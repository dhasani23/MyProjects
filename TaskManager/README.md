TaskManager applet that allows users to add, remove, and search through a list of tasks. 
Each task consists of a title, estimated time to complete, and type (morning, afternoon, evening, or anytime). 
Tasks are continuously displayed in sorted order (by type).
You can run TaskManagerGUI.java to launch the applet.
