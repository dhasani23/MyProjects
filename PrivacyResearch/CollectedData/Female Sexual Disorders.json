I have been with my partner for 2 years, and struggle at having a sexual relationship with him. It feels more physical than mental. I have acute pain that lasts throughout sex, and any other object inside me causes the same pain. Is it my hymen still? Despite a year of constant trying? Can a tampon really cause that much pain? Or is it something psycological?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Pk_anon,  I would recommend you see your gynecologist about this.  It sounds like you may be experiencing a condition called vaginismus.  This condition is where the muscles of the pelvic floor involuntarily contract making intercourse or insertion of objects into the vagina very painful and even impossible.  This condition is treatable.  Seeing the counselor is a good idea as there may be some emotional issues related to this; however, seeing a medical doctor (i.e. your gynecologist) is also important as treatment is often guided by them. Success rates are very good with treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You did not indicate what the mistakes were that you made.  Are you saying you have had intercourse?  Are you worried about a sexually transmitted infection?  If not, it is probably nothing to worry about and could be caused by yeast or some kind of dermatitis, but you would need to see a doctor to be sure.  So, if it does not go away, schedule an appointment with a family doctor.  It is wise to have periodic \"well child\" exams to discuss any needed immunizations and other health matters.  You should be able to speak privately with the doctor, without your parents.  A good doctor will allow for some private consultation time so any sexual concerns can come out without the presence of your parents.  You might make the appointment and then ask to speak to the doctor's assistant and explain that you hope to have some private time, even if your parents are there.  That way the staff can request the parents wait outside, rather than you being in the position of making that request.  Ask that they make a note of it so when they call you back to see the doctor, they can ask your parents to wait for a bit.  I hope this works for you so you can be at ease about your normal sexual development.  I could not begin to diagnose through this medium as it would be important for the doctor to actually see it and consider this with the rest of your medical history.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In the last 6 months I have gone through a particularly stressful time at my university, and this has had a damaging effect on my libido, which is affecting my 1 year old marriage. I am considering taking an herbal remedy to increase my libido which states to have the following ingredients: Ashwagandha, Acetylcarnitine, Catuaba, Cnidium, Choline, Cistanches deserticola, Coleus Forskohlii, Daidzein, Damiana herb, DMAE, Dodder seed, Horny Goat Weed, Jujube, Maca, Mucuna Pruriens, Muira Puama, Passion Flower, Suma, Rehmannia, Rhodiola rosea, Shilajit, Trimethylglycine, Tongkat Ali herbal extract, and Tribulus Terrestris extract.   Do you know if these would decrease the effectiveness of my oral contraceptive pill?   Thank you very much and have a wonderful day.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Herbal supplements are not tested or regulated by the FDA so I have little information about this.  What I do know is that the effectiveness of libido enhancers is questionable at best.  I do not know if there is any interaction between the substances.  I would not think so but can't say for sure.  You might ask your pharmacist to check the particular pill you use to see if there are any food, herbs or medications that interact negatively.  Rifampin (an antibiotic) has been shown to affect birth control pills but this is rarely prescribed.  This is known because it is a medication; not a supplement.  You may find that stress relief would do as much for your libido anyway.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diarrhea & Anal Sex",
    "content": "Hello, This would not be a typical cause of diarrhea so I would see a doctor to determine the actual cause before you become dehydrated.  There are many reasons a person may develop diarrhea but it would be impossible to diagnose without being seen, as a stool specimen would most likely be needed.  There are bacteria, parasites and physiological conditions that can all contribute to diarrhea symptoms.  If you get a fever, that could suggest infection that would need specific treatment.  Try to overcome your embarrassment and see your doctor if the diarrhea does not go away in the next day or two.  This is nothing your doctor has not encountered before and you do not need to disclose the sexual activity to your parents.  It is helpful for the doctor to know this but you should be able to get treatment without the parents being with you for the interview and/or exam.  Since it is very likely not associated, if you did not discuss it, the exams to determine cause of diarrhea would be the same anyway so don't worry too much about that.  It is very possibly just coincidental but there could be some relaxation of the anal sphincter but this seems very unlikely with a single act of anal sex and in that case I would think you would find general incontinence; not specifically diarrhea (loose, watery stool).    If the diarrhea resolves soon, you can probably chalk it up to a viral infection but if not, please see your doctor. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 19 years old and I've been having sex for a solid 2 1/2 years now. I've been in a long distance relationship for about 4 months now and ever since we've started having sex strange things have been occurring. First off, during sex it's often times painful...it almost feels sharp and stabbing, it's just really uncomfortable. Then afterwards, usually if the sex lasts long enough me and my partner notice that there is  a half-dollar sized spot of blood on the sheets, I always go to the bathroom to try and figure it out and I honestly can never tell whether the blood came from my vagina or my behind. I've also noticed that my period cycle has started becoming later and later in the month...I used to get it on the 17th of every month, then the 19th, then the 21st, and now I'm still waiting. I took a pregnancy test and it came up negative. After the first time we had sex, I got a UTI. That was my 3rd UTI in about 1 1/2 years but then I noticed a few weeks later I got another one. They always go away with antibiotics but I don't think it's normal to be so prone to them. I noticed that about once a week...or maybe once every two weeks, mostly around the time I'm supposed to start my period my genital are just doesn't feel right. It's not a specific feeling, it just feels kind of weird...and it almost feels like I have to pee but I don't. There isn't ever any pain related with urinating when that happens.. it just feels odd down there. I just don't understand what's going on with my body!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are many possible causes for your discomfort.  One of those is endometriosis, which can be kind of hard to diagnose.  If it continues you should ask your health care provider about the possibility of this or other conditions such as ovarian cysts.    Urinary tract infections are in fact very common in women because of the short urethra which is in close proximity with the anus, which tends to be quite \"dirty.\"  Sex often increases the woman's susceptibility to infection and a few measures can be taken to help.    If you urinate both just prior to having sex and immediately after, this helps wash the bacteria away before it can travel up the urethra.  I would recommend avoiding anal sex as well since e-coli (normal in the bowel) is a common organism causing urinary tract infections.    Use lubrication when you have sex in case you are having some localized trauma.  If the infections continue, sometimes doctors prescribe low-dose maintenance antibiotics.  Talk to your provider about this if you get these frequently.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Your cousin is and always will be a girl, female through and through. She is not a man trapped in a female body, men look, act and sound like men. Women with Androgen Insensitivity Syndrome, which is what your cousin was diagnosed with, are actually in many ways more females than us with XX chromosomes. Their bodies do not react to testosterone like ours and as such they develop post natal down a more female line.  If anyone reads this with a similar question remember to tell the patient, that she will be fine and that should the doctors wish to remove her gonads due to malignancy risk, she will simply need to take a simple regiment of estrogen.\n\n",

    "content": "I too have a similar question to the two people above except im older. Im in my early 20s and during puberty one of my breasts stopped growing while one continued, leaving one bigger for a while. What happened later on is that the other started to grow again but now they are significantly different in size. Padding doesn\u2019t work and it has even had a huge effect on my social and especially sexual life.  I went to the doctor when I was younger and he said it would fill out , yet now here I am and nothing. My mother keeps on pressuring g me to get breast surgery but I really don\u2019t want to. I was wondering what I could perhaps do. Is there a certain hormone that I might need more off to help the other one fill out like a pill or something. PLEASE HELP\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know this is a very frustrating problem for you.  I'm afraid there is no magic pill or potion that will help this problem.  I would also not be quick to rush to cosmetic surgery since this could interfere with your future desire to breastfeed a baby - something that is very rewarding and could be quite disappointing if your \"cure\" now would cause problems later.    I would see a doctor to have your hormone levels evaluated and see if there is anything apparent that might cause this problem but I suspect it's just part of your genetic makeup.  Almost all women are uneven in varying degrees - some more pronounced than others but you are not alone for sure.  I know this may cause you to be self-conscious but most people put little real value on such external things in a relationship.  In the meantime, you might try being fitted with a special bra from someone who works with mastectomy patients.  They can do a remarkable job of evening things out even when one breast is missing entirely.  Try to accept yourself as you are and see how things even out as you bear children and have the opportunity to nurse them.  Patience is needed here but realize many women experience this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A thin woman typically has smaller breasts.  It is disheartening to many of them and this is why so many women have breast implants.  When you see larger breasts on very thin women this may be the reason.  But, since you don't know the particulars you may have an altered sense of normal.    Still it would not hurt to consult with a doctor who may choose to evaluate your hormones and determine if this is just your genetic and hereditary make up or if there is something going on that is contributing to this.    Do be assured than many women feel self-conscious about this and if they are too uncomfortable find alternate ways to enhance their breast shape with clothing.  The reason there are so many padded bras on the market is because so many women want larger breasts or feel like it makes them look better in clothes.    In most cases, even small-breasted women successfully produce milk to feed their babies and are able then to enjoy some natural enhancement.  For this reason I discourage breast surgery for cosmetic reasons.  You could be affecting your future babies' and your own health for this.  Try to accept your body as it is and have a general physical exam for peace of mind.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Almost all women have one breast somewhat larger than the other but in some this is more pronounced.  There are some also who have underdeveloped, genetic conditions.  You would need to consult with a doctor to see if yours is a problem or just within the norm - about 50%  have a noticeable difference.    I would not recommend plastic surgery since you are likely to undergo breast changes when you become pregnant in the future and surgery before then could interfere with your ability to breastfeed - something that is not only very important for babies, but also contributes to the mother's health.  Try to look down the road and use padding or prosthetics to help this cosmetic concern in the meantime.  A bra-fitting specialist such as those who work with mastectomy patients can help you find something that is acceptable. Meanwhile, try to appreciate your body as it is - nobody is perfect.    Focusing too much on a flaw can cause emotional stress.  I realize we are in a society which puts great emphasis on exposing the breast, associating it with sexiness, but really the breast has a higher function and the difference in size usually does not affect that at all (unless you have the genetic underdevelopment I spoke of but even then, one is enough to nourish a baby).  It is also possible that after childbirth, things will even out a bit.  I know you are worried about this, but it is part of the normal variation of people's bodies and it is OK.  But, down the road if it still bothers you, cosmetic surgery is a good option to correct it and most women are pleased with the results.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Almost all women have an unequal breast size, unless they have had augmentation (artificial equality).  Yours might be a little bigger of a difference but there is nothing wrong with you - it's merely cosmetic, particularly since you successfully breastfed.  This leads me to think it is not a matter of underdevelopment of glands.    Our bodies are not perfectly symmetrical as you would see when you have a picture of yourself reversed.  Usually there are differences in the eyes, the smile, etc.  Breast size can be the same.  I would not advise any surgical intervention until you have completed your family because breastfeeding is much more important than breast size and equality.  It probably bothers you more than your husband or others.  You should be able to get cosmetic corrective underwear to make the size difference less noticeable under clothing.  I know it is frustrating, but be assured your health is not in danger.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Much of this is due to genetic makeup and we inherit these characteristics from our ancestors.  Every woman is different and breasts come in all sizes and varieties.  In rare cases there are hormone problems and an endocrinologist could check for normal levels of various glands in the body to rule out a physiological cause for this.  But, if everything is functioning fine, there is little to be done aside from artificial (surgical) breast augmentation.  This is expensive, carries some risk and could interfere with future breastfeeding.  This may not seem so important to you now but one day it might - for you and for your future babies.  Women's lubrication is something that is stimulated by sexual arousal and it also varies from woman to woman.  Many rely on use of a lubricant you can buy.  This can make a lot of difference.  Aside from this, relationship health, communication and desire toward  your partner has a lot do do with this.  These are emotional things that you can work on, perhaps with a therapist.  I'm sorry there is no magic pill or potion to make things as you want them to be in this sexual area.  Becoming comfortable with who you are makes the most difference.  Try not to compare yourself to the artificial images you see in the media.  These are altered photographs and altered bodies; not real life women.  Most men care much more about a self-confident woman, regardless of her breast size.  Confidence in a woman is a real \"turn on\" for men while hiding behind what you feel is an imperfect body does not encourage intimacy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, At the risk of sounding uncaring, my initial reaction is give yourself time.  At 22 many people are just beginning to reach a sexual maturity and developing a sexual relationship.  Libido is not a given and many women report this as a frustration because they want to be like others (usually they think \"others\" means everyone else).  In truth, if you read about human sexuality beyond the sensational stuff that touts all women have multiple orgasms and it's all about technique, you will learn that this is extremely common.  You will also learn that a woman's sexual prime is usually at age 30 or beyond; while men hit theirs in their early 20s.  Unfair?  Maybe, but that's the way it is.  It is not all mechanical and a meaningful relationship, trust and love can do a lot to help a woman to learn to find pleasure in sex.  I'll be honest - some women never do really enjoy it.  Researchers have been searching for years for a medication or treatment that will increase a woman's libido.  They know that the manufacturer of a woman's \"Viagra\" will become rich overnight because of the widespread desire for such a medication.    I believe that women more often than men, though not exclusively, require more in the area of commitment, emotional attachment and trust in order to enjoy the natural physical extension of the love relationship.  We want to be more like men this way - able to just jump into it with reckless abandon and enjoy the physical side whether or not the rest is there, but it just isn't typical.    Your other physical conditions, for which you have been prescribed medication, could also affect your feelings of well-being here as well.  Make sure you are taking care of your complete health; not just focusing on your sexual pleasure.  Patience is the key here so I would work harder to focus on the other person, not try too hard to achieve orgasm yourself and chances are in time, things will evolve in a more positive way for you.  Like many other things in life, pleasure can come when you least expect it and when you aren't really trying.  Working too hard for the big \"O\" can destroy the other parts of intimacy - closeness, caring, giving and showing love.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I'm 19 years old currently in china with my gf who's 24 years old, I'm Chinese American and she's Chinese and she seems to have a problem with orgasm by penetration. She can achieve it through masturbation and I can also help her achieve it through using hands. I'm very in love with her but a bit frustrated, I've read up on quite a lot since I first started at 16, she's my 9th gf, and never had any problems with previous girlfriends ages 16-28, I'm curious is it because of something that's effecting her emotionally because of culture? or perhaps i need to wait longer? I've been with her for 8 months now, and she told me before she was never been able to achieve it before. What steps could I take to help her along? I know its something that she has to experience and feel out, but she's able to achieve it through all other methods easily so I'm a bit confused.   There's one thing that she told me before that her the vagina tube is opposite of normal girls and its a bit rare so childbirth might be a bit hard on her, but i don't think it should effect this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Many women have difficulty achieving orgasm with penile thrusting.  Sometimes this is something that improves in time and women are known to reach their sexual prime after age 30; whereas men achieve theirs in their early 20s.  Some may never be able to get the right stimulation through basic sexual intercourse.  If you are able to please her through clitoral stimulation using your hand, this is an important part of lovemaking.  It has more to do with the individual, her anatomy, her emotions and desires but orgasm is not as automatic with women as it is with men.  Time often helps but if it doesn't she should be comfortable with who she is to enjoy sex in the way it works best for her, with your complete support.  This is not something that can be forced but it does work a bit differently for women than for men.  Make sure she has plenty of lubrication (the kind you add from a bottle in addition to her own natural lubricant).  Take plenty of time with caressing and foreplay without focusing exclusively on the big \"O\" so things progress naturally.  Be patient but don't determine success in a relationship by her ability to achieve an orgasm as easily as you do.  This is VERY normal and VERY common.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is not unusual for it to take years for a woman to be able to orgasm.  The problems you have experienced in the past may make it more difficult so it might be good for you to seek counseling, particularly regarding the rapes.    As for decreasing the lubrication - it's really not something you can manipulate and it varies during the month in nature and amount.  There are some medications with a side effect of decreasing body fluids, but you really don't want to go that route just for this purpose.    You can experiment with different techniques.  It can be especially hard for some women to orgasm with sexual intercourse.  In many women, direct clitoral stimulation is necessary.  You have not mentioned if you have tried something other than traditional sex with penetration.  If you read some books or articles on this subject (both of you together) you will learn how common it is an  perhaps get some ideas.  It definitely should not ruin your relationship which is hopefully built on mutual respect, love, trust and patience.    This is something time will likely cure if you work at it without concentrating so much on the big \"O\" that you lose the spontaneity and joy of your experience together.  Sometimes it happens when you least expect it, but if you try too hard, you may be too tense for the pleasurable experience.  I wish we had the magic pill women all over the world are hoping will be discovered - the female sex enhancer similar to Viagra for men.  They're trying so we may see it yet, but in the meantime, you may want to consult with a therapist, skilled in sensitive couples issues.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Im a 27 year old male who has been married for 2 years to my wife who is also 27. We met when we were 23 and had an increible sex life for about 2 years.  My wife was involved in a car accident 3 years ago and suffered some neck injuries (occipital nueralgia) I think thats how its spelled, anyways she has been on Topamax for this duration and a multitude of other antiinflammatories and narcotics, undergone accupuncture, massage therapy, chirpractic care, and just about anything else you can think of.  The problem is that I believe this medication is killing her sex drive to the point that we have not had any sexual relations in 5 months.  As I stated earlier it has progressively gotten worse to this point.  I am very concerned and try to be comforting and caring about this but anytime I suggest we seek counseling or dr advice she gets extremely sensitive.  I love my wife to death and just want to fill this one void in our relationship.  I don't know if a dosage adjustment or a supplement to offset side effects is possible but this is starting to put a strain on an otherwise great marriage.  She has told me she has even tried to pleasure herself and quit and states she NEVER thinks about sex AT ALL.  This is very alarming and I have also looked into treatments to kill my libido so I don't feel the urges anymore.  Ive heard of DEPO-Prevera in men with past criminal sexual history and wonder if this is an option for me (though ive never had the criminal history).  I am in dire need of help or advice on this issue\n\n",

Otherwise it doesnt bother me. Its almost like Im allergic to my own fluid.  Right before this started  I found out I had fibromyalgia and was suddenly allergic to things I had never had a problen with before like pain killers, soaps & any kind of bubble bath & scented anything. Ive tried every thing I can think of, Read about or get my hands on to get rid of this horrible infection but Nothing seems to kill it. It was under my breasts & under my arms but Ive got that under control.  Is their anything you can suggest I do to get rid of this infection ?  Thanks so much\n\n",

    "content": "It is unknown why some women are prone to this very inconvenient problem.  It is all about the normal bacteria and pH of the body and sometimes it is just more conducive to overgrowth of yeast.    Some women respond to acidophilus (a supplement like you might find with vitamins and health foods).  This helps alter the pH.  It can be taken orally and it sounds like this is systemic for you so it might help.  There are also some douches that can help with the vaginal yeast, though as a rule, we discourage douching because it can alter the normal pH.  In this case, that is the goal.  I can't actually prescribe but one such douche is this:  1/4 cup of 3% antiseptic hydrogen peroxide mixed in two cups of water.  You can talk to your doctor about this for his/her opinion.    Since you have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and new allergies, it is certainly possible that your body is having some hypersensitivity to otherwise normal flora so perhaps there is a connection.  This is not something that has been documented but we don't know everything.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible to have both infection and the dysplasia but I would not expect the abnormal cells to be the result of the infection.  I think you are experiencing two different conditions and I doubt infection is causing the results to be abnormal.    When abnormal cells are found in a pap smear, this is the result of a screening process; not a diagnostic one.  In other words, there is something here worth investigating further.  The colposcopy goes that next step to see if the cells are actually of concern.  Many times this verifies that there is nothing to be alarmed about.  But, the dysplasia was already diagnosed.  The colposcopy will learn more beyond that so this should be the most revealing test.  The normal biopsy is much more important than the abnormal cells seen on the pap smear.  You are doing a great job taking care of your health in spite of this very frustrating tendency you have to infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For the past year or so, I have had a constant  burning sensation in my vagina.  I have no discharge or funny odor whatsoever.  I have mistaken it for a UTI several times however after taking all the antibiotics prescribed for a UTI the constant burning feeling is still there.  The burning sensation isnt with urination so that rules out a UTI..sometimes it just randomly starts in the morning..or even in the afternoon..some days i don't feel it at all, other days its so unbearable i just put on loose pants and lay in bed until its gone, which usually lasts all day..  Some extra facts: I try to urinate before and after sex to cut down on bacteria but the burning feeling doesnt improve. I have seen multiple doctors and i have been treated for UTIs and my gyno also said that i had an inflammed cervix my last visit (a few weeks ago) and prescribed me antibiotics for bacteria vaginitis, however neither have cleared up the burning sensation. Could this have soemthing to do with my PH level?? Is there soemthing else going on?? What can i do to get rid of this constant burning?? i am miserable! Im only 20! i want to enjoy the rest of my life and i want to enjoy sex and feel good after sex not worry that i might feel like my vagina is burning...\n\n",

My bowel movements are fine but the pain proceeds.  He did think that this problem was around my colon area because when he touched the right side of my abdomin it was excrutiating.  He informed me that my colon was in that area.  I am really nervous,  I don't know how dangerous this could be but it's starting to hurt to even walk.  Does anyone know??

    "content": "There are several complications to anal sex:  Pain from hemorrhoids. Hemorrhoids can be fragile and prone to bleeding, although they don't usually cause the kind of pain you've described. You can frequently feel a hemorrhoid as a swollen, tender lump in the anal area. You'll often notice blood from a bleeding hemorrhoid on toilet paper after a bowel movement, or on the stool itself.  Pain and bleeding can also occur when there's a small tear in the lining of the anus called an anal fissure. Even small fissures can be pretty painful because they often cause spasms of the opening of the anus. They heal slowly because they're irritated repeatedly during bowel movements. With anal fissures, you may also see blood on toilet paper or on the stool itself.  A rare, but serious, complication after anal sex is a hole (perforation) in the colon. This dangerous problem requires hospitalization, surgery to repair the hole, and antibiotics to prevent infection. A colonic perforation will usually cause fever and severe pain and pressure in the abdomen. This condition requires immediate medical attention, either through your health care provider or your local hospital emergency department.   Sexually transmitted diseases can infect the anus in much the same way as vaginal intercouse.  My advice to you if you do not have fever and the pain is somewhat bearable, is to take an colic pain killer, a stool softner for a couple of days. If you do not improve then you will have to consult someone face to face and you may even need a scope exam. A surgeon would be best at evaluating this condition.\n\n",

Anal sex is safe in the long term (especially when in a monogamous relationship, using lube, a condom, etc.) evident by studies such as \"Anal sphincter structure and function in homosexual males engaging in anal receptive intercourse.\" by Chun et al. and the fact that people have been engaging in anal sex for centuries without having to wear diapers once they reach their forties.

    "content": "Hey I'm 19 years old, I have a lump just under my public hair line and just about my clitoris. There is no head or anything on the lump, it is under the skin. At first it was a bit painful but now its not as painful, I was trying to squeeze it (thinking it may be a pimple?). Do to the squeezing it has grown a bit. It is more hard than soft. I just had sex the other night (Saturday), but did not use a condom for about 20 seconds, after that used one. I'm very worried it could be a STI or STD or something, but hopefully its just a cyst or pimple. Thankyou!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This does not sound like an STD but more likely a cyst or infected gland.  Give it time, use warm moist packs or sitz baths for comfort and avoid squeezing - tempting though it will be.  Chances are it will resolve on its own but sometimes a doctor is needed to remove it.

    "content": "Hello, Yes, the emergency contraception is powerful hormonal manipulation and so the periods can be affected.  For future information, the birth control pill is quite reliable and you should not need to use back up protection during the white benign pill phase.  Of course if you want to reduce risk of STD, condoms are a good idea no matter what other birth control you use.  It should have been explained to you that the inactive pills come at a time to allow you to have some bleeding but you are not likely to ovulate at that time.  The mechanism of action for the Pill is to stop ovulation and make the uterus less hospitable to the egg, should there be one that happens to slip through.    You do not have to take a pill each day for protection; just every day that the pill contains the active ingredients.  The white pills are to keep you in the habit of taking it daily but you are not at greater risk of pregnancy at that time.  Of course there are a very few who may become pregnant while taking the pill, most often due to user error (forgotten pills).  But in these cases it is not likely that ovulation occurred during the week between active pills.  You could possibly have another missed period but likely it will return to normal soon.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, At your age it is perfectly normal to have irregular periods.  You could be in the perimenopausal phase which can last for several years prior to menopause.  The changing hormones result in heavier, more frequent or missed periods.  It is nothing to worry about unless it goes on this way (excessive bleeding) for several months resulting in anemia.  Your doctor could treat this if that becomes the case.  However, you could still be ovulating, even if irregularly so birth control should continue as long as you are sexually active and menstruating.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear silverado, Loss of sex drive can be due to many causes. Some are psychological such as marital problems, power struggles; others are physical such as heart disease, or any other disabling disease. Some medications may also lead to low sex drive (antidepressants). Reduced estrogen to postmenopausal levels can lead to dryness of the vagina making sex painful. Another cause may be reduced testosterone levels. It has been argued that increasing testosterone levels even in those without low levels may also serve to increase sex drive. Another hormone currently under study is MSH (melanocyte stimulating hormone). It has been proposed to be a cause for the increased sex drive experienced in women at the time of ovulation. A recent study on female rats has just been published and shows favorable results. However, the drug is still in the preclincal testing phase and it will be a long time before we see it on the market (if it ever makes it).  The patch you are talking about is a testosterone patch. Although not yet approved by the FDA, a recent study showed some very promising results. Indeed, 50% of women receiving the patch showed a significant increase in sex drive as opposed to those receiving a placebo. The study only included women with low sex drive due to surgically induced menopause. They all had a condition called hypoactive sexual desire disorder (HSDD). This is a very significant result for a disease which previously had no treatment.   It should be noted however, that testosterone therapy in women is associated with several unfavorable side effects, of which the most disturbing is increased body hair.   On different tone: your profile is quite alarming with 13 of your aunts having a history of breast cancer? If this is the case then you should seek genetic counsuling. Specifically, you and any daughters you may have should test for the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes.   Best regards.\n\n",

You may actually have multiple factors that could be diminishing your drive.  If your libido has always been quite depressed it is a different issue than a recent change in your desire.  This is information to share with your doctor or therapist.  There are also certified sex therapists who deal with such issues but be sure you get a good recommendation as there are also people of questionable training and experience in the field.

    "content": "Hello, I suspect you are experiencing the result of some hormone changes that come with the arousal and it is normal.  I would not worry about it being a rejection problem but rather just physiological with these new feelings.  Of course if it seems to get worse over time, you should discuss it with a doctor, but since you are not sexually active and infection is not likely, you should be fine to watch and wait.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "negative test after 7 weeks and feeling like pregnant",
    "content": "During an intercourse I didn't use any protection, so the next day I took the day after pill. After 5 days I had a normal period that lasted for approximately 4- 5 days and was normally heavy- it definitely wasn't lighter than my usual periods. Now I started living in a different city and have been going through a lot of stress. A month passed and I missed my second period. After  8 days since the missed period I took 2 clearblue pregnancy tests and they both turned out negative. I did follow all the instructions and did use my first urine of the day. I have been having sore breasts now for 11 days since my second period was due and also cramping started 5 days ago and hasn't stopped. So could I be pregnant and the test has made a false negative even after 7 weeks after the conception? It was a good quality and expensive pregnancy test. Should I just have had a late ovulation, but then why did I start having all the cramping and breast swelling such a long time ago- I really feel I  either have ovulated or either am pregnant. Can you actually not ovulate, but really feel like it? I have also been quite emotional and irritable recently. Maybe I have an ectopic pregnancy- that could have made the test a false negative? But why then did I have the  1st period- can one have periods with ectopic pregnancies? I am really worried. Then I also read on the net something about ovarian cysts? Maybe that's the cause? I am sure going to see a doctor, but can you please calm me down before that, because I have time to go to the doctor only next week. What is going on with me- just tell me some possibilities. Thank you in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I don't think you are pregnant since you had a significant period following sexual intercourse.  However, if you have continued to be sexually active since then, that is a different story.  There are many reasons a person can have symptoms and not feel like herself that have nothing to do with pregnancy or ovulation.  Then again, you can have symptoms with ovulation so it is impossible to say.  But, I doubt pregnancy is what is happening unless there is more to this story.  Best wishes\n\n",

Over the last month and a half I been feeling lots of nausea and dizziness, lower back pain, and the related discomfort that comes with my monthly menstruation, after I went to the doctor he gave something for the nausea, and it has helped, before that, I couldn't keep anything down, still my appetite is not very good, though it doesn't bother me.  Over the last few weeks I have experienced something that I've never feel before, I cry for almost anything and I'm usually a very self controlled individual, so I don't know what to think anymore.  My lower back pain, is still not too strong but a constant presence, as well as difficulty in bowel movement or lack of any.  Please reply soon  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not a doctor, however I have done some researching of my own... Based on the information you provided.. tENageRsept16... the time period he is \"in\" you isn't important.  The question is whether or not he ejaculated or \"came\" inside you.  If he did, or had any on his genitals when he entered you.. it is possible that you are pregnant.  If he did not however... no sperm to combine with your egg to form a pregancy or \"fetus\".  If you find you are pregnant and seek to terminate it, consdier all your options very carefully.  Abortion is not always the simplest answer, I can tell you that from personal experience.  Health clinics have information on all options available unless certain procedures in your state are illegal.  Don't freak out though, you're probably not pregnant.  Take a deep breath and give yourself probably a week after you normally would start your period... then go get a test if you don't start.  Goldielocks... same info applies to you... time is of no importance when it comes to getting pregnant... if any ONE sperm gets inside your vagina... pregnancy is possible.  It only takes one sperm to fertalize an egg and one ejaculation contains several hundred of them.  Use a condom even if you are on birth control.  Birth control will prevent pregnancy 99.9% of the time BUT there is always the .1% chance you could get pregnant... and if you don't take birth control just right... at the same time everyday... and even antibiotics you take when you get sick can cancel out the effects of birth control...   I hope some of this information helps you...  Carrie D#23 y/o\n\n",

    "content": "tENageRsept16: if you choose to partake in sexual activities, ensure that ou have sufficient protection. 1 minute- 5; it doesnt matter; protection is required to prevent the transmission of STI's; and as kristi meantioned you can get pregnant from pre-cum (hence making the 'withdrawl method' an inadequate method for contraception.) I know it is easier to say than do, but try not to stress at the moment; stress can delay your period!  If in doubt in regards to a possible pregnancy or planning to become sexually active; visit your doctor and discuss your options.  GoldieLocks: The only method of contraceptive that is 100% is abstenence! even the pill and condoms are just over 99%; still pretty good coverage though; if you decide to become sexually active, discuss with your partner combining two forms of birth control: pill and condoms. Keep in mind; the pill decreases your chance of getting pregnant but doesnt stop you contracting STI's  stay safe and always practice safe sex.\n\n",

    "content": "It really concerns me that so many young women have sex before they know all the facts and are ready to accept the responsibility that comes along with having sex. If sexual intercourse did not occur, that is, actual penetration of penis inside vagina, then pregnancy cannot occur.  If a man ejaculates, then inserts a finger inside of you, you cannot become pregnant. the time that a penis is inside of the vagina has no bearing on the chances of becommign pregnant. 1 second, or  5 hours, that doesn't make a difference. The difference is is he ejaculated or not. Keep in mind that \"precum\" or a small amount of semen is usually expelled before actual ejaculation, and that small amount is enough to get pregnant. The only absolute way to ensure you do not become pregnant is abstinence. If you choose to have sex, make sure you use a birth control method each and every time. A condom is the only way to protcet yourself from STDs. If for some reason the condom broke, or slipped off, or you just did not use birth control, you can take an emergency contraceptive, that stop you from becomming pregnant, but that must be taken within 72 hours of sexual intercourse. I hope this answers any questions. If you have any more questions, please feel free to ask and I will try my best to answer them for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would recommend you talk to your parents about this if you possibly can.  I know it is difficult and only you know your parents but most often they love you enough to help you through even the bad times.  Sometimes they are surprised or even shocked but they want what is best for you, except in rare cases.  You can contact any gynecologist or family planning clinic about this and they abide by state and federal laws that regulate abortion so it would depend on circumstances and state laws (if you are in the US), but most require parental notification or consent for a minor such as yourself.  This is for your own protection since you are not of age to make such major decisions alone.  Often extensive counseling is helpful so this will not become a cause for severe stress in the future.  I would recommend this as well.  Let your parents help you with this problem.  Good luck.\n\n",

Most of the time he doesn't pull out and cums in me. Well i haven't gotten pregnant yet because i still get my periods and ive tooken tests. But The last time i was on my period (day 2 of it) we had sex and he came in me ( i was bleeding alot this period) i stopped bleeding completely well except a few spotting after that but it wasnt new blood. that was on Oct.15 and now its the 29. ive tooken pregnancy tests but theyve came up not pregnant. im really worried that im pregnant.. do you think i am? also i had a baby over a year ago if that makes a difference?   help?\n\n",

Every woman varies beyond that - some have headaches, extreme fatigue or tender breasts due to the hormonal changes.    If you do not want to become pregnant, you should use contraception.

It has not gone away but sometimes the skin around it will swell every once in a while. It is tender and sometimes hurts (but not often). When it does, my nipple is also very tender and sometimes red. I am only 19 and very far away from home (at school). I am not comfortable going to a walk in clinic for this but I am starting to worry because it isn't going away. Might this just be a skin problem or should I go to a clinic right away? Are these symptoms or breast cancer?\n\n",

During oral sex with her, she presumably comes to orgasm based on her emotions/sound/etc. and vaginal contractions (she isn't sure what an orgasm is) and after long periods of oral and manual stimulation, she is very tired and satisfied but her fingers and hands are tingling and numb. I believe it is because she is too tense and nervous, but I was wondering if there were any other explanations? I am only interested in her well-being and health, and any advice or insight would be very appreciated. Thank you so much!\n\n",

My doctor said that was completely normal, and about two weeks ago I started on a progesteron (sp?) only birth control pill that, I was told, would stop my period. So basically, NO BLEEDING ever until I am off the pill and finished nursing. However, about three days ago I started bleeding a little bit- it was mainly brown, very light, kind of like the end of a typical menstrual cycle. But yesterday it picked up and today it is fairly heavy and very red, and I am getting some cramps. Is it possible that I may have gotten pregnant after the baby was born (very unlikely but possible) and am now mis carrying, or am I getting a period? I want to know what's going on. =)\n\n",

    "content": "I had been on Microgynon 30 for 8 years it was fine, no problems, but I wanted a change so my doctor put me onto Yasmine. I had been on Yasmine for 6 months and it was fine, again no problems. Then me and my boyfriend split up so I decided to use the opportunity to take a break from the pill so I stopped taking it for about 4 months, then I met someone else and realised I should start taking it again, but I only had some of my old microgynon pills left so I started taking those again. I had about 2 packets then managed to get to the doctor who gave me my Yasmine prescription again. I have now started a Yasmine packet straight after my last microgynon, without a break inbetween, but i keep bleeding while taking it. Is it because of going backwards and forwards between the two pills? I have a week left of my Yasmine packet and I am thinking of stopping the pack and having my week break early to give my body the chance to have a period and \"get it out of my system\" so to speak. Is this a good idea?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Bleeding irregularity is a frequently reported side effect of oral contraceptives.  Usually within a few months of a new pill prescription your body will adjust.  I don't think stopping early will actually do what you are hoping in \"getting it all out.\"  It has to do with hormones; not a back up of blood.  I would take the pills as prescribed and if things don't settle down within 3 or 4 months, talk to your doctor - sooner if you find it heavy or just unacceptable.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had my period last week and finished 4 days ago. It lasted for 5 days, when my normal period is only 3 (which doesn't worry me as this sometimes happens)........  however this morning immediately after having sex I noticed I had started bleeding a little, so I inserted my menstrual cup and about 10 minutes later I felt it overflowing!  When I emptied it I realised that I wasn't really bleeding all that much but had passed a blood clot equivilent to 12 liquid mls that completely filled the cup (huge!)........It looked like I had passed an organ! I have checked the cup twice in the last half hour and it is clean and I have stopped bleeding enitrely. Is there something wrong? should I go and see a nurse?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Occasional clots are considered normal - even large ones.  When blood pools and stays in the uterus it can coagulate and then you pass it as a clot.   The abrupt alteration of your hormones that occurs with plan B, along with the other contraceptives most likely has affected your cycle. Some women find it takes a few months to get back on schedule after that.    Since the bleeding has stopped, I suspect it was just that your body needed to eliminate the clot and now that it has, things have stopped as they should.  I would not feel it urgent to see a health professional unless you get ongoing or excessive bleeding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been bleeding between periods for 9 years now. The only thing that stops it is the nuva ring. I don't' like it because of the side effects. I was diagnosed in 2005 with endometrosis and a small fibroid. I recently had a child thru IVF. We were unable to concieve on our own. About 4 months after giving birth the bleeding started again. The pain associated with the endo was the only thing to subside. It usually starts 1-2 weeks after my period. It's usually a very dark brown. It can be light or heavy. The longest I bled for was 17 days straight. I'm at a loss. I'm sick of bleeding!! I was told I had an ovarian disorder. Not sure if that's the cause. I've been to at least 7 doctors, and then the specialist who did the IVF. I don't have any pain now with the breakthru bleeding. I've never had any hormone tests. My thyroid is normal. Help!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, One of the many causes of bleeding between periods can be endometriosis.  It is impossible to say if complete removal of diseased tissue would resolve your problem or if it is caused by something else.  Other causes include stress, drugs, weight (over or under), eating disorders, PCOS (Polycystic Ovary Syndrome), thryoid disorder (you have ruled out), perimenopause, tumors, polyps, fibroids, and other conjditions.  One of the first treatments attempted for this condition is hormonal birth control.  Since you experienced relief with the Nuva Ring it is likely yours ,might be helped, perhaps with an oral contraceptive.  Side effects may occur with that but you won't know unless you try.  Some other treatments are used once a women no longer plans to bear children, such as uterine ablation.  I think you need to continue with your provider to try other methods to stop the bleeding since it is such a nuisance for you.  In small amounts you are not likely to become anemic but it can happen.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Deviantgirl,  Postinor pills are a hormonal pill and most definitely can affect your menstrual cycle.  The effect is varied from person to person and can range from no effect to altering flow patterns to delaying (or hastening) a woman's period.  Given the day of your cycle, you would be expected to be less fertile but pregnancy is not impossible.  Overall, it sounds like your risk is low but if there is concern, I would recommend taking a pregnancy test in about 4 weeks.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm generally in good health, and haven't been in a sexual relationship for months now, so I'm ruling out an STD. I really really don't want to go to my Doctor, so I'm hoping someone can help me here. Could this be a sign of cancer, and if not, what other possibilities are there?

If it continues it would be good to have it checked out, though at your age the chances are it is nothing to worry about.  Infection sometimes causes itching and this can result from a change in the normal pH of the vagina.  If you can see a doctor to determine the cause you will probably be able to fix the problem without too much trouble but I see no harm in waiting a little while to see if it goes away.    Try to trust your mother to help if you need it.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know this is a very frustrating condition.    In addition to the measures you are taking, birth control pills may be prescribed because they often decrease the symptoms. In severe cases, danazol my be prescribed (a steroid which has androgen like effects such as hirsutism, acne, adema and voice changes) if the potential benefits outweigh the potential negative effects. Tamoxifen is occasionally used in severe cases.  So there are some other avenues for you to try so you should be in regular contact with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Is there any doubt this is urine?  Perhaps you are leaking natural lubrication, which is normal.  If it is definitely urine, you should first make sure you have completely emptied your bladder prior to sex and avoid drinking very much before you have sex.  If this does not do the trick, you should be examined to see if you have any urinary tract issues such as a weak sphincter muscle.  Your gynecologist is the one to see for this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I have been married for about a year. However, both of us are still virgins. I am worried we always be for the following reasons:  1) I no longer have ANY sex drive.  When we kiss now, I don't really get wet, or wet enough. I am indifferent to making out. Before we were married, for about the first year of our relationship, we would make out all the time and it was great. We never had intercourse but did other things because we wanted to wait til marriage (thought it was the right thing to do. in hindsight, maybe not because I was horny back then)  2) Any attempts at sexual intercourse have been incredibly painful.  He even tried to use his finger, and even that hurt. I once went to a gyno to have a pap smear and that hurt like crazy.. i was practically in tears and the gyno barked at me to stop clenching my muscles (involuntary) . So maybe my vagina is too small, I don't know.  3) His penis is crooked. Does this pose a problem in having intercourse? He has problems sticking it in..  I suppose you might recommend visiting a doctor, and honestly I have no desire to explain this to someone in person. What would you say to me if I came to your office?? And what kind of doctor do I visit?  What are things a doctor would recommend?? Is there any hope or should I tell my husband that he will have to continue to suffer in a sexless marriage?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Having problems losing my virginity..",
    "content": "Hello, I'm sure you are very discouraged but chances are you can turn this around.  I don't think it was a mistake to wait for intercourse and suspect your lack of interest now may be related to the frustration at not being able to have sex comfortably.  You should start with a visit to a gynecologist.  If you can find one that specializes in sexual function problems, that would be great but they are all trained in sex issues to some degree and should be able to help.  First the doctor will want to check for physical causes, including hormonal function.   Some women have a partially intact hymen that needs to be surgically repaired.  There are also some gentle stretching exercises that can help but this should happen under the direction of a specialist.    One possible problem that can cause entry pain is vaginismus, where the vaginal muscles contract involuntarily, making penetration extremely painful or impossible. Sometimes the body tries to protect itself from pain by \"closing off\" the vagina, especially after you have had negative experiences.  Once the doctor diagnoses or rules out physical problems, it will be clear what to do from there.  Sometimes a qualified, licensed sex therapist can help.  Most of the time there is a physical cause but sometimes it can be psychological.  The mind is very complex and tied closely to the rest of the body's functioning.  You should not have to resort to a sexless marriage.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am female in my late teens, and I have never been attracted to anyone in my entire life. I have never thought anyone was hot or been turned on by someone, or even turned on by anything at all. I have never had sexual desire, arousal, tension or anything. Basically, the only way I can explain it is I feel exactly the same as I did as a child--completely devoid of any form of sexuality. Attempts at masturbation only leave me feeling physically numb (not numb per se, but that's the closest way I can describe it for lack of a better term).  Is this a hormone imbalance, or something else? I am not on any medication, I am completely healthy otherwise, and my period is regular.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, While some young women report a high sexual arousal and desire, as a rule, women are most aroused when they are in a loving and committed relationship.  This varies from most men, but it is quite normal.  I would not be alarmed unless you fall in love (which happens later for some than others and it's OK) and then you still find no physical attraction at all.    Hormones can play a role for sure but we don't know a lot about this and have not yet discovered how to manipulate this with women.  Many women on hormonal contraceptives find this decreases libido, but usually this would only be noticed if she had previously had a higher level prior to the pill or other device use.  I think you are premature in worrying about this as sexual maturity (emotional as well as physical) varies tremendously in women.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I made a post in the psychiatry section of these forums, but on a second look I thought it might fit better here. Here 'tis:  I've been having a problem engaging in sexual relations with my husband for the past two years or so now. We've been together almost 8 years, and in the beginning of our relationship that aspect was perfectly normal and good. But after we were married (about 5 years ago), I was unfaithful in many very damaging ways; damaging to our relationship and to my own mental health. We split up for a while, during which time I threw myself into all sorts of unhealthy, unnatural sexual relationships, till I finally came to my senses and came clean to my husband. We're now back together, having worked on our relationship, and we're in a good place in every aspect but the bedroom. Every time our foreplay reaches the point of sexual contact, I get a disgusting feeling and badly want it to stop (unless I've imbibed a certain amount of alcohol). I go through it for his sake, but during the whole event I feel like I just want to die. He knows I'm not enjoying it either, so it's been gradually more and more of a strain on our relationship. I can't afford to go to any kind of therapy; that's out of the question. But I'm wondering if there's anything I can try to do on my own to work through this problem and be able to enjoy intimacy with my husband again. I know that this problem stems from those unnatural relationships I had before and during our separation, and also from prior sexual trauma I had as a child, but that knowledge isn't making the problem any less. In fact, as time goes on, I find it getting worse and worse. I'd appreciate any advice, thank you.\n\n",

We have been married for two years, we dated for five years prior to marriage.  For years, we had a very healthy sex life, in fact there were many times I wanted to have sex and he didn't, this is not the case today.  I have been going through an \"aversion\" to sex or any kind of intimacy.  Even kissing, hand holding, or cuddling makes me feel very uncomfortable.  The last time we had sex, which was sometime last year, I just did it for him, I wasn't at all into it (this had been going on for several months).  I literally felt sick to my stomach the next day to even think about what we had done the night before.  It actually made me cry to think about it.  We haven't had sex since.  I was hoping this \"aversion\" would go away on it's own and that it's just a phase, but it hasn't.  I feel this way even though I have been faithful and he's been faithful, bless his heart since we haven't been having sex.  I've tried being open and honest with him about how I feel, but it hurts his feelings because he thinks I'm not attracted to him anymore.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Libido and interest in sex varies greatly from one person to another and how you feel now does not necessarily predict your future.  Most people do best when they are in a committed, monogamous relationship, such as marriage.  Casual sex is overrated and low sexual desire is very common, especially in women.  The emotional factor in a relationship with someone you truly love drives the sexual interest for most women.  It is not merely physical, but a combination of the physical and emotional.  Give yourself time and meanwhile, don't focus on sex.  Just because the media portrays it as the number one activity of life, it really is not that way for most people.  When it's right for you, I suspect your feelings will catch up.  If you read about women and sexuality you will probably find that this is very common.  Also, you will learn that women reach their sexual peak in their 30s or beyond, though men in the 20s.    Best wishes.\n\n",

However, because it is serious, a pregnancy test would let you know if that might be the case and ongoing, severe pain should always be checked out.

I did that, but now, 2 weeks on, I am still on my period, and it seems to have no signs of stopping any time soon.  This has never happened before, as my periods have always been 7 days or less.  I'm assuming the reason my period is 15days long and still going, is because of the pill as it only happened after I started taking it.  So is this normal for people taking the contraceptive pill?

If it continues much longer I would discuss it with the doctor because you may need additional hormones to stop it.  But, most irregular bleeding on the pill disappears within a few months of taking it.  Bleeding like this is enough of a nuisance that you may do better with a different pill formulation.  Each woman is unique in her response to hormones and you never know until you try it how you will react.  It's a matter of fine-tuning until you get it right.  Some women are never happy with this method of contraception; others have no problem.    Best wishes.\n\n",

My periods wasn't  due for another couple of weeks, yet the spotting carried on for another few days. After the spotting my periods came at the normal time. I did not take much notice, as i had heard that it happens to other people. Whenever he fingers me, it doesn't feel 'pleasuring' just very uncomfrtable. Eventually i tell him to stop.  Its now months after, and he fingered me again. Straight after i started spotting again, just like before. It was accompanied with no period symptoms like cramps or sensitive breasts, just blood and no clotting. It's still bleeding now and its been 4 nearly 5 days and it's still another week before my period is due. This time he fingered me, it was extreeemmmely uncomfortable and resulted in me crying (tearing).  We don't often do anything with me as we never get the chance, so i'm not sure if this is regular after everytime he fingers me.  Thankyou for reading the long post; i will very appreciate any reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is quite normal to have spotting following sexual activity.  It is possible you still had your hymen intact and there has been some breaking of it, resulting in the spotting.  I would not be alarmed.  Also, sexual enjoyment is something that takes time to learn and when you are in a caring relationship, being considerate of each other is an essential ingredient.  He needs to know how you are feeling so he can learn better technique.  You might also benefit from some lubrication.  There are all kinds of feelings involved here that can result in this being a not-so-pleasant experience.  Included might be an inability to relax due to circumstances, risks, fear of what else this may lead to, etc.  I think it will resolve in time unless you have some history of sexual abuse or some trauma that you need to work out with a therapist.  However, whenever a person contemplates becoming sexually active it is a good idea to  have a discussion with the health care provider.   There are serious risks such as sexually transmitted infections as well as pregnancy that can disrupt your life.  You should talk about protection against this.  While condoms cannot guarantee you will not become infected, their use can help reduce your risk.  Good luck.\n\n",

I am afraid of telling this to anyone in my family and am definitely not able to gain the courage to go visit a doctor. The problem is that I have really long hair that grows around my nipples. I have been using a tweezer to pluck them. But now I am really concerned and want to get rid of them permanently. Also, my periods are not regular. Till date I have been unable to chart out my menstrual cycle; the only thing that I am sure of is that they last 7 days. I am dead scared of getting a pelvic exam done cause I think the doctor will tell me that I am not normal down there cause of the appearance of my genitals. Can you please tell me what could be the reason of the hair growth and should I consult a gynecologist or some other doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is very common and not significant for a problem.  You can have laser hair removal or see a doctor about checking your hormone levels to see if you have excessive androgens - again this can be very common.  Plucking is no problem, shaving is also acceptable but I understand your concerns.  Hormones my help but this would need to be evaluated so you need to see a doctor - gynecologist or endocrinologist perhaps.  If you are more comfortable with a female, do that, but you don't need to worry.  You would be surprised how many young women struggle with this issue.  Often as you get older the problem may change as hormones do but for now, try cosmetic methods of hair removal and try to realize it does not mean you will have any other sexual or reproductive problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Some women describe it as what seems like a regular period, only perhaps shorter in duration.  Others describe a much lighter bleeding.  Because of the wide variation  (most women don't actually experience anything), all you can do is wait.  If you miss a period, take a home test.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "MISSING PERIOD/CHRONIC FATIGUE - what is wrong with me?",
    "content": "I'm a 23-year-old female who has a pretty normal health history.  I was diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse/Irregular heartbeat at the age of 18, but was experiencing symptoms of it from about 15 years old.  I am married, a stay-at-home mom, pretty laid back, and lead a fairly mellow and low-stress life.  I got pregnant when I was 21 for the first time, and had a miscarriage at 7 weeks gestation.  3 months after, I got pregnant with daughter, who is now 1 year old.    I started having periods when I was 13, pretty normal.  After my initial period, I didn't have one for nearly 6 months, but things eventually regulated and I had fairly regular periods until I got pregnant for my daughter.  Once I had my daughter, I missed a month (which I know is perfectly normal) and resumed having periods the month following, which was February.  Ever since, my periods have been totally irregular.  For example, one will be a 26 day cycle.  The next will be 38.  The next will be 44.  The shortest it's been is 26 day cycles.  The longest, 44... until now.  Ever since I gave birth to my daughter (a totally traumatic emergency c-section after 21 hours of labor, that I was put to sleep for), I've been tired.  REALLY tired.  Not like I just had a baby tired, but more like can't get out of bed tired.  It reminds me of the way I felt when I had mononucleosis when I was 17.  I weighted 140 pounds when I got pregnant with my daughter (pretty normal for 5'8\"), and I gained 49 pounds when I was pregnant.  I currently weigh 173 pounds.  I've tried exercising, dieting, diet pills, everything!  And the lowest my weight has gotten is down to 166, and that was only after about a month of being addicted to prescription painkillers.  I don't gain weight regularly, but I don't lose it - even when I try.  On top of that, I've been getting more and more tired.  I used to wake up after 9 hours of sleep.  Ever since my daughter was born, I sleep for 13 hours sometimes, and wake up feeling terrible, or don't wake up until somebody wakes me up.  I've tried setting alarms and getting up after just 9 hours of sleep, thinking maybe I'm sleeping too much, but I just feel worse and then fall asleep later in the day.  I don't use any drugs (including the prescriptions I was briefly hooked on), I eat a relatively balanced diet (maybe a little low on veggies).  I've cut a lot of unnecessary sugars out of my diet (like soda, for example).  And still, I don't lose weight.  It fluctuates between 5 pounds regularly, sometimes within a day.     In late November, even though my periods are irregular now, my husband and I decided to try to get pregnant again.  I joined a fertility website that keeps track of cycle information and makes it easier to know when to try to conceive.  I entered all my past period information since the birth of my daughter (which I keep track of), and we attempted to get pregnant.  That was at the end of last month.  My period (which was figured to be due at about a 40-day cycle) never happened, so I figured maybe I had gotten pregnant.  I took a pregnancy test at about 9 days past ovulation, which clearly wasn't long enough to tell.  But there was a very, very faint line indicating some, albeit not much, hCG was detected.  I labeled it inconclusive, since it hadn't been long enough and the line was very faint and the test was a generic brand.  I took more tests over the next couple weeks, bringing us up to date.  Today is my 20th day since I supposedly ovulated.  And the pregnancy test is negative.  Less than a week ago, I couldn't sleep because I had horrible pain in my left pelvic region, which hurt with each pulse.  Thinking maybe it was an ectopic pregnancy, I figured if it still hurt in the morning, I would go the emergency room.  The pain was completely gone in the morning.   Now I don't know what to think.  I'm ridiculously tired all the time, yet I can't sleep when I go to get in bed at night.  I have always had poor circulation, but I am either freezing cold or burning hot all the time now.  I feel pregnant... slight nausea on and off all day, frequent urination,  lower back pain, some cramping, sore breasts.  I was sure two weeks ago that I would either start my period very soon or get a positive pregnancy test.  But neither has happened.  I found out from a forum that people sometimes develop postpartum hypothyroidism, and I was interesting that a lot of the characteristics were similar to mine, but it seems too extreme.  I don't gain weight.  I don't have vision problems.     I've looked at my mother and sister's patterns since the birth of their children.  My mom was very, very thin before getting pregnant.  After she had all her children, she never really lost the weight.  She wasn't fat until she was older (her eating habits are not good), but she never was back to 100 pounds.  My sister remained chubby after her daughter was born, losing only about 10 pounds of the 60 she gained.  She has a lot of fertility problems (a calcified placenta with her first and an ovarian cyst with her current pregnancy).  My father's side of the family has a bad history of fertility problems, and my great-grandmother went through menopause at just 28 years old!  All the females on that side of my family have had hysterectomies in their 40's.  My mother's side has fertility problems too.  My maternal grandmother had several miscarriages, and my maternal aunt had complications with her pregnancy due to diabetes and a previous abortion and was told she would never be able to carry a child to term (although she did once).  I had a difficult but relatively healthy pregnancy with my daughter.  I had extremely low iron throughout, and the doctors tried to get me to agree to a blood transfusion at the birth of my daughter because my iron level was so low, but I refused and it returned to normal within the week.  I've never had anemia otherwise.     I've always had pain during intercourse.  Not extreme pain.  It's bearable, but pain nonetheless.  At one point when I was 18, I was having very bad, sharp pains in my pelvic region immediately following intercourse.  Between 18-20, I was having frequent instances of severely bloody feces when I deficated.  I would get very bad stomach cramps, and then the fecal matter itself would be extremely bloody.  I was very worried, but never had the insurance to get checked out.  The instances let up, and I had several more last year.  But, once again, lack of insurance kept me from investigating further.  I haven't experienced the bloody feces in awhile.   My primary question is what is causing the absent period, the pregnancy symptoms without the pregnancy, the constant fatigue, and the chronic headaches I have almost all the time.     Please, if this sounds like something familiar, let me know.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Follow delivery, most women have an interval of anovulation and menstrual cycles irregularity.  How about breast feeding? Breast feeding impairs the return of ovulation and most of women breast feed (no supplementation) might get their period every three weeks, every six months, or  without periods for many months.   This is due to the fact that the pituitary gland makes more prolactin, a substance which suppresses ovarian function and causes your breast to enlarge, be tender and sore.  Feelings of exhaustion and fatigue are extremely common for women after childbirth for many different causes. I would also consider the possibility of you being anemic, anemia would cause changes in your general condition and your ability to work and concentrate. It is easily treated with iron supplements, or with an increase in iron-rich foods. It is also better to take a vitamin supplement.  Regarding the past history of bleeding per rectum, it may be due to constipation and internal hemorrhoids which may aggravate the anemia. Occult blood in stool will confirm the presence of blood.  I advise you to follow  up with with your Doctor for proper management. There is no replacement for direct clinical examination.  Best regrads.\n\n",

    "content": "I would recommend you discuss your symptoms with your obstetrician.  You are absolutely correct in that occasionally after childbirth women can become hypothyroid.    You describe the birth of your daughter as traumatic.  Did you loose a lot of blood?  There is a condition known as Sheehan's Syndrome in which severe bleeding during pregnancy causes a transient low blood pressure.  This low blood pressure causes enough problems to result in damage to the pituitary gland-the \"control\" gland of the hormonal system.  Your fatigue symptoms, cold intolerance and increased weight are all very much consistent with hypothyroidism and I would recommend you have your TSH and T4 levels checked to evaluate this.  Also, you should consider having some of the other pituitary hormones checked.  These can include FSH and LH which help in regulation of the menstrual cycle.  Checking a prolactin level may be a good idea as well.  Hypothyroidism in itself can also cause irregularities or cessation of the menstrual cycle.  If I had to pick one, I'd go with the thyroid test first.  Your OB can help you in getting all this evaluated.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I did not have any severe bleeding during or immediately following the birth of my daughter.  I did, however, have extremely low iron levels (I believe the level was 2 when it should have been 11 or something along those lines).  At my 2-week doctor visit following the c-section, my midwife reported that my iron levels were completely up to par again.    The trauma I spoke of included being induced with Pitocin because I was developing preeclampsia (I was 40 weeks pregnant that day).  I had many allergic reactions to what I believe was magnesium that they were using to control my blood pressure, which was given via the epidural, and caused me to have horrible itching in my legs.  I was also given anxiety medication, which put me in kind of a haze, and they maxed out my doses of Benadryl until they said they could no longer safely give me any more.  I had developed an infection after they broke my water in my amniotic fluid and developed a temperature of 104.  They were extremely concerned about the baby at that point, and performed the c-section.  For two days, my daughter and I were both hooked up to antibiotic treatments every hour or so, but my daughter never got the infection.  My c-section went smoothly with no complications, and the incision healed perfectly.  The only suspicious thing at that point was a strange and sudden illness about a month postpartum, in which I developed another extremely high fever and was horribly sick for an entire day, and then was virtually fine in 24 hours.  I visited the emergency room, and was given pain medications.  They had no explanation for the illness, but assured me it probably wasn't surgically-related.      I breast fed my daughter for about 2 weeks, but she developed Thrush and wasn't getting enough food, so I decided that for my emotional situation, it would be better for me to stop breastfeeding.  I'm glad I did.  I had a brief bout with baby blues, and it helped to know my daughter was getting the nourishment she needed.  My daughter was born on December 27, and my period resumed by mid-February.  The most irregular thing about it has been the most recent one, which was November 3.  I was having spotting all during the mid-to-end of October.  It was very dark and sticky and thick.  It continued until November 3, when it turned red, and I assumed it was an actual period at that point.  I haven't had any bleeding at all since.    The problem with seeing a doctor is that I have no medical insurance at this point.  I am trying to get covered under Medicaid, but I don't know that I'll get approved and even if I do, Medicaid has refused to cover certain things that they don't consider necessary.  It's a vicious cycle, and it would cost much more money than I have to get checked out at an OB/GYN or GP.  :(\n\n",

You may be able to find a clinic in town that can see you with a reduced or no fee plan.  If you do qualify for insurance, I'm confident that with your symptoms your insurance company would consider the testing necessary.  I hope you are able to get an evaluation soon.  I'm quite suspicious of hypothyroidism.  Just as an off chance, do you eat a lot of food that may contain iodine?  High levels of iodine inhibit the thyroid from properly making thyroid hormone.  It's a long shot, but worth thinking about.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I really appreciate all your imput.  So I solved a little bit of the problem - the ovarian cyst.  But from the looks of things, that's not what's causing the majority of my problems.  I really feel like there's a bigger issue going on here.  It's hard to explain.  It seems like almost every aspect of my health has been affected by whatever is going on.  I'm very convinced that there is something hormonally wrong, because I've had several symptoms that indicate so:  skin breakouts, lack of menstruation, stinky feet (for lack of a better word - i don't really know if this is directly affected by hormones, but i have never EVER in my life had stinky feet until about 2 -3 weeks ago).  But there are additional things that I feel may not be hormonally-related.  Such as bowel problems (fecal bleeding on a large scale), very bad stomach cramps and having to use the restroom immediately.  Also, I've started feeling very light-headed, as if my blood sugar drops suddenly just out of nowhere, much more than usual.  It's so extreme that I've actually gotten to the point where I'm considering horrible things like bowel cancer or ovarian cancer.  I'm ALWAYS tired.... no exceptions.  Very low energy, I wake up very tired, my blood sugar seems to drop and I'm dizzy to the point of passing out very quickly for what seems like no reason, excitement causes me to have heart palpitations (which I have been actually diagnosed with by a cardiologist when I was 18) to the point where I can see my heart beating irregularly through my chest.  Something feels very wrong.  But I don't even know where to begin with a doctor, because they seem to want to send me to specific doctors for specific things, but there are many symptoms, so nothing gets done.  I do have an OB/GYN appointment coming up.  But something tells me that's not going to solve my problems.  I hope whatever it turns out to be isn't as extreme as it feels.  It's scary.  I will indeed request that my thyroid function gets checked out at the OB/GYN, although I'm not even sure if OB/GYNs handle that kind of thing.     The root of all these problems began when I was 15 years old, with the heart problems, that I honestly think were caused by extreme stress.  Then again, I'm not a doctor.  So it's just a guess.\n\n",

    "content": "Problems such as yours can be difficult to diagnosis.  Persistence is important.  Sometimes, we as doctors don't \"get the whole picture\", so I encourage you to continue to follow up with your primary doctor.  They can coordinate all the specialists and help make sure that all the specialists are talking to each other.    Your primary doctor can do much of the screening steps for you, such as checking your thyroid hormone, cortisol levels, etc.  Also, you may want to consider inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in the work up.  There are some blood tests for this, but the best way to make the diagnosis is to see a GI doctor for an endoscopy where they can look at the colon and take some biopsies.  With IBD, there are many chemicals released in the body.  One of these, known as tumor necrosis factor-alpha, is a potent inhibitor of \"normal body function\" including things like growth, energy, etc.  I would still start with the thyroid, although blood bowel movements are harder to connect to this.  You should also get a CBC to look for anemia with the bloody stools and lightheadedness.  Keep pursuing the answer.  Eventually you'll get it figured out.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I had my first doctor visit since the discovery of the ovarian cyst yesterday morning.  It was determined that, as I suspected, I have a Urinary Tract Infection (caused by the catheter in the emergency room).  I have been prescribed Keflex for that.  Also, I was given two more appointments - an ultrasound on January 11 to determine how big exactly and what type of cyst it is.  And a follow-up to the ultrasound on January 18.  I wasn't really impressed by the doctor.  He wasn't very thorough, and didn't really communicate with me.  He seemed more interested in what the chart said than anything I had to say.  I was told that small cysts rarely affect menstruation, so I'm really not sure where to go from here, since it's been 2 months now, with no period.  I am definitely not pregnant at this point.  I now have a bad cold and a fever.  I haven't filled my prescription for the UTI medication yet, because of financial issues.  I wonder how long you can have a UTI before it becomes a kidney infection and is more serious.  I have been especially tired lately, even more than I was, if that's possible.  The heart palpitations have slightly decreased over the last week.     If there is a doctor who is going to be able to piece together everything and be thorough, this isn't him that I'm seeing right now.  He hasn't shown much interest in what's really wrong.  It seems as if he's just trying to get through his day as quickly as possible.  My expectations are little.  But it's to be expected with no health insurance, although I've applied for some benefits through some state agencies that might be of some help.  I don't think I will be approved for Medicaid, but it's in the application process.  It's so frustrating, not having the money for insurance and having something wrong.    I'd like to get pregnant as soon as possible (at which point, Medicaid kicks in), so that the next baby can be born as close to my daughter as possible.  But I didn't find out about these problems until I started trying to conceive.  Ironically enough, I had very few menstrual problems before we started trying to get pregnant, although I really don't think it's \"stress\", as everybody and their mother tells me it is.  I'm really not that stressed.  I'm pretty laid-back in general.   So now I'll just wait until the ultrasound and see what's going on with this cyst.  I wonder if I should even worry about the possibility of getting pregnant, since I don't know that you can if you're not having periods.\n\n",

    "content": "Urinary tract infections can travel backwards up to the kidneys.  At that point, they generally cause fevers, back pain and a worsening ill feeling.  Cephalexin (Keflex) is one of the cheaper generic drugs, so if at all possible, I would encourage you to try to fill your antibiotics.  Hopefully your insurance will come through soon.  Regarding your desire to conceive, generally the lack of a period indicates that ovulation is not occurring; however, I would never use this as a sign that pregnancy is not possible.  Given all your symptoms I am still highly suspicious that you may have hypothyroidism.  Also, it is important that you feel comfortable with your doctor in order to insure that you are able to communicate well and relay all your concerns to each other.  If you are not comfortable with your doctor you may be able to find one that you are better matched with.  Sometimes, expressing your concerns to your doctor can help get you both on the same page and improve your doctor-patient relationship.  I hope you feel better soon.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, today I got online and found some insurance I can afford.  It has a high deductible, but I can work that out over time.  So as of January 15, I will be covered!  :)  I am insanely pleased with that.  I woke up this morning with a very high temperature and a swollen-shut throat.  I don't know if it's just a cold (my daughter had one a few days ago) that turned into something worse.  My immune system is clearly not the strongest.  My abdominal pain is worse, so you're probably right about the kidney infection.  Besides, it was roughly two weeks between the time I had the catheter and when I got the prescription for Keflex.  I did get some generic Keflex (cost $26.00) and I'm taking it 4 times a day.  I wish this was all happening after tax return season.  :P   As soon as my insurance kicks in, I will find another doctor.  The one I'm seeing now is simply the only one available through the ambulatory care clinic I was referred to for people without insurance.  I think the insurance policy will be a good investment, and it's not ridiculously overpriced at $80/month.     Now hopefully things won't get worse before January 15.  :)\n\n",

    "content": "Well, on January 3, I started my period.  The doctors said it would probably be very painful, but it hasn't been at all.  The antibiotics to cure my UTI from the catheter caused a yeast infection, of course.  So now I'm dealing with that and a super heavy period!  I guess a month late just adds more blood or something!  My hormones seem to be evening out a little, without any medication.  An interesting point to note is that as soon as I started having period issues (as in, missed periods) I noticed my feet stinking, which they never have before in my life.  For about the last two weeks, they completely stopped stinking.  And then today, the smell has returned.  I assume this has to be hormonally-related.  Also, hot flashes, constantly.  I'm either dying of heat or freezing to death!     I'm considering cancelling my ultrasound appointment at the hospital, solely because my insurance isn't completely effective yet.  I do not want to have to pay for that when I just received a bill for more than $2,000 just for the ER visit to get the cyst checked out.  I really wish medical help wasn't so expensive!  I understand why it has to be, but it is crippling!  Besides, I dislike my doctor at the ambulatory care clinic, and I refuse to have another catheter put in right now, since I just got over the UTI caused by the first one.  It was soo painful!  Then, once my insurance kicks in, I'll schedule a gynecological appointment and tell them I'm trying to conceive, since we would like to get pregnant in February (thus creating a Scorpio boy).     I'm not sure if the cyst is gone or not, but I'm feeling more normal.  As long as I have a period next month, I don't know that I'll have the motivation to go in for an appointment.   So that's what's happening right now.  I'll see about how the hormone thing works out.\n\n",

It feels like it is hitting a wall or some sort of barrier when inserted. I get extremly painful cramps durring periods also. I am planning on going to a doctor once I get insurance.

In the meantime you might even be able to locate a low cost clinic for women, perhaps through a community health center.  There are treatable conditions that can cause this problem - vaginismus is one problem women experience.  You can get more information on this disorder online at http://www.vaginismus-awareness-network.org/  People who struggle with this share what works for them.  This might be a place to start while waiting for your care provider.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Rough sex can result in trauma and vaginal tears.  Most likely this is the case since in both instances you had experienced the rough sex. In addition, the hormones could cause breakthrough bleeding and if it doesn't stop within a few cycles you should get it checked out. Other causes are infections, cysts. cervical polyps, tumors, and endometriosis.  It is important to rule out these conditions when you have breakthrough bleeding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Do you mean the rough sex could cause the cancer?  That is not likely.  And cellular changes on the cervix do not typically come with bleeding as a first clue.  This is why we have Pap screenings to detect these changes when they occur before there are any symptoms and most people are detected this way; not because of bleeding. I have not seen any statistics saying those who have rough sex are at greater risk.  There is an increased risk if you have multiple sex partners and some other infections such as HPV (which is what we screen for with a pap) or other STDs.  So, lifestyle can play a role and you should be careful about the decisions you make in your sex life.    Best regards Debbie\n\n",

I put plenty of KY on me and him. When he goes to enter it feels like there is not enough on there even though there is loads??? I feel like it is chafing. And it is very sore. It is kinda hard to explain. Then there is white bits left on his penis after sex. I am not sore of itchy down there in any way. No white bits on me usually. I have had trush in the past but never experienced anything like this, so i don't think it is that. Could I have become allergic to KY all of a sudden??  Any advice welcome.\n\n",

Your doctor may recommend estrogen cream if it seems you need something more and you could try some other lubricants - perhaps Astro-glide.  These should be water or silicone based; not petroleum jelly.  There are some massage oils available as well.  You may need to try various brands to get something that works.  The white bits could just be dried lubricant or dead skin cells - nothing to worry about.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I bought a vibrator to practice with, but after trying to get it in, I realized I get a sharp pain once it starts going in. The pain just scares me. I thought if I could finger myself, I wouldnt have any pain whatsoever. Please help me in my situation, and let me know whats going on. Whats best for me to do? I think I am just having the normal scare, that alot of girls have, but could you please reply me by helping me with my fear and maybe giving some tips on how I can stretch my vagina so when we have sex its easier and not painful.

And please use at least two forms of birth control. ie pills and/or contraseptives for STD prevention.  There are many alternative ways of  pleasuring each other then having sex. It just sounds to me that you are too caught up in the fear that leads me to feel that you are definately not mature enough yet to be having sex.  You need to be emotionally,psychologically and physically prepared. More importantly your partner if he truly cares for you will wait as long as you need to.

First of all i would like to say that i don't think you're to young and that you need to become older or anything to have a sex life (fyi, poeple who go around saying things like, oh you're not old enough really bother me and thats really just why i'm bringing this up) anyway... I have painful sex problems as well, and while my problem is not the same as yours i did ALOT of research and so i think i can help you.  Has anyone told you about vaginismus? I think what is happening is that you are afriad of larger penetration, or penetration by something that is not yourself and becuase you are scared your body naturally tries to get you to stop what you're doing by clenching up real tight so that penetraion is really hard to achieve and is very painful for you.  My advice is that when practicing with a vibrator you should take it slowly and try not to do anything to fast or anything becuase the fast movement will make your vaginal muscles tense up and cuase pain.  There really isn't anything else you can do for this, but i do know if you practice alot your body will learn that sex isn't a bad thing and will stop making your muscles clench up.  I hope i helped you!\n\n",

I'm only 16 and have had sex with my boyfriend, and i have to say that we didn't do it until we were both comfortable with our and each other's bodies.   Maybe you and your boyfriend need more time doing other things that are less intensely sexual. Oral sex, maybe. Also, good ways to get you comfortable with having sex is to start with dry-humping and fingering. You can both finger you at the same time, which if you have a problem with things beside yourself near that area it may help with it.   When my b/f and i first got together i would tense up and if he wasn't gentle it would hurt for him to finger me (and not by lack of masturbation, lol) because i was nervous. When we had sex the first time it hardly hurt, really more of an annoying pinch than a pain for a few seconds, and i know that's not because he's small.   It sounds to me like you aren't comfortable and relaxed enough with this boy, and until you two are comfortable you either won't be able to have sex or if you do it's going to hurt you pretty badly.   Also, try buying some lube. Joe Lube brand is good, cheap, condom-friendly stuff. And it looks a little like a hair-get tube, so it's not quite so embarassing to buy. Also, please please use condoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is more likely to Bartholin's glands problem like cyst which became infected forming an abscess.  There are two Bartholin\u2019s glands at the inside of the vulva near the entrance to the vagina posteriorly. They secret mucus-like fluid.  When their ducts are blocked they form cystic swelling filled with fluids. Bartholin\u2019s duct cysts are usually unilateral and non tender, and palpable which may cause minor discomfort during intercourse.  If they became infected they form small abscess (this is more likely to be the cause). Both conditions are mild and antibiotics may be needed for infection treatment. When infection is not properly controled the condition can recur.  Other causes to be excluded are dermatitis due to friction or infections like Candida. In sexually active individuals, STDs should be excluded too.  Direct clinical examination is essential. So I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, While allergies to lubricants are not common, there is always the possibility so you could try doing without this to see if it helps.  There is a condition called vaginismus where pain is present with vaginal penetration but I suspect this would have been happening for a longer time if that were the case.  Orgasm can also cause muscle contractions, even of the uterus which would feel like cramping.  It is possible you have developed some type of infection - bacterial or fungal (yeast) and this can be treated so if it continues you should see your doctor.  If you prefer to try treatment on your own first, yeast is easy to treat with over-the-counter anti-fungal creams.  Be alert to any external exposures that might be irritants for you including tight-fitting pants.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible that the pill has affected your sex drive.   Unfortunately many women suffer with this problem and they are working on effective treatment.  There is a topical I have heard of called Zestra which helps some women.  Try to relax and not worry too much about this.  Chances are your drive will improve again, but you should know that it's perfectly normal to have fluctuation in this area.  As you both become more experienced and comfortable in your relationship things are likely to get better with time alone.  I doubt it is any physiological problem.  The amount of \"erection\" you get with your clitoris also varies from time to time so don't stress about this.  Try to enjoy being together and let things develop naturally without being rushed.  Best wishes and good luck in your marriage.\n\n",

    "content": "She told me this prior to us having any sexual contact, but I really wasn't sure what to expect.  Last night was our first night being intimate together and twice she had a panic attack.  From what I could gather she seemed to have them when she was very excited and close to orgasm.  The first one occurred during foreplay, and the second right after sex when I was helping finish her off.    Basically both attacks lasted around 7-10 minutes.  She turns away from me, curls up into the fetal position, and would barely talk or move.  I tried to be comforting and reassure her I was not mad and or upset and not to worry.  I figured maybe she was embarrassed... but to no avail.   I never felt so helpless in my life.    Is there anything I can do to help?  Maybe not go as fast/hard?  Is there any sort of treatment that can help her?  Also, she told me that she believes that these may be caused because she used to be morman, which looks down on sex before marriage, and deep down perhaps she still feels a bit guilty.  I do not know how much to weigh that in the issue though.  Thank you for your time and help.\n\n",

It is doubtful it is a religious issue alone as many people have this belief system regarding premarital sex and panic attacks are not a consistent and common problem there.  Feelings of guilt alone rarely would lead to a panic attack.    She could have PTSD (post traumatic stress disorder) if there is some abuse in her perhaps buried past.  It would be prudent for her to see a counselor she could trust (probably female) to help her work through this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

You can do a test by switching to a non-latex variety.  These are not quite as reliable as latex but if you find you don't react you can be pretty confident that latex is the culprit.    If you still have symptoms you should see a doctor to determine whether or not there are other lesions or causes for the discomfort.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First of all, let me reassure you that you are not alone in this.  It is one of the most common disorders among women.  Part of it may be a learning curve and time will help you to learn what works for you.  Patience by your partner can also help.  Often young men have premature ejaculation, making it very difficult for a woman to sustain stimulation long enough to feel the way she would like to feel during sex.  This also tends to improve in time but can sometimes be helped with therapy.  It would be good to have an exam by a doctor to rule out any source of potential problem.  Your doctor can be a great resource in this - believe me they deal with it regularly.  Unfortunately they have not yet found a female \"viagra\" so we don't have a magic pill.  All people are different in their responses and anatomically some women find that they don't get the clitoral stimulation through intercourse.  They sometimes find they can enjoy other types of sex.  You probably could benefit from seeing a therapist, perhaps female, who specializes in these things.  Books can also be helpful in learning more about yourself.  I'm sure there are millions of other women who wish you were right and that they (everyone else) were enjoying it like you think they are.  The truth is that it can be very difficult for some women to become aroused, to feel sensations and/or orgasm.  See your doctor and get his/her referral for additional help in your local area.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have never had that problem before, and because of this, my sexual desire has decreased from daily to almost non-existant.

I have been experiencing hard to quench thirst & headaches. The cramps with this menstrual period are so terrible this month, that I have to stop what I am doing. It's also causing back pain.

    "content": "Hello, You should see a doctor about this to rule out any structural problems, infections, etc.  You may have dyspareunia (a fancy word for painful sex).  I know, you didn't need a doctor to tell you that.  Infections can cause this or you could have vaginal spams (vaginismus) so finding the correct diagnosis is the key to finding the solution to the problem.  Some women appreciate being involved in a support group with others who experience this and can help them find ways to deal with it and improve their sex lives.    I'm glad your husband is patient and it will likely take a while to get to the bottom of this.  With the help of your doctor and/or therapist you should be able to find a way to have traditional sexual intercourse.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The most common causes of vaginal odor are poor hygiene, infections, a forgotten tampon or damage between the rectum and vagina which might allow stool to move into the area.  You should be sure to be very clean with regular bathing and lots of water with soap or cleansing gel.  Douching is not recommended.  If this doesn't help you should be evaluated by your gynecologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Not exactly female myself so I'm not sure if this is a little strange, but me girlfriend is too shy with other people to do or say anything, sorry if this is in the wrong section too, wasn't too sure. So anyway me and my girlfriend are having some trouble figuring out what to do about some pain she's experiencing after sex. Um, brief intro on us, I'm an American male, about 6 foot 3, 190lbs, no medical problems what so ever, 18 years old, she's Japanese American female about 5 foot in height, 100 lbs, 18 years old as well, a few back problems (yes...noticeable size difference, which might have something to do with this whole thing). To knock out this idea right away, no STDs for either one of us as I was a virgin before her and I personally know her only other previous partner, and he has been tested for everything and came up clean (for other reasons, long after the fact, not on suspicion that she had anything). Well, we've been having sex now for the last couple months, and everything was more than wonderful for the longest while. Except lately, immediately after intercourse she is experiencing intense pain on her vaginal lips, she describes it as a \"stretched out feeling\". I guess it sounds like I'm simply a little...too big for her, but we've been having sex for a while now and that was never an issue before (well, nothing more than me just having to be a little gentle, that's all). Also, it happens immediately after sex, or if we've been having sex for more than a couple hours, and/or after she orgasms once or twice. It puts her in tears half the time its bad enough. The obvious thing would be for her to talk to her doctor, I know, but there's kind of a hitch with that. One, she's a very shy girl, and I doubt she could ever work up the courage to talk to her doctor about that, two, she hates her doctor, three, she's on her mother's insurance, whom the bill comes to, and if her mother found out we were having sex she'd probably try to castrate me with a pair of goat shears or something (even though we are both 18, she's kind traditional). We kind of have a little bit of a theory as what's DIFFERENT now to be causing her this pain, but it kind of sounds a little stupid and naive. Its a little combination of things....umm, well, typical, because pubic hair is a pain in the *** I'll trim it at least. And as of late she's discovered that she enjoys it when I penetrate her kind of....deep, so for one that's stretching her out a little more than normal, and that combined with the fact that I'm a little prickly with stubble on occasion, might cause some irritation? It sounds far fetched I know but those are the only things we've done different as of late when this problem started. We are going to try letting my hair grow and be a little less rough during sex, but I wanted to hear some else's opinion first. Sorry if that all was a little graphic, but the nature of the problem requires that, and this is a medical forum so I assume that's ok. I just want to figure out what's going on, what's changed, because she beats herself up that she has these problems all of a sudden and thinks she isn't pleasing me, and I beat myself up because I feel so damned guilty that I physically hurt her by accident when that's the last thing in the world I'd ever like to do. Thanks in advance for your time if you reply to this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for taking time to write and for your concern about your girlfriend.  The fact that you did not have problems early on leads me to believe it is not a size issue.  That and the fact that the vagina is very elastic and can accommodate varying sizes.  This is rarely a problem.  The hair issue could cause irritation and I would definitely recommend trying to go \"natural\" to see if it is a contact dermatitis due to irritation.    As for the doctor, should she decide to go, she could make a routine physical exam appointment and just discuss it at the time.  The doctor will not discuss it with her mother and they do not give specifics on the billing information.  These things are confidential and it would only be billed as an office visit, perhaps labs, and even though she is on her mother's insurance, it should be addressed to her with confidential noted on it.  Since you don't worry about sexually transmitted infection, it would be her decision to be checked for these.    There are some conditions, such as vaginismus but again, since this is a new development, I would doubt this is the situation.  This could also be something that would be helped with some increased lubrication so try getting something over the counter and be sure there is continued lubrication throughout the course of your sexual encounter.  You mention \"two hour sex\" so it could be just too much friction.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Virginity is not easily detected even by specialists since the hymen can and often is ruptured for other reasons than sexual intercourse.  Simply using tampons and basic physical activities can cause the hymen to break.  It is a false belief that breaking the hymen on the wedding night is proof of virginity.  Please do not worry about this.  It will not regrow, though some women have what is called an \"elastic\" hymen and it appears intact even after sexual intercourse.  Again, it is not a reliable indicator.    Good luck with your marriage and your sexual past need not be revealed unless you choose to do that or it makes a difference such as with sexually transmitted diseases.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnancy symptoms but still having period",
    "content": "There is no evidence of any birth defects when taking the pill after becoming pregnant.  These are hormones similar to the ones you have naturally and your own fluctuating hormones don't cause birth defects.  The reason the packaging reflects the manufacturer's classification that says not to take in pregnancy is because testing is not done in pregnant women (it would not be ethical).  Therefore, they must classify it as one that should not be used and the wording states this.  Again, it is not because it is unsafe; just that it has not been (and cannot be) tested to assure safety.  But, over the years, watching thousands of women who took it after conception but without realizing they were pregnant, we have learned that it does not cause an increase in birth defects.  Keep in mind in the general population birth defects occur in around 3 to 5% of all births - most of these without any known causes and therefore not preventable.   A few drugs have been shown to increase risk but birth control pills are not those.    Good luck with the bloating.  Perhaps a change in prescription can help.  Be sure you are not dehydrated.

More likely it is just normal hormonal fluctuation causing it or even some trauma to delicate tissues and capillaries in the vagina.  Of course you could be pregnant, having unprotected intercourse during a potentially fertile time, but I would not expect spotting at the time of conception.  Post-conception spotting that usually occurs with implantation happens around the time the next period would have occurred had you not conceived that month.  If you believe you might be pregnant, wait until you miss your next period to take a test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

No matter how much I get involved with foreplay..no matter how much my boyfreind tries to excite my vagina...nothing happens. There is very little lubriaction...infact, there isn't any lubrication at all. This problem has started to affect my relationship. Been doing everything, but not the intercourse, sounds really odd and scary to me now. My partner thinks i'm avoiding loosin my virginity which is not the problem. I can't tell him that theres something wrong with me. I live in the middle east and here it is a bit awkward for unmarried girls to visit a gyne for such issues. Please explain me the causes of this problem and advice.  Some important information: Three months back my prolactin was slightly high for which I took Dostinex and now its back to normal. My sister is a case of polycystic ovaries, but I am not.  I am experiencing hair loss for the past four years and been taking vitaminds for it for the past three months.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Unable to have intercourse",
    "content": "Hello, I would suggest a general physical exam with a doctor who would check your thyroid and do other blood tests to be sure everything is normal that way.  Then, when he/she orders the test, ask if you could have hormone testing done as well since you are concerned about your vaginal health.  This way the appointment itself would not draw attention to your specific concern but might reveal something and would give you a chance to at least talk about your symptoms, including hair loss which can be hormonal in nature.  Many women do need to use lubricants for sex even when everything checks out to be \"normal.\"   Try not to be self conscious about this.  Libido varies with each person as well and it is very common for women to have a decreased arousal mechanism.  Try some over-the-counter products and be open with your partner about your desire to have this experience but would like to try the lubricant to help.  I'm sure he will understand and will want you to be comfortable.  Communication is very important in  relationships.  With time, things might improve on their own but even if you must use a lubricant each time, that is not a bad thing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am assuming you are describing a regular period; not just minimal spotting.  Bleeding between periods is quite normal and common for most women at some times in their lives.  Sometimes emotional factors play a part because the balance of hormones is what makes the cycle function as it does.  When the hormones fluctuate, the body gets a different message and responds accordingly.  This is nothing to worry about.  I can't tell you if you will get your period again at the expected time or not.  Sometimes you get an extra period, sometimes a delayed one and sometimes you miss one or two.  It is possible that having sex stimulated some hormones and contractions of the uterus, causing your period to start.  However, rough sex or sex without adequate lubrication can result in bleeding, but this is usually minimal.  It is even possible that you had a hymen that was still mostly intact and the act of intercourse broke it.  This is also normal.  If you find yourself bleeding for most of the month for two or three months, you should see a doctor because it is possible you could become anemic.  But, I doubt this will be the case for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not suspect an infection from colon bacteria after so long but it would not be a bad idea to be checked for STDs when you see a doctor for any other reason.  Once you are sexually active it is a good idea to have regular pelvic exams where your sexual health can be monitored.  It would be good to have a general physical exam and if you haven't yet had the new Gardasil vaccine for HPV, this would be another good reason to see a doctor.  You might suggest to your parents that you realize teens should take an active part in their health including vaccination for tetanus.  Manys school health classes teach about these things and are trying to get the word out about the need for immunizations for teens.  It is recommended that teens be allowed time with their doctors without parental supervision so they can feel free to discuss personal matters when they go in.  If yours is a family friend, perhaps you could ask to see a gynecologist since you are a young woman now.    If your parents agree to a physical exam, you could call the doctor ahead of time and request that he/she provide some private time for you.  This should be standard practice but is not always done.  With an advance request, perhaps you can accomplish this.  The doctor can then take the lead in stating that the parent should wait but would be invited in after a few minutes if you are comfortable with that.  Hopefully your parents will also respect your privacy when it comes to a physical exam involving genitalia.  It is also standard to have a medical assistant present for the pelvic exam.    There is the possibility you could have a vaginal infection.  These are quite common and can be treated.  Some discharge is also quite normal but it would be good to find out since you are itching as well.    Best wishes.\n\n",

A day ago i found two small sores that look like canker sores on the opening of my vagina on the soft moist tissue area. It can't be an std because i have never been sexually active, or even came close to be. At the moment i have the flu, and i did get a very high fever yesterday where i was sweating loads. The 2 sores only hurt when i wipe or touch them. i have looked on various sites to find out what they are and most say they are probably sores from blocked glands that should clear up on their own. This would make sense because of my high temperature and sweating but i am still unsure. I know i should tell my mum and go see my doctor but im scared and embarrassed. Please could you tell me what you think they are to put my mind at rest?  Thank-you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are some very harmless things that can result in such a lump.  You could have an infected follicle or even a bartholin or sebacious cyst.  Neither of these things is serious but you may want to see a doctor to be sure we are guessing correctly.  It is important not to squeeze them and if they do not go away or interfere with your life, you can have them removed by a doctor, though they sometimes come back.  If you are sexually active there is always the risk of sexually transmitted infections and any time you have a bump or lump it is wise to have it checked out with a health care provider.  I would not be alarmed, but it is wise to be sure of the diagnosis.  For the discomfort, you may find that warm, moist packing with a clean washcloth may help or even soaking in a shallow, warm bath.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The white discharge can be quite normal and unrelated to your other diagnoses.  Especially during periods of fertility your vaginal discharges increase.  It is part of the normal process to facilitate fertilization and pregnancy.  If your doctor has ruled out bacterial or yeast infections, it is likely just your normal vaginal lubrication which would naturally be thicker and heavier at certain times.  Some women become so in tune with their normal secretions they can actually determine when they are fertile and can plan their sexual intercourse around this depending on whether or not they are trying to conceive.  If it truly is excessive it is probably due to some infectious process and your doctor should evaluate it.  Best wishes to you with these frustrating conditions.\n\n",

It is also possible you need to have your birth control pill adjusted if you're spotting frequently.  People vary in how they handle hormones in oral contraceptives and you may need a different strength.    It is also possible you could have some type of infection or cervical condition so if you have not had a recent checkup with your gynecologist, you should do that now.  Even if you have been in recently, if this continues you want to check it out to be sure it is not something that needs treatment such as bacterial vaginosis, sexually transmitted infection, yeast, polyps, fibroid tumors or inflammation.

Everything was fine until she suddenly had a flashback and feelings of extremem panick overtook her.  The operation at the hospital was VERY traumatic for her, she hates hospitals, needles, etc.  So, I want to know how long we should wait before we try again,and when do we know we need to seek outside help?  I know that one week hasn't been long since the miscarriage, I just want to know how to know when we need additional help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Miscarriage is a very traumatic event, often not recognized as such.  Different people respond differently to the whole thing - emotional, sense of loss, physical trauma, pain, etc.  Some women experience anxiety for a long time afterward, others anxiously continue trying to become pregnant very soon.  There is no way to say a particular time frame here.  If you wife could benefit from counseling, it might be good to schedule an appointment with a therapist, skilled at helping people deal with loss and trauma.  Meanwhile, being kind, considerate, affectionate and caring, as I'm sure you are, will go a long way towards healing and her feeling ready to try again.  Patience is the order of the day.  Good luck and please express my condolences to your wife too.  I am confident you will experience a positive outcome soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Paranoidteen,  There are some changes in the vagina that occur with pregnancy but most are not noticeable directly.  Without a bit more detail I'm not able to tell you much more.  If you are concerned about pregnancy, many home pregnancy tests are accurate during the 4th week after your last period, some are reported accurate several days before your next period would be due.  If the test during the 4th week is negative and your period is delayed, a repeat test should be performed during the 5th week.  At this point urine pregnancy tests are almost 100% accurate (not exactly 100% but close).  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is because I got my period around late September and I still have it (October 28) so it's probably around a month and a few days. I was wondering why my period isn't stopping. On September it was normal. But after a week starting in October it was dripping very lightly, so I thought my period would be a couple days more. The light drips continued everyday. I never had this kind of period before. Never had any diagnoses or surgeries and none of my family members who are females had this kind problem. I exercise everyday and I'm healthy. Also I do not take any medications. I hope you can help me :) Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi im 28f for the past two-three years i have had constant yeast or bacterial infections.  No one can seem to figure out why.  I have been on BCP since I was 13.  About 2 1/2 years ago I developed hypothyroidism.  Also I have had a right ovary removed and continue to have numerous large cysts in the pelvic area.  I have had about three lap surgeries in the same time period. Everytime I try to have sex with my husband it burns and I get really irriated and then i get a yeast or bacterial infection.  This happens with or without a condom and we have tried every type of lubrication possible. Also I pretty much have no sex drive at all I really could care less about sex I don't know if that is because I know its going to hurt and end up with another infection or what.  My husband and I have been married for four years and all these problems seemed to start after I had my daughter three years ago.  I have been checked for every STD as well as my husband and everything is negative. Also, have lost about 25 pounds in the past three months or so.  Medications I am currently taking are:  Ovcon 50 (BCP), Lyrica 100mg a day, Adderrall, Xanax XR, Synthroid.  I believe that none of these meds with the exception of maybe the BCP that would effect my libido, etc.  Please if you have any suggestion of what I should try or change I am open to anything at this point.  This is an effort to save my marriage and my mental sanity.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ashleybrook,  You may want to consider seeing an immunologist to see if you may have an immunodeficiency causing you to be more susceptible to these infections.  Also, if you are using only topical or intravaginal medications for your yeast infections it may be that you are not fully treating the infection.  You may want to try an oral medication treatment such as fluconazole.  Typically one dose orally is sufficient but in your case, given your prolonged course, you may want to talk with your doctor about using a seven day treatment.  It may also be helpful to have your husband take the fluconazole at the same time in order to treat any possible yeast colonization of his skin.  It is possible that you may be being reinfected without knowing it.   I should add that yeast is not an STD in the classical sense but if an infection is present in both partners the risk of cross infection does go up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "If it were me, given your history, it would not be worth it to try this.  Only you know how much pain it caused and what you might be getting yourself into.    The mucous membrane of the rectum is not as thick as the vagina and so it is more vulnerable to tearing.  Then, given the nature of the stool it is also more prone to bacterial infection.    If you decide to go for it your partner must be very gentle, with no forced penetration and/or vigorous thrusting.  Use lots of lubrication (not saliva).  Make sure your partner is in agreement that he will stop immediately if you feel pain and ask him to do so. Don't shift from anal sex back to vaginal sex without changing condoms. Feces can end up in the vagina and cause infections. And please wash your hands with soap and water after.  You will have to decide for yourself on this one.\n\n",

The day before I found out about my ex I started feeling sore on my vagina. I went to the doctor and told her what I heard and she did test. She said it could be one of three things and I got treatment for all three.  When the test came back she said that it was trichomoniasis and told me since I did the treatment I would be fine. Well, its been about a month and I just got my period and its brown. I've been having abdominal pain. Well I knew I had to go to the doctor so I shaved, when I did it looked like a little bug on me and when I took it off I had a red bump.  So I went back to the doctor today. My regular doctor wasn't there, so I expained everything that happened. The new doctor told me that since I had the treatment and i havent been with anyone I couldnt have it again. She also said that doing a pap wouldnt show her anything. All she did was look around the outside and said everything is fine. I know its not, but what could it be and what should I do?

Give it a little time but if you are still worried or you get additional symptoms, go back to the doctor.  Don't worry about the brown menstrual fluid.  It is normal.   Do not worry about shaving to see the doctor.  This in itself can cause bumps and infections, ingrown hairs, etc.  Your doctor can work around normal pubic hair.  If some kind of surgical procedure were needed, they would handle any necessary shaving.    Take care.\n\n",

Since I no longer have any female organs in which to get cancer I have been taking HRT in the form of Estratest.  This certainly helps with the vaginal dryness and also make me feel more amorous when the time presents itself.  The problem is that although I am able to enjoy sex and become aroused, I am unable to climax.  I used to be a frequent masterbatour, and I can not even bring myself to climax, just to the edge, and not over.  It is very frustrating.  My question is this.  What else can I do medicinally to help with this.  I did try the testosterone cream, but the smell was awful, so I stopped using it.  I feel like there is some chemical that is lacking in the Estratest, that had naturally occured around the time of ovulation, but I am unable to identify it in any of my reading.  That is what I need, I am almost sure.  Do you have any suggestions?\n\n",

While there is much effort going into finding a medication that might help women's libido (a pink viagra) so far they haven't found it.  One promising medication will require years for FDA approval and it is in the form of a nasal spray.  So, the day may come when we will have an effective medication, but not yet.  Meanwhile, some women respond to the testosterone, but not all.  Some women are helped with the hormone therapy such as estrogen; others are not.  It's a matter of trial and error to find something that may help.    I wish I could give you better news.  I don't know why you have been affected adversely by your surgery.  And I don't know what you could take to help.  Continue to be in touch with your gynecologist to see if there might be a formula of HRT that would be better for you.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "One condition that can have pain and inflammation is vulvodynia but the fact that you do not have this problem with pelvic exams and other activities would lead me away from this idea.    As you mentioned vaginismus, it is important to remember that not everyone will experience every symptom associated with a particular condition.  So, it is possible you could have this.  Some women with this only experience pain during sex, as you have described.    It would make sense that if you have inflammation as your doctor described, you might benefit from anti-inflammatory medications.  I would continue with your gynecologist and/or alternative pain relieving therapies such as hypnotherapy, psychotherapy and/or physical therapy with a specialist in pelvic floor and sexual pain issues.  You might even benefit from seeing a sex therapist.  Ask your doctor for a referral to a reputable adjunctive health care provider.  At any rate, you should continue to seek help for this very complicated problem.  It sounds like your doctor has tried to determine possible infections and irritants.  Hopefully he/she will continue to work with you to find the actual cause.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sarahg,  Given that you have normal menstrual cycles it is very likely that all your hormonal components are working properly.  Breast development is driven by estrogen as are menstrual cycles.  The fact that you are menstruating indicates that you have estrogen activity.  So, I suspect that one of two possibilities is occurring.  One is that your breast tissue may have been damaged or is not responsive to the estrogen leading to failure of breast development.  The other possibility is that genetically you are not going to have very large breasts.  Given your description I think this may be less likely.  It sounds as if you have had failure of breast development.  It doesn't appear that you have had anything that would have caused damage to the breast bud tissue.  Possibly there is some resistance to estrogen.  This is where my knowledge ends about this issue.  You may want to see an endocrinologist or a gynecologist for further evaluation.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sarah,  I suspect that what ever the underlying cause there is unlikely to be a treatment that will cause breast growth at this point, unfortunately.  Many patients with similar issues as yours who are not happy with their current state will consider cosmetic surgery.  Others don't want the risks of surgery.  Seeing the doctor may help give you a reason for the failure of breast development but probably won't do much beyond that.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you are sexually active and fertile, this could be an early sign of pregnancy.    There is no way to know when you can expect your next period since hormonal fluctuations are common and this can continue to cause irregularity.  As you age, you will likely find more and more of this - even perimenopause which can occur a number of years before menopause.  Try not to worry because this is pretty normal.\n\n",

My prob is once I have reached an orgasm I have no more desire to continue with intercourse, nor is it pleasurable,even tho my husband has not yet reached orgasm. What causes this and how do I fix it? My husband doesn't seem to understand this since women are  supposed to have multiple orgasms. He thinks I should be able to continue with pleasure. It becomes very uncomfortable after the orgasm. Not painful, but uncomfortable. I am not taking any medications. This has been a problem I have had for several yrs.\n\n",

    "content": "This is very typical.  While multiple orgasms make good magazine articles and TV talk show subjects, in reality they are not that common.  I dare say it is more typical to be as you describe.  The arousal is intended to do just as it is doing for you.  Climax is just that - climax, signifying the end of the aroused state.    Hopefully your husband can learn a bit about women and come to appreciate what is unique about you and the two of you can find ways that work for both of you.  You may be able to find a book on the subject that you can read together.  The idea that once is not enough was not based on any scientific study.    Perhaps you could work toward helping your husband to climax first, then concentrate on you, although the same situation is likely to be in reverse when he finds there is less desire to continue after the orgasm.  I understand where he is coming from, given the  media representations, but it would be good if he could try to better understand your individual needs and desires.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 18, I have been having sex for about a year now. For the past few months I have been having this horrible pain in my vagina, that pretty much leads me to tears. It feels like my insides are being ripped apart and it happens every time after sex.   I have considered that I have endo, because of some of the other problems I have. Such as period pain. I understand that all girls have pain while on their period. But mine is severe. It feels like I am being stabbed multiple times and advil/midol/tylenol/birth control do not help me at all. I can't sleep when I am on my period or walk. I get so faint that I almost pass out. I believe I read in a topic that endo can cause pain after/during sex, that's why I also brought up my period.   My mom tells me that I can't have endo, so maybe it's not that. But why am I having so much pain?   I am about to start my period any day...should of actually started already. I have had cramps for three days in a row and my breasts hurt, there's no sign of blood though. I usually have cramps for one day that aren't too bad about four days before my period.   I also discharge a lot. If I run I do...it gets really annoying. Or after I urinate...I can't leave the bathroom for a few minutes, because I know it's coming.  Advice please<33 Sorry, this is so long.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello fellow worry worts...  I'm a 21 year old female who has dabbled into anal stimulation every now and then; anal sex maybe 5 times.  The other night my boyfriend inserted his thumb in my anus without much lube and did his thing.  When he took it out afterward there was some slight blood.  Not enough to be worried of a polyp or \"roid\" of anything of that nature.  So I looked at his nails and sure enough... they were a little longer than he normally keeps them and the edge of his thumbnail was semi-sharp.  Certainly sharp enough to scrape my hand... i tried.  So I just wiped the blood and went to sleep.  Although I woke in the morning to it still there.  I passed a small B.M. and when I went to wipe there was a very large amount of blood in the toilet!  Not fun to see when you AREN'T on your period.  So I wiped and dabbed my anus to see if it was localized or actually inside me.  Sure enough- just like when you pick a scab, it bleeds a little.  But I think since the anus has to stretch to relieve a B.M. it stretches the cut, and releases blood at a higher volume cause of pressure.  Just applying common sense.  I did a self check and I sure enough have a little 1/10 of an inch knick on my anus.  The only question I have is about infection possibilities, and how long it's going to take to heal assuming I take a B.M. every day or two?  Basically it feels like I knicked my knee shaving and it stings every now and then.    Help me.  Blood is only a good thing in the toilet when you're menstrating!\n\n",

    "content": "Blood like this can be deceptive as far as quantity and can look like more than you are actually losing so don't worry too much about this, particularly following a difficult bowel movement.  It is important that you allow your body to heal and do what you can to avoid constipation.  I would advise sitz baths, stool softener, increased water consumption and adding fiber to your diet.  Exercise can also help because it increases blood flow and promotes healing.  Also avoid other anal sex activities while you are healing.    You can also use a medicated cream such as Anusol, Preparation H or Cortaid.  It will probably be much better within two weeks.  If it lasts longer you should see your doctor in case it is something else besides a simple laceration.  Also, if you experience any signs of infection such as increasing pain, unusual discharge, fever, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your concern.  To reassure you, toilet seats are very unlikely modes of disease transmission.  Generally any organism still living on the seat would have to make contact with an open wound or cut to infect you. Skin is actually quite a good barrier against many bacteria.    It would be impossible to say what is going on here but a trip to the doctor, where this could be evaluated, could be helpful. It could be some kind of local infection (follicle, duct, etc.).  If it causes discomfort, try warm, moist packs (like warm washcloths) and sitz baths, where you just sit in a shallow bath.  It may resolve on its own but if not, you will want to have it evaluated for sure.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for being a concerned friend.  Many times it is helpful for an outside observer to be involved and to encourage someone to get the help they need.    I certainly understand her reluctance to talk about such a sensitive subject with a doctor or other professional and yet this could be exactly the thing that can make a difference to her.    You mentioned that this is making her depressed.  That is also very understandable, but it is also possible that underlying undiagnosed/untreated depression and/or anxiety could be causing the problems.  Sex drive is frequently cited as a symptom of depression.  She may need medication to help this.  Wellbutrin is one medication that has recently been shown to actually help improve a woman's sex drive while treating her depression, but she needs to see a doctor to find out if she is a candidate for this or another prescription.    There could be other issues such as hormone imbalance or even psychological concerns that should be addressed in therapy.  Please continue to urge her to see a doctor (Gynecologist or psychiatrist) for an evaluation.  Remind her that this is a very common problem among women and can be quite effectively treated.    Let us know if you have other questions and how this goes.  Again, thank you for caring about your friend.  This can be so helpful and I'm sure it means a lot to her to have a confidante such as yourself.\n\n",

I am not manic or any of the other descriptions I have googled for a high sex drive. I am not in a relationship, and thus, am not having sex, but I am so frustrated at my ridiculous sex drive. Is there not any type of medication or herbal supplement to calm this down? When I am in a relationship, I like to have sex once or twice a day, but nothing too much.  I really am so frustrated. I do masturbate, but that only satisfies a short while, and usually makes me even more aroused. I have no problem reaching orgasm, in fact, when I do have sex, I have too many to count. I also have ejaculating orgasms much of the time. Please give me any advice. I am constantly in a state of unsatisfied arousel!!\n\n",

You might also benefit from some hypnotherapy where someone could help you learn to control this subconsciously.    You have said it is not mania, but perhaps a psych evaluation would also be worth investigating.  In bipolar type II there is a hypomania (not as severe as the mania you typically see with bipolar type I and so it is not as easily recognized.  I would see your gynecologist first and ask him/her for suggestions as well.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 18 years old, and a Female. I am happily with my boyfriend and we have had intercorse. He was a virgin, however I was not. I have had sexal partners with past boyfriends, but they were all clean. So I am clean too. My boyfriend is a virgin so he's clean too. Now here's the question: I have these bumps near my vagina, and between my vagina and anal. They are very tender and sore when I touch or wipe after using the restroom. Other than that they do not bother me at all. At first I thought it was because when we had intercorse it got too crazy and he ripped me a little, but that's fine. It happens. However, after a couple of days I realized that I got these 3 bumps. They do not itch, nor is there any odor. It just worries me and it just makes me confused of what it is.   In addition, in the past I did have a UTI (urinary tract-infection) from my past boyfriend. Did not go to a doctor but realized it was because I was not being very clean.   Do you think the bumps could be from not washing right after intercorse? Or could it be from not wiping the correct way (front to back) after urinating. Maybe because it was dirty? (sigh)  Please if anyone could help me on some advice that would be great. Thank you very much~  BTW (by the way) -no surgeries, and not on any medication, no birth control or anything like that.  -CK\n\n",

    "content": "The menstrual cycle is regulated by two main hormones, estrogen and progesterone.  The estrogen induces the lining of the uterus to thicken in preparation for supporting pregnancy.  Subsequently, the estrogen drops off some and progesterone increases.  The progesterone causes the lining to mature, again to support pregnancy.  If no pregnancy occurs, the progesterone level drops off.  This decreased level of progesterone induces the sloughing of the uterine lining that results in the menses.  Taking the medroxyprogesterone tablets essentially keeps the progesterone levels from dropping off and keeps the uterine lining from sloughing.  When you stop the pills, the progesterone level will drop and your menses will begin.  It may take a day or two for this to happen.  Taking the pills should not alter the 28 day cycle but will shift if forward a few days.  I.e. you should still have your period every 28 days as you have been.  You should determine your safe days as you normally would but add a few days to the risky days just as a precaution.  (The progesterone should not alter when you ovulate but may keep the uterine lining hospitable for pregnancy longer if the egg happens to remain in the uterus for fertilization.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

They don't hurt at all unless i try to see if they are maybe in-grown hairs and apply pressure.  Secondly, though I am young, my vagina/vulva area looks, well, old. It's kind of gray-ish, limp, and wrinkly. It's not really a medical problem, but it does bother me, especialy since my left inner labia is much larger and darker colored than the right, and also less sensitive to touch. I was wondering what can be done to change this.  And advice would be very much appreciated!!\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding your first issue, you may be seeing some plugged glands.  There are many glands that line the entrance to the vagina.  Occasionally the skin openings get blocked.  Generally this is not an issue and they will resolve themselves.  Occasionally, however, they can become infected and require antibiotics for resolution.  Regarding your second issue, it is possible that your venous blood flow is somewhat limited for drainage of the blood flow from your vaginal area, especially on the left side.  This would cause some mild backing up of blood flow resulting in a bluish gray discoloration.  I would recommend you consider seeing a gynecologist for an evaluation to ensure nothing more serious is going on.  There may also be some treatments for your condition I am not aware of that the gynecologist may be.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Colpostenosis is a narrowing of the lumen (or open area) of the vagina.  Your post indicated the affected person was 28 months old.  If this is correct, I'm a little uncertain as to why they would be looking for this diagnosis.  I would generally encourage a 28 month old girl with colpostenosis to simply wait and see if the issue resolves once she gets older.  If the person in question is actually 28 years old there are several other factors involved in terms of implications of the diagnosis.  First if the narrowing in minimal it is quite likely that there will be no noticable effects.  If the narrowing is more severe there may be issues with pain during intercourse of insertion of objects (such as speculums, etc) into the vagina.  Also if there is scarring resulting in bands that are causing the narrowing there may be issues during childbirth, etc.  If the narrowing is severe a colpostenotomy can be performed.  This is essentially an incision into the wall of the vagina to free the narrowing.  I hope this helps.  If I haven't really answered your questions please feel free to post a follow up.\n\n",

    "content": "What you are experiencing is actually a somewhat common issue for women.  There is a syndrome known as Hypoactive Sexual Desire Disorder.    In your case there may be several possible causes.  It is likely that your symptoms are due to a combination of causes.  First, you may actually be underplaying your past a little.  Sexual abuse can have a huge impact on your mind, even if you don't remember the exact details.  If you truly have forgotten all the details then they really are unlikely to hurt much; however, I find that most people haven't really forgotten their abuse, they've more repressed it so as to try to stop the hurt.  I would recommend that you consider seeing a counselor to explore this.  Also, pain during intercourse is a definite way to decrease desire.  Your ovarian cyst may be causing you some pain, or you may not have sufficient lubrication due to lack of desire.  Regarding the cyst, there are a few things that can be done.  Ultimately, if it fails to resolve surgery can remove it.  Before surgery, most gynecologists will recommend a three to six month trial of oral contraceptives to \"take over\" the hormonal axis.  This often will result in the cyst resolving or at least significantly shrinking.  You can discuss treatment options with your gynecologist.  Also, the stress of the entire situation can add to decreased desire.  Fear/expectancy of failure to enjoy sex and concerns about not pleasing your partner can all add in to this.  The sum total of all of these things is likely causing much of your symptoms.  I woud recommend that you discuss your situation with your gynecologist.  I am not familiar with libido stimulating medications if they exist, but your gynecologist would know.   Also, have you discussed the issue with your fiance?  This can take some of the burden off your shoulders to simply unload the secret.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "Just to ease your mind a bit, this is actually not an uncommon issue.  Some women require more clitoral stimulation than others to reach climax.  This is likely the case in your situation.  There are a few things that may help.  Kegel exercises can help some.  These exercises help strengthen the pelvis muscles and increase stimulation.  Essentially, one can repeatedly contract the muscles that are used to stop urination.  Start with sets of 10 contractions and work up.  These can be done through out the day.    Also, you may discuss with your spouse trying different positions.  Occasionally women are able to obtain more clitoral stimulation in different postions.  In particular, with the woman on top and moving upwards just slightly it can help aline the clitoris with your partner's pelvic bones to improve stimulation.  This may help you achieve climax.  It is also important to be open with your spouse to try different methods to help you.  Being open also can help to relieve any pressures/anxiety that can hinder reaching climax.  Hope this helps a little.  I recommend that you discuss your situation with your gynecologist.  She may be able to make some other suggestions to help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 24 year old female. I am currently in a long distance relationship with my boyfriend.  While I was with him 3 months ago I noticed that I was bleeding after having sex.  He always said that he might have touched the lining of my uterus and caused some bleeding.  I was worried so 3 months ago I went to the doctor to be tested for STIs they all came back negative and the doctor did not say anything about an abnormalty in my pap smear.      A month ago I purchased a vibrator - as being away from my boyfriend has been difficult. I have used it only a few times, however, the last time I used it I went all the way in - worked it vigorously. I noticed that I was bleeding after this.  Does this mean that I do have abnormal bleeding from my lining?  Its really annoying - especially as my boyfriend would mention that i was bleeding again when we were finished. It's a very embarrasing thing and I need to find out what's wrong with me. What should I do, What does this mean?\n\n",

If you had a clear papsmear within the last 3 to 6 months and if your bleeding only presents itself immediately after intercourse or masterbation it is possible that your cervix could have small abrasions or lesions that when deep penetration occurs it causes your cervix to bleed.   If you are experincing pain during intercourse accompanied by bleeding you need to see your physcian immediately as there could be a more seriouse problem.\n\n",

There are several glands that line the introitus that can become obstructed and may or may not become infected.  Another possible cause would be herpes lesions, or other STD's.  Given that it's presentation is after intercourse with a condom, you may be having a reaction to the condom.  Other non-STD possibilities include vaginitis or yeast infections (though this would be an atypical presentation).  In addition, there are a few conditions such as Bechet's disease and Crohn's disease that can present with mucosal lesions.  The best way to diagnose what is going on is to visit your doctor while you have the sore.  Direct examination is important.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities that I can think of.  One possibility is that you may be allergic to the material in the tampon.  This can explain the pain while inserted and the burning afterwards.  As a test, you may try taking some diphenhydramine (Benadryl) to see if the burning goes away.  This explanation is not as good for pain with intercourse.  Painful intercourse can have several causes as well.  One very common reason is anxiety about pain.  Anxiety causes muscles to contract, making intercourse more difficult and thus more painful-sort of a self fulfilling fear.    I would suggest talking with a gynecologist about your symptoms.  A physical examination may be helpful to look for any signs of inflammation or infections that may be causing your pain.    Hope this helps.\n\n",

If it does not, you may want to talk with your doctor.  You mention that you are 14.  How old were you when you first started your periods?  During the first few years of menses the cycles can be a bit unpredictable.  The cycle length can vary, you may miss a month or two in between cycles, the blood flow may be light or heavy.  Generally after 2-3 years this evens out and cycles often become quite regular.    The reason for this variation is that there are still several cycles during the first few years in which an egg is not released from the ovaries-known as anovulatory cycles.  These cycles often will be \"different\" than the normal cycle.  I hope this helps.  Let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Vaginal odor occurs typically due to inflammation of the vagina. Inflammation of the vaginal results mainly from  infection in or the surrounding of the vagina (like glands). Dryness of the vagina makes the area more prone to infections.  Causes of infection include: Bacterial Vaginosis  Vaginitis  Chlamydia  and Sexually Transmitted Diseases (STDs)  Yeast (fungal) Infection  PIDs  Infection of the vagina is usually associated with discharge that may be seen only during local examination.  Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor to receive the proper treatment. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, I really need someone to help advise me on what to do here because I don\u2019t know if there is something wrong with me, or what it is.   I\u2019m 17 and I have been with my current boyfriend for almost a year now (11 months), we haven\u2019t had sex yet, but purely on the basis that he\u2019s worried because he can\u2019t get me to orgasm. I wasn\u2019t worried until I found out that I couldn\u2019t get myself to climax either.  We had done most forms of foreplay, and it\u2019s not that I don\u2019t enjoy any of it, because I do, I do a lot. I just can\u2019t or better said, haven\u2019t orgasmed. And I can\u2019t do it myself either, I\u2019ve tried a few different things, and get the same result, that I approach a climax but then nothing happens, I just keep going until I give up or get tired.  Currently I am on no medication, my periods are regular, I am a virgin so this is the first time I have encountered this problem. The only thing that could possibly be effecting this is that I take vitamins. I take vitamin A, E, C and a B complex, as well as iron and Zinc. Though I don\u2019t take these as regularly as I perhaps should. I also take up to 10g of vitamin B5 a day, most days only 5g though. I take this as it clears my skin from acne. I used to be on synthesized drugs like minomycin and Erythromycin but they just wore off and the B5 is still working fine so I don\u2019t want to have to go off it.  My boyfriend wants me to see my GP, but I feel that will be awkward, though if it is recommended I will go ahead and see a doctor. Are there any specialists to see? Or should I wait and see if I climax during sex first?   Someone please help, I\u2019m so confused!\n\n",

Now when you say you 'hit a wall' i'm guessing you're hitting your cervix (the very back of the vagina) Now hitting the cervix can hurt for some women and sometimes it's due to an infection, so if you want to find out if this is curable i suggest going to a doctor and getting checked out, it could be a very minor problem or it could be very major so you should go soon.

    "content": "Hello,  Women with chlamydia infection are usually symptomless. They may have symptoms like abnormal vaginal discharge or a burning sensation when urinating.   The main concern is the spread of infection from the cervix to the fallopian tubes while they still have no signs or symptoms. Some may present with lower abdominal pain, low back pain, nausea, fever, pain during intercourse, or irregular vaginal bleeding.  Regarding vaginitis due to candida infection, the typical symptoms are Vaginal or vulvar itching and cheese like discharge.  However, itching and burning sensations is not always present and differentiating between yeast vaginitis and bacterial vaginosis is difficult.   One study addressed the possible differentiating factors and found that presentation after the 14th menstrual cycle day, sexual intercourse more than four times per month, recent antibiotic use, young age, and absence of current gonorrhea or bacterial vaginosis are strong factors in differentiation.  Gram stain for yeast is an accurate method of diagnosis as well as culture, consideration for a background positivity in women without yeast problems should be taken.  Gynecological examination and cultures are essential.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. Me and my bf had been trying to have sex for approx 10 months but it was always too difficult and hurt too much. Eventually we found a position that worked and I bled for about 10 minutes so I figured this was my hymen breaking.  This was several months ago and since then we have had sex many times but it is still hard for his penis to go all the way in and it still hurts a bit.  Is this because I am still tight? I thought that when you're hymen breaks sex becomes easier over time? I feel comfortable, I am well lubed, I'm not anxious, scared or pressured and I am even able to orgasm yet his penis does not fully enter my vagina.  I can insert a finger or 2 into my vagina and it feels tight. What can I do? Do I just have to continue trying to have sex so it stretches to accommodate the penis?  I'm confused because I thought it'd get easier but it's not. Any replies would be much appreciated.  Cheers.\n\n",

Lack of lubrication is another cause of pain during sex and some lubricating products can be used to aid in this problem.  Vaginal infection of different types can lead to a painful sex.

    "content": "Does anyone know the best clinic i can go to for for a female sexual disorder? I live in virginia and I'm thinking about going to the North Carolina pelvic pain clinic becuase well, its the only pelvic pain clinic i know of and i'm sick of going to doctors who know absolutely nothing (come on now its like i know more then they do).  I mean if your vestibule is red and hurts like crazy if you touch it you'd think after going to 5 different doctors at least one of them would be like you have vestibulitis, but no none of them did, and alot of them were like i don't see a problem here... and all i can say is i want to scream/slap some sense into them/cry out that gynecologists are the worst people EVER.  I don't know, i'm REALLY frustrated now and I know they (the clinic) have done special research on vestibulitis... but are there others?  (becuase i ABSOLUTELY REFUSE to go through that kind of pain and torture that those people put me through, i mean i thought doctors wanted to help people, no they just made my life a living hell)\n\n",

In order to receive a prescription for a medication you have to have a physician issue it.

One of the causes may be due to the uterine contents not being completely shed during menstruation. Forceful orgasms also may cause this appearance.

    "title": "Ingrown Hairs or Herpes?",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 19 year old girl. Three weeks ago I had unprotected sex with a guy I did not know well.  About 6 days ago I had a generalized itching sensation in my vaginal area and the next day there was a swollen area on the left side of my vagina which disappeard during that same day.  About 4 days ago I devopled several small pimples which were all far away from each other.  On my upper thighs there was one on each side and another two or three on the right upper buttocks not very near each other and two which were next to each other that were right were my pubic hair begins to grow.  All the pimple like bumps are in areas where there is hair.  The next day white spots appeared on three of the pimples and they hurt when they rubbed up against my jeans which were tight.  That same day one of the pimples that didnt have a white center spot popped and blood came out.  These pimples are relatively small however when they had white centers there was a large area of red around them.   However today, when I woke up the pimples had mostly disappeared on their own... they were not large anymore andd they had slight craters in three of them... they were quite small.. I went to the docter and she insisted it was not herpes but ingrown hairs.  However she was in a hurry and as a university health center they don't usually spent much time on patients.  I'm still very worried since the remaining pimples have begun to itch. There are only about two left that havent popped.  The rest (the ones which are disappearing) don't itch or hurt or are large, they are just little red dots which are disappearing fast.  I have had ingrown hairs before but not so many at the same time.  Also, on the day I had the generalized itching senstaion I also felt rundown and slightly sick. However I am currently suffereing from allergies so Im not sure if its that.  Please, please tell me what you think.  I am very scared that I may have been misdiagnosed and I do not want to spread this to anyone else. -Thank you\n\n",

After rupture, painful ulces are present which typically scab over and heal in approximatel 1-2 weeks. Folliculitis,  caused by blockage of a hair follicle from damage, shaving etc.,may present with pimple/pustules in the genital area, causing discomfort, itching, etc. These damaged follicles may of course be infected with a staph bacteria or fungal related, etc. I would suggest a re-evaluation to assure a STD is not the causative factor but in my opinion, from your description, I would be inclined to agree with your physician. Again, re-evaluation would identify the causative factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I just spent a wonderful eight days in the  hospital , and might have to go back . Turns out after 3 ultro sounds, and one final ct scan with imaging medicine taken... they have finally found what is been hurting me for the past 7 months. One Doctor felt the lump that i had felt and said it was a lyphnode and may have been iritated due to shaving. Another said it may be just scar tisuee from my c section. And another just wasn't sure until they finalu  found i have a small 1 cm solid mass growing in  my left abdominal wall. They took samples through a needle in my stomache I  may have it  removed depending on what they find the from the samples they sent to the lab. So If you have pain and get an ultra sound KnoW  that they have two types of wands...one for deep imaging and one for closer under the wall of your stomache . That is why mine kept on being missed they where looking to deep and not with the right wand!  Willl post what it was soon.... Thanks and best of luck to all that read this.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been experiencing Persistant Sexual arousal for a few months now.  I am seeing someone who is attempting to treat me for Pudendal Nerve entrapment. This condition is horrible and I know it is very rare. I am on a support group with women who have this problem and there is 80 of us in the group.  I need to say that this condition is not Psychological and not what you would call 'sex drive' or 'libido'.  It is a problem in the gentials only and becomes very uncomfortable and debilitating at times.  It is basically the COMPLETE opposite of orgasmic/arousal disorder for women, in that there is TOO MUCh sensation down there, and it is not cleared with orgasm, in fact, orgasm can make the arousal worse.  Alot of us think it is a nerve problem and I personally think I have Pudendal nerve entrapment as do a few other women. One has been treated for it and she is fine now. Alot of the women have gotten this awful problem after withdrawl from an SSRI.  I have been reading up about female arousal and all the dynamics of this like blood flow, nerves etc which neurotransmitters control what in this region and am trying to figure out what has gone so wrong.  I was wondering what your opinion on this matter is, and perhaps you can explain the dynamics of this area, like how arousal works and what could be possible causes or what could of gone hyperactive down there or something to cause this.  I know it must have something to do with nerve endings going crazy and too much blood flow. It is the most awful distracting problem in the whole world and it actualy puts you off sex cos you don't want to stimulate something that feels already over-stimulated.  At times it feels like I am on verge of orgasm without any stimulation, like I said its horrible and is only just being recognised as a medical condition.  It takes over your life.  thanks Helen\n\n",

    "title": "Persistant Sexual Arousal Syndrome",
    "content": "I began suffering from persistant sexual arousal about 6 days ago.  I am a 52 year old woman recovering from a West Nile Virus infection in Aug 05.  I have been having all sorts of aches and pains in legs, arms and back.  I'm extremely tired all the time.  I recently (Janurary 12) had a colonoscopy done for hemmorids and three were banned.  After the colonoscopy I had terrible pain in my rectum and vagina.  The pain in my vagina has ceased but I still have rectum pain just before and after bowl movements.  I called the neurologist that is currently seeking to find the cause of the continued muscle pain and tiredness, plus dizziness and blurred vision that has continued since Aug 05.  She stated she doesn't know why this is happening, asked if I was feeling manic (I am not mentally ill) and suggested I take three lorazapam's daily.  I called the colonoscopy doctor to ask if this could be related to the banning he did, and am awaiting a return call from him.   I also called a gynocologist and made an appointment.   The only information I could find online about Persistant Sexual Arousal was an article by a Sandra R. Leiblum, PhD with Sharon G. Nathan, PhD.  In this article they sited that this is a new problem with no known exact cause.  Some of the treatments that physicans used to treat various women, case histories, and outcomes.  It points out the difference between Persistant Sexual Arousal Syndrome \"PSAS\" and hypersexuality.  It says and I quote \"The prevelance of PSAS is unknown, though it may be more common than supported because many women may be too embarrassed to report the complaint to their pysicians.  As indicated, the authors have spoken with some affected women who are not troubled by the feelings of spontaneous arousal, except when they persist unabated for weeks.  Physician inquiry can be helpful in identifying the prevalence of this phenomenon and validating the patient's experience as genuine, disturbing, and not \"all in her head\".  Such complaints must be taken seriously if physicians are to identify the causes, sustaining factors, and therapies for this perplexing problem.\"    I had read another article, can't recall who wrote it, but it talks about the use of a chemical to cause cows to come into heat and that the chemical may be getting into the dairy products we are consuming.  So, I am going to stop all diary for awhile.  And just when we women were increasing dairy in our diets to fight osteoporisis.    I don't know what caused this, but it is driving me crazy.  At first I tried to masturbate, but that didn't help.  Nothing seems to calm the feeling that I am on the verge of an orgasim constantly.  My breathing and heart rate are increased and my legs feel weak.  It is very distracting, and uncomfortable.  The only time it's not bothering me is when I'm sleeping, and now that I'm taking the lorazepam 3x's a day, I'm doing a lot more sleeping than before, but I seriously doubt that this is something I can keep up with.  There has to be an answer out there somewhere.  If anyone has any information, please pass it on.  Thank you, glowhite\n\n",

    "content": "I am a female age 69 in May, hyster at 43, altenol, altace,zocor 25 mg. zoloft, hydroch.(water pill). Happily married for 47 years to a man I adore. Sex life fantastic. Sex probably at least 12 times a week for 45 minute each time to 1 hour.  In May of this year on a vacation during a wonderful sexual encounter with my husband I ejaculated.  I had never done this before. It was wonderful. I was scared and thought this was peeing. After I did this a few more time trying to hold it back I went to OB-GYN. They treated my for incontient not believing that a female of my age could ejculate. Sent me to an Urologist. To make matters short I was told to hold the urine in using the kegal muscles instead of letting it out.  All this time I wanted to ejaculate and this did hurt holding it in.  I ejaculate between one quarter cup to one half cup each time.  Soak the bed. THis has nothing to do with my problem.  I remained sexual and sexually alive with my husband. Became hotter each day and more uninhibited and just such a change in me. Finally I did have a doctor whom I talked to long distance that said I could be ejaculating. With that I let it lose and what wonderful pleasures.  This has been going on since it started but really much now.  In September I started taking estring vaginally because of the soreness from too much sex. This has helped a lot and have it put in every three months by GYN.  I have noticed starting in June and getting stronger that in the area of my G-Spot it is so highly aroused and needs either manually stimulation, by my husband or a vibrator. This has gotten stronger.  I, in the morning look forward to spooning with my husband as the friction of his penis against my G-Spot will send me to the stars.  I need this like I need water.  During the day at least 10 to 12 I feel the desire for his penis in me and would love it.  I give him oral sex a lot and enjoy everyting about sex. I have changed to such a erotic, animal like and uninhibited, sexual woman since this happened and continue like this.  My husband adores this.  Being as sexual as I am I have been able to completely change him since July (this took me a good two months) off Viagra and my manual stimulation of his penis plus oral both morning and night have turned him completely around so that he can have sex sometimes three times in a day and is able to govern when he ejaculates.  I am this sexual I can do this.  My question being Do I have Persistant Sexual Arousal? I am sorry for the long letter but had to bring everything out.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 yr old woman, about a month ago I was experiencing lower right abdominal pains. The doctor, after taking a urine test diagnosed it as a UTI - the medication she gave me, she said was safe for pregnant women ( @ that time I had just gotten off of birth control and had unprotected sex- the doctor said that there might have been a possibility that i was pregnant). I took the medication along with medicine to \" have a period\" ( right after I got off the birthcontrol, my period was over 3wks late) so the doctor gave me medicine so that I could have it. So I took the medications, I ended up getting my period a day after I  visited the doctor..... but now my pains are back ( lower right abdomen pain), havent gotten my period yet( few days late) and am extremely worried. Is the UTI back?? I feel like I go to the bathroom often and when I do pee it's very little, I also feel like i'm bloated. The pain is uncomfortable, I need to sit or lay down when it hurts and it's terrible during sex. - i'm not on any medications right now Please help,  Isabel\n\n",

    "title": "Extreme Yeast or STD?",
    "content": "I am unfamilar with vaginal discharge and mine changes every month!!  I am soo worried.    HISTORY within 5 years ago (1 bf):  I did take antibotics 3 years ago.  And ate half a anitibotics prescription about 2 years ago (bad choice, I know).  I finished about 2 packs of birth control, using it as morning after pills within the first  and third year.  3 years ago, I took Diflucan with my bf and it helped for a little while (can't remember).  During this history,  I occasionally get burning urination and painful intercourse.  But usually I get the thick discharge, itch (half the time), discomfort intercourse without the burn, and soreness after intercourse (went away after a few minutes).  My bf would get miniture red dots that form around the head of his penis & itch.  But it goes away the next day.  He is not circumsized but particular with washing after urination.  In order to deal this after the 3rd year, first I tried \"douching\" by water wetted cotton balls around my finger and cleaning inside.  Then with rock allum mixed with water wetted cotton balls (1st time getting white flat  tissue like bits, so I stopped).  Then dry cotton balls.  Since that didn't work, I completely stopped and only water cleansed after every urination on the outside.  From what I remembered, I think I then used over the counter Monistat to help my yeast infection (as I thought they were) and it does helped for a small period of time.  Then I realized that I was buying it for temporary relief when I saw that my \"yeast\" came back within 3 days after being \"cured.\"  I think by that time  I used Monistat 3-4 months in a row.  That made me feel really worried that I got some kind of illness.   So then on, I allowed my body to heal on its own.  So NOW (this year)  I just water cleanse on the outside.  Fortunately, I did get normal discharge for about 2-6days on healthy months if I was lucky.  On the other days of those months, I was usually \"dry\" and thick.  Also, had uncomfortable intercourse and soreness (not so much of itching).  He would get tiny red dots and itch on these \"other days.\"    A few confusing (occasional) discharge is clear uncooked egg white-like.. the one that when you crack open an uncooked egg and the part is the left over egg that kinda strings, hangs on the egg shell, & doesn't come off completely, kinda thick feel rather than liquid.    Another thing to keep in mind is that I have a whitish patch with slight rough texture on my cheek gum.  Is that a HIV symptom?  Perhaps my immune system is too low to fight yeast bacteria.  I already got tested negative but maybe they did it wrong.  RECENT Symptoms:  I have strange discharges, but my recent experience was a bit different than \"usual\" (exluding exceptions of past experience).  Last week, I had maybe 2-3 days of healthy discharge.  Then afterwards, I was dry but also noticed a small area around my vaginal lips that were rashlike to the touch.  Wasn't very itchy but could've been.  I told my bf but we had intercourse anyway.  He was itchy afterwards.  My urination wasn't quite burning but slightly discomforting.  The next day I was gone of the rash (dry period).  However, for my bf and for the first time ever, he had larger red bumps on the head of his penis than normal.  It was also sensitive rather than itch.  Poor thing.   :cry:   I was really worried he got herpes.  I did oral occasionally before (not much to avoid spreading yeast infection) but they didn't cause anything, so why now and how??  This time they weren't minitures that you had to look up close.  This time they were still considered small but big enough to be clearly visible... More reddish than before that were pinkish red.  Then the very next day he was healed.  Phewww.  He concluded that it's because he'd was pulling on his penis and might've caused blood to rush into the capillaries.  Thus, it was like before but bigger.  I think he was still sensitive but he didn't want to tell me to make me sad.    Then the next day (yesterday), I saw that I got a somewhat profused amount of what is similar to cooked egg white bits or tissue.  These were somewhat similar to when I first used water with rock allum except chucky instead of flat tissue.  They were thick and not creamy.  Like chopping lightly cooked whites of eggs.  The lips of my vagina was somewhat itchy or irritated.  Question: What do I have now??  Why do I keep on being healthy for one moment and get yeast so quickly the next?   It's so frustrating.  I also considered maybe masterbation causing my yeast because of the temperature increase for bacteria.  What types of infections do I have to cause unusual discharge??  Am I normal??  What about my bf?  Is he bringing back my yeast infection?  Do I have something more extreme than a yeast infection?  Thank you soo much for reading my longgg post.   I thought maybe background info helps.\n\n",

It's fully opaque, creamy, and light yellow (Overall discharge is dry).  My bf is healing but hasn't fully.  Since then, the bumps been gone but he's been feeling somewhat a rashlike feel (by touch).  Meaning.. for both of us.. if we don't touch it, we'll feel okay.  However, if we do, we want to scratch or rub it.   Isn't yeast infections suppose to come only once or twice a year??  Mine is more recurring and seem to never be healed for anymore than a week long.\n\n",

One observation I have made is that the egg white discharge you are describing is the discharge you get when you ovulate but above all I STRONGLY URGE YOU to have saught or are seaking an ob/gyn. You should have seen one when it first happened after not being curred from the Overthe counter monistat. You don't want to wait on that sort of stuff because you can potentially if it is an STD make yourself andyour bf sterile especially if its been untreated for months.  And to top it off most people don't even receive symptoms so consider yourself lucky. I am not saying you have an STD but it sure sounds like it.  You should both be receiving physicals at least yearly when you are sexually active and be given STD screening.  I hope everything works out for you too  best luck\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I didn't know where to put this post so please bear with me.  Anyway about a week now my girlfriend has been getting pain in her lower abdomen; twice during intercourse and now a couple times after intercourse. She always claims that it doesn't hurt that bad, but the face she makes is driving me crazy with worry.   After a good while she's back to herself, but right after intercourse it seems to me like she's in extreme pain.  I don't know what it's going on with her, I love her so much, and I hate seeing her in so much pain.  My Girlfriend is 21, and is always in good health. If it helps, she recently went off Birth-control pills 'cause we're trying to have a baby... could that be a side effect?  Does anyone have any thoughts about this... Please I'm open to any theories, suggestions, anything.

The vagina is designed to have painless intercourse and when it is painful that is the body's way of indicating there is a problem. It could be as simple as a bacterial infection or more complicated as an STD.  Have her if not already make and appointment with her ob/gyn immediately...don't allow this to persists and do not have intercourse with her until you have confirmed the problem solved.  I hope you follow this advice  Best of luck\n\n",

Absence of menses can have many different reasons besides being pregnant.  Some beign, such as body weight or body fat to muscle ratio.  Are you very thin, or are you athletic?  There are some not so beign reasons as that probably a visit to the doctor would be an excellent idea to rule anything else out.    As far as breaking out with shaving out try shaving in the direction of hair growth, use a brand new razor each time, and try scrubbing the area with an antibacterial soap, prior to shaving.  See if that helps.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

I did some research and found that the tailbone controlls your sexdrive and do not know what i can do to help. Is it to late to fix a tailbone that has been broken for years?

    "content": "I think you are describing your problem better than hers.  How old are you and how long have you known her?  Does she like being affectionate with you, and more important perhaps, do you like being affectionate to her?  Take that as having little to do with being sexually aroused.  The tail bone (coccyx) rarely has anything to do with sex, and never anything to do with sex drive.  If you had a high sex drive the worst coccyx pain could do is distract you, or frustrate you, but you would find something else to do sexual that did not aggravate the pain.  The coccyx is unlikely to be damaged severely enough to make surgery helpful after years.  I suggest you take the most interest in the forms of interest that she shows in you, and how she expresses them.  She would not likely say she has no sex drive.  Not being interested at any time is not the same as having no drive.  Be a better listener, and try to understand a) if she thinks she has any problem at all, and how she describes it, b) what her priorities are in how the two of you express your feelings towards each other, and c) if she likes touching and being touched, find out most about where and how and when she wants to be touched.  You have much more to learn about her and her mind than her tailbone.    If you think I am way off on my guesses, then describe more about how she describes the problem.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry I misjudged you.  It is important that you say that \"She gets \"horrny\" but when we have sex she says she cant feel anything.\"  It sounds like her sex drive works, but since she can't satisfy it due to lack of feeling, she has given up.  I think whoever sees her for gyn exams should consider referring her to a neurologist to see if there was any correctable damage to a nerve that leaves the spine just above the coccyx.  The pudendal nerve is one of these, and it is involved with feeling in the area of the clitoris and vagina.  Surgery on or near the spine can be complicated.  Some people instead see a chiropractor who may have a non-surgical way of restoring function of nerves.   If masturbation feels good, then the nerves probably don't have a problem, and she could teach you more about what feels good.  There are various related conditions, none of which I am expert on, but you might want to read about them: http://www.ppodsyndrome.com/ http://www.caudaequina.org/definition.html\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend has been taking Lexapro (antidepressant) for 4-5 years. Our sex life started alright, but for the last 2-3 months, he has had no sex drive whatsoever. He insists that there is no one else, no porn or masturbation being substituted, he just has no sexual drive right now. He's a bit frustrated, but not willing to do much about it.  I, on the other hand, have a libido through the roof, so the lack of any response from him is quite frustrating. Is there anything I can do to kick-start his libido and lessen mine a bit? I'm in need of some solution as a relationship without the sex is simply just a friendship. We want to get married and have children, but I'm not too sure I want to be involved with someone that has no desire whatsover.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lexapro (Escitalopram) an active isomer of citalopram is a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI).  Although loss of erectile or ejaculatory function in men and loss of libido and anorgasmia in both sexes may be complications of virtually any antidepressant medication, these side effects appear to be more common with SSRIs.   The psychiatrist should ascertain whether the sexual dysfunction is a result of the antidepressant medication or the underlying major depressive disorder. If sexual dysfunction is determined to be a side effect of the antidepressant medication, a variety of strategies are available, including continuing treatment to assess whether the dysfunction will disappear with time, lowering the dose, discontinuing the antidepressant, or substituting another antidepressant such as bupropion (Wellbutrin).[1]  Specific pharmacologic treatments that can be added for arousal or erectile dysfunction include sildenafil, yohimbine, or neostigmine; specific medications that can be added for orgasm dysfunction include sildenafil, cyproheptadine, or amantadine.[2]  Your boyfriend needs to be evaluated by his psychiatrist, it may be a manifestation of his worsening depression or he may need to shift to another form of treatment. You on the other hand should do nothing to decrease your drive.  References: ========= 1.

    "title": "I can't be alone on this...",
    "content": "WOO HOO!!  First post!  Finally, a category for female sexual disorders!  I was a little offended when I first joined and saw that there was a category for men's sexual disorders but not women's when female sexual disorders are supposed to affect over 1/2 the population of women!  That being said, I know I can't be alone here.  I am 29 yrs. old and I don't EVER feel like having sex!  I mean EVER!  It is driving my husband crazy and I am so afraid of losing him over our miserable sex life.  I thought women were supposed to be at their peak around 30?  So why has my libido become nonexistent over the past five years?  At first I thought it was all in my head.  I went to a therapist but that was a waste of money!  I am a very anxious person and I always worry too much about things so there are all kinds of reasons that pop into my head for why my sex drive has decreased but really, it all boils down to \"I just don't understand!\"    I quit taking anti-depressants.  I now only take 1 mg of Xanax every night do that I can sleep through the night.  I have been on birth control since I was 16, but does birth control really make your sex drive disappear all of  sudden?  I was a little \"hornball\" in college and I was on birth control then, so it can't be the birth control.   The only other medication I am on is Phentermine but my libido disappeared way before that.  The only over-the-counter meds I take is Naproxen for pain and headaches, and I don't take any vitamins or supplements.  I wasn't abused as a child.  I had a bad experience with a boyfriend in high school and one after college but I was never actually raped.  I was always skinny in high school and college and never really had low self-esteem but I wasn't overly confident either.  I'm not so skinny anymore, hence the Phentermine, but my husband doesn't seem to mind that I am a little overweight.  My weight bothers me but I don't really think it's the reason I don't want to have sex.  I am only about 20 pounds overweight so it's not like I am morbidly obese or anything.  I am actually pretty happy about the fact that I've lost 35 pounds in the past six months!!  My husband is a wonderful man and always tells me I am beautiful, etc.  He always tries to make me feel desired and when we do have sex, it's not like it's bad or anything.  I have to work at it to reach orgasm but our sex is pretty good.  I guess what I don't understand the most is why I physically never have the urge to have sex.  For lack of a better word...I never get \"horny\".  I would rather get a good night's sleep than have sex.  Everytime my husand even tries to \"get me in the mood\", I just feel annoyed.    Most women like it when their husband's kiss them all over and start to get \"gropey\".  But I just feel irritated and want him to stop.  It's like when you little brother or sister keeps poking you or something and you just want to yell at them to \"stop touching me!!!\"    It takes an act of Congress just to talk myself into just giving in and having sex so that I can just get it over with.  It feels good when we are doing it but in the back of my head, I am thinking \"wonder how long this is going to take?\"  And I am always dry!  And if by some slim chance I'm not horribly dry to start with, I am in five minutes.  And I hate it when his semen gets all over me!  That slimey sticky mess all over the place is the worst.  Why am I so bothered by all this?  I don't understand why I don't ever want to have sex!!!      I apologize for the length of this message but I am hoping that someone will take the time to read it - - and feel the same way as I do!\n\n",

    "content": "You are right - female sexual dysfunction (FDS) is very overlooked and discounted as psychological.  It is not normal for you to have a lack of desire so suddenly.  The first thing to look at obviously, is hormones.  The major culprit in younger women is usually the pill.  Yes, I have seen it affect many women even after they have taken it for years, so it could still be the problem, the worst offender being the depo shot.  How the pill works: it introduces synthetic hormones in your body to stop ovulation, mainly progesterone.  Progesterone suppresses the free testosterone in your system.  Testosterone is the sole hormone that causes desire, not estrogen.  Estrogen helps lubrication, but on the pill,  it doesn't work as well as natural hormones, so dryness is often a problem.  You also aren't quite as aroused as you normally would be, and that affects lubrication also.  Talk to your doctor about going off the pill and you will probably see a big difference  in drive, but give it a few weeks, it takes time for your body to fully produce it's own hormones again.  There are other options for birth control besides condoms; discuss with your doctor a diaphragm, the sponge or an IUD.  I wish you the best!\n\n",

    "title": "I don't want to discontinue the pill...",
    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply!!!!!  Yours is the first reply I've gotten to any of my posts on this website!  I thought about going off the pill to see if that would help but I REALLY don't want to.  Reason 1 - I DON'T want to get pregnant now or in the near future.  I hate condoms as they always seem to break and are just more trouble than they are worth.  All the other birth control methods are out of the question for me. Reason 2 - before the pill, my periods were very irregular and heavy.  Not too long after I began menstrating, my doc found a cyst inside my right ovary.  He put me on the pill to try to shrink the cyst and to help make me a little more regular.  (Didn't shrink the cyst and I ended up having my right ovary taken out at 17 but I do however thoroughly enjoy being regular!).  I'm afraid if I go off the pill I'll be back to my usual irregular cycle.  No thank you!  I know going off the pill could possibly stop a lot of side effects that could be associated with the pill but I've thought about it long and hard and I really don't want to stop the pill.  There has got to be something else I can try.  My GYN suggested Avlimil but stressed that he didn't really know much about it but he's heard good thing about it.  He said I could certainly try it if I wanted to but to keep an out for side effects.  I ordered it but I am too scared to take it.  What if it counteracts the birth control?  When I first ordered it and researched it, I couldn't find anything saying it would but I couldn't really find anything that said it woudn't either.  Now I am on other medications (Xanax and Phentermine and Naproxen) and I don't want it to mess with those either.  I guess I am just scared to take something that my doctor can't tell me is 100% safe for me.  I have recently thought about having my hormones checked.  A good friend of mine who is in her mid-40's and just went through a radical mastectomy and recontruction suggested it.  We talked about early menopause that can occur for various reasons and she was telling me about her problems because of the radiation she underwent.  I go back to see my GYN August 30 and I am thinking about asking him to check my hormone levels.  This decreased sex drive has been going on for several years and not getting any better.  It's just a blood test right?  I think I can handle giving up a little blood (since it appears that I can't handle giving up \"a piece of a%^\"!!!)  I am also in the middle of trying to find out if I have some sort of autoimmune disorder.  I have been having joint pain all over my body but most severe in my ankles with lots of pain, swelling and discoloration in my ankles.  I have a follow up with my ortho on June 30 and I think he's just going to refer me to a rheumatologist since the antiinflammatorys he prescribed aren't really helping now that I've completed the steroid pack.  Don't some autoimmune diseases cause decreased sex drive?  This is so frustrating.  I feel like I am falling apart and I'm not even 30 yet!!!!!\n\n",

There are a lot of foods which can change your sex drive and hydration also has a great factor.  There are a lot of women out there feeling like you do, and I think some change in lifestyle can be helpful in some cases, of course as I said, I am not doctor, but it's something to consider.\n\n",

    "content": "I don't disagree with any suggestions but thought I would like to add my opinions.  First, I would get more advice on possible negative side effects of two of you medications, Xanax and Phentermine.  An article I looked at said that 6% of Xanax patients had decreased libido, vs. only 2% of the people taking a placebo.  Lots of SSRI's can interfere with interest in sex.  Phenteramine also may affect interest one way or the other.  I am suspicious that your Gyn would think of recommending Avlimil.  There are no clinical studies, but companies making a lot of money from it because as an herbal it does not need to be licensed.  As a mixture of herbals, it is very hard to compare to what herbals other people are using.  I think he is stumped and doesnt have the time or training to do more time consuming counselling.  Your personality (you mention worrying a lot), and your having had more neutral or stressful sex occasions than rewarding ones, makes me think that the two of you should have gradual goals around helping each other feel good.  If a couples therapist is not a good option for you, I think you could find some couples workbooks that might have some helpful ideas.  I think you should not try very often to have pleasurable sex on short notice, I think in the short term you should be more creative and see if you can have some physical activities together that are sensuous (massages for example). Suggest to your husband you would like first to relax more around being physical and maybe work on the sex itself more in a later month.  Or treat him to something he finds arousing other than the usual sex, if there is something that will not make you anxious.  If you have a body image problem, perhaps you could find ways to discuss it in a way that gets you compliments more than raising you anxiety.  What does he most like about your body, that is easiest for you to listen to and believe as a compliment?  Try to get him to compliment you more in a way you can believe, and help you feel desirable.  Also, what clothes and environment make you feel most comfortable when you are having some romantic times?  By romantic, I mean work most on what you enjoy doing together, and less on the mechanics of sex.  Any of this sound workable and appealing?\n\n",

You may try Warm Moist Compresses to the area which will help to ease discomfort and also help to \"pop\" this on it's own.

    "title": "Red Bumps under pubic hair(woman)",
    "content": "Hi     I've been doing some research on the internet about red raised bumps above the vagina pubic bone, under the hair and never seem to find a clear answer. Maby you can help Well Im 24. I only have had one sextual partner. I've been having sex with him for about 2 years. Its great. One day I saw a small litte red bump on the inside of my thigh, of course i scrached it and it looked like this little bump filled with blood. So I though it sort of looks normal and it doesnt hurt. 2 months after I saw the same bump just were my pubic hairline starts from the belly....it didnt hurt and didnt bother me so I left it. Then another, then another.....i have like 8 now and none of them hurt. The other day one made a little scab and it came of(like a small bruse that is healing) .....and simularly to a pimple it started bleedling a little. After 2 minutes it stopped and when i feel the little bump over my panties I don't feel anything where as before I felt the little bump. So now Im thinking it might be a pimple. The others don't look like pimples though? I don't know. I have a medium fair skin and have 0 pimples on my face. But I have been going to the tanning salon often lately, but stopped about a month ago. My husband doesnt have any and he says he doesnt think it is serious but if it bothers me i should go check it out. Im immigrating so I don't have any medical back up and it will cost me a lot just to see the doctor about small little bumps that mean nothing. I wanted to send you pictures but but there is no where I can upload it. What can you tell me. Doesnt itch. Doensnt pus. Doesnt burn. Its just there. Thanks for taking the time to read this. I would truely appretiate your help. Regards Yogibird\n\n",

    "title": "Genital wart?",
    "content": "Hi!  Either way, I do not believe you have anything to worry acutely, until your immigrant status proceeds to allow you medical benifits. The probable cause of your bumps could be many, of which, the salient ones are mentioned here.  ****Genital warts or Condyloma acuminatum:   This is a viral disease (Human Papilloma Virus, HPV) spread by sexual contact. The highest rates of genital HPV infection are found in sexually active women younger than 25 years, even after correcting for the number of lifetime sexual partners. It is often NOT symptomatic.   Patients who present with condyloma acuminata do not necessarily need other laboratory studies; however, patients who are diagnosed with condyloma are at an increased risk for other sexually transmitted diseases. Consider testing for chlamydia, gonorrhea, syphilis, hepatitis B, hepatitis C, and HIV if you doubt so. You will also need a Papanicolaou (Pap) test of the cervix if a Pap test has not been performed in the last 12 months. This test is nothing but a mild scraping of cells from the cervix to check for more morbid pathologies.  For most patients, medical therapy should be the first option. The different medical treatment modalities can by performed in the physician's office or at home. Morbidity is low. Surgery should be reserved to treat condyloma resistant to medical therapy. Most patients should not need surgical therapy unless the condylomatous lesions are too large to treat medically or if the lesions would interfere with an abdominal delivery.  Because genital warts are sexually transmitted, the risk of acquiring HPV primarily is dependent on several factors related to sexual activity. These factors include the number of sexual partners, frequency of sexual intercourse, and the presence of genital warts on the sexual partners. Latex condoms offer some, but not complete, protection in the transmission of HPV. Women should avoid skin-to-skin contact with partners if genital warts are visible  The major complication from exposure of the vulva, vagina, or cervix to HPV is the development of dysplasia, which could be called the microscopic sign of impending cancer. But, this again would depend on the type of the virus involved.  The prognosis of immunocompetent women diagnosed with condyloma acuminata is excellent. HPV infections are transient in the vast majority of these women. Unless the woman constantly is exposed to different HPV types, the infection eventually abates when the host immune system stops viral replication.  ****Molluscum contagiosum:  This is another viral disease, which is self-limited in immunocompetent individuals, with no long-term complications or sequelae. Affected adults who are otherwise healthy uniformly are sexually active but may not know that their partners are affected. Having multiple sexual partners increases the risk of infection; the frequency of unprotected sex increases the risk of transmission.  The incidence in men reportedly is greater than in women.   In adults who are immunocompetent, lesions usually are found on the genitalia, lower abdomen, inner upper thighs, and/or buttocks. The average duration of an untreated lesion is 6-9 months but may be as long as 5 years.  The course of MC usually is self-limited, and lesions generally heal without scarring.   Intervention may be indicated if lesions persist. Therapeutic modalities include topical application of a variety of medications, radiation therapy, and/or surgery. Each technique might result in scarring or postinflammatory pigmentary changes. Frequently, multiple treatment sessions are necessary due to recurrence of treated lesions and/or the appearance of new lesions by autoinoculation. The benefit of therapy must exceed the risk.   **** At the end of the day, it would be your dermatologist who will decide upon your diagnosis and management. Meanwhile, I hope this mail has helped to allay any fear.  Bye!  -Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, a penis goes in the same place as a tampon. The reason you think this can't be possible because a tampon can be so tricky to get in is because you are a virgin. Your vaginal canal is very small, and you probably still have an intact hymen.  When having sex, the vaginal walls stretch, and become larger.  When the time comes, you will be able to have sex, so don't be worried about that. You can practice with a vibrator if you wish, but it isn't nesessary.   Also please remember when you decide it is time to lose your vigrinity if you aren't prepared to have children yet,, make sure to use protection or birth control. Pregnancy can happen even the first time.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with Gracie01.  The penis and tampon does go in the same place and the skin will stretch accordingly.  However, my best advice is not to start putting things into your vagina because it's the stepping stones toward having sex.  How?  Because of curiosity and because sometimes our minds makes us do things we wouldn't do, thinking back years from now.  Having sex is a big responsibility.  Not only could you get pregnant and get STD's but also it takes a bigger part of u.. your spirit and heart.  Because I sense you are uncertain about having sex, I want to leave you one last advice.  Don't use sex to prove love or make a person stay with you.  =)\n\n",

    "content": "Your suspicions may be right - Genital warts- caused by the human papillomavirus (or HPV)  usually appear as soft, moist, pink, or flesh-colored swellings, usually in the genital area. They can be raised or flat, single or multiple, small or large, and sometimes shaped like cauliflower. They can appear on the vulva, in or around the vagina or anus, on the cervix, and on the penis, scrotum, groin, or thigh. Typically, the warts are diagnosed by a visual inspection.  Treatments are usually medications applied to visible warts or possilbe revoval or visible warts - while there is no cure, it usually disappears in time in most women.  The main thing you need to be concerned with is the link between HPV and cancer.  Cervical cancer has been linked to HPV virus. My advice is to see your Gynecologist ASAP.  Make sure you get a pap smear and continue to get follow-up pap smears.  Early detection is lifesaving. In the mean time, make sure you are taking all of the proper precautions during sexual activity, as HPV is a sexually transmitted disease (STD) that can easily be spead.  By the way, men can get it too.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, To answer your question regarding the disadvantages of anal sex, the following complications have been reported:  Rectosigmoid tears (a tear in the rectum) may result from foreign body insertion, fisting, or vigorous anal intercourse.  Allergic proctitis (an inflammation of the rectum) is secondary to lubricants and douches, especially when scented or colored products are used. Patients are advised to discontinue use of products if allergic reactions occur.  Some people report severe pain following anal sex and are not comfortable doing it. Sexually transmitted diseases can also attack via anal sex, hence the use of condoms is essential. The penis should be washed with soap after anal sex and prior to insertion in the vagina.  Best regards,\n\n",

It sounds like it may possibly be too high a dose for you;  you should  be feeling an increase in desire but not to the extent you describe.  It can take several weeks for the testosterone to start working, it doesn't work right away.  DHEA isn't responsible for sex drive.    Testosterone can masculinize women at a very high dose; women only produce about 10% of the testosterone that men do, naturally.  You should contact your doctor about this, and let him know what is happening; it probably just needs to be adjusted.\n\n",

IF IT BURNS SHE IS PROBABLY ELERGIC TO YOUR SEMEN BUT A DOCTOR CAN TELL YOU THAT. AND IF YOU USE CONDOMS SHE CAN BE ALERGIC TO THE LATEX ON THE CONDOMS.\n\n",

    "title": "Oversized Labia Minora",
    "content": "I'm 15 and one of my inner labias is about three times the size of the other. However, this wasn't always so. It started about 2 years ago when I started masturbating with the showerhead. (Could this be the cause of it?) Anyway, I figured it was just swollen, and the swelling would go down. However, as time went on, it only got worse. It's now a more purple-ish, darker color, and bigger. Anyways, point being, instead of it getting better like I assumed it would, it only got worse. And it's now two years later, and I haven't told anyone about it. I would really like to, but I am too embarrassed. Also, I'm afraid if my parents take me to a gynocologist or anything of that sort, they will find out I'm not a virgin anymore, WHICH CAN NOT HAPPEN. I've been a huge emotional wreck ever since, and I really need to find out more about this. Any advice, information, help, or ideas would be SO greatly appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there  just letting you know, even though I am not a doctor, I have exactly the same condition. One of my libia minora is much larger than the other. It is also a purpleish colour. I went to the gyno for suggestions on removal. They can operate to remove it. They said it will be a quick cut, nothing too serious. I think they use lazer surgery so it heals and everything. I am only 18 so I have to wait a while to go through with the operation. However, I have only just gotten over my depression and worries about such a small issue.  Since you are only 15, I think your parent has to be with you during your gyno appt. I went with my mother. don't WORRY, They cannot tell your mother or father that you are not a virgin! It is a privacy thing. Also, when you go into the rooom to be looked at, you will be with the doctor and they ask if you wish your parent to be present. Just say you don't feel comfortable with it, they will understand.   It is a bit of relief to hear someone else who has the same trouble as I do.  thought no one else had it, I thought i was alone. So when I saw your post, I thought I would offer you some advice and support. Hope what I suggested helps you get through this hard time in your life. I know how hard this can be! Just don't worry, you will be fine. tell me how everythng goes!  Sarah\n\n",

There is cosmetic surgery to change the appearance if you are unhappy with the way they look.   Being that you are 15, the reason you have noticed this change recently is because of puberty. Your body is maturing and changing. It isn't from masturbating.  It would be a good idea to go to a gynecologist now, if you are not a virgin, because you need to have anual pap smears. Also, while yoru there, you can address any concerns you have. The doctor cannot tell your parents any medical information without your permission.\n\n",

We have been discussing the possibility of marriage, but there are definitely issues that need to be worked out in our relationship before we move on to the next step.  And the primary one is my lack of sex drive.  I have absolutely no libido.  I don\u2019t think about sex, and even when my lover expresses his deep desire to engage sexually, I instantly withdraw.  I understand even while I\u2019m in the moment that this is a problem, yet I can\u2019t seem to be able to give in solely because he wants, and needs it.  To be honest, it is ruining our relationship.  I feel horrible that I can\u2019t be in the mood, and I know he feels that I no longer find him attractive.  I also feel that I cannot seek medical supplements to help this issue.  I\u2019m twenty years old, and there is no reason for me to have this sort of problem so early in life.  I\u2019m afraid to just be rejected by a doctor because of my age.    What can I do to increase my libido?  Should I seek help despite the odds of being turned away?  Will a doctor consider giving me a prescription for a libido enhancement?    This is tearing us apart.  Please help, and thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

I was molested as a child, however I had a healthy sex-drive until about a year and a half ago.    I was on birth control, but after hearing very similar mentions of what the pill can do to a woman\u2019s libido, I stopped taking them when my sex-drive died.  Currently, I\u2019m not on any birth control method, as I just don\u2019t have sex.  Is it possible that the pill  already  effected me to the point that I lack libido because of them, even after being off of it for so long?  Is there anything I can do to reverse the suppression?

I don't know how long it's been there. I just sort of stumbled across it one day.  I asked my gynocologist about it right away, and she said that it was probably just a lymph node.  Since then, (about two years) it hasn't increase or decreased in size. It hasn't been painful. I wouldn't even know it was there if I didn't feel for it.  but it bugs me that I can feel a lymph node on one side but I can't feel it on the other. Are our bodies symmetrical? If I can feel it on one side shouldn't I be able to feel it on the other side, and if not is it possible that this could be something else like a cyst or ovarian cancer? I'm convinced I'm dying and it' s probably making it worse.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi agobeil, Most commonly lymph nodes enlarge as a result of an infection because they are the bodies filtering system for bacteria/viruses. Their size may not return to their preinfectious state. Although lymph nodes are present in \"symmetrical\" areas, this does not necessarily mean that they enlarge in such a fashion. It was quite wise for you to bring this to the attention of your physician but in my opinion I would be much more concerned if there were continuing changes such as enlargement despite treatment etc. The fact that it has been present and unchanged for such an extended period of time would indicate that it is related to a benign or self limiting nature such as a past infection rather than being related to a cancerous condition. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

This can be something called Polycystic ovary...that's why you haven't had regular periods. And that's why he's putting you on pills to try and regulate it.   Tender breasts and discharge are normal because of the high progesteron content that your body is experiencing with pills. The pills mimic pregnancy that's why your period doesn't come while you're on them.  Ask your doctor why is he giving you the pills and what is his long term plan.  Polycystic ovaries are not dangerous...and alot of girls live with it,get married and have kids.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I have had a lot of experience with this.  The tender breasts are from the excess amount of ESTROGEN in your body not progesterone!  Tender breasts are a sign of estrogen dominance, and with Polycystic Ovarian Syndrome, the body does not produce enough Progesterone each month (hence the absent and irrgeular periods).  This fact means your body pumps out more estrogen and you get estrogen dominance.  If you are taking a combined pill (with estrogen and progesterone) its most likely only making the estrogen dominance wors, thats why you have sore breasts.  Its not good to have sore breasts like that. I know how it feels.  I have PCOS.  You need to balance out the estrogens effects in your body.  I take natural progesterone cream 20mg daily, this regulates my periods, gets rid of PMS, makes my periods lighter and less painful, and gets rid of the sore breasts straight away.  If you want the pill for contraception, I would suggest getting a pill with the lowest dose of estrogen possible and take evening primrose oil for the sore breasts.  The pill only masks the problems you get with PCOS, it  doesnt fix it. I was on it for 11 years (just to 'regulate' my periods) and I am still paying for it now with all the side effects it gave me.  If you use condoms and contraception pills arent a big deal for you, give the natural progesterone cream a go, it is awesome.  Even if you don't have PCOS it really works.  I am not making this up, I have been to hormone doctors who gave me this advice.  Believe me, the sore breasts are NOT from the high progesterone in your body - they are from too much ESTROGEN from the pill you are taking, plus the estrogen dominance you already had in your body (thats why you werent having regular periods).  Buy any book on hormones and it will say the same thing. A good book is \"what your doctor doesnt tell you about Pre-menopause\" by John Lee.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thank you Everafter for your  information...It's very helpful. About the progesterone cream...It's very effective indeed...Alot of women use it for hot flushes... sore breasts in an attempt to try and equalize the excess Estrogen effect with a low dose progesteron being absorbed via the skin thus minimizing its systemic effect.  The Evening promise oil is great as well...and you can add chamomile herbal tea that has a soothing effect .  I insist on the Pelvic ultrasound though...and don't forget to drink a lot of water before doing it so that your bladder can be full and the doctor can visualize both your ovaries clearly and you won't need a transvaginal ultrasound.  Best regards,\n\n",

The problem is, she has been on the pill for about 4 months, we have been sexually active, we've only ever had sexual experiences with each other, no history of STI's ect., everything has been fine.  Today, about 2 weeks into this months' pill cycle she had some bleeding, a reasonable amount, enough to cover her undies. She isn't meanth to get her period for another 2 weeks, we are really worried about what this could be!!  Espescially since we had sex 2 weeks ago, the night on which she took her FIRST pill of a cycle in the morning. I didn't know this was risky for possible pregnancy, but she then told me it is in the first 7 days of starting a new cycle of the pill.  Is this some sort of miscarriage?? Pregnancy related thing?? Help!  Please help us allay our fears, thankyou\n\n",

There have also been episodes where she has loss the ability to move her limbs or torso incompanied with the loss of breath. This subsides over 15 minutes or so. She also complains of tightness in chest, the feeling that her hands have fallen asleep and dizziness and even naseau in some cases while these episodes happen.

This concerns me since, I am a self-conscious person and, have no idea how big or small my penis is.  When it is erect it measures eight inches long, is this small? average? big?

    "content": "Dear problemgirl,  It depends on the way you shave and the direction if you are using shavers. If you are waxing...don't use the same wax strip again...You have to be very clean and antiseptic about shaving because you have a very sensitive skin.  I advice you to go and ask a beauty center about the best method for you to shave.  Regarding the red bumps and festers...they're due to contamination...somehow your hair follicles get infection and that's why they get red and then form pus.  A beauty center can be more helpful than a dermatologist in your condition for long term management. But ,Yes, an antibacterial is very benificial for the bumps...just make sure you're using the appropriate one.  Best regards,\n\n",

And he must trust you to tell you such a personal fantasy of his. Sexuality is a very complicated thing. From the time we are small we are told it is wrong and dirty to do certain things and then as adults we are told by other people that we should do these very things. Only you know what feels good to you. You say that doing this turns your stomach. Why? Is it only that you are shy and uncomfortable? Because if that is the case then I would encourage you to try it a few times. Perhaps you and your husband could work something ou :: i.e. you'll try it twice if he tries something for you (it could be sexual or cleaning the kitchen for a week). Or you could start slowly by having him touch you with your hand over his and then eventually take over. If you have honestly tried and you truly find it awful then talk to him about other fantasies-- yours and his and see what both of you are willing to try. Also, do you masturbate or fantasize by yourself, and how old are you?\n\n",

It doesn't hurt or anything. I haven't had sex  at all. I dunno how big it is my guess would be that it's close to the size of a golf ball, maybe a bit smaller. It's not really hard, but it's not soft either. I think it might have something to do with the stomach problems I am having. But as far as I know, I've been having my stomach problems long before that showed up. Could you possibly tell me what it is?\n\n",

Regarding your menstrual disturbance: two months of absent cycles may be a normal happening every now and then. Ofcourse your concern is related to the possibility of pregancy. Since your pregnancy tests came out negative repeatidly I would safely exclude that. If you do not get your cycles for another month (3 months in succession) then this is a condition referred to as amenorrhea (or absence of menses). You will then need to be investigated with a panel of hormone tests that would include (FSH, LH, TSH, Prolactin). These tests will in most cases determine where the problem is.   Of note is the fact that an important cause of amenorrhea is purely psychological. A psychological trauma can lead to a direct decrease in hormone levels from the brain (hypothalamus and pituitary).  My best to you,\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure if this is an obscure issue or not, but here's the deal:  I started dating my current girlfriend about a year ago, we were long distnace and  her life at the time was complicated by family issues, but our sexual and emotional relationship got off to a great, highly motivated start. Because the relationship was long distance  I didn't know how aweful she was handling her family situation, and she got really sick.  Later I found out she had taken a bottle of tylnol pm and had to go to the hospital because she had experienced kidney failure due to the over dose.  She got help and in time became more physically and mentally stable.   She had a kidney infection this winter after she moved to where I live, was treated and got better and she felt ill again in the spring and her kidney's were tested and came out totally healthy except for some minimal scarring. The doc at the time said she did have a UTI  which was untreated for a week or two. She did get antibiotic  treatment for the UTI, but her sex drive was pretty much depleted by all the infection in the nearby areas.  Now she's much healthier and happier, but she has no motivation to have sex.  She says it's a physical issue, that her vaginal area is sensative and sometimes painful to touch, there are no signs of infection,  just a chronic sensitivity and discomfort.  There were no red flags regarding STDs when she went to the gyn, and beyond her last UTI, she has had entirely healthy sexual fuctioning.   I am curious to know what the phsical issue could be, she is keeping well hydrated, but perhaps there is scarring there in the vaginal area? I know she is not using the physical ailment as an excuse to not have sex, there is a physical issue at hand but it doesn't seem to be a 'common issue' as I am not seeing any literature on any issues like her specific situation.   Does anyone have any insight?\n\n",

At first, we used condoms having sex....but then we thought they were more trouble because they didn't fit him right, and one even came off inside of me once....Recently, he's been enjaculating inside of me...completely in me. I'm so nervous that I'm pregnent. I told my mom we were having sex, because I want to go on birth control, but I hear people saying that it won't kill any sperm already alive inside of me. I'm wondering if thats true, and if it is, if there is ANYTHING i can ask my doctor for when I go there this week, like a type of day after pill that will kill the sperm and eggs if they happend to connect. Please, any help would be appreciated. I try to reserch it online but I can't find any information and none of my friends are doctors....And I want some sort of idea of what to say to my doctor, so any kind of help would be good, telling me what kind of options I have. If all else fails, I would get an abortion, which I REALLY don't believe in, but I can NOT have a baby, and ruin my life right now.  Thank you  -Paloma\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, From your description there probably is no problem to correct. Its normal for some females to have 'puffy' nipples. Even for some males! As you grow older your breasts shape and size may change. Obviously I am in no position to correctly assess your condition. I would recommend someone assess your condition. If there is no evidence of anything abnormal causing the swelling then you should learn to accept the way you look rather than how you should look according to what has been regarded as ideal or more fashionable. Plastic surgery remains a last resort. Whether or not your case deserves plastic surgery is something that is determined by your doctor.  Males who have puffy nipples are a different matter, however. There is another post that I have answered on the possible causes and cures for puffy nipples in males. You can view this post by clicking here!  Best regards,\n\n",

What is my problem? I did some research on the internet, I thought they are caused by KP, i bought a lot of KP products, but they dun seem to work for me? But then I dun think KP would make ur skin (other than the hair follicles) actually turn red/purple? The condition is even worse in winter. Please help!!

The area around my nipple leaks, when this happens it is very sore and the only thing I can do is put tissue on it.Then it dries. After this it sticks intself to whatever material it is touching. Removing this can draw blood and is extremely painful. Then it scabes over. Then eventually heals. After a while the process will start again. Its painful, I have been to the doctors to ask their advice and each time they have advised Hydrocortisone cream. I use, it helps a little but doesnt stop the problem, plus I can only use it for a maximum of 7 days. Im 19 and not pregnant, so that rules out those variations. I would really apprecaite any help or advice on this as my doctors have not been very useful and with Uni and work i cant find the time to visit them again. If u can help, let me know, thanks for reading this, T\n\n",

But lately I have been feeling like that I could do without the sex. I haven't felt sexual or had  any desire for sex in a long time. I don't keep the sex from my husband and he understands how I feel but I know it hurts him. I haven't felt horny or anything like that. I am not overweight, I am 5'0 and at 110 lbs. Me and my husband get along fine we are not a fighting couple so that can't be it. Can you please help me and tell me what I can do before it ruins me?\n\n",

    "content": "I am 27 years old. About 1 week ago I was having some vaginal irritation, and I thought that I had just scratched myself.  Then, last Friday my inguinal lymph nodes started swelling and getting sore, so I got a mirror and looked at my vaginal area, there appeared to be what looked like a canker sore (just like what you get in your mouth). So, on Sunday there seemed to be another sore near my rectum. I went to an Urgent Care clinic and the doctor told me that I had a yeast infection and vaginal and rectal fissures which had became infected causing my lymph nodes to swell. He said it did not look like herpes,  He gave me Keflex 500mg four times daily, diflucan, Terazol-7 and Bactroban cream to use. I have been using all this for 4 days and I am not much better, and now there is at least 3-4 more of these small canker sore looking sores......PLEASE HELP....I am in pain everytime I urinate, wipe, or have a bowel movement.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Karissa,  I am sorry to hear that you are in pain despite treatment and I know how painful it could be. For that reason, I want you to report as soon as possible to a genitourinary clinic for re-evaluation (and change of treatment if my suspicions are proved correct).  Your symptoms are very suggestive of genital herpes simplex, not candidiasis. For that reason, you have not responded to treatments prescribed for candidiasis and secondary bacterial infection.  *You have the classical signs of primary genital herpes infection :  *irritation *grouped and painful lesions on your vulvar and anal region. The lesions may present as ulcers, abrasions, or fissures *enlarged and tender inguinal lymph nodes *pain on urination or defaecation  Vulvovaginal candidiasis does not cause lymph node swelling.  Genital herpes is a sexually transmitted disease and the presence of one STD raises the possibility of another. Therefore, a full screen for STDs and partner notification may become necessary if the diagnosis is confirmed. Please keep me posted on this site or to my private box for further advice.  Thank you for contacting this website.    Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hypoactive sexual desire disorder is increasingly being recognized as the most common of all sexual disorders in both males and females. The problem is a very complex one with psychological problems being a direct cause of HSDD. Another potential cause that needs to be excluded is hormone imbalance (testosterone). This is a more curable cause. I would advise you to seek medical attention in order to run a few tests and exclude psychiatric depression. Depression in this case should be treated with an antidepressant that is not an SSRI (e.g. Bupropion hydrochloride), as other antidepressants can lead to drive suppression as a side effect.

I have what you would call a \"masculine\" body type for a female (Android), and I have tried everything to make my butt grow, but my fat always deposits around my stomach, and I'm not much of a body builder.  Would it be safe to take some kind of product with estrogen in it to make my fat deposit around my butt instead?  I have heard of some steroids that cause your body to release more estrogens,  and this seems like it would be the best way to get a larger backside other than plastic surgery.  The only side effects they mentioned were gynecopaeia or something like that, and of course moodiness and bloating, but that shouldn't have an effect on me since I'm a female right?  So is this a safe method?  Would it work?  If so,  do you have any suggestions for products I could use to get my body to release more estrogens?  Thank you!\n\n",

The vagina is a tube that opens to the outside air and when you douche, insert tampons or have sexual intercourse, air is automatically pushed inside.  For you to have an air embolism, the air would have to be introduced into the blood vessels where it would travel to an area that it could cause harm.  This can occur in divers who ascend to quickly, and during surgery and rarely during childbirth but I have never heard of it occuring any other way. I hope this helps you. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Air embolism",
    "content": "Dear Anit,  Even though it is rare, it is possible to have air embolism during sexual intercourse:  1. Especially if performed early after delivery, reason being, the blood vessels inside the uterus are still engorged to an extent and this makes it easier for air to get access to them and cause air embolism.  2. It could happen in the non-pregnant, but it is rare, reason being, that during sexual intercourse, the blood vessels of the vaginal wall become engorged and if a vaginal tear occurs and air is insufflated inside the vagina, this could lead to air escaping to the circulation and causing air embolism.  There are also very few reports also about air embolism happening during menstruation during sexual intercourse as well when the female takes a position known as the \"doggy position\".  The medical litterature only describes case reports of such occurrences, which means that this is something quite rare, i don't think you need to worry about it.

    "content": "I am having a problem with both of my breasts. I am a 23 year old female not currently taking ANY type of medication.  Last month, a few days before my period, I was experiencing nipple pain, and discharge when I squeezed on them.  I suspected that I had spontaneous leakage too at that time, but was unable to see it happen.  It seemed to go away with the start of my period, and I figured it was related to my cycle.  However, this past week, about 2 weeks after my period, the nipple discharge began again.  This time I did catch it leaking from both breasts at different times, spontaneously.  My breasts are also painful, and my nipples seem to be very sensitive and painful, and stay erect for long periods of time without stimulation.  My nipples are also very dry and cracked looking.  The liquid is usually clear, and very small amounts, only a drop or two.  A few times, out of one breast it was a white color.  I took a pregnancy test on Monday, 11/8/04 and it was negative.  I've never had any sort of breast pain or issues related to my period/monthly cycle.  What could be causing this?    Thanks!  EMG\n\n",

My period came, and then it was gone.  I thought maybe it was just some odd cycle thing.  But it came back about 2 weeks ago.  With more fluid leaking out, and coming out with out spontaneously.  I re took a pg test this Monday, a week after I originally took one.  It was negative as well.  Thanks for your help!  Love Liz\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Yeast infections cannot be cured by using a wash or douche. The problem with yeast infections is that they tend to reoccur.  The reason for this is usually because the persons sex partner reinfects the person.  That is why it is important for both partners to be treated at the same time.  Males usually do not have symptoms but they can reinfect their female partners after treatment because they still have the yeast fungi on them.  I believe there are now over the counter medications for yeast infections.  If these do not work, you need to see your doctor so he can prescribe a stronger medication for you.  The reason you have pain in the vagina is that the yeast fungi irritates the tissues of the vagina, causing redness, inflammation, itching and sometimes bleeding. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Honey you don't need a doctor for this answer.  After 35 years of marriage I feel qualified to answer. LOL  Men have glands that produce lubrication similiar to women.  They certainly can have discharge from these glands. It is not usually noticed very often because it is washed away with urine production.  However, with slight stimulus  of the penis you may notice a thin clear discharge without the penis being erect.  This is normal and nothing to worry about. However if the discharge is bloody or foul smelling, then this is a sign that there is something else going on such as an infection. The doctor may give you a more medical explanation later on.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

How long after intercourse do you have this odor and on days that you don't have intercourse do you still have this odor?  If it is only during and right after intercourse and you are monogamous I suggest  that your sexual partner may have an infection and is passing on the odor  of it to you.  Also if the odor is caused by your own fungal infection then if your sexual partner isn't treated for it at the same time you are treated then he can reinfect you during intercourse. I hope this helps. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

However, if the discharge has an odor or you have symptoms such as pain or itching you should see a doctor for treatment.  Unfortunately over the counter products for yeast infections do not always clear up the infection.  If you are sexually active and have a yeast (fungal)infection, you can spread it to your partner.  He may not show any symptoms but he can reinfect you during sexual intercourse. If this discharge lasts more than a few days you should consult a physician for treatment.

Even women who are regular can have an occasional late period due to stress, excessive exercise or illness. You can take an over-the-counter pregnancy test now as early as one week past the date you were due for your period to start.  However, rather than spend the money, I suggest you wait another week and see if you start your period. CmMerritt\n\n",

Even though, you have a clear cause of infertility, the workup will most probably conducted as usual, making sure that your partner does not have any problems, and that you don't have any other problems that could result in infertlity as well.  Regarding pain in the vulva during sex, you should be examined by your doctor to look for local causes like infected or inflammed cysts or others. You could have trauma and other causes. Endometriosis can sometime be occur in the vulva as well.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It was painful and my partner said I was extremely tight. This has me very worried and quite honestly am now afraid of what I will feel the next time. The watery blood lasted for the next day but my abdominal area feels very sore now. I awoke in the middle of the evening with extreme burning and am having a great deal of pain while voiding. Hot baths are only relieving it short term. The pain is so intense it feels like an infection, I assume this is normal being the first time but I am still very leery if this will be a reoccuring thing each time. Hopefully this will get better, but was just wondering if this is a common thing. I have heard that bladder and urinary tract infections are common at this time, so i imagine it is one of those. I have just started the Estrogen and am wondering if this will help with the situation. If anyone could help, I would be much appreciative.\n\n",

    "content": "HI,    I am a 30 year old, white female who was just diagnosed with mastitis. I know it isn't a big deal but I am a little confused. I came home and got online to get some more info and everything I read is directed toward breast feeding women. I haven't breast fed in over 7 years.....     I am a dog groomer and I quite often have to remove dog hairs that have made it through my clothing and are stuck in my nipples. They actually burrow into the skin. Is it possible that I missed a hair and that is what's causing the infection and if so are anibiotics going to take care of the infection if the hair is still in there?\n\n",

    "content": "ibanezjem, Good to see you here again! Now about mastitis its a common condition. Some are more susceptable than others especially if like you said they are breast feeding. If you noticed that dog hairs get stuck in your nipples, then more than likely you have found the causative agent. The problem is that the hair would innoculate bacteria into the breast and this would lead to the inflammation. Antibiotics will take care of it but you should be more careful like wearing more protective clothing while grooming them next time.  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "i am a 24 year old female recently married in feb 2004 ..from the very first sexual intercourse with my husband...we were't satisfied as we both felt that there was no tightness in my vaginal muscles..though i haven't had  sex before. n the penis size of my husband is a little below average.  Though in my medical history i have mentioned thati had irregular periods earlier and  mild polycystic disease of the ovaries was detected in 2000-2001. After consulting a gyn and getting my thyroxine test done it was found that my thyroid level was just above the normal level and was advised to take basic dosage of thyroxine (Thyronorm  50) after which my periods got regulated.. I am still taking the dosage n it has been about an year since i started taking it.  Is this sexual dissatisfaction due to thyroxine dosage intake ? if so then what should i do. stop taking thyronorm? who is better to consult regarding this nature of problem a GYN / SEXOLOGIST  This seems to be a great problem as every newly wed couple looks forward to this type of pleasure too..please help me..  regards\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nutsme2003,  It is not easy sometimes for inexperienced couples to experience sexual satisfaction.  The best way of action is to try and get sexual education so that you both understand what your roles are during the act and what is it that you need to do so that you can reach satisfaction. A sexologist would be a reasonable choice.  i don't think that thyroxine had any thing to do with your problem.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Most importantly however, my boyfriend and I have been having protected sex for about a month and recently we had sex for the first time without a condom (he was a virgin without STDs), afterwards I burned and bled a little for about 10 min. is that a big problem, its the first time it ever happened.  I was at the end of my period, but the blood was bright red, I don't think it was from my period.  Also, with or without a condom, upon penetration, I hurt a little, and after about 1 min. the pain goes away, is that just because I'm adjusting to the size?  Thanks, T\n\n",

    "content": "Calitila, Bleeding after intercourse can result from irritation of the cervix, the walls of the vagina, the entrance to the vagina, or the urethra. It is most common for this to be noticed within a day of relations, rather than after several days.  If this occurs occasionally and always clears within a day, it likely has no importance.  Some women will experience bleeding with intercourse if they have just finished their menstrual flow, if they are close to ovulation (mid-cycle) or about to start a menstrual period. This is normal, but the reason it happens is mysterious.  If you have not had a recent well-woman examination including a Pap Smear, I encourage you to contact your primary physician for this examination and also mention your concern about postcoital bleeding.\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend and I have been togethor for over a year. During these  last four months I would bleed from my vagina after intercourse. I thought it might have to do with aggressive intercourse but even mild intercourse will result in my loss of blood. I have never experienced this before. I have never had an STD and have been active with my boyfriend alone for over a year now.    The blood loss is mild, it is on tissues after I wipe, however the blood loss does increase with agressive intercourse.       I am not pregnant because I just had my period last week. However everytime I have sex regardless of how far apart I am in my period, I will bleed.       Do you have any suggestions to why this is happening? Is it life threatening?\n\n",

'Postcoital bleeding' (bleeding after intercourse) could be due to several causes including vaginitis (infection of the vagina), cervicitis (infection of the cervix of the uterus), cervical ectopy (eversion of the cervical lips), cervical polyp (a benign mass), trauma, and cancer. Apart from cancer, none of the causes are lifethreatening, and at your age, and with your monogamous relationship, cancer would be too long a shot.   Make an appointment with your gynecologist and get yourself examined and treated.  Warm regards,  bill\n\n",

    "content": "In the past 1.5 months, I have started to develop hard bumps under the skin in the pubic area, upper thighs and one in my armpit.  One lump was on my labia, one is now around the back rim of my vagina, and a recent one was in my bikini line.  Others have been on my thighs.  And one was in my arm pit.  They last about 10 days, get red and infected , increase in size and usually end up leaking pus (especially if I squeeze them like a pimple).  They are painful and tender.  I have had one sexual partner for the past 5 years who I am 100% confident is 100% faithful.  I consulted with my dermatologist and she mumbled something about hormonal imbalance and infection of the hair follicle.  I have never had a problem with acne or ingrown hairs.  I am 40 years old with a 2 year old daughter.  My periods have always been semi-regular but long in cycle.  In recent months, they have become much more regular and somewhat shorter in cycle (e.g., from 35 days to 28-30 days).    Can you please tell me what this might be?  Should I consult with my gyn/ob?  This is getting very uncomfotable and kind of disgusting.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am not yet clear as to what exactly you mean by an ingrown hair. But assuming some bumps caused by block or infection of the hair follicle, I would suggest using glycerine magsulfate solution taken on a piece of cotton, and somehow let it remain over the small bump for some time. The fluid inside the bump will be absorbed by the glycerine on the cotton. But if the bump does not begin to show any improvement within 2 days, or if there is pain and redness, or lymph node enlargement, or fever, it would be best to consult a doctor and get yourself treated with anti-inflamatory medications, and antibiotics if need be.  I hope this helps. Please feel free to clarify any more doubts regarding the same.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Several possibilities could underlie your problem, but mostly benign, and hence free from worry. Folliculitis is the infection of the root of the hair. This could present as small bumps near the vagina, where there is hair. This could be painful.   Bartholin glands are small glands at the opening of the vagina that secrete fluid to moisten the inside of the vagina. These glands could become blocked at their openings, when they swell to be felt. Otherwise, these glands are small enough to be seen or felt. Once Bartholin glands get blocked, the fluid accumulates inside it to become a Bartholin cyst, which is mostly painless. If the fluid in a cyst gets infected it becomes an abscess called Bartholin abscess, which requires surgical drainage and a procedure called marsupilaization.  Otherwise, folliculitis could be treated from home using topical glycerin and bartholin cyst could be treated with daily sitz bath in warm (not hot) water (with or without salt added) for 10 minutes daily. If after these home treatments, if the bump doesn't seem to budge in a few days, or redness/discharge/pain/fever/lymph node enlargement comes by, it would be best to consult your doctor. In any case, there is no substitute for direct clinical examination.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  -Bill\n\n",
