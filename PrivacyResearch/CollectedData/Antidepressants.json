    "title": "Will Antidepressants Work For You?",
    "content": "Welcome to the Antidepressant Forum!  The Psychiatry Team has started this new thread to answer any and all questions you may have about symptoms of Depression and its treatment.  In the UK this past week, headlines have appeared that the SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) don't work any better than do placeboes.  However, the research that these headlines are based on has some weaknesses.  Please see the article under the \"Home\" tab about this study for full explanation.  At any rate, please be patient as we update the antidepressant database with the most recent accurate information based on solid research.  To introduce this new thread, a basic description of the symptoms of Major Depressive Disorder and of Dysthymic Disorder, along with definitions of certain terms, follows.  Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) Common symptoms of MDD include:  1.  Depressed mood - mood refers to the prevailing feelings and is persistent over a period of at least days 2.  Anhedonia - lack of motivation to do anything, including bathing, eating, doing activities you previously enjoyed 3.  Poor concentration - cannot stay focused on any task long enough to complete it as compared to your usual functioning; indecisiveness 4.  Feelings of hopelessness and worthlessness - loss of hope that you will ever feel any better, feeling that you are a failure 5.  Feelings of guilt that are excessive to the situation - feeling that everything that has gone wrong is your fault, such as \"carrying the weight of the world on your shoulders\" 6.  Change in sleep pattern - either sleeping much more than usual (hypersomnia) or the inability to fall asleep and/or stay asleep (insomnia) 7.  Change in appetite - either a marked increase in appetite (hyperphagia) or a marked decrease in appetite (anorexia) with a change in baseline weight 8.  Fatigue or loss in energy 9.  Feelings of physical and/or emotional agitation or slowing 10.  Thoughts of death or suicide In addition, the disorder must not be caused by a drug of abuse, medication, or general medical condition.  Criteria for mania/hypomania have never been met, and the disorder causes clinically significant distress or impairment.  Dysthymic Disorder Common symptoms of Dysthymic Disorder include:  1.  Chronic symptoms of depression (see 1 - 10 in MDD) 2.  Symptoms must last longer than 2 years 3.  Symptoms generally are less severe than in MDD  Everyone is different and there are many, many different presentations of depression.  In some people, depressed mood is not even part of their complaint.  Instead, it is the lack of motivation to do anything at all that brings them to seek treatment.  Sometimes, it is the presence of other symptoms (called co-morbidities because they occur along with depression) that are distressing, such as anxiety, which is a close cousin of depression.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Eisele,   I appreciate your listing of the requirements for the diagnosis of major depressive disorder. I think that you made it much clearer in regards to the severity of symptoms required for a diagnosis. For example, anhedonia - lack of motivation to do anything including bathing, eating, etc., as well as the things we normally love to do. I think we all go through periods of time where life events make us lose our appetites, gain and/or lose weight, such as in response to normal life events such as the death of someone close to us. I have noticed that many patients who are experiencing major life changes (divorce, death) are being prescribed antidepressants as a way of reducing the associated suffering. I have mixed feelings as to whether this is even a good idea at all because of the profound changes that antidepressants can make in those who need them just to maintain normality.   When I first started taking medication, I had been in weekly counseling for 18 months. As I learned to adjust to a background of growing up in an alcoholic family and learned invaluable skills to deal with things I did not have control over, I still found myself sobbing often, feeling that I was worthless beyond description, etc. I had always gone through this and at age 21 experienced a worsening and lengthy period of symptoms. I began sleeping throughout the day, could not get out of bed to go to work and lost my job, quit attending classes at college, ate significantly more and gained weight. I was elated beyond description to begin taking an antidepressant and noticed immediate improvement in every aspect of my life. I no longer felt that I had a dark cloud over my head, that everyone thought I was pathetic, that I was useless, etc. I always knew in my heart that I was a wonderful person with incredible amounts of empathy and compassion for others. This just did not match the emotions I experienced with my severe depression.    I wanted to post this here to say yes, antidepressants do work, at least for some people. I cannot live a normal life without them. I have gone off of antidepressants after long periods of time thinking that I may have gotten so used to being happy and well adjusted that I no longer needed them. Sadly, even after 3 long months of being off of them, I was exactly as miserable as I ever was before. I slept a lot, I avoided any and all social contact, felt that people who looked at me must be able to tell what a loser I was and thought I was pathetic, etc. I also experienced the usual nightmares and extreme self-deprecation I was so used to in my pre-antidepressant years.   I realize that there is a lot of discussion and ongoing research about whether antidepressants work better than a placebo. The simple answer is yes. Do they work for all depressed patients? Perhaps not. But my success with them cannot be a placebo effect. I wanted so much not to have to take the medication again and I believed that my years of treatment with it allowed me to build strong relationships, successful social interactions, etc. - enough that I would be just fine without the medication. I tried so hard to be okay without it. I wasn't and I simply am not.    Feel free to share my story with anyone it might benefit if you would like. There is simply no other way to describe the \"me\" before and after antidepressants except that it is the difference between a black and white world and one with color, light and darkness, a sunny day and a hurricane.\n\n",

    "content": "Currently i am on 10mg Lexapro and i need to start taking a beta-blocker but lexapro inhibits an enzyme called CYP2D6 in the liver which metabolizes certain things, thus causing certain medicines to build up in the system since it cant metabolize it good. Is this true? Is this only with certain beta blockers and antidepressants? I don't want any kind of interaction with these. I mean there has to be millions of people on lexapro and a beta blocker right?   I know lexapro inhibits this enzyme in the liver because it does that with caffeine too and whenever i drink coffee i feel like crap and my nerves go crazy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  Some SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors) antidepressants do inhibit CYP2D6.  Lexapro has only a weak effect on the enzyme, if any.  In vitro studies did not find that Lexapro had an inhibitory effect on CYP2D6.  Inhibiting the enzyme could cause some \"build up\" of medication due to slowed metabolic effect, but this does not appear to be a major consideration.  There is no contraindication for prescribing Lexapro with beta-blockers.  However, both medications may slow the heart rate, so that aspect is likely monitored by your physician.    Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Are Alprazolam and Estazolam typically prescribed together?",
    "content": "Hi -  Estazolam and Alprazolam are in the same drug family, known as benzodiazepines.  Taking them at the same time may potentiate the effects of both, and thus should be monitored by a physician.  There is no contraindication to using them at the same time.  Estazolam is particularly useful in treating insomnia or other sleep disorders, and alprazolam is particularly useful in treating anxiety and panic disorders.  As always, the lowest effective dosage is recommended, so may vary from person to person, depending on their metabolism and sensitivity to this type of medication.  Both medications are excreted in the urine.  Estazolam is prescribed in 1mg and 2 mg dosages, with 2 mg considered the maximum dosage.  Alprazolam is prescribed in 0.25 mg, 0.5 mg, and 1 mg dosages; the maximum dosage for use by the elderly is 4 mg per day, in divided doses (usually 4 times daily).  The primary safety issue is the possible effect on motor function and alertness; hazardous activities that require alertness or motor control should be avoided until the effect of the medications is known.  Alcohol use with either medication is contraindicated, and could be dangerous.  A person using either medication should report any excessive or prolonged effects on the Central Nervous System; these effects are insomnia,irritability, dizziness, headache, anxiety, confusion, drowsiness, light-headedness, sedation, somnolence, speaking difficulty, impaired coordination, fatigue or depression.  Some of these effects are the desired outcome for using the medications, and can be expected; once again, it's the excessive or unusually prolonged effects that should be reported to one's doctor.    I hope this information is helpful!  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have been taking Zoloft 75 mg for a few weeks (was on 100 mg for about three weeks) but I started having insomnia.   I was also started on BusPar 30 mg  day as well a few weeks ago and have felt headaches and insomnia too.  I have also been taking Klonopin (clonazepam) for about eight months.  I initially started taking 0.5 mg at night to help me sleep.  I think I developed a tolerance because a couple of months ago it stopped working, so my psych suggested I started taking 1 mg and even 2 mg at night if needed.  I am scared about that one the most b/c I've heard horror studies of becoming addicted and having horrible withdrawal symptoms that last for months or even years.  There is no way I am taking more than 1 mg of clonazepam.  I am on so many meds, I don't know which one is causing the insomnia.  Could it be the combination of Zoloft and Buspar.  I've read that they both can cause insomnia.  I thought of tapering off the meds to see if my insomnia improves.  First, the Buspar since I read there really is no withdrawal worries with that one and see what happens.  Next, I thought of going back down to 50 mg of Zoloft for now to see if my insomnia improves.  The next and most difficult one that I'm scared of is of the clonazepam.  What is a safe withdrawal schedule for such an addictive drug (psychologically and physically)?  I just don't want to be on such an addictive drug.  I suffer from anxiety/depression, but it manifests around a week or two before my period.  I certainly don't think I need to be on three meds.\n\n",

BuSpar and Clonazepam are not known for insomnia, but the opposite effect.  The maximum daily dose for Clonazepam is 20mg, in divided doses.  It's possible to develop dependence on the drug.  If anyone feels they are taking too many medications, it's worth a discussion with your doctor, so any possible adjustments can be made.\n\n",

In recent years, due to the reports of persons with experiences like wncsunshine's, there has been a name assigned to such withdrawal problems, called \"Discontinuation Syndrome.\"  It includes multiple unpleasant symptoms, and sometimes requires as long as a year for the person to slowly titrate the dosage downward.  Some physicians prescribe Prozac while the other medication is being withdrawn, and then titrate the Prozac downward, which often works.  If you need to speak with your doctor, insist on it, or make an appointment and see him or her.    Good luck to all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tindra,  Citalopram and Meridia should not be taken together.  Citalopram and Meridia have similar actions in being what is called serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and taking them together could result in a condition called Serotonin Syndrome or Serotonin Toxicity.  The condition has a rapid onset and can progress quickly.  Mild symptoms may include increased heart rate, shivering, sweating, dilated pupils, tremor or twitching, and oversensitive reflexes.  Moderate toxicity has all of that, plus increased bowel sounds, high blood pressure and temperatures up to 104 deg. Fahrenheit.  Severe symptoms additionally include severe increase in heart rate and blood pressure that can result in shock, and temperatures may go above 106 F.  It can be life threatening, and result in seizures, kidney failure and severe blood clotting throughout the vascular system.    Citalopram itself can result in Discontinuation Syndrome when a person is trying to taper off the medication, so it should be tapered off very gradually, over a period of 2 to 4 months or longer.  Physicians have found that prescribing Prozac and having the person then taper off Citalopram more quickly works fairly well, and then the person can taper off the Prozac with fewer problems.  Prozac also enhances weight loss.    Meridia is most effective with a lower calorie diet.  A lower calorie diet also results in weight loss, especially when in conjunction with a regular exercise program.  Using a low calorie diet without Meridia is the best choice while using Citalopram or any other serotonin-enhancing medication.  A low calorie diet plus a regular exercise program is effective, and would be the best choice for long term results.    It would be a good idea to discuss all this with your doctor before proceeding on any weight loss program.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Should I stop taking Effexor?",
    "content": "Hi jeffrey6873,  Migraine is a neurological condition with severe, chronic headaches which can last for hours or days.  Some have warning signs, called auras.  Migraines are often accompanied by nausea, vomiting and sensitivity to light and/or sound.  There is no cure, but the condition is managed by drugs that can lessen the frequenccy and severity of the headaches.    Treatment of migraines consists of pain relieving drugs and/or preventive drugs.  Pain relieving drugs include NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatories), as Midrin or Advil; triptans, as Maxalt and Imitrex; Ergot, as Minergot or Cafergot; anti-nausea drugs, as butalbital, which may be combined with acetominophen, although these have a risk of rebound headaches and withdrawal symptoms; and opiates, as drugs with codeine, with these being the last resort.  Preventive drugs include certain cardiovascular drugs known as beta-blockers and calcium channel blockers, which may help block migraine; antidepressant drugs, especially tricyclics (amitriptyline, nortriptyline) which boost neurohormones in the brain; other anti-depressants known as SSRIs (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), which have not been as effective except for Effexor; anti-seizure drugs as Depakote or Neurontin, which help reduce frequency of migraines, but high doses may cause significant side effects; and Botox (botulinin toxin A), which is effective for many people and is usually injected every three months.    Although Effexor is noted to be the most effective SSRI in the treatment of migraine, it is also on the \"worst offender\" list for severe withdrawal symptoms, known as \"Discontinuation Syndrome.\"  Symptoms of Discontinuation Syndrome include anxiety, tremors, visual disturbances, hallucinations, restlessness, muscle and joint pain, dizziness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, headache, lethargy, weakness, unstable gait, insomnia, flu-like symptoms, electric-like \"zaps\", tingling sensations, and/or irritability.  Those SSRIs that are least likely to cause Discontinuation Syndrome are Serzone, Wellbutrin, Remeron and Prozac.  Effexor should not be withdrawn as quickly as is usually recommended (2 to 4 weeks); rather, it should be very slowly reduced over at least 2 to 4 months; for some people, as long as a year is required.  The Discontinuation Syndrome has been identified in recent years due to increasing reports of withdrawal symptoms from persons who have been prescribed the drug.  There are times when Effexor is the best drug for a condition, and the person and their doctor must balance benefit vs. risk.  Some University medical centers now require people to sign a waiver for the use of Effexor, to be certain that the potential problems are clearly understood before starting to use the drug.    It's always a good idea to discuss any concerns with your doctor, so that you can work together to find the best treatment for you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

I hope you'll consider giving your doctor a call before proceeding with your medication plan.  I also hope you'll have a lovely holiday.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Im 25 yrs old.  I used to be a bodybuilder, avid fisherman, used to drag race, and enjoy the great outdoors.  USED TO.  I was on effexor for about 3 yrs, 75mgs.  I decided I wanted to stop taking it, I felt fine.  Im 25 I said and I can deal with lifes problems.    I told my doc if I may discontinue the drug he said sure, if  you want to.  Doctor didn't even ask me if I wanted to wean off,  I suggested him to give me the 35mgs, but he gave me only a weeks worth.    I have never in life felt so sick.  I would not wish this on anyone, not even my enemy.  The first 3 months were hell.  dizziness, nausea, fatigue, bad memory, brain zaps, you name it I had it.  I couldnt even walk sometimes.    I fought and fought and it is now 7 months that I am clean off this horrible so called drug.  To this day, 7 MONTHS later, I am left with weakness, bad memory, and horrible coordination.   I can no longer workout, all my muscles went down, I have no energy to do what I liked to do in my life.  I cannot function or remember things at work.  I am useless.  If it wasn't my cousins place, I would have been fired along time ago.  I am not depressed, I don't have panic attacks.  In my opinion, Effexor has left me permanent damage.  I have been through more tests than you can think of.  blood tests apon blood tests for every disease known to man.    This drug has changed my life for the worse and everynight i cry, because I feel that this medicine has severly left me damaged in some form.  My doctor has no idea what to do.    so what is there to say?  any advice?  Is this what these drugs are supposed to do?    24 hrs, 7 days a week I feel like i have the flu.  Is this how patience / humans have to live when they come off this?    i am trying to take care of myself by taking flaxseed oil and garlic. This is the only thing so far that seems to help with the fatigue.    I need some help or idea's, because I cannot take this anymore.    for others who are reading this, if you feel depressed, do not take any of these medications.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sorano:  I'm sorry withdrawal from venlafaxine has been so difficult for you.  It's too bad your doctor didn't let you try to wean off a bit more slowly.  Many people do have bad withdrawal from this medicine, but on the other hand, there are just as many who do not have this problem.  There does not seem to be a way to predict who will and who will not.  The shame of it all is that venlafaxine is an effective treatment for depression.  I have seen many patients whose symptoms have improved dramatically in as little as 10 - 14 days.  Because of the withdrawal problems, I only prescribe it for those who have tried everything else.  I find that people in that situation are willing to risk the withdrawal just to not have to live with their depression forever.  I hope your symptoms begin to let up soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.    As far as the withdrawals are concerned,  I don't think withdrawals last for 7 months.  I am really convinced that this medicine did leave some kind of permanent damage.    Many symptoms have past, in the first 3 months, now I am very fatigued, my body aches, bad vision, and so on.    I am going to a neurologist soon.  Not really happy or relieved that I am going because I will just get some more bad news and the term, \" sorry there is nothing we can do\"    This has been the most scariest event in my life time.  A once healthy indiviual is now somewhat of a vegetable.    People tell me to have faith, but 7 months have past and nothing is getting better.  So chalk another one up for a patient that has been devistated by medication.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with the above post 110%!!!!!  I can remember when I was put on effexor xr and it was totally unaffective in treating my panic attacks and depression - furthermore it made me feel numb and just totally 'out of it' while I was on it.  If I so much as missed my next dose by an hour - horrible side effects would kick in (then again this reinforced me to always take the medication for fear of the bad side effects).    When I finally had enough of feeling like a prisoner to this awful medication and began to taper off the regular dosing level - I literally went through hell.  What I remember most was the vivid and very disturbing nightmares, waking up in cold sweats every night and then feeling dizzy, nauseus, anxious and trembling throughout the entire day.  This lasted for about 1-2 months and of course the first 2-3 weeks were the worst.  I think this drug is rather dangerous and the risks of side effects isn't worth the prospect of curing your disease.  I actually felt incredibly healthier and better once the drug was out of my system and the withdrawal effects ceased.  I cannot more strongly advise people to try other treatments first before resorting to effexor xr.  I know I won't ever go back on it.  Hope doctors are more careful in prescribing this medicine and monitoring those who are on it. Taryn\n\n",

I decided to quit because I am pregnant and I didn't want the baby to go through the same withdrawals we all have gone through. The dr. told me there is a chance that my baby wouldn't but how do they know. Just like the percentage of people that do get off effexor xr and don't experience any withdrawals, were are those people, because anyone I have talked with has had some withdrawals. So I have been off the medication for about 2 1/2 weeks and the worst is over but still I have this agitation, I cant think straight and headaches, the worst headaches of my life! I never had the agitation before so I know that its not some type of depression. I was only prescribed this drug for post partum and ended up staying on it for 3 years because it was always just easier to take another pill then to deal with withdrawals! I was never depressed or agitated before I got on the medication and now I just cant have a normal day! I also feel it has ruined me. Maybe I wait longer and hopefully it will go away but I almost feel like I can't wait! Its truly the worst thing Ive ever gone through! I can only hope it goes away.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello uberirfit and all,  There are potential side effects with literally all medications, although some are far more serious than others.  Effexor did not demonstrate such severe side effects in the drug trials; that information has been developing over time, as more and more people have reported problems.  The situation is now called \"Effexor discontinuation syndrome\".  Other similar medications with similar problems are also named as discontinuation syndromes.  The medication is still extremely useful, but withdrawal now must be done very gradually; for some persons, 2 to 4 months is plenty, but others may require a year or more.  Some University medical centers are having patients sign waivers that they understand the risk of difficult withdrawal.  Permanent damage is not common.    Good luck to all of you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Changing Tranxene Dosage",
    "content": "Hi tbl,  The usual prescription for Tranxene is from 15 - 60mg per day, in divided doses of twice to four times daily.  It has a long half-life (the time it usually takess for about half of the medication to clear from your system) of 20 to 179 hours, which makes it a long-acting drug.  Dependence in the form of increased tolerance for the drug can develop, especially at higher doses, though it generally develops more slowly with Tranxene than with other benzodiazepines.  Decreasing the dosage by one quarter generally would have little effect since you are on a low dose.  Abrupt total withdrawal from the medication at low doses can cause significant problems, including depression nervousness, rebound insomnia, irritability, sweating, and diarrhea.   Abrupt withdrawal from high doses can cause anxiety, apprehension, tremors, insomnia, nausea and vomiting, confusion, toxic psychosis and seizures.  Gradual reduction for total withdrawal is recommended.  Even though decreasing the dosage is not likely to have an adverse effect, it's important that you let your physician know of your plan before proceeding.    Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, tankgllrr74,  I'm sorry to hear about your difficulties.  Guanficine and Topimax are not known to affect appetite in any way, so they are not likely contributing to your situation.  Each person has an individual response to any medication, but those two would not be the first suspects in weight gain.  Zoloft could be the problem, as it is known to increase appetite.  Antidepressants that are specifically noted for decreased appetite and weight loss are fluvoxamine maleate, and nortriptyline hydrochloride.  Fluoxetine hydrochloride (Prozac) can go either way, depending on the person's individual response, but it most often helps with weight loss.  Bupropion, selegiline and pramipexole increase metabolism, which helps with weight loss.  Zoloft is in a class known as an SSRI, or selective seritonin reuptake inhibitor; fluvoxamine maleate is also an SSRI.  Nortriptyline is in a class known as a tricyclic antidepressant.  Your physician may have a preference as to which type he prescribes for you.  Since you are already using an exercise program to assist you, I suggest that you maintain a food record for everything you eat - meals and snacks of any kind.  People with depression and anxiety often eat much more than they realize, and the food diary could be helpful to you in determining if that's happening with you.    Good luck to you, and thank you for serving your country.\n\n",

I've never found that any of this has helped.  I've asked my doctor if i can stop taking them because i'm affraid of the withdrawl symptoms getting too bad later on.   I've decided to try and lean myself off it myself, without the approval of my doctor / psychiatrist..   I've started by skipping every second day.   By the end of the second day i generally feel awfull.   My question is, am i wasting my time by doing this or should i be getting lower doces and leaning off them that way.  My doctor(s) don't seem to want to lean me off, rather they keep wanting to up my dosage .   The only thing i've ever found that has actually helped me is smoking marijuana.   This is the only thing that ever calms me down to a point where i can control these panic attacks.  It also helps me to sleep at night, otherwise (happening more often) i have a very hard time to sleep at night.     Thanks for your time.  p.s i was also on paxil for a while but was taken off because it was causing my face to go numb!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Schitzo,  It is absolutely necessary that you never stop taking a medication that your doctor prescribed for you without going back to him first. If you don't want to be continued on a certain medication you should talk to your doctor and come to an agreement with him.  There are certain medications that should never be stopped by the patients unless under strict medical supervision.  The maximum dose of effexor xr is usually 225 mg/day and in certain studies with severely depressed patients up to 350 mg/day. The usual dose for anxiety disorders is 225 mg/day as well. i am not sure though whether the dose that you are getting could be increased to 350 mg/day or not as every patient differs from the other.   The way to wean effexor is to take off 75 mg per week. Meaning, you are currently taking 150 mg/day. Your drop your dose by 75 mg (so that you be taking 75 mg/day) for 1 week and then continue to take 75 mg/day for 1 week and then you could stop it.  The information that i gave you is not meant to replace your doctor/pschiatrist instructions. You have to consult with them now as they might think that you should be tappered over a longer period of time as they are more aware of your medical condition.  One more thing, you are not supposed to take any other product that could interact with the medication that you are taking and may be causing some side effects. If you intend to take other products whatever their nature, you have to tell your doctor.   i would strongly urge you to get back to your doctor regarding your wishes to discontinue effexor.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor Addiction",
    "content": "I have tried weaning myself off Effexor on several different occasions. Missing only one doze (150 mg one time daily) creates awful symptoms. Within four hours of taking the missed doze I regain the ability to get out of bed, etc and return to my normal routines. During attempts to wean off 'the stuff' I become so physically ill that I become totally bedfast.  Without Effexor I become lethargic, sleeping heavily. The nausea, stomach pain  and fever (flu-like symptoms) make it impossible to even get out of bed! The body tremors and dizziness are horrible! I become so weak, so sick, that I can't function. My thought pattern becomes so fuzzy that I am unable to reason or even speak. So, after each attempt to free myself of this drug I have no choice but to give-in and take the med so that I can function...go to work...so I can afford \"my habit\".  My doctors tell me they have never heard of such withdrawal...and appear to take on the attitude/opinion that I am a Hypochondriac or loony!!   I have tried switching to Wellbutrin XL, only to find myself back to  Effexor Withdrawal!  I choose not to use my vacation time from work  to experiment with what might happen after the 4th day of pure hell! I have often wondered if I would eventually begin to recover...but after reading the posts on this site, I am even more skeptical. Years ago, I had the same problems with Paxil, being told I must first \"wean\" off the Paxil before taking the Effexor. After moving to Ohio and finding a family doctor I learned that I could take the Paxil 'today' and start the Effexor 'tomorrow' (of course, discontinuing the Paxil from that moment on). I just want off Effexor!  I am willing to switch to a different medication but...to what medication?\n\n",

    "content": "It is so good to see that weaning off of these medications is being shown to be important.  The side effects should be  monitored by a physician, but there are so few out there that acknowledge that these medications can have such intense withdrawals for some.  Thank you again, Dr. Mokhtar, and may those weaning or tapering (or making the decision) know that the road could be bumpy along the way, but the destination is attainable.  Keep in close contact with your physician.  Let your family and friends know what your are going through and what the possibilities of emotions are so they will understand should they encounter you in an emotional outburst.  Withdrawal for some is non-symptomatic, while others have an emotional rollercoaster ride.  Unfortunately, I was on the rollercoaster going cold turkey from an SSRI.  Even more unfortunate is that the doc's that had put me on these medications knew nothing about withdrawal.  For the third time, thank you, Dr. Mokhtar.  Best of luck and wisdom to those in need!

    "content": "I have been taking Effexor (37.5 mg) for many, many years, at least 10 (or even when they first got approval from the FDA).  I have tried to get off the drug by weaning but found it impossible - the side effects from the withdrawal were unbearable.  After reading these postings I'm glad there is finally a description for the feeling I had always described by saying my head and my body feels like \"sheet metal that someone is banging on constantly, with every small move I make.\"  I couldn't last more than a day off the drug, and because I work full time, resumed taking it to avoid the side effects.  It would work within hours to get rid of those awful side effects...and I felt like a failure.  What really gets my goat is doctors prescribe these medications so freely without explaining how horribly hooked you can get on them.  I am 48 years old and I have two nephews in their 20s taking Paxil and Effexor, respectively, and it really angers me.    My question is this:  can someone recommend the best and most successful course of action to get off this medication?  I have absolutely no sex life, I don't cry, I feel nothing.  I want my old life back.  If it's counting beads, offsetting with something else, can anyone out there offer their own success story?\n\n",

    "content": "A tapering dose down is the best way to go if you want to withdraw.  Discuss this with your physician before attempting this as they will be able to give you prescriptions for the appropriate dosage for each step down.  During withdrawal you need to keep in regular close contact with your physician so they can monitor your withdrawal symptoms.  You may be one of the lucky ones who do not experience these, but they need to see this also.    To the person who was trying the every other day route:  The half-life of these medications vary, but 48-hours can throw your brain into cold-turkey withdrawal.  Another option to discuss with your doctor is alternating your current dose one day, half dose the next day, continuing this routine for about a week before dropping to the half dose daily for a time period before you attempt the next drop.  This works for some, but not all, so again TALK TO YOU PHYSICIAN.  During this time of withdrawal you have to listen to your mind and body.  You have to convey to your physician exactly what you are feeling with each dosage change and work together to find the most comfortable and safe way for your personal withdrawal.  Good luck, patient and best wishes to all of you!\n\n",

    "content": "Some people have even gone to the point of counting out the beads inside the capsules during their withdrawal, going down as slowly as possible.  Most are not warned about the potential (and very common) side effects while taking these medications or about what they now call \"discontinuance syndrome\".  In the physicians' defense, they were not informed of these problems by the drug companies.  These problems are now being reported publicly and the drug companies can no longer deny the allegations.  We also have the stigma when taking these medications that there was something mentally wrong to begin with or we wouldn't have been on these medications, therefore the withdrawal effects or side effects must all be in our heads also.  It's very frustrating, but the tide is turning.  Be patient during your withdrawal.  Listen to your body and brain because it will be evident when a dosage drop is too much or you are ready for your next step down.  Do as much research as you can through the Effexor website and any other resource so you will be educated when speaking to your physician, and you will have definite questions you want answered/researched by him/her.  Best of luck to you.  Withdrawal is attainable even though it may take longer than you would like.\n\n",

    "content": "First off, Im female and 18 years old (19 next month) and have been on effexor since I was 17 (the summer before grade 12). I was put on effexor by my doctor after I began breaking down at school. I was in his office five minutesone day when he decided to put me on it. I started on 75mg, but it quickly became too little. I then was switched to 125mg and then to 175mg. All of this within the course of about a year, although it was never really enough, at one point I was put up to 200mg. However when I went off to university this year my docotor knocked down my dosage (already hardly working) and put me back on 150mg because he was unable to check in with me monthly. Since I have been at school I ahve had endless difficulties.  They put me on 75 mg when I got here!! Imagine. I was going crazy! I quickly upped my dose to 121, closer to what my doctor had suggested and soon evend out.  However my biggest problem on effexor has always been how erratic it makes everything. Inrease in anger, sleep too much or way too little, moody, irritable and if I miss a dose (Im always rediculously forgetful) I  feel physically ill (even when I don't realize Ive missed a dose, which excuses the possibility of it being all in my head), and Ive gained so much weight this alone is enough to want to kill myself. Recently I attempted suicide, this attempt failed miserably, but the thought was there. As of a week ago I ran out of medication and have been irritable, crying over stupid things. (this being a huge change to the emotionless self I have become used to on effexor ex: hardly laughing, mopey,tired, never able to cry until I reach a breaking point) HOwever I have wanted to get off of this medication for a long time. The only thing that has really helped me is smoking marijuana. It calms me down, helps me sleep, gives me an appetite (coming off effexor I find I no longer feel the need to gorge like I would before), and generally just gets rid of my stress. I am aware of its classification as a downer, but in my case I find this isnt so.. My true concern is how will coming off effexor effect me (its been a week), what can I do to make myself feel better (this is cold turkey style). How long will I have to wait before I can expect to be normal again? I keep having moments where my thoughts seem to smash into a wall and I go blank..is this even normal?\n\n",

    "content": "after reading many of these posts Ive realized what Im feeling isnt .. well its not just in my head.  When placed on effexor by my doctor I was underage and knew nothing about it except it would make me stop crying and cutting and hating myself. I was never concerned with the long term. When you get to so low a place you only want to get out. Now I find it so difficult to do anything... especially because of my age. I speak to people, my mother, councellor, doctor and try to explain how I feel at times, but nobody seems to believe me. I feel this is the most frustrating part. Seeing that there are other people out there like me however makes me feel alot better.  For anyone on anti depressants trying to come off I suggest replacing meds wth marijuana. It takes the edge off quite a bit and calms the panic attacks I would normally have had I forgotten a dose. And since Im stoned Im not angry or irritable. Its also a great help sleeping...which Ive done alot this week (luckily my one week off from school) I still found myself feeling nauceous and having headaches the past week (weeping to no end too) but if you're desperate, its not nearly as addictive as effexor.  good luck everyone. live, love... feel happy :)\n\n",

I feel like Effexor has put a huge damper on my relationship with my boyfriend and now I wish that I had never started taking it in the first place. Since we started going out, my sex drive has steadily decreased to the point that I have to tell myself to be intimate with him, when we do have sex. I try telling him that it's nothing personal and that I think it's just the medication, but he still gets so cold and withdrawn when we don't have sex for a while. When I try not taking it, I get so sleepy and end up sleeping practically the whole day away. Then he complains that I'm lazy and have no drive. I feel like there's no winning and there's not really anyone I can talk to about it. I'm not the type of person that feels comfortable divulging in the details of my sex life to my friends and when I try to explain things to him he just doesn't get it. I don't even feel like I need it anymore, since I feel like I've matured a lot emotionally from the age that I started it. I've started to ween myself from 150 mg to 75 mg since spring of this year, but I'm scared for my relationship! Don't get me wrong, my boyfriend is a great person, but I feel so pressured and tired of fighting.\n\n",

Apparently they were having a better response with this particular medication. I think sometimes we can be a little unkind to our doctors the reason I say this is because at the time of diagnosis I was so afflicted by anxiety and panic attacks that I would have done or taken anything for it to stop. I was warned by my GP that there were side effects and that I may experience some of these but the pros of the medication far outweighed the cons. I did have a few mild side effects that lasted briefly and spent the next two years in effexor heaven so to speak, apart from a little weight gain, all the symptoms of my anxiety dwindled away. I had a few sessions with a psychotherapist to learn strategies to help me control my anxiety, I felt great, in control and decided now that I had the tools to help me I no longer needed the medication. Anxiety and Depression can be a frightening experience, as you all know from the posts I have read, I have always believed that medication is really there to help us in the acute stages of our illness, until we learn how to cope better with the symptoms, so I decided that this was it. After consultation with my GP we decided to taper off from 150mg to 75mg, which I believe is normal procedure, according to the drug company who makes the drug. Here lies our problem, doctors are guided by the drug companies themselves and the patients information. I live in Australia so if the drug was not safe the doctor would not be able to prescribe it, so therefore I was not advised on the withdrawal effects as coming from a rural town there was not a lot of patient info for the doctor to go on, only that of the drug and my own reaction to discontinuing the drug. My symptoms of withdrawal were much the same as what has been reported on this site, major gastrointestinal upset, chronic diarrhea, headaches, balance problems, nausea, and brain zaps. I have found the brain zaps the worst symptom of all and often sat there wondering what the hell have I done to my poor brain, is this a permanent effect? Fortunately they reduced after about four months and I decided to stay with that dose for another two months before reducing again. At the sixth month mark I reduced from 75mg to 37.5mg. The symptoms were far less severe I can only assume due to the fact that it was a smaller drop. I was on this schedule for another six months. Only then did I decide to discontinue the medication completely. The first day off no side effects I thought great, then I woke the second day got out of bed fell over while trying to put my slippers on, lifted my head and got a mighty zap. Since that day it has been a slow process but each day improves, there is less nausea, less brain zaps, less tummy upsets. I have found that drinking lots not worrying about food too much, and taking a fish oil supplement and ginkgo biloba which has been found to help vertigo has reduced my symptoms somewhat. I really feel for all people coming off these drugs as I have felt the wrath of effexor first hand. Fortunately I have had a positive experience if you could call it that, remember that there is no gain without pain. The reason for my post is to inform people of the effects of discontinuing Effexor and to also encourage those who are experiencing the negative effects that there will be an end to the symptoms eventually. At the date of this post my symptoms of discontinuation have continued to lessen and there has been no return of the dreaded anxiety disorder which led me here in the first place. Good Luck to you all.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello docs,  I'm looking for some specific advice regarding Effexor withdrawal.  I realize this is not a doctor's visit.  I no longer have health insurance as of 6 months ago, so I cannot see my doc now and am needing to figure this out on my own.    My doc & I knew I would no longer have health insurance so we devised a weaning off plan:  I SLOWLY weaned off Effexor over the course of about 5 months.  I was on 150 mg so I switched to 75 mg for about 2.5 months and then down to 37.5 mg for about 2 months and then I stopped taking the medication altogether.  I stopped about 14 days ago.  The first week was unbearable.  All the symptoms others mention before me.  It has improved by now (day 14) but I am still having this Bone-Aching-Pain all over my body.  And extreme Exhaustion.  I mean really bad pain and fatigue.    Does anyone have a time frame for these withdrawals?  How much longer do people normally experience these symptoms?   Also, I don't have health insurance now and can't visit a doctor, but I'm looking for advice on what could help me through this.  I'm open to anything. Thank you\n\n",

It scared me the first few days and was noticably stronger when i would have a cigarette...i have seriously cut down on the smoking. Effexor was a gift to me in the beginning but grew less and less so as some of the side effects became less bearable over time.  I tapered off and was closely paying attention to the amounts and dates but once i was off it I was again experiencing the whole gammet of symptoms of withdrawls...i refuse to restart taking the medication and will gut out the symptoms ...  i need to know...any helpful hints to help ease the discomfort i have been told by various non medical people benadryl 12  fruits veggies ...the only time i feel okay is when i am laying down... ***please does anyone have an idea of when this madness will go away... tapering off just seemed to prolong the inevitable for me and really need to know how long can i expect to feel \"off\" symptoms  thnks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, physsie1,  This is a late response to this continuing discussion, but wanted to add information in case it might be helpful.  Effexor is difficult to discontinue, and should never be discontinued \"cold turkey\".  Doing so can prolong the negative effects of withdrawal, as well as having the potential for a dangerous response to the sudden withdrawal.  If withdrawn under the supervision of your doctor, it is done slowly and your physical reactions are monitored.  It's possible to switch to another antidepressant for a time, and then withdraw from that one.  Withdrawal symptoms can also be addressed by supportive medications, as anti-anxiety medication.  I hope this information is helpful.\n\n",

I had one doctor who totally agreed with me and supported me, but she ended up leaving that office, and I'm not happy with the doctor I see now.  He is telling me that there is no withdrawal, I'm feeling this way because my body is trying to tell me I need this drug due to a chemical imbalance.  I'm sorry, but that's ridiculous.  I have not been able to go longer than every other day, and am getting quite discouraged.  I want nothing more than to be off this drug, but always give in and take it because I cannot feel so badly when I work and attend school full-time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello everyone,  The \"discontinuation syndrome\" occurs more often in some antidepressants than in others.  It appears that the ones known as \"tricyclics\" have not given as many problems when discontinuing.  It is counterproductive to discontinue by taking the medication every other day, as Del pointed out.  Most people find that going back on the medication and then very slowly discontinuing it over a period of 2 months or more has the best success in regards to the discontinuance side effects.  It's frustrating, but easier on your body.  Many University medical centers, as a result of information from person like you, are now having patients sign waivers that they understand the potential discontinuation syndrome may occur.  Never try to stop cold turkey.  Banning such medications isn't the answer, since for some emotional disorders, they may really be the best choice, and it becomes a matter of benefit vs. risk.    Good luck to all of you!!\n\n",

To prepare for a future with this man I investigated the effects Effexor XR may have on a pregnancy.  Once I discovered the potential harm to an unborn child it was decided I would discontinue taking Effexor XR.  It is important to state I was never told nor could I have discovered the facts regarding this drug and it's withdrawal effects.  I am currently experiencing dizziness, dry mouth, fatigue, major headaches, nervousness, tremors, vertigo, vomiting, agitation, abdominal pain, confusion and various other effects. After it was apparent to me that these were in direct response to my discontinuing taking the Effexor XR.  It is impossible to me to work at this time due to the withdrawal symptoms.  There are thousands upon thousands of people suffering from these effects to the point of remaining on the drug to avoid them.  This to me seems more like a systematic way to keep people on this drug to increase profits than a drug to help people who are ill.\n\n",

My experience and the experience of everyone I know personally as well as that of many people posting to various web sites suggests that a much longer tapering off is needed.    I tried to taper off by my doctors recommendation and ended up in the psych ward.  This time I tapered off over a 3 month period and although I experienced side effects throughout that time they were manageable.  When I finally stopped taking it altogether the  withdrawal effects were still more severe than during the tapering off process but remained manageable.  I wish doctors would have available more research and more independent research to advise patients with.  Also a doctor might want to advise patients to use their own judgement when tapering off.  The withdrawal symptoms are so severe that sticking blindly to a prescribed regime of withdrawal can be very harmful, to the point of being life threatening.  My advice to anyone is take it slow and remember you know your body and how the withdrawal is affecting you better than anyone else and you need to make your own decisions about how fast or slow you can cut back\n\n",

I ended up taking 2-3 \"beads\" out of each capsule every day or so, till I finally was down to around 15 beads in a pill!! NEVER NEVER AGAIN  I was not told either about the withdrawal side effects.  When I first tapered down, I was fine until around 5-6 days without them. Then the vomiting, lightheadedness, dizzy, etc. hit me like a brick.  It dawned on me it might be the effexor, so I took a 1/2 a capsule, and sure enough felt better within around 6 hours. That is when I started taking a bead or 2 out of each pill.  I think there is around 180 \"beads\" in each capsule.... That rx should be banned. Nasty stuff.\n\n",

I have been opening up each 37.5 mg capsule and then taking 1/3 of that every other day for three weeks. Now I'm on day 3 of not taking any of the medication and feeling rotten as hell. I'm dizzy and can hardly keep my head upright. I'm having trouble functioning at work. I'm nauseous and woke up in the middle of the night in a cold sweat sick as a dog the other night. I'm having trouble seeing straight. I feel like a herion addict trying to kick a nasty drug habit.  Sure the medication helped me get over a tough time, but I gained weight and now I'm suffering withdrawal sickness like a regular street drug addict. To me, that's not worth it. There are plenty of other medications that can do the same thing without these debilitating side effects. It's a crime that the FDA approved this medication and that physicians actually perscribe it without telling patients the HORRIBLE withdrawal problems it has.   I will never take another anti-depressant again no matter how suicidal or depressed I get again. It's a shame that I can't even trust the medical community to be honest and upright about what the drugs they perscribe actualy do to my body. And I believe the side effects are a way of keeping people hooked on the medication so the drug company can make a bundle of us. Why would they want us to get any better when they can have a bunch of addicted crazies on their medication who can't get of it?\n\n",

I feel the brain shiffers constantly, but it's not THAT bad.  When I was reading about how bad it was from everyone on the internet I was assuming it would be like coming down from a weekend binge of coke or something.  Nothing like that at all.  I mean the brain shivers are a bit strange, but not that bad.  I am curious how long the brain shivers last, but honestly all you people who are complaining about how bad this is really should try coming down from a party drug.  Effexor come down is easy in comparison.  Can someone tell me how long these electrical shocks through my brain are going to last?\n\n",

He said I had a chance of getting depressed again so he said I should continue taking it, but taper off gradually.  He said to just slow down, but do it over a few weeks so I don't get the shivers.  Also he upped my dose of Wellbutrin to the regular dose for depression.  So now I am taking 150mg Wellbutrin XL twice  a day.  I  took 75mg (half my usual dose) of Effexor on friday.  Skipped saturday, took 75mg on Sunday, and today I took 75mg.  I feel totally normal, in fact I feel pretty freaking good today.  My sex drive is definitely up because I had sex with my girlfriend this morning.  I plan on stepping down to ~ 37.5mg tomorrow and trying that for the rest of the week.  I might increase it if I get the shivers, but will only increase it to stop the shivers (per my doc's recommendations).  I will give and update next week.  I can't wait to get off Effextor so my sex drive is normal again and I get horney every time I see a girl.\n\n",

I know, personally, that effexor can take longer than a few weeks to get out of your system. The problem with these doctors replying is that most of them have never been on an anti depressant and have never experienced withdrawal side effects, and thus have no idea of what others are going through. My best advice is to taper off SLOWLY and if you start having withdrawal effects, then go back to the next highest dose and stay another week on it before going down to the next lowest dose again.  prayers to all who fight depression,\n\n",

My Dr. said I was depressed but I never thought I was. Anyway this is my 3rd attempt to get off effexor. First time just couldnt take the withdrawel side effects so wemt back up just to feel better. The second time my Dr. took me off all at once and gave me wellbuterin to take in its place. That was the wosrt experience I have ever gone through. I cried at the drop off a dime. Did I mention that I am a 49 year old male ?  This time I tapered by reducing my dose by 37.5mg every 2 weeks and it didnt seem to bad until I was on my final 37.5 that is when i started noticing the headaches, dizziness, tremors and so forth but they were managable. Now it has been 3 days with no effexor and I am really feeling the above mentioned effects plus the slightest head movement sends my head spinningand I and smapping at my wife and 12year old daughter for the stupidest things. I really want to be off this drug because of the sexual side effects and the weight gain plus I am not bepressed and don't feel I need to be on unnessecary medication.  Are there thing we can do to help eleviate some of the withdrawl effects? I am desperate because I do not want to have to go back on this nasty drug just to eleviate the side effects\n\n",

    "content": "hi.. i've been on effexor 75mg for a year now, my doctor prescribed me to it when i was 15. he failed to warn me about the side effects i would be suffering from when he started me on them, and now i'm suffering more than i was before. the withdrawal is something i never would want anyone to suffer from and i'm sure you guys would agree. i've wanted to come off them for around four months now and i'm now taking them every third day, and i'm suffering from 80% of the syptoms i've read. it's messing with my entire body and mind, i want it to end. i'm sixteen! i just want an actual way to come completely free of my medication without these side effects\n\n",

    "content": "Withdrawal from Effexor is the worst feeling I have ever experienced.  I have tried tapering off of it from 150mg down to 75mg then to 37.5mg but got too many nerve shocks/tremors and nausea so went back on it but now I am pregnant and must go off of it and the withdrawal is so bad I ended up in the hospital two days ago.  I am seriously thinking of suing my two doctors and the makers of effexor because NO ONE told me that the withdrawal would be this bad.  If they did I would have never started taking it.  My doctor said there would be \"flu-like symptoms\"...obviously he has never tried to stop taking effexor.  This is a nightmare and these people should be better informed and tell their patients THE TRUTH.  I would like to know if there has been any negative effects on my unborn child from this horrible withdrawal.\n\n",

I questioned the prescription because I am not only a nurse but know people who have taken this med for depression/anxiety.  He pretty much told us side effects were rare and that effexor has been NOTED to help with chronic headaches.      People beware the drug companies are screwing you...

    "content": "I have been taking Effexor XR since 1999, that's six years.  I was up to 225 mg per day but for the past year I've been taking 150 mg.  I have attempted to get off it under my Drs direction by tapering off gradually twice previous.  I always ended up taking it full time again because the withdrawal symptoms were so bad, or should I use Wyeth's terminology - discontinuation symptoms, HORSE PUCKY!!!  This is my third attempt and this time - COLD TURKEY.   I am on day 4 with no effexor having been consumed.  The electric shocks started as soon as my next dose was due.  They have increased in occurence as well as severity.  I have no appetite, feel sick and dizzy.  This I could handle, it is the uncontrollable crying, the wild whirling thoughts in my head, the anger, did I say anger, I mean rage at times is overwhelming.  This morning at 8:00 am, I was out mowing my lawn, that by the way i had just mowed 2 days ago, trying to burn off the hostile energy.  I was crying the whole time.  It was how you would cry if you were just told your father has died or something.  I cried, bawled & sobbed for about five hours and 2 boxes of kleenex.  Tonight, I am not too bad, but I have had a couple of small crying jags this afternoon.   The zings - electric shocks go from my head to my chest and arms sometimes, and often from the tips of my toes up into my abodomen.  I hope I can make it once and for all.  This drug and others like it should not be allowed to be sold.  I called Wyeth Canada today @1-800-268-1946, ext 3662 and spoke to a nurse.  I told her of my attempts in the past to stop this drug and my withdrawal.  I gavve her an ear full.  She said \"a small number of patients do get adverse effects or discontinuation symptoms.\"  I let her have it,  I said  a few, bulls&#t.  I have been on the internet all morning looking for information on Effexor withdrawal and there are THOUSANDS of people and the worst of it is that our Doctors are not even fully informed of what kind of drug they are working with.  This is CRIMINAL.  We are living, breathing human beings, not test animals and there are real repercussions because of this drug.  Even in the insert from Wyeth that came with my first few sample packs from my Doctor, there was absolutely no mention of the side effects of withdrawal from this drug.  For heaven's sake, I knew as soon as I missed my dose because the electric shocks would start whizzing through my body.  I told her that I had contacted Health Canada and the Fifth Estate (CBC TV news show) and that I was going to take my soap box and tell anyone that will listen that this drug should not be allowed to be sold in all the world.  If I had known then what I know now, I would never have taken it in the first place.  I also said to the Wyeth Nurse, you say it is not addictive, well I am going through hell right now,  I may not be on the corner selling my body to get a fix, but i am suffering severely due to something that is NOT ADDICTIVE   Thanks, I needed to vent.  But, if you feel lead to, contact Health Canada adverse drug reactions department, or in the states the FDA and any other governing body you can think of.  This drug has to be stopped. thanks, 6 year Effexor Addcit, in rehab, lol\n\n",

    "content": "I posted yesterday, very determined that I would never take another effexor.  Well, I'm sorry to say, I have taken another effexor.  I had a terrible episode this morning.  I cried and howled all morning off and on.  We had to drive 50 miles on a 4 lane highway, so I got my sister-in-law to drive as I was too dizzy and mournful.  I was so dizzy and naseous during the drive.  I had to have the radio turned off as it was getting on my nerves.  The further we drove, the more agitated I felt, I was sobbing uncontrollably, I just had to get out of the vehicle. My sister-in-law pulled over on the 401 highway, one of the busiest in Ontario, I stumbled and bolted from the vehicle staggering, I was so dizzy.  I threw myself in the tall grass on the side of the highway with tractor trrailers whizzing by and was screaming, crying, praying  and begging to God to pleaase help me.  when I got home, I called and went to the Doctor who insisted that I take 3/4 at least of the 150 dosage I was taking, get myself under control and then try tapering off again, GET THIS over a 2 week period.  I laughed and explained that I had tried tapering for 2 months once about 3 years ago, unsuccessfully. My son was upset this morning, he had never seen his mom so manic and out of control.  I took the effexor for his sake.  I will try to taper off AGAIN, beginning next week.  The point of this, cold turkey is not the answer.  I will admit, the withdrawal was much worse than when I tapered off. The electric shocks , I can handle, nausea, OK.  But the manic episodes were increasing with severity each day, what would have happend tomorrow if I did not take Effexor today.  I have a little boy and a husband and it was killing them to see me in such agony.    Just thought someone might want to know.  Good luck everyone.\n\n",

I started to feel the brain shivers on Saturday afternoon and it was a bit uncomfortable but nothing to write home about.  Saturday night when I had sex with my girlfriend it was great so I decided to just quit taking effexor.  It's only been 3 days since I stopped but it isn't that bad for me.  I feel the brain shiffers constantly, but it's not THAT bad.  When I was reading about how bad it was from everyone on the internet I was assuming it would be like coming down from a weekend binge of coke or something.  Nothing like that at all.  I mean the brain shivers are a bit strange, but not that bad.  I am curious how long the brain shivers last, but honestly all you people who are complaining about how bad this is really should try coming down from a party drug.  Effexor come down is easy in comparison.  Can someone tell me how long these electrical shocks through my brain are going to last?i had that sex problem too with effexor. It was a pain.  As for withdrawl, i came off it a bit too fast and i went REALLY depressed. Felt like i was in a dream world and all i wanted to do was kill myself. I had really violent thoughts too.... i considered killing a bunch of people i hated and then killing myself in gruesome way...  Im amazed i survived that few weeks and am still here. I feel great now, but thats because i stopped using effexor and went back to an old reliable drug. Which im now coming off, gradually.  Im not sure effexor should be banned, but its definatly dangerous.\n\n",

I am disabled with 2 small children at home, my husband works two jobs to take care of us and this medication is too expensive. My insurance only covers part of it and I don't need it anymore. I am no longer depressed.   I am going to take a few beads out at a time. Say 3 a day for one week. Then the next week 4, then so on. I will check back and let you know what my progess is.

    "content": "I am currently in withdrawal from the Evil Effexor. I was on 150mg and tapered down gradually (75mg for 2 wks, 37.5mg for 2 wks and I've been off it completely for about a week) and my withdrawal symptoms are better but still there. I tried going off cold turkey several months ago, but the nausea, vertigo and brain zaps were so terrible that I was sobbing in the office and couldn't take it any longer. I took a 150mg capsule and felt better in several hours. My withdrawal has been MUCH better after tapering. Not great, but MUCH MUCH better. PLEASE do not go off this medication cold turkey! It really should be banned...     My symptoms: dizziness, brain zaps, clumsiness (bumping into walls, tripping over my own feet), sight problems, extreme irritability over small things, crying at the drop of a hat, nausea, headaches, scary scary dreams where I'm being chased by ax murderers, weight gain, a major craving for vegetables (esp. broccoli)     But I am gladly dealing w/ these symptoms because I now have my emotions back. When I was on the medication, I was numb. I didn't get angry or sad, but I also wasn't really elated or super happy about things. I have always been an extrovert, and when I was on Effexor I was a wallflower and quiet in social situations. I felt awkward all the time. This is gone now that I'm off the medicine! I'm already starting to feel like my old passionate, exuberant self.  General practioners are clueless, y'all. They hand out these drugs like candy without warning patients of their side effects or withdrawal symptoms. This is because they aren't aware of them themselves. It has been my experience that we often know much more than GP's about medical science. From this point forward, I will be self-diagnosing myself using medical dictionaries. Yes, surgeons and specialists are extremely important! They can save lives. But GP's are pretty much useless.\n\n",

    "content": "Susie, how are you doing?  I missed your last post as I was out of the country and I'm rather shocked that no medical professional responded to your distress.  I hope things are better.  If not, you need to get in contact with your physician that is regulating your Effexor.  If they are not being supportive with your withdrawal and sympathetic to your withdrawal symptoms, find another doctor.  Withdrawal can be very dangerous for some people, and you sound as if you were in that group a couple of weeks ago.    I understand what you're saying about the manic episodes.  I had those, plus I didn't feel safe to drive because I kept feeling like I was coming out of a dream, having to snap myself back into the realization that \"this\" was reality.    It can be a long process, but the slower the better for everyone involved, including you and the people around you.  Get in touch with a physician or local mental health clinic to help you through this.  You are not alone and do not let anyone try to tell you that it's just you.  Best wishes and hopes for your condition now and your success in withdrawal!\n\n",

    "content": "Here's my story:  I started Effexor in 2003 to manage some awful post-partum depression. My son is now three and a half and the offending hormones seem to have stabilized yet I carried on with Effexor because I could not quit. I started on a 75 mg dose after attempting Paxil for a couple of months. Paxil was okay but knocked me out so my doctor suggested Effexor. The dose was just fine and I had very little side effects so I carried on merrily until last summer when I decided to quit. My doctor suggested I come off it over a month's time. I went down to 37.5 mg a day for a couple of weeks - fine, then every other day - no good. It seems I needed a daily fix no matter how small. I was able to get some 37.5 mg pills that could be cut in half so I was then taking an itty bitty pill. Then I tried the every other day thing which meant that I felt sick as hell every other day. After about 36 hours from my last dose I got severe dizziness, headaches and hot flashes. As a mom to a preschooler, I just couldn't afford to be incapacitated like that. Another pill and I was fine.   I then saw another doctor who suggested that I had come off too fast. I ended up back on 37.5 mg a day. I am a full-time university student so I simply could not afford to try quitting again during school. But with two weeks to go before next semester, I have gone precisely 57 hours since my last pill. I hadn't planned to try to quit right now but (yes, this is stupid) I ran out of pills at the end of last week and just didn't get around to calling the doctor for a refill. Normally, I'm a little more responsible about such things but frankly, I really want to quit. The thing is, I'm feeling okay aside from being a little light-headed and pretty tired. Plus, I have a doctor's appointment in the morning - I should at least survive until then (hopefully). I'm hoping that I'm going to finally get off these things but I know that I could get hit with ugly symptoms at any time. Luckily, both my husband and I are off work and school respectively for the next two weeks so I can take naps if I need to and so far I have - I've slept away half of the last two days.  I'll post again and let you know how it's going. Wouldn't it be nice to have a success story on quitting Effexor?   Hopeful  P.S. Susie - I'd like to hear how you are doing, too.\n\n",

    "content": "Kendyl is absolutely right.  Nothing is textbook.  You have to listen to your own body and mind during this process.    If/When you begin to feel the withdrawal symptoms again, you need to get an Effexor that is scored you can go down slower.  Liquid would be the ultimate way to taper if it is available to you through any pharmacy.  Check with hospital out-patient pharmacies if needed.    I wish you the best of luck during this next attempt.  Total withdrawal is attainable and may it be quick for you.  Patience is not only a virtue, but a must during AD withdrawal for MANY.  Remember that in no way should you ever consider yourself as failing if you have to go back up just a bit.  It can be like dancing the 2-step...2 steps forward, one step back or even the other way around.  Eventually the goal will/can be reached.  And always keep your doc informed of everything you're feeling.  They may suggest going on another AD to help with the symptoms of Effexor withdrawal, but you do your research and have all of your questions answered before beginning anything new.\n\n",

    "content": "Kendyl, you are definitely not alone!!  It can be the most difficult situation a person has been through, making the original cause for going on the medication seem trivial.  I, in fact, am still going through the withdrawal process, 90% down from my original dosage.    I know it can be done.  I know it's incredibly hard for some of us.  I know the majority of the physician community needs more education in the problems that these medications are causing on a larger scale than they can imagine.  I am working on that through different lines, along with trying to offer support to those who need it along the way.  Banning the medications at this point would be detrimental to the world at this point.  Can you imagine the entire world (or the estimated 8 to 13% of the world on these medications) going through withdrawal all at the same time?      We have to get the education out to the general and medical public.  We have to get the drug companies to admit what they have known for years in their research.  It's going to be a long road.  Also, these medications have their place.  Counseling is a must during AD therapy as the medications do not CURE the problem.  So the problem must be gone before withdrawal has any chance.  Proper withdrawal must be worked with between the patient and the physician.    On the good side, physicians are beginning to listen and learn, through educational resources and through observations of their patients.  Progress is being made.    Best wishes to you and yours also!\n\n",

    "title": "No More Pills Please!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
    "content": "The situation that I am currently dealing with is one that I wouldnt wish on my worst enemy! About 6 years ago I was diagnosed with \"Anxiety disorder\" after collapsing in my local Wal-mart store. They recommended my taking Paxil and talking to a mediator/counselor. To no avail none of that worked so I decided to come off of paxil and take control of my life again. The side effects of those pills were so horrible that it felt like  I was constantly walking on a trampaline and and being shaken. I didnt want to talk or be around anyone. After finally dealing with it for 2 weeks I was O.K. again. (or at least i thought). About a year later my life became so topsy-turvy that I was too scared to leave the house, I wouldnt even check the mail alone. Finally my mom dragged  me to the doctor and she put me on Effexor XR 150mg. At first it seamed to work but I think its all in my head. So now I am trying to get off of this and never take pills again! Im not going back to the doctor this time because all they want to do is up my meds and keep me dosile. Thats not what I want. I want to live a normal life and have kids (which you cant do while taking Effexor RX). If you are reading this wondering wheather or not you should take pills, I would definatly not! To the doctors-what is your take on this? I don't think i had anxiety at all, just low blood sugar that morning. I beleave Paxil made me more anxious than I was prior to that eppisode.\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor Ignorance",
    "content": "About five years ago I went to my doctor for a routine check up for my thyroid.  My doctor was alarmed at my weight loss.  I am 5'6\" amd was about 110 pounds and 45 years old.  He asked me what was going on in my life.  I told him that my father was dying of a terminal illness and because I was very close to him, it had caused some anxiety.  My doctor suggested that I go on the anti-depressant Effexor.  I told him that I was not depressed.  He replied by saying that there is a fine line between anxiety and depression and I just needed to trust him.  So, I began taking 75MG a day.  After one month, I told my husband that I didn't feel any different, so I was going to quit taking them.  His reply shocked me.  He said, \"Please don't.  You seem so much happier and less irriated with _________ (our ADHD teen).\"  So, I said, \"Okay, if you see a difference, I'll take it for you and the kids.\"  After a year on the drug, I gained 30 pounds and I went to the doctor and said that I wanted to get off of the Effexor because I was actually starting to feel depressed.  I can't believe that I let him talk me into doubling my dosage, but soon I did start feeling normal again.  However, that year I put on an additional 30 pounds, for a total of a sixty pound gain!  I had to start wearing my mother's clothes and buying new ones.  Though I felt fine emotionally, I felt terrible about my appearance.  I also didn't like the fact that it totally took away my ability to enjoy sexual satisfaction.  So, I tried several times to wean myself off the drug, only to get headaches, nausea, funny brain sensations and incredible irritablility that was out of proportion to the situations that brought it on.  I made an appointment with my doctor to discuss this, and he told me that it was all my imagination because \"Effexor is little more than a vitamin.\"  Every time I tried to quit, I couldn't stand the nausea or irritablility that it caused and I'd go right back on it.  Then I started to search the internet and discovered that these symptoms were not all \"in my head.\"  I decided to ask my pharmacist for help and he suggested a slower program of withdrawl.  The first week, I cut my evening tablet in half, so that I was taking 3/4 of my daily dose.  After two days, I got an very upset stomach which lasted for several days, but I stuck it out because I wasn't having the irritablility.  The second week, I cut my evening dose in half again and again suffered stomach flu-like symptoms on and off throughout the week.  Yesterday, I started my third week and I totally eliminated my evening dose all together, so that I'm now taking only 75MG per day.  I expect that I won't feel wonderful this week either, but I'm going to follow through.  At this rate, I'm not experiencing the irritability at all.  Do you think that it's wise to keep going at this pace?  Am I going to quickly?  I start teaching 5th/6th grade the day after labor day and do not want to be sick when school starts.  Any suggestions for me would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Love2Teach~  This is my 3rd time trying to get off Effexor, and so far this has been the most tolerable to me. I'm opening up the capsules and removing some of the beads, I started with around 10-12 a week ago and I took out just over 30 today. I was on 150mg for a year, then last April my doctor talked me into more using the same theory, that it would help me sleep..blah..blah..blah. So since April I've been on 225mg.  The weight gain has been insane. I never had a weight issue in my life, was not so fit before I got pregnant with my now 3 year old, and since his birth I've gained nearly 50lbs. Just crazy. I too have no feelings, and sex is a joke (my poor husband!)  I think you have to do what is best for you on this, I think there is no perfect cutting back dose that covers everyone. I personally can't feel yucky, I have three kids, babysit two others, one of my children has autism, and I am in constant motion running him to his daily program and making sure that the afternoon one here at home goes smoothly, along with taking care of the rest of the family. I have to be at my best 120% of the time.  I don't want to tell you what to do, because I'm not you. I think you should listen to your body and adapt as you see fit. Good luck! I hope you are able to wean off successfully.\n\n",

If you come to a point where the withdrawal is too much to handle with the beginning of school, do not feel bad for going up a tad to get over the hump.  There is no withdrawal schedule set in stone anywhere.  You have to listen to your mind and body to know when you are ready for your next step down, or when that last step down may have been too much and you need to edge back up for a few days.    This goal can be reached and it's not fun for anyone.  Keep up your patience and courage, but be patient with yourself also.  Do what you need to do to make your return to school as pleasant as possible without the added anxiety of \"I have to complete this by such-in-such date!\"  Good luck and have a great year!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sanjeebk.dash,  I'm very sorry to hear of your troubles.  You may have symtpoms of depression, including your feelings of inadequacy, lack of confidence, dissatisfaction with your job and your life, and your loneliness.  It would be a good idea to see a doctor and discuss the possiblility of an antidepressant.  Most take 2 to 4 weeks to begin to be effective, and then a few months to resolve your depressive symptoms.  An antidepressant should not be stopped abruptly, and you should try not to miss any doses.  When it's time to stop the medication, it should be slowly decreased in dosage until you can stop it altogether, over a period of at least 3 to 4 weeks.  It may also benefit you to see a therapist, to find ways to overcome your shyness and dissatisfaction with yourself.  If you feel better about yourself, you may find you feel better about your job - at least until you find a different one.  If it's possible, discuss revising your position with your supervisor, or inquire if there are other positions in the company for which you might qualify.    There are other things you can do, as well.  Starting a regular exercise program, such as walking or jogging daily, will boost the neurohormones in your brain, which will help to offset your depressive symptoms.  Are there evening classes in which you might be interested?  Do you have a church that has activities you could join?  Perhaps a local bookstore has a reading discussion group that would interest you.  Taking the first step is the most difficult.  While it is easy for us to worry about what others may think, generally people do not stop to think about what you are doing - they are more concerned with their own worries.  If they actually do judge you, you do not have to accept their judgment of you.  We are all worthy persons.  You might benefit from reading books about building confidence and finding self-acceptance, and following their guidelines.  There are many, and are readily found in libraries and bookstores.  Make finding one a first step on your journey to developing more confidence.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have tried several antidepressants for the last 20 years and nothing seems to work. I was diagnosed with chronic depression, and recently with Attention Deficit Disorder (ADD). The doctor who diagnosed it is giving me Ritaline. It is making me feel better only because I seem to be able to concentrate better at work. However, my anxiety and obsessive negative thoughts are still there taking over rampantly. Is there an antidepressant that works together with Ritaline? (I know tricyclics should not be mixed with Ritaline). Is it OK to stop taking Ritaline during the days I am not working (holidays and Sundays)? My doctor says better not to, but I would like a second opinion. I would like to reduce Ritaline intake as much as possible because side effects are supposed to be horrible. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Martine,  Yes, there are antidepressants that are used with Ritalin, generally those known as SSRIs, or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  Your doctor would be the best person to select the specific SSRI, as there are several.  Your doctor is correct that it is not a good idea to stop and start Ritalin, as it would result in inconsistent blood levels and thus inconsistent effect.  If you are not having side effects now from the dosage you are taking, it's not likely that they'll occur from taking the medication consistently.  Most side effects happen when they person is taking the higher dosages, or if they become ill, as with a cold or flu.  If you become ill, consult with your doctor about what to do about your medication dosage.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I need to know about \"Antidepressant Discontinuation Syndrome\".  I have been on so many different antidepressants since I was 16...I am currently 30.  As of the middle of June this year I decided to stop taking any more medication.  I contacted my psychiatrist's office and they said to take half of what I was taking for a week and then I would be done.  I was taking Celexa (40mg) and Trileptal (300mg).  I did what they said and what sick as a dog the week after.  My husband cut the pills in fourths and I took that until the beginning of July.  Then, because I was still dealing with withdrawls, my husband called and got 7, 10mg Celexa.  We then cut those into fourths and the Trileptal in eighths.  As of last week I tried to go completely off the meds yet I'm still experiencing really bad withdrawal symptoms.  My symptoms: dizzy, light headed, headaches, nausea, diarrhea after every meal, exhausted and a general feeling of not feeling good.  Could I be just very sensitive to getting off this medication? Or could there be something else going on?  Any comments and/or answers would be so appreciated....I have missed work and felt like this summer has completely been wasted dealing with this issue.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: antidepressant discontinuation syndrome",
    "content": "Hello georgiaonmymind,  Trileptal is usually given for control of partial seizures.  It should not be discontinued quickly, due to the risk of increased seizure activity.  It is usually withdrawn very slowly, and is often replaced by another anti-seizure medication.  Aside from the risk of seizures, the primary withdrawal symptom is insomnia.  The medication is not addicting, and there is no reason it should not be taken indefinitely.  Sodium levels should be monitored while taking the medication.  Low sodium in the body can result in significant weakness, nausea, vomiting, fatigue, loss of appetite, restlessness, irritability, muscle weakness, spasms or cramps, seizures, cardiac irregularities, and decreased consciousness or coma.  Celexa is one of the antidepressants that create the most difficulty in withdrawal.  It should be done very slowly, and sometimes requires as much as a year for all symptoms to resolve.  If a person is having significant problems, the medication should be restarted and withdrawn more slowly.  Withdrawal symptoms can include anxiety, tremors, visual disturbances, visual hallucinations, restlessness, nausea, vomiting, muscle and joint pain, dizziness, fatigue, headache, lethargy, weakness, unstable gait, insomnia, flu-like symptoms, electric-like \"zap\" feelings, tingling sensation and/or irritability.  For the best outcome, it should be replaced by another antidepressant and then taper that medication slowly downward.   The anti-depressants that are the least likely to produce such withdrawal effects are Serzone, Wellbutrin, Remeron and Prozac. All drug withdrawal should be monitored and supervised by a physician, usually over a period of at least 2 to 4 weeks.  Many psychiatrists titrate all psychoactive medications over a period of months rather than weeks.  I can appreciate the desire to discontinue medications, but would like to point out that if a medication is needed for an individual's best function and stability, it seems the best judgment to continue taking it.  Just as a diabetic needs insulin or oral anti-hyperglycemic medications for the long term, some persons with issues as chronic depression, anxiety or partial seizures may also need medications for the long term.   At your age, medications during pregnancy may be a concern.  There are medications that are considered safe for use during pregnancy, and your obstetrician/gynecologist can provide guidance about the best medications in your specific situation.    I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

It has been over 8 days since taking a Lexapro ( I am starting to think the Lexapro is NOT the cause of the tingling/burning)  A few nights ago the burning and tingling was so intense I wanted to go the E.R. but thought I would try and hold off on doing this.  Right now my face feels incredibly tight like after a bad sunburn.  These burning/tingling feelings are still in my legs but I can also feel them in random parts of my arms.  This is driving me out of my mind!!!  I called my GP today, but he is on vacation till next week and I don't want to deal with who he left on call.  I feel like ripping the skin off of my face.

    "title": "Re: lexapro/burning tingling sensations",
    "content": "Hello beez1953,  One of the potential side effects of Lexapro is paresthesia, which is a tingling, burning sensation.  Leg pain is also a potential side effect.  Most people don't experience these side effects, but they do occur in a small percentage of persons taking Lexapro.  The sensations can also be due to or exacerbated by an anxiety condition.  The medication effects are expected to diminish with time, generally over a period of 2 to 4 weeks.  An alternate medication is usually prescribed to address the initial underlying condition of depression and/or anxiety, which also will help diminish the parasthesias.      If your situation is due to Lexapro, it is one of the most severe I have happened to hear about.  You may have a sensitivity to it and are having an allergic reaction to it.  It's possible that you have a medical condition that is causing the symptoms, such as an autoimmune condition, but that seems unlikely as such a coincidental onset would be highly unusual.  You really do need to see a physician for treatment of the possible allergic reaction, which probably would involve epinephrine and/or a course of prednisone.  Since the symptoms are increasing, it is extremely risky to wait for your usual doctor, as you could develop respiratory difficulties that are very serious.  Vitamins B6 and B12 are known to be helpful with relieving parasthesias, but would not be at all sufficient if you are having an allergic reaction.    I encourage you to see a physician as soon as possible.  Going to urgent care or an emergency room is justified in this situation.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Im going to a regular family practice Dr and he doesnt seem too knowledgeable about the medications I need.  Im taking 30mg of Paxil and have been doing so with minimal issues for 5 years.   Ive been battling with weight gain ever since I got on the medication.  Ive finally had enough and he wants me to switch to Effexor.  But he told me I could just flat out stop taking the paxil and start the Effexor.  Which I can not do.  I have horrible withdrawl symptoms if I try to stop the paxil so Ive cut my pills in half and have been taking 15mg for a week now.  I do not use drugs of any kind aside from this and Im a little nervous about starting something new.  Is it safe to take both pills at once?  How long do I need to continue taking the paxil while Im on the effexor?  I had also talked the the pharmacist about this when I picked up my pills.  The Dr gave me effexor xr 75mg and I can not afford to spend $100 a month on pills, so he gave me the regular effexor 75mg taking them once a day.  The pharmacist thought one pill a day was unusual so I feel really lost right now.  Any help is greatly appreciated!  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi MorganS,  Firstly, a preferred way to switch your medications is to gradually introduce the Effexor while gradually tapering the Paxil, over a period of 4-6 weeks.   Second, do not take the regular Effexor just once a day, your total daily dose should be taken divided into three doses evenly over your waking hours, as the medication washes out of your body quickly.   Thirdly, many people prefer not to use Effexor, as it can be very difficult to be tapered off of; you might discuss this with your doctor. It is a fine medicine that can be used safely, it just needs a very gradual, slow taper when one goes off of it.   Good luck!       -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I am in the same situation. I have been on Paxil (40mg) for ten years now, and it worked as a miracle for me, I didn't gain a pound, and I was myself again, until recently, I think it's just not working anymore. So my doctor prescribed 0.5mg Clonazepam, because I was experiencing huge panic attacks again (due to bad economy and financial issues).      4 days ago he suggested to start taking Effexor, 75mg (one pill a day), and keeping the Clonazepam for reducing side effects while switching.   I did some research, and I found out that you can't take Paxil and Effexor together, because Paxil is an SSRI, and Effexor is SSNI, so I stopped Paxil cold turkey, while starting taking Effexor, along with Clonazepam. Today was the first time I experienced withdrawals, electric shock feeling and a little dizziness, and I know how horrible the withdrawals are from Paxil, and I just found out that Effexor is pretty much the same, so I am not sure what to do now, I don't want to go bipolar and crazy, with the Paxil I felt perfect, never had any problem with it, until it just stopped working..   How am I going to switch to Effexor if I can't take it with Paxil and slowly taper off, or maybe I should just ask for Lexapro or something that wouldn't effect me so bad when quitting?\n\n",

    "content": "Morgan and Tia,   As Dr. Siegle said, you can take them together.  What he is describing is a cross-taper and if you are going to switch it is the best way.  Don't ever let a Dr. tell you that you can quit and SSRI's, SNRI's, NDRI's, etc without tapering off and please if you do taper off, cross tapering, or you are in the process of quitting be prepared for a long journey.  It's like losing weight, how ironic huh?  You need to be prepared to go through a long journey which could be a year, worst case scenario.  I do want to make a point though.  Paxil can be lowered to a dosage that affects weight and mood minimally so if you are tapering down and not going through withdrawal but are experiencing severe depression, or anxiety again, consider that you may not be ready.  So many people attribute this to the drug but it is more possible that not a manifestation of continuing stressors that have to be tackled before you will have the ability to be free of these medications that treat a very definable disease.  I know that the side affects seem to outweigh the risks of quitting but I think that this is just the reality that you are regaining control of your emotions and your feelings while you are in treatment.  As well remember that it is very unlikely that a Dr. is going to give you a toxic cocktail of drugs.  The amount of reference material available nowadays is phenomenal.  If you are doing your own research please be careful.  Look at peer reviewed case studies in medical journals and learn the lingo.  I could do an interaction search online this instant and find drugs.com to say one thing and 100 other sites to say something else.    best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Courtsly82,  Congratulations on your plan to join the military.  I hope it works out for you.    Bupropion has a relatively short half-life, or the time it takes for about half of the medication to clear from your body, of 8 to 24 hours.  It takes about 4 weeks to reach therapeutic levels in your bloodstream when you first take the medication, which is usually established by increasing the dosage during that time.  To discontinue the medication, it needs to be tapered downward and should not be stopped abruptly.  The general recommendation is to taper downward over a period of 2 to 3 weeks.  Recently reported experiences suggest that taking a bit longer is good for a successful result.  You didn't mention the dosage that you are taking, but the guideline is to reduce the dosage amount every 3 to 4 days in increments as even as you can make them.  If you doctor hasn't returned your call, it would be a good idea to leave a message regarding how you plan to taper off the medication so that he or she will be aware of it.    If you have symptoms of depression (feelings of sadness, tearfulness, loss of enjoyment or interest in usual activities, sleep problems of either too much, too little, or disrupted sleep, unplanned weight gain or loss, unusual fatigue, feelings of self-harm, associated physical symptoms such as backache, headache or general malaise, irritability, or any unusual problems), discontinuing the medication is not advisable.  If after you discontinue the medication you experience recurring symptoms, you should notify your doctor right away.    Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Discontinuation syndrome",
    "content": "Hello, I am a female, age 44, am currently on Lexapro, have a history of fairly severe degenerative issues in my neck and depression from a very early age...though I didn't seek treatment for the depression until my early 30's. I had been on and off Zoloft for about 7 years with a couple times on Prozac when the Zoloft stopped working. Several years ago I tried Wellbutrin in an attempt to quit smoking and went off the Zoloft over two weeks while working my dose up on Wellbutrin...that's when I found out I had MAJOR discontinuation syndrome. I spent an entire month with the dizziness, nausea, and other symptoms I hear people talk about but my worst symptom was the \"zapping\"...for lack of a better description. I literally felt like someone was poking me with a cattle prod (can't tell I'm out west, huh?)...it started in the middle of my chest and ran in every direction from the top of my head to the tips of my toes and fingers about every 10 to 15 seconds. I waited for almost a month for the symptoms to show any sign of diminishing but I finally had to beg my doctor to put me back on Zoloft because I couldn't stand it any more...the symptoms went away within 48 hours of restarting. A little over a year ago I decided I wanted to go off the Zoloft because I didn't want to be held hostage and I was told Lexapro had less chance of the same issues I had with the Zoloft. My psychiatrist started me on Lexapro and, over the course of about a year, weaned me off the Zoloft. I had some minor issues each time the dose was changed for a day or two but successfully made the change completely about 6 months ago. About a month ago my work schedule became irratic and I managed to miss a dose but didn't realize it until about 12 hours after the missed dose when the zapping started again. Is it very common for people to have this much trouble even when they've done everything right...in terms of weaning off the meds VERY slowly...and for the symptoms to hang on as long as they did that first time? Is it possible for these kinds of antidepressants to be covering up nerve issues? I ask that because of the neck problems and the fact that I do have (as of my last MRI a year ago) some stenosis in my neck. I also had an uncle who died last September from peripheral nerve sheath sarcoma (my mothers brother)...not that I think I have it but it makes me wonder about nerve issues since he had trouble with mild discomfort when people rubbed his skin even before the cancer and I seem to have similar issues on occassion. Any information, suggestions, or comments would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for offering this forum...it's nice to be able to ask questions and get a variety of information. Sincerely, Aimee\n\n",

    "content": "Discontinuation syndrome can rear its ugly head in many ways.  According to a study performed several years ago at Harvard, around 70% of patients will experience moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms if they stop the medication abruptly.  As you have come to learn, slow withdrawal can ease the symptoms to a tolerable state.  The cattle prod - always my exact description of the zaps.  In my experience and many I know in Paxil-related cases feel these starting in their head and eventually zapping throughout the body at the frequency you describe.  Everything you describe is not unusual.  You have to listen to your brain and body during the withdrawal process, possibly going slower, with smaller drops or even at times being able to go a little quicker.  There is no magic time schedule.    Fatigue also triggers withdrawal symptoms.  Be sure to get plenty of rest - even a catnap of about 20 minutes during the day if you are able.  Controlled breathing.  Removing yourself from a difficult situation until your nerves and symptoms have calmed down.  As for the skin issues - Extended use of these medications 'can' bring on symptoms of fibromyalgia and/or rheumatoid arthritis - although testing will prove that neither exist in the patient.  During withdrawal all senses become over-sensitive - especially light, sound and touch.  There are also reports of phantom smells and tastes.  Odd, but true.  There can be a restlessness felt (akathisia), or the feeling that something is crawling all over and under the skin.  Again, this diminishes over time.    On a good note, successful tapering is attainable.  The further away from your last dose, the more the symptoms diminish.  There will be ups and downs, but the ups become longer and you have to hold on to the memories of the 'ups' to get through the down times.  Psychotherapy and/or counseling should be utilized during this time to learn coping skills.    Anyone going through this should keep in very close contact with their physician.  Others may have no problems at all, but those who do experience discontinuance syndrome need to know that it's not all in their head - it is very real, but can be overcome with proper support and education.\n\n",

I had been told by one doctor it was simply anxiety and another it was the side effects from the Wellbutrin (one at an urgent care clinic and the other a family doctor).  I do have one other question if you find this and have a moment...and have an answer. Is it likely that having discontinuation syndrome on one medication can make me more suseptible to it on another? My psychiatrist, while she didn't doubt my telling her I also had it on Lexapro, said she had never heard of anyone having it with this particular medication. Thank you again De Lyn for your reply and reassurance and have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!\n\n",

    "content": "Tapering is necessary on all of these medications after they have been taken for more than a couple of weeks.  The shorter time a person has been on them, the shorter time it should take to taper off.  No, I cannot say that the occurence of discontinuation syndrome from one medication signals that the person will have it with all of these medications.  There are some medications that have worse track records than others.  Wellbutrin is actually a different class of drug than Lexapro, so the effects and withdrawal may not be similar, but it does have to be tapered also.  It seems hypocritical that an anti-anxiety/depression medication could cause the symptoms to increase, but it is true.  Also, it must be noted that switching medications will not ease withdrawal from the one being stopped.    Lexapro seems to one of the medications with the least reported cases of moderate to severe withdrawal symptoms, although there have been numerous cases reported.  The key is to educate yourself on what could happen, but do not 'expect' them to happen.  Know that rest is important when tapering off of any of these medications.  Keep tabs on how you are feeling and don't rush yourself.  You will have a good idea when you are ready for a drop and you can always slow down if needed.    I hope I helped more than confused with my answers.  Best wishes to you and thank you for the good wishes!  De Lyn\n\n",

    "content": "4PtSake:  Hello, and Merry Christmas!  I'm sorry I wasn't able to get to your post sooner, it did not show up on my list of \"unanswered questions.\"  Very slow tapering off antidepressants that utilize serotonin for their mechanism of action is indeed necessary.  The antidepressants in this category that are in common use today include the SSRIs and a new class called the SNRIs.  SSRIs include: fluvoxamine (Luvox) paroxetine (Paxil) fluoxetine (Prozac) sertraline (Zoloft) citalopram (Celexa), and escitalopram (Lexapro).  The SNRIs include: venlafaxine (Effexor) duloxetine (Cymbalta)  The discontinuation syndrome that is commonly experienced is actually properly called the serotonin discontinuation (or withdrawal) syndrome (not the same as serotonin syndrome, which refers to excess serotonin in the system).  Notice that bupropion (Wellbutrin) is not on either list.  This is because it has no action on serotonin.  It works by increasing the amount of norepinephrine and dopamine that is available to nerve cells.  There is no discontinuation syndrome associated with this medication, and it would not be of any use to help ease the withdrawal symptoms of a medicine that has serotonergic actions.  Other antidepressants that use serotonin in their mechanism of action can help ease the symptoms of withdrawal from another of this class of medications.  For example, a switch to a medicine within the same class that has a longer half-life is often used to help.  One anti-depressant with a VERY long half-life is fluoxetine (Prozac).  However, because it's half-life is so long, you would have to take Prozac for approximately 2 weeks before you stopped the other anti-depressant.  At that point, one could decrease the first anti-depressant relatively quickly (4 weeks vs. 6 months), because the Prozac is on board and it does use serotonin for its action.  After the first anti-depressant has been completely tapered off, the Prozac can be discontinued, with no tapering.  No taper is required because it has such a long half-life--it tapers itself, so-to-speak, and it does it very slowly.  This method works so well that it is common practice in the area in which I practice.  Some doctors don't like this method, however, and you would need to consult with your physician to find out her preferences.  Escitalopram (Lexapro) does not commonly produce a discontinuation syndrome because it's half-life is much longer than that of paroxetine (Paxil) or venlafaxine (Effexor).  I will answer your other questions about the nerve problems a little bit later.  I'm afraid I've run out of time for right now.\n\n",

    "content": "4PtSake:  I am now addressing your concers about nerves.  Generally, the SSRIs are thought to act mostly in the central nervous system (CNS), which refers to the brain and spinal cord.  We do know, however, that there are effects in other parts of the body, for example, in the platelets.  The newest of the antidepressants, duloxetine (Cymbalta), of the SNRI class, does have the additional indication of treatment of diabetic peripheral neuropathy.  For the purposes of this discussion, I am simply pointing out that Cymbalta is known to have widespread effects on the nervous system--both CNS and peripheral nervous system (PNS).  I think there is a possiblity that the condition you mentioned having to do with your neck may have sensitized you to the serotonin discontinuation syndrome.  I think you should see your physician as soon as possible--whoever follows up with nerve condition.  In addition, unless there is a compelling reason for you to stop escitalopram (Lexapro), I think staying with that medicine as regularly as you can would be worthwhile, at least until you are advised about the nerve condition.  Please drop back in and let us know how you're doing.  Happy Holidays!\n\n",

About 1 year ago I feel that my Paxil stopped working for me. I started using Pain medication recreationally to counteract the horrible anxiety/agitation that I was feeling on a daily basis. (Restlessness, constant worry, and general uneasy feeling at all times) The recreational use turned into a habit which quickly turned into an addiction. Now that i am clean and sober the problem with my Paxil not working is starting to take over again. My question is- Is there a medication that is known to work better after a substance abuse/ addiction? The anxiety is actually worse now than it was before I was taking drugs recreationally. Sometimes I feel like totally coming out of my skin and wonder if a anti psychotic would do more good than a anti anxiety medication. Please if anyone has experience with drug addiction and anti anxiety/depressants or even anti psychotics. Then let me know.  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello eighty6more,  Congratulations on your hard work in dealing with your addiction issue!  I apologize that this response is so late, but will provide some information in hope that it may be useful to you and to others who read your post.  There are several alternatives to Paxil, and there are several antipsychotic medications available, as well.  Whether or not they are more effective with addiction issues may depend on your individual metabolism and chemistry.  If you haven't discussed your issue in detail with your doctor, it's extremely important that you do it as soon as you can.  Never mix alcohol with prescribed medications, and you are already aware of what can happen when combining different medications.  If you feel you haven't been able to explain your concerns well enough to your doctor, write them down just as you did in this forum, and take it with you to your next appointment.  It may be helpful for you to keep a daily record of your symptoms and concerns, including what the symptom is, what time it started, what you were doing when it started or just before it started, how long it lasted, what helped or made it worse, any thoughts on why you think the Paxil isn't working, and any other information you think is important.  Take your record with you to all appointments with the doctor who prescribes the Paxil for you.  It can help you be sure that you're clearly communicating your concerns to your doctor, and it can help your doctor see what is happening in your life in regard to how effective the Paxil is or isn't.  Your doctor would then have more information to use in deciding on any alterations in dosage or in medications.  And as you know, always take prescribed medications exactly as the doctor orders, at the same time(s) each day.  I hope this is helpful to you.    Good luck!\n\n",

However, I also started weaning off Zoloft 50 mg a few days ago and had a really horrible night of sleep with strange dreams and auditory hallucinations last night.  Today I feel rather dizzy with slight vertigo.  Should I wean off one at a time?  If so, which one is better to wean off first.  What\u2019s a good tapering schedule for Zoloft?   With the Klonopin, I\u2019ve been tapering off \u00bc of a pill every 7 days and that seems to be working for me.  I also started acupunture, on fourth session, which is why I decided to wean off the meds.  I cannot tolerate psychiatric drugs very well as they cause more anxiety/insomnia.\n\n",

It is never a good idea to titrate off medication without the direction and supervision of a doctor.  Most doctors prefer to decrease only one medication at a time, so that if there are undesired effects of the decrease, he or she would know what medication dosage to adjust or replace.   General guidelines are to decrease the medication according to the person's tolerance, which is usually over a period of 2 to 4 weeks for most medications.  There are many medications that a doctor may use, so if one isn't effective or has negative effects, another may be used successfully.  Finding the best medication or combination of medications can be a matter of trial and error, in order to best meet the individual patient's tolerance.  Good luck to all.\n\n",

Last year, the doctor suggested I reduce the dose (to 300mg daily) to see whether extra tiredness was caused by high dosage. Within six weeks I had a return to many of the symptoms of earlier times and this affected my work performance, so as to be noticeable to my supervisor. What is your advice in regard to the dosage. (I am very happy with the medication because it enables me to work full time with minimal anxiety and no depression.) My anxiety levels since I started working again in January 2004 have gradually been reducing although not consistently so. Is it dangerous for me to continue to take Effexor XR at such high dosages.  PS I have no physical symptoms and my doctor regularly monitors my health.\n\n",

Effexor is an effective antidepressant that is given in varying dosages, according to the individual needs and tolerance of the person receiving the medication.  Generally, the maximum daily dose is considered to be 225mg, but for moderate depression may be as high as 375mg, according to the manufacturer's guidelines.  However, in individual cases, physicians have prescribed higher dosages, up to 600mg daily, usually in divided dosages.  The safety and effectiveness of such high dosages must be monitored by the prescribing physician.  The focus of such monitoring would include increases in blood pressure, impaired altertness, weight loss, kidney function and suicidal thoughts.  I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Mental Health Meds Related to Being Weight Loss Resistent",
    "content": "Firstly I thank you in advance for reading this. I am desperate for support and suggestions.I have taken mental health meds for approximately 10 years to assist with depression and anxiety. I gain weight on all of them I have tried.I was told by my mental health professional that I have now tried them all and am considered weight loss resistent. Recently I read a book written by a popular doctor and several other doctors and mental health professionals. They also address  the term weight loss resistent . They stated that no matter how much one exercises and or eats a super healthy diet they will not lose weight.  Supposedly this happens for about 15% of people.  I know only two other people that are also currently dealing with this. One of them is a marathon runner and works as a dietican. She too cannot take off even 5 pounds. The doctors writing the book offer no specific solutions for this type of weight gain challenge other than to try other meds.  I am 46 and get at least three hours of vigorous activity each day. I eat a low fat diet that is made up of fruits, fiber, veggies, beans, fish and small amounts of meat. I have lived a super healthy life style since in my 20's. My father died at 51 and I have already outlived my grandparents. Prevention has always been a top priority in my life and I actually enjoy lots of exercise esp. outdoor work . Eating super healthy is not hard for me. I teach a weekly class on  basic healthy food choices at a local treatment center for women in recovery. I actually eat less while on meds as I feel so much better. Four months ago I gave up all sugar and do not eat any foods high in sodium. At times I have tried to come off meds and use holistic measures to manage my mental health issues as I am trained in holistic practices. During these times I am able to take weight off easily but all the holistic practices still don't take care of my anxiety and depression. On my last time off meds I ended up in the hospital after months of being off the meds. As hard as it is I have found a bit of acceptance with needing to take meds. I just can't accept the fact that there is nothing I can do to take off even 5-10 pounds. I feel out of control and being out of control is starting to control me.  I have also had ever test under the sun to determine if there are other factors that cause the weight gain.  I have spent thousands of dollars on tests, vitamins, supplements, alternative treatments etc... The 40 to 50 extra pounds really,really scare scare me esp. as I get older and think about my family history. The extra pounds also are just so hard to carry on my small frame. I never had a weight issue in my life. People called me \"TOOTHPICK\" I only wish I would hear that these days while walking down the street.  HONESTLY I have to stay so active each day and maintain a super healthy diet in order to not go over my current weight gain.  My husband says I am starving myself but this is the guy who went on mental health meds and lost weight despite eating large amounts of food. Ya that sucks.The cruel comments others make also hurts my self worth. No doctor has ever been able to help with this issue. I know that I am a bit obbsessed by my exercise and food choices and could be considered to have an addiction to physical activity and a possible  eating disorder.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, lillymae,  I'm sorry to hear of your distressing time.  The category \"weight loss resistant\" is applied to persons who, despite all efforts, are not able to lost weight.  The contributing factors that have been suggested are thyroid deficiency, estrogen/progesterone imbalances, excess cortisol levels, insulin resistance (resistace to one's own insulin), food allergies, disruption in intestinal bacteria levels/balance, and \"toxic burden\".  Toxic burden refers to environmental metals, toxins, or medications.  Hormonal deficiencies can be measured and are addressed by replacement therapy; insulin resistance is often successfully treated with Glucophage, a diabetic medication;  and intestinal bacterial levels can be assessed via laboratory tests.  Some doctors also recommend a basal metabolism test.  The best approach is to discuss it again with your doctor and review the information you have given.  Perhaps you and your doctor can work together to achieve a balance between medication and holistic practices with which you have had success in the past.  I sincerely hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

Although B vitamins are available without a prescription, as with any over the counter medication there can be negative interactions with prescribed medications.

    "content": "Hello, jixos,  I apologize for the tardiness of this response.  I hope that information about your concern will still be useful to you, and to others who may read your post.  Seroxat (generic name paroxetine) is in the class of antidepressant/psychoactive medications known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).  When first given, it may take 2 to 3 weeks for the full benefits of the drug to be established.  When dosages are altered, either upward or downward, it can also take days to up to 2 weeks for the change in response to take hold, depending on the person's metabolism.  In some people, when a therapeutic level has been established and symptoms are controlled, reducing the medication interrupts the action of the drug to the point that when it is again increased, slightly more of the medication may be required to achieve the previous level of effectiveness.  As with all prescribed medications, the dosage should never be altered without the advice and supervision of a doctor.  With OCD, the optimal dosage can be as much as 40mg daily.  Maximum dosage is 60mg daily.  The person taking Seroxat should never combine the drug with alcohol and it should never be stopped abruptly.    I hope you are doing well.\n\n",

    "title": "Ibuprofen as Anti-Depressant? What does this mean??",
    "content": "I'm 27, male, and generally in very good health, I'm quite fit, etc., get at most one cold a year and then it's mild. I play tennis, lift weights, etc.; however, I notice that I have a lot of the symptoms of depression. This is in spite of the fact that I don't feel \"sad.\" Nevertheless, I have insomnia, extreme irritability (at times), pain and stiffness in my upper back and neck (it's not there all the time, e.g., when I'm working out, but it appears often and the pain/spasms become very strong at night and when I'm sleeping for example), fatigue, and at certain times of the day inability to focus mentally, blurred vision, and symptoms that might come close to dysthymia and anhedonia. There's no fever, etc., or anything like that, and this has been coming and going for a while.  If I take 3 ibuprofen these symptoms all go away. This is very strange to me. I'm thinking one of two things. Either a) ibuprofen and anti-inflammatories in fact can act as anti-depressants...there are many new links being discovered between depression and chronic inflammation; therefore I am \"depressed\"; or, which worries me more, b) I'm not depressed; these symptoms are caused in fact by chronic inflammation, which is why the ibuprofen works so well with me. In that case, I don't even know what the solution would be.  I should add that I drink a lot of coffee and have a very irregular sleep schedule; for some time I thought this was the cause of my symptoms. But there are weeks when drinking large amounts of coffee and getting little sleep doesn't affect me like this. By contrast, I slept almost 11-12 hrs last night and it did nothing to make me feel better until I took 3 ibuprofen a few hours ago.  My main concern then is, \"What does it mean if you have depression-like symptoms, but ibuprofen can clear these up?\" I should add that taking ibuprofen doesn't cause some mild shift--it's really like a powerful transformation, it restores my energy, uplifts my mood, enhances my field of vision, I'm able to think and work again. Any thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

I'll provide some information in hope that it might still be useful to you, and to any others who may read your post.  Some of your symptoms could be considered as indicators of a depressive disorder, although other symptoms would also be present in an actual major depression.  Having some depressive symptoms often occurs with chronic pain and/or tension.  Pain definitely can have a negative effect on enjoyment of usual activities and energy levels. Your observation that chronic inflammation may be a possibility appears to be the most likely explanation, based on the results you get from ibuprofen.  To date, there has been no correlation identified between ibuprofen and antidepressant medications.  If you haven't seen your doctor for evaluation of your disrupting symptoms, it would be a very good idea to do so.  Leaving an inflammatory condition untreated can result in more damage to the tissue that's involved.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

I'll provide some information in hope that it may be useful to you in the future, or to others who may read your post.    It is never a good idea to discontinue a medication without a doctor's advice and supervision.  This is especially true when the medication is a psychotropic medication like Abilify.  Abilify has a half-life, or how quickly the medication clears from the person's body, of about 75 hours in a person with average metabolism.  This means that withdrawal symptoms could be noticed rather quickly, and would become more noticeable as time progressed as the person continued to decrease the medication.  Withdrawing too quickly can cause serious physical symptoms.  One of the known side effects of Abilify is \"flu-like syndrome\", which is what you describe.  Withdrawal of the medication can intensify a side-effect when it is done too quickly.  That's one of the reasons it is so important to alter medication dosages only with the advice and supervision of a doctor.    I wish you the best of luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Zyrexa, Xanax, Ambien, Klonopin, Lamictal - Is this safe?",
    "content": "I have a friend who started having symptoms of depression and anxiety at the onset of menopause.  She was referred to a psychiatrist about two months or so ago.  The psychiatrist prescribed Abilify for the first month, then switched her to Zyprexa.  The psychiatrist also prescribed Xanax, Ambien, Klonopin, & Lamictal. In addition my friend is taking Estradiol and micronized progesterone caplets. I saw her today and my bright, bubbly friend looks like a zombie!  I'm very concerned about the effects this chemical cocktail has had on her.  She has lost weight, she was shaking, her affect is very flat, she seemed confused and unable to focus or concentrate.  My question is this:  Are all those drugs safe together and is this a typical doctor's  response to depression and anxiety brought on by menopause?  I'm very concerned for her well-being, as she admitted that she has begun having some very 'bad thoughts'.  In addition, her psychiatrist, after putting her on all these drugs, is now saying she can no longer afford to see my friend, who started seeing the psychiatrist because she was offering her services pro bono.  However, the psychiatrist has not given my friend any information regarding whether she should continue on the drugs she (the psychiatrist) put her on, which are not helping and have turned my friend into someone I no longer recognize, nor has she been helpful in helping my friend find another doctor.  Should my friend continue these drugs or not? What will happen if she stops? Any advice you can give will be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Churchlady,  I apologize that this response is so late in coming.  I hope your friend's situation has resolved and that she is now doing well.  I'll provide some information in case it would be helpful to her and to other readers.  It's unusual for Abilify or Zyprexa to be prescribed along with Xanax, Ambien, Klonopin and Lamictal all at the same time, without a period of progression.  It does occasionally happen in cases of severe depression with suicidal thoughts and the person is very closely monitored by the physician.  When multiple medications are prescribed, the additions often happen over time so that the physician can see fully see the effect of the original prescription and the additional medications before adding others.  The estradiol and progesterone probably would not contribute to the symptoms that you have described.  It's very unfortunate that the relationship between your friend and her psychiatrist altered at a critical time.  Whether your friend's type of response to the medications is through over-medicating or not, it's never a good idea to stop them abruptly or without medical supervision.  Public community mental health agencies often base their charges on the person's ability to pay (\"sliding scale\"), and both psychiatric and psychological treatment would be available.  In any case, it's essential that a person in your friend's situation see a physician as soon as possible.  While the person may prefer to see a psychiatrist, an attending physician is certainly able to help her with her medication status.  Good luck to your friend, and to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there I was diagnosed with ME in 2006 and was put onto Venlalaxine to alleviate the tiredness and fuzzy head. This drug worked wonders. My maximum dose was 150mg. I became pregnant but at this time I was only on 37.5 mgs. Withdrawal was hell but at the time I never knew that's what it was. I assumed I had terrible morning sickness.   In 2008 I went back on the drug for the same tiredness symptoms. This time only up to 75mg. I am now trying to get off again. I am currently cutting in half the 37.5mg pill after taking the 37.5 mg full pill for 2 months. The problem is I'm struggling to do anything and my head is feeling like those cartoon characters you see when their head leaves their body then pop back into it.   I'm scared to be on this for life in case the drug stops working - can this happen? Also, I want advice how to stop the drug without such withdrawal symptoms. If I stop all of a sudden how long till all symptoms subside?  Many thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, mojomands,  I'm not exactly sure what diagnosis you are referring to as \"M.E.\" since there are several possibilities.  Since that is the case, my answer will have to be somewhat general in nature.  First, abrupt withdrawl from any antidepressant - and many other medications - is distinctly contraindicated.  Symptoms become much worse very rapidly, and some can be life threatening.  Discontinue such medications only with medical supervision on a progressive, downward titration per your doctor's recommendations.  I can understand your concern about having to take a medication for life, but would like to suggest that if you had diabetes and taking the appropriate medication, you would not question the need to take it for the rest of your life.  You may not have to in your situation, but if you do, it's the same principle.  If your current medication stops being effective, there are a number of alternatives.  It would be helpful to both you and your doctor if you would maintain a record of your symptoms, including what the symptoms are, when they occur, how long they last, and what you are doing when they happen, plus any other things you might notice about them.  Keep it at least daily, and take it with you to every appointment with your doctor.  Such a record can be invaluable in determining the best medication for you, as well as to identify any pattern or other significant issues.    I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, lindseyjm,  As you have discovered, Venlaflaxine, or Effexor, can be very difficult to discontinue.  Some authorities consider it to be the second most difficult of the antidepressants to withdraw from.  The only way to discontinue it is to go as slowly as you have been doing, or even more slowly.  Unfortunately, it sometimes requires going back onto the medication or an alternative antidepressant, and then proceeding very cautiously in the withdrawal process.  Some people have reported having difficulty for a year after discontinuing the medication.  Individual symptoms/side effects of withdrawal can be modified by supportive medication.  I understand your frustration with your situation, but will point out that doctors are only recently being advised of this problem, as it has become more widely known.  Many medical centers are now having people who accept this medication sign a form acknowledging the potential difficulties before it is actually prescribed.  I hope this information is helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, leesy85,  I apologize for the delay in having a response to your question.  I'll provide some information and hope that it can be helpful to you and to any other readers.    Chronic use of alcohol can be very irritating to the lining of the stomach.  Alcohol in combination with other medications can be dangerous due to the many medication interactions that are possible.  If your alcohol use was limited to three separate episodes, it likely did not result in permanent damage to the stomach lining.  Effexor, Seroquel, and Panadol can also cause stomach upsets, but generally those effects go away after the medication has been discontinued.  If use of such drug and alcohol combination is prolonged, chronic irritation and/or permanent damage can occur.  The only way to know what is happening with your stomach is to see your doctor for a thorough evaluation.  There are medications that can reduce irritation and the resulting indigestion and/or nausea.  I hope this is helpful to you, and I wish you good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should discuss this side effect with your prescribing physician as most often these things resolve within the first two to three weeks of beginning the medication.  To continue to have nausea, vomiting and weight loss is not good and you should probably change to another medication.  It's best not to stop this abruptly unless your doctor is aware so another can be started in its place to avoid a rebound depression.  But, don't hesitate to contact the doctor and let whomever answers the phone know that you need to talk to the doctor directly; not just wait for an appointment in a few weeks.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Went to 35 and skipped a day for two weeks. It has now been about a month that I have been off of effexor but I feel extreme fatigue during the day. I get enough sleep during the night and the next day I do pretty well until mid afternoon and the sleepiness is so powerful. Sometimes I feel tired the whole day. I just started taking multivitamins but I feel nausous when I take them. My fatigue is overwhelming and I was wondering if it is the side effects of being on effexor medicine for four years. Does my body still hold onto the side effects of the medicine and what can I do to get rid of the fatigue. I try to exercise and keep busy during the day. Sometimes the tiredness just hits me and it can come when I'm driving in the car. I have to come home and take a long nap. I have three children to care for and I work during the day. I used effexor 75 for four years and never went above this dose. When I was taking the effexor XR I also was very sleepy and slept a lot when I was taking the medicine. I started the medicine because I had severe panic attacks. I don't seem to have the panic attacks anymore so far.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, davidsonmiddleton,  I apologize for the late response.  I hope that your issue has been resolved, but will provide some information in case it will be helpful to you, and helpful to any other readers of your question.    Effexor and Effexor XR are among the medications that are more difficult to withdraw from.  It's certainly very effective in treatment of conditions such as the one you had, but can give some problems when it's being discontinued.  Withdrawal symptoms can last two months or more, and some people don't feel \"right\" even as long as a year after Effexor has been withdrawn.  Insomnia is more frequently noted than fatigue, but fatigue has definitely been reported by a significant number of people.    Because your fatigue is or was so severe, the best advice is to have a complete physical examination.  Having a diagnosis of panic attacks, depression, or other psychological conditons does not preclude a person from also having or developing a physical condition that causes fatigue.  Hypothyroidism, Chronic Fatigue Syndrome, cardiac issues and autoimmune disease are a few that also can cause severe fatigue.    If your fatigue still persists and you have not had a physical examination, it would be a good idea to arrange one.  I usually recommend that a person keep a daily diary of their symptoms, including what it is, when it started, how long it lasted, what you were doing when it started, anything that helped or made it worse, and any other data that you feel is important.  Take it with you to all medical appointments.  It gives a more factual record than memory is able to do, and helps the treatment provider see any diagnostic pattern, as well as helping them see the real impact on your life.  It also helps you track your improvement, or lack of it, because you have a clear record of the actual frequency of the symptoms.    I hope this is helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, wendyj6262,  You're wise to double check the advisability of taking Prozac and St. John's Wort together, or in your case, in succession.  Taking the two together can lead to serotonin syndrome.  Earlier signs of this syndrome include agitation, confusion, heavy sweating, rapid heart rate, diarrhea, and shivering.  Severe serotonin syndrome also includes high fever, muscle rigidity/spasms, irregular heartrate, and seizures; this can be fatal if not quickly treated.  The syndrome is readily reversible with prompt treatment, which starts with simply not taking the medications.  In more severe cases, serotonin blockers may be prescribed.  Prozac has a fairly long half-life of about 2 weeks, meaning the drug is still present in your system for about that long, and to a lesser degree for a little longer.  As you pointed out, St. John's Wort is an unregulated substance, but it does have anti-depressant properties and has been effective in treating mild to moderate depression.  Long term effects have not been clearly established.  Mild side effects include stomach discomfort, rash, fatigue or restlessness.  More severe side effects that have been noted include photosensitivity, interaction with other drugs, particularly anti-depressants.  St. John's Wort also appears to decrease the effectiveness of other medications, as those for autoimmune conditions, anti-cholesterol drugs, Coumadin, and contraceptives, among others.  If you haven't discussed your situation with your doctor, it would be a good idea to do so.  He or she may prefer to provide you with drug samples for a time, or may reassure you about the use of St. John's Wort.  In very general terms, if St. John's Wort is appropriate for you to use, the Prozac has most probably cleared from your system by now, so there should be little danger, but please check with your doctor before making any decision.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, TruckerP9,  First let me apologize that this response is so tardy.  Since your concerns are fairly common, I'll go ahead and respond anyway, in case anyone else is reading this, as well.   It often takes longer than 6 to 8 weeks for a medication to establish appropriate blood levels, although the average time is usually given as 6 to 8 weeks.  A medication such as Symbax (a combination anti-depressant) should be decreased gradually, and is most safely done under the supervision of a doctor.  Sometimes such medication has initial side effects that disappear with time.  The Klonopin would address issues of anxiety and some mood stabilization, but would not directly address depressive symptoms.  Whenever a person is not happy with the way the medication regimen is affecting them, it is perfectly acceptable as well as advisable for them to see their physician and discuss their concerns in depth.  I hope this is helpful to you, and others.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Emotions are gone after Citalopram",
    "content": "I've been on antidepressants and some antianxiety and antipsychotics for nine years.  In February, I had been doing very well for a good while and felt confident enough with my place in life and my coping skills to go off Citalopram 20mg--my only daily drug besides birth control.    Three days after I tapered down to 10mg, I was just sitting with my fiance talking, and it felt like suddenly all my emotions and all my feelings for him just dropped away.  Since then I have not felt anything at all for him.  There were no disagreements or anything, things were going so well and I felt very much in love.  I also lost all interest in my master's thesis which I'm working on, and was very passionate about.  All my feelings and passion were just gone.   After about 3 weeks I talked to my doctor who suggested going back up to the full 20mg of Citalopram.  I did this and after 6 weeks, no improvement.  The doctor asked if I wanted to try going completely off it, and so I tapered down again.  I am now completely off Citalopram for about a week.  I feel horrible: dizzy, brain shocks, and crying all the time, but I am willing to stick that out.  I saw the doctor today and he suggested to wait some more and see if things improve.   Right now I see so much of what was so good going to waste.  I still feel nothing for my fiance, and I've just been acting as if I feel everything I did before, hoping it will come back.  My thesis is due in two months and I hardly care to even look at it.  I try doing the things I used to enjoy and spending time with my friends but only feel a huge emptiness.    Will I ever get my feelings back? Is it possible I have done permanent damage?  I'd like to live my life off drugs, but could taking another one possibly bring my old self back?    Thank you for any help.      --------- Past Medications ----------- Paxil, Zoloft, Effexor, Lexapro, Wellbutrin, Cymbalta (short term memory was moderately impaired after taking this for 2-3 months in 2005 and has not improved after stopping), Celexa, Abilify, Ativan, Klonopin, Valium, Amitryptyline (migraine prophylaxis-10mg--started in May 2010)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, *****,  How difficult this situation must be for you.  What you describe actually sounds like increasing symptoms of depression, and it doesn't seem likely that discontinuing your medication will help.  While returning to your prior dosage didn't seem to help, sometimes it takes longer than expected for the full effect to be reached.  Also, some physicians find it best to actually prescribe a higher dosage until the symptoms abate, and then taper back to the lowest dosage that maintains your best functional level.  I urge you to discuss this with your doctor.  Though you likely do not feel at all like exercising, please do so - talk a short walk every day.  It helps your body restore itself.  It's extremely unlikely that you have caused permanent damage of any kind.  I understand that you would like to avoid having to take medication for the rest of your life, but I must point out that if you were a diabetic and required insulin, you would accept the need for continued treatment.  This is no different.  Your condition is real and deserves appropriate treatment.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck with your thesis and your relationship.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, sad_girl,  How difficult for you!  You did not mention what it is the doctor or shrink has told you, but I'll do my best to respond to your question.  You are at a very vulnerable developmental stage in your life; the teen years are not easy years when life is perfect.  When there are problems, then issues become understandably magnified and seem overwhelming.  I'm encouraged that you do see the doctor or shrink.  It's normal to have episodes of feeling down, or being unable to sleep, or to have a short period of feeling less energy.  However, when those symptoms are the usual, it isn't normal.  They indicate depression, and that some treatment would be beneficial.  I think it's reasonable to feel even more sad after appointments if you are frustrated and do not feel you have been heard or helped.  Please talk to your parents about this, or to one of your parents if both are not in the picture following the divorce.  Ask them to help you advocate for yourself with your doctor or shrink.  Please start a record right now of your symptoms, including your mood, your sleep pattern, any anxiety, your level of activity and your appetite.  Maintain the record at least daily, and take it with you to each appointment.  It's okay for you to tell your doctor or shrink that you do not feel that the treatment is helping.  Often the local public mental health agencies have therapists who specialize in working with children and adolescents; ask your doctor or shrink to refer you.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Allergy to ciprimil and phosensitivity",
    "content": "Hi I am a 37 year old single mum, and feel that I need to start using an anti depressant again. I was using ciprimil for approx 3 years until 2 years ago.  I had a constant rash all over my body from the moment I started using it, but had to stop taking it as I became very photosensitive and allergic. My face swelled severely, and was bright red/pink painful and itchy for months, (I didn't look human), my skin burned and developed a thick rash if I went out in daylight, even if it was cloudy. I was told to stop taking ciprimil immediately, and my symptoms stopped. That was 2 years ago and I struggled with my mood and ability to function since then. My mood  was stable (20mg) and my pms went, as long as I doubled the dose to 40mg the week before my period, when I took ciprimil.   I have a history of severe pms/pmdd, and mild depression during the rest of my cycle. (I used to have panic attacks in social situations for years, but now I only get a very mild anxiety socially). My pms is out of control and I become very depressed, angry, anxious, and can't function for approx 10 days before my period. The two days before my period starts this is ampified and I can't sleep and feel aggressive, with mood swings, that I can't control. I get relief as soon as my period starts, and feel calm and happy. I have sjogren's syndrome and allergies, which means that I have to use a sunblock factor 50+ every day, so I need to use an anti depressant that doesn't increase my photosensitivity in this way.   I am unable to get back to work because of my low mood, lack of concentration generally and my unstable mood when I have pms. (my dad had depression with a psychotic episode when I was 10 years old, and my mum had pms/pmdd until in he 50's). Could you recommend an equivalent to ciprimil, but without the photosensitivity as a side effect for me to try? I am going to the doctor next week and would like to be informed as much as possible, before I go. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Fluffwick,  I apologize that this response is not timely, and I realize that you have probably already seen your doctor.  The medication you were taking before is in a class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors.  There are other types of antidepressants, known as tricyclic, tetracyclic, aminoketone, triazolopyridine derivative, selective serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, or phenylpiperazine antidepressants.  Perhaps your physician has prescribed a trial of one of these.  They can be effective when prescribed alone, or when prescribed along with another, depending on the nature of the symptoms.  When photosensitivity is a side-effect, the intensity varies with the type of medications and your body's ability to metabolize them.  You are already aware of the need to use a higher SPF sunscreen.  Also consider using tinted glasses while indoors, always wear a hat when outside, and long sleeve and long pantlegs in your clothing.  There is reasonably priced sun-protective clothing readily available, which you can obtain through catalogs and occasionally in some department stores.  Look up sun-protective clothing online to get started in that direction.  Please remember that it takes any medication some time to become effective, and try to be patient.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

If so, I'd encourage you to discuss what was happening with your doctor to rule out anything that he or she would need to address.  You are correct that long term use of a low dosage would probably not be cause for concern, but do inform your doctor so he or she can monitor you and your liver function.  The risk increases greatly with alcohol use, sensitivity to the medication, increased dosages to get the same effect you desire,and use in combination with certain other medications, which is another reason why you should be sure to discuss it with your doctor.  Since chronic use can decrease glucose and hemoglobin/hematocrit levels, your doctor may choose to do routine CBCs.  I hope this information has been helpful to you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Age: 61. Sex:Female. Diagnoses:  Major depressive disorder, severe, recurrent without psychotic features (2 episodes: 2003-2004 and 2007-2008); surgeries include hemithyroidectomy (2004), total hysterectomy (2001); family history includes severe heart disease and Parkinson's disease (father), depression (mother), AML (sister).  Current meds & daily dosages:  Synthroid 50 mcg; Climara 0.0375 mg patch (weekly application; simvastatin 10 mg; sertraline 125 mg (in process of reducing from 200 to 100); buspirone 60 mg (30 x 2).  History: 2 episodes of MDD 2003-04 and 2007-08.  Successful with 100 mg sertraline and CBT first episode.  2nd episode had to increase to 200 mg and also used diazepam 5-10 mg/night temporarily for severe anxiety & insomnia until sertraline took effect.  Initial tremors subsided after a few months.  Depression & anxiety gone.  OK for about 1yr.  Then noted \"Unintential but not Involuntary\" rhythmic foot-tapping movements, increased to including jaw clenching/tooth grinding.  Started buspirone a couple of months ago, increased to current dose.  No effect on bruxism (or anything else) so far.  Dentist noted broken tooth & displacement of front teeth; he's making a \"deprogrammer\" for me.  Psychiatrist & FNP concurred: reduce sertraline dose 25 mg increments every 2-4 wks & stay on buspirone; currently at 125 mg sertraline.  No ill effects.   Question(s):  How long do I wait for buspirone to work?  Should I take more of it or something else?  I just read about propranolol as a possibility, what do you think of buspirone vs propanolol?  Should I give up medications as a solution & just wait until I find my \"maintenance dose\" of sertraline & see if it goes away and just protect my teeth with the deprogrammer?  Will this make it more likely that the akathisia will become permanent?    Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Superstring,  I am sorry that this response is so tardy, but I will address your issue anyway.  Simply stated, it generally takes several weeks for buspirone to take effect, as you likely have already discovered.  Dosage adjustment may be required, as people don't always react to a medication to the same degree as others may.  Occasionally, it will take the doctor several \"tweaks\" of both the antidepressant and the buspirone to arrive at the most effective dosage for a specific individual.  It can require patience on your part; you can maximize the effect of treatment by taking your medications at approximately the same times every day.  It can help your doctor if you maintain a record of your side-effects - when they occur, how severe they are, if they disturb your sleep, etc.   He or she may be able to detect a pattern or optimal times for you to take your dosage.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Often a doctor is reluctant to change medications when one is working well since each individual responds differently.  Perhaps your doctor can look into a program where the drug manufacturer assists with the cost of the medication.  If you qualify due to no insurance, you may even be able to get Cymbalta without charge or with a very low copay.  The doctor writes the prescription and submits it to the company along with your application and then it is supplied directly to the physician for your use, usually in three month increments.  You should inquire about this.    If this is not a possibility for you, sertraline (Zoloft) would be worth trying.  While some doctors are very in tune with the high cost of health care, some are a bit removed from the financial side of things.  Continue to explain your dilemma to be sure the doctor understands your concerns thoroughly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Breastfeeding and Xanax",
    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your decision to breastfeed your baby.  This is the best thing you can do for her health.    Many medications are safe with breastfeeding.  The labeling always warns because we don't do the usual testing of drugs in lactating women.  For Xanax, the recommendation is to only use it with your doctor's knowledge; not to avoid it altogether.  Long-term use is the only concern here.  Single use (short-acting; not extended release) taken as needed are pretty safe and it has a relatively short half-life, making it a better choice than many others especially if you feed the baby 2-3 hours after the dosing because this reduces the exposure to your baby.  The longer half-life of the extended release form make it more difficult but I suspect the regimen you are on is good.    Tom Hale's Breastfeeding and Medications forum says the main worry is with many days' use but it is unclear what exactly constitutes \"many days.\"   Many factors go into consideration here such as whether or not the baby is healthy, full-term, without apneic spells (stops breathing).  It sounds like  your baby is healthy and I assume was born at term.  It would be ideal if you were able to wean yourself off this dose, as planned, assuming you are able to cope with the anxiety with \"as needed\" treatment.  I hope you are also getting some therapy to help you find other non-pharmaceutical help.  Pumping and dumping demonstrates your commitment to breastfeeding as this will help keep up your milk supply and it shows you are looking at the bigger, long-term picture. The constant anxiety will hopefully be just a temporary glitch for you.  Once you recover, you can continue to rebuild your milk supply for long-term successful breastfeeding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It seems to me that serotonin syndrome occurs because tramadol also has a serotonin stimulant effect on the brain and that produces an additive effect to the fluoxetine.

    "content": "Hello, It is usually not a good idea to stop an antidepressant cold turkey and really should only be done with the guidance of your doctor, if at all.  There is a serious risk of rebound depression.  The degree of antidepressant effects you would get with only the tramadol may not be in the therapeutic range so you really need to decide with your doctor about the best course of action, perhaps changing one of the medications.  However, in some cases the additional SSRI present in the Tramadol may be quite safe and so are sometimes prescribed together.  Your doctor is probably letting you know the possible side effects, as he should with any treatment so you can make an informed decision regarding your treatment.  The two drugs can be used with caution, meaning you should report to your doctor any new or bothersome side effects.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are other drugs that could help with your anxiety and panic but you do need to consult with a doctor to try and find the right one for you.  Wellbutrin is in the same general classification but works differently than Zoloft, and is often used in depression without the sexual side effects some of the others exhibit.  There are also medications such as Periactin (cyproheptadine hydrochloride) which can relieve SSRI-induced sexual dysfunction.    So, talk to your doctor about your concerns.  You don't want to suffer a rebound depression/anxiety because of this.  But, each person is individual in their response and I can't say how you will respond once you have stopped the medication or how long before the side effects are gone.    Good luck.\n\n",

I have been taking my 100 mg dosage every day for the past 4 weeks and have now increased it to 150 for a week and a half.  I am concerned because I am still not feeling better and my anxiety seems almost worse.  Will the zoloft work for me again and I just need to give it more time at the increased dosage?  I am so upset and not sure what to do.  I just want to feel like myself again!\n\n",

I don't see that you have anything to lose since you clearly have problems with your neurotransmitters and need some kind of medicine.  I'm afraid trial and error is the typical way we learn what works since each person responds differently and we cannot do blood testing or other testing to determine which medication will work best.  I know it requires great patience on your part and that of your family but try to stay with it long enough to see what will work.  Stay close to your doctor in case you have more negative effects from the new medication.  In some cases you need a combination of medications and it can take a little while to get to the most therapeutic level possible for you individually.  Hang in there!  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I'd really appreciate some advice in regards to this matter!  About two and a half months ago I was put on Fluoxetine for a panic disorder.  I started on 10mg and gradually went up to 50.  Four days ago I stopped taking it because I could not tolerate the side effects-- racing thoughts, insomnia, and difficulty focusing.  My psychiatrist said that Fluoxetine is long-lasting enough that I could just stop taking it and let it cycle out of my system naturally.  For the past three days, I've been having headaches, severe lethargy, constant indigestion and bit of light-headedness.  I certainly didn't have these symptoms before starting the medication!  I know Fluoxetine is not infamous for withdrawal symptoms, but is it possible that that's what I'm experiencing?  I think I may be very sensitive to medication, which might have something to do with it.  If it is withdrawal, can anyone offer some insight into how long it will last?  It's not intolerable, so if the symptoms only last a few weeks I would prefer to not restart the medication...  Thanks in advance for any responses.\n\n",

    "content": "Basic Patient Information:  Female, Age 34, with significant childhood traumas.  Condition: Severe depression and PTSD.  1999: Patient presented with depression and was treated with 50 mg of Zoloft.  Within a short time, patient began having paradoxical reaction, and stopped taking the medication.  2006: Patient began taking antidepressants again.    2007: Patient began seeing a psychiatrist to try to find the right combination of antidepressants for her treatment.   - October 11, 2007: Patient was on 112.5 mg of Effexor XR.  Doctor wanted to rule out possible bi-polar diagnosis and prescribed lowest dosage of Lithium.  - November 1, 2007: Patient became significantly depressed (also in correspondence with ovulation).  No mood improvement. - November 8, 2007: Patient expressed suicidal ideation, but no plan.  - November 13, 2007: Patient was going to attempt suicide, but stopped the intended actions and contacted a counselor as well as the prescribing doctor for help and treatment.  2008:  Patient remains on Effexor XR, no Lithium, and no additional suicidality noted or reported.  QUESTIONS:  Is it possible that the patient was experiencing another paradoxical reaction, similar to the 1999 occurrence, with the new combination of the Lithium and Effexor XR?  What additional medical documentation is available as proof to validate this concern, for keeping in the patient's medical record?  Thank you!\n\n",

Lithium and Effexor XR can combine to increase the risk of serotonin syndrome.  This would not generally appear like a paradoxical reaction.  Effexor XR, by itself, is known to increase the risk of suicidality in some.  It may be that this effect is what was being seen.  The lithium may have been an innocent bystander in the whole event.

    "content": "It appears that serotonin syndrome could not be a possible cause of the suicidality  due to the fact that the patient has remained on the Effexor XR - lithium was the only medication that was discontinued.  The Effexor XR has been augmented with the Levothyroxin for treatment resistant depression (which was the intent of the prescribed Lithium).   If additional suggestions on possible reactions related to the combination of the two medications are available, I would be interested in hearing the ideas.   Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Katie0873:  I've never heard of the addition of lithium to any antidepressant causing suicidality.  There is a lot of evidence about the efficacy of lithium, in small doses such as 300 mg daily, for augmentation of antidepressant therapy.  I have had a few patients who were unable to tolerate lithium, but these were adverse effects, not suicidal ideation, and didn't seem to be due to a drug-drug interaction.  Results of the STAR-D study were published a few years ago about various treatments for depression, including augmentation strategies.  Lithium was added on in that study and found to be effective.\n\n",

    "content": "I started getting panic attacks about 2 months ago. I was prescribed resperidol 1.5 mg which was 1 and 1/2 pills a day. After two weeks she told me to double it to three. Well I thought she meant three pills so I was taking six mg double what I was supposed to. Into the second week I started to have chest pressure and breathing problems. After she found out I took more then I should have she took me off of it immediately. I wasn't weened off of it. My chest was bothering me so bad I went to the emergency room. They did blood tests and an EKG and everything was ok. He thought it was just muscle pain. It has been a week since I went to the er and my chest is still sore and I have to take deep breaths if I exert myself. I don't know if this is something to worry about or if it could be from panic but it is constant. I am taking Xanax for the anxiety when I need it I can't even work. I am going to a pyschologist on Mon.  Thanks.\n\n",

Aside from the medication, the history of panic attacks alone may also cause these symptoms. I am glad to hear that your visit to the emergency room identified no abnormalities. I also hope your visit to the Psychologist is very helpful. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I have been taking fluoxetine for many decades. It has its drawbacks but in general, has kept me relatively out of the deeper depressive bouts. I have tried many other antidepressants and found this one to be the most tolerable. however, the doses have been steadily going up over a long period of time. i am now on 40mgs. The problem arose today when i dicovered I had been accidentally taking two instead of one. I had done so becaseu when I was taking the 20mg size and was given a prescription for twice that amount I took two of the 20 and then the pharmacy switched me to the 40 and I simply kept going with the old habit of taking two. I discovered this today. Can I just take one a day now and not expect too many bad come down effects?   I have to mention that I tried titrating off this medicine three years ago because of the sexual dysfunction that was problematic in a new relationship. Needless to say, my pshychosis was far worse. I have also learned through your forum of other side effects of being on this drug and one of them is excessive talking, a kind of hyperactive \"high\", if you will, and that it was possibly linked to bi-polar disorder, which my oldest son has been diagnosed with. We both are ADD and neither one of us takes anything for it at the moment. Though the amphetamine meds were extremely helpful in keeping my job, I have high blood pressure and the doc said I should stop.   So will it be OK to just take one fluoxetine now without too much concern and should I try to get a further diagnosis for bi-polar. I struggle with all sorts of things and that is basically what life has consisted of, just living with what I have takes all my effort even with drugs, study, meditation and informed questions. I am 60 and wonder when I will get to relax and start living!\n\n",

The benefits of certain medications far outweigh the potential side effects. Over-eating in itself will cause nausea but you would certainly want to discuss the nausea with his physician upon his next evaluation to assure there is no other reason for this to be occuring. You may also want to keep in mind that sipping gingerale will help nausea to subside. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I see.  Perhaps you should see a dentist to see if there is any cause relating to your mouth.  Are you brushing and flossing well?  I know this is the obvious and you probably do this but it is the first thing to check.  Make sure you see your dentist regularly to remove plaque and check for gum disease.  Some people have dry mouth which prevents the natural washing of the mouth that occurs.  This can be a side effect of some medications.    If you use tobacco, this can make the problem worse so kick the habit.    Food can affect your breath (like garlic and onions).  You might try increasing fruits and vegetables and decreasing meats.  Infections can also cause odor so you should see a doctor to be sure it is not some medical disorder.   You also mentioned body odor and that should be discussed with your doctor.  Again, it could be an underlying medical problem.  Best wishes.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are several smiliar medications to try and to my knowledge none of the SSRIs or SNRIs contain epinephrine.  I wonder if you are thinking of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine which is affected by some antidepressants.  Effexor, actually an SNRI (the \"N\" is for norepinephring vs another \"S\" for seratonin) merely allows the naturally occurring norepinephrine to work in your brain as it should by inhibiting the reuptake of the neurotransmitter, where your body interferes with the transfer of these chemicals.  But, there are other SSRIs used to treat depression that do not have the effect on the norepinephrine (ie Zoloft, Prozac).  It depends on which kind of neurotransmitter blocking you need for your depression treatment.  Talk to your doctor about your concerns to see if changing to a selective seratonin reuptake inhibitor is an option for you.   It can take several weeks to find the best treatment that is effective and with minimal side effects.  Try to be patient but let your doctor know your side effects.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Have you talked about these concerns with him/her?  You are correct that the body does acclimate to these medications, much like a morning cup of coffee. If you have a cup of coffee every morning your brain adapts the number of receptors it makes available, expecting that caffeine every morning. No caffeine and 'you just can't get going'. In much the same way, your brain adapts, knowing that it can expect a dose of these medications soon.   There are many options which you can discuss with your dr., like drug 'holidays', alternative medications, or alternative holistic treatments like yoga, reiki, massage, etc.  Good luck and let us know how you are doing!\n\n",

Over the last 5 days or so I have been having chest pain.  I know that it is not acid reflux because antacids don't make any difference.  Taking a natural anti-inflammatory helps but not completely.  I read on a few websites that this can be a side effect.  Does it typically subside or should it be something that I am concerned with?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can understand your concerns. Antidepressants are trial and error. It is not easy to find the right one. Everyones body reacts in different ways. I recommend telling your doctor about this right away. Sometimes the side effect can be chest pain, anxiety, shortness of breath, and other cardiac symptoms. If you do experience any of these other symptoms along with the chest pain, you can have an ekg, and other cardiac tests that will show nothing. It is a reaction from your body, and if it doesn't agree with you, then it is not the right medication for you. you may want to see if this condition subsides, and maybe it will.  Good luck  to you simonne\n\n",

    "content": "My mother is 48-49 years old, and is on 20mg prozac, 10mg lexapro and 600mg lithium she told me what sleeping pill she was on but i forgot and can post it when I go home tomorrow.  I really would like to know if this combo is safe?  She used to be addicted to opiates (hydracodone) for years then got off them via suboxone when she got off of the suboxone she started getting prescribed prozac, then they did prozac with abilify and that stuff hurt her, now she can't lift her arms above her chest.  After that happened she went on the current combo of prozac, lexapro and lithium.  Does this sound right to anyone?  I'm no med student or doctor but I have done enough reading about SSRis and seratonin to know that something could be potentially wrong here. Also she acts freaking weird, she reminds me of myself in high school after I ate marijuana or something of that nature, its kind of funny but not.  Its my mom not a high school stoner.  All she does is sit on the couch and watch tv, she doesn't want to do anything!  She thinks going to the grocery is an accomplishment. Please help any info would be lovely! Thanks Ryan\n\n",

While some antidepressants are taken in combination, typically they are of different varieties so they work on different neurotransmitters.  Normally we don't use two SSRIs together but of course we don't know her particular situation.  This is why it's best to be sure the doctor is aware, in case two different physicians are prescribing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are times when two similar medications are used together so if she is under the doctor's care and not having side effects, it is probably OK.  Lithium often is prescribed along with an antidepressant such as Prozac, and blood levels are typically drawn periodically to be sure it is in the therapeutic range.   The \"chemicals\" are merely correcting her normal levels of neurotransmitters and she may need them long-term.  They are not addictive, but can be similar to the use of insulin in a diabetic.  Each person is different and the medications must be fine tuned and adjusted as needed (just as insulin needs such monitoring and adjusting).  Therapy can be a good addition to medicine in many cases but I would not expect it to necessarily result in the discontinuation of her meds.  Often the two go hand-in-hand for excellent results, especially if there are unresolved issues.  Many people do fine with one or the other and sometimes both are indicated.  It may or may not result in a reduction of medication.  Often people do have changing dose and medication needs so regular contact with a doctor or therapist is important.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't get those random erections throughout the day as I used to. I can get an erection, I still get them in the morning but it seems to be quite a bit harder to get one. The not getting erections doesn't bother me, but does it have an affect on my hormones for puberty? It lowers the amount I fantasize I guess you could say and I am only fifteen years old.

Wellbutrin is also one that has fewer sexual side effects than many of the others so you will likely be able to use it long-term without problems.  Thank you for your question. Best wishes.\n\n",

I suspect that the medication was not the most effective for you, though you did not say why it was discontinued.  Your level of distress needs to be evaluated again by your doctor or psychiatrist, with a different medication to help you manage your symptoms.  What you are going through is not something that is expected after this length of time.  I urge you to see your doctor as soon as you can, so that your mood does not deteriorate and your anxiety does not keep getting worse.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Wellbutrin day 5 with high anxiety levels",
    "content": "Hi there --  First, and this is probably related to the general anxiety you're feeling, a slightly elevated white count is not something worth additional anxiety. It's a very common thing, can be caused by a passing mild virus, medication, just a very transient non-event as a rule. Try and let that one go, although it would be appropriate to follow up non-urgently any time something like that shows up, just don't give it too much thought.   The anxiety could be directly a result of the new medication, as many SSRIs can set off new and often intense anxiety even as the depression lingers, since the purpose of an antidepressant is mostly to fight depression and can take a couple weeks to reach a thereapeutic level. Trouble is, that occasional side effect of increased (or new) anxiety can show up sooner. Long, convoluted reason for that, but it happens -- a lot. Wellbutrin may not be the med for you. Then again, this phase does usually pass in about the same length of time the antidepressant effect begins to become noticeable.   There is one other thing to bear in mind, and that is anxiety and depression often go hand in hand, almost like a hangover after a drinking binge (for lack of a prettier analogy). This could be part of the problem too, but with SSRIs it can become a problem because of the med. Hopefully by now it's worked through and you're feeling better. If not, by all means consider trying something different. Since Lexapro worked well for you before, maybe it would again. Any special reason for the change?   Hope this is helpful to you and that you're doing better by now. Good luck and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

My doc when I first told him I was depressed gave me a bunch of samples and worked me up to 150 mg a day.  He never told me that I might be on it for a long time..to be completely accurate, he didnt tell me ANYTHING about Effexor XR other than the dosage.  I would definately reccommend that patients ask many many questions when they see their doctor. That was my mistake.. Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately, doctors were not given all the information that they needed to know by the drug reps and companies.  Slowly the problems and the seriousness of the need for slow weaning are becoming apparent and publicized to a larger audience.The best effect I have noticed over the past several months is that more and more physicians are getting the true information through the media and through watching their patients.  It can be done and it will be done.  It may take a while and patience is definitely a virtue during this process.  Realize that there are going to be major ups and downs throughout the process, but always remember that the \"downs\" will decrease and diminish in strength over time.  Keep a journal if you are able of exactly what you're feeling at different times so you can share this with your doctor during the process and you can look back on how you've progressed down the road.    Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "EFFEXOR = SMOKE XOR",
    "content": "Hello,    I have been on Effexor XR (75mgx5/day) for over a year. Actually, I was only taking 4/day, just in case or until I decided to get off it and I would have some extra's.     I did not accept my doc.'s defeatism: \"We'll see in about a year. If you suffer then from withdrawal trying to get off of it, you may have to take the REST of YOUR LIFE\". What is that for a statement? Pills don't change you, YOU DO! They are there to help you like gas runs cars but you are still driving. Anyway... I tried to wean off of it, but no success. Besides being \"uncomfortable\", you know you are not as \"performant\" as being on it. But do I want to stay a zombie or be in charge? I have a family though. My daughter is turning 5 and my wife is so frustated w/ me she wants...     I noticed really early on Effexor that, after exercising hard (20-100 miles bike ride), I would feel like a million bucks and would forgot to take my dose for the rest of the day. The following day or day after, I would then feel the affects being: lethargic, depressed, no motivation... So I always when back on Effexor. If I DID take the dose before a ride, I would feel like S...: having cold sweat, short breath. Because of life's demand, I am not in position to go and train 5 hrs at a time. So I became more & more morose and stopped exercising all together, put on a few extra FATTY pounds, etc..     It's ONLY a few  weeks ago, around Sept 01, 2005, that I went COLD Turkey on Effexor. I had been for a few day now working in my backyard building a patio. My wife was helping the best she could but injured herself in the process. The heat (GA) had been torrid for the past FEW weeks but I was like a \"machine\" (I used to race Ironman and Adventure Races). After working the yard, I would then do my 8hr evening shift at a VERY busy Starbucks (on your feet and go-go-go) and do it all over the next day. On Sept 4th, I realized I had not been taking my Meds. I knew I was overheating faster than before, had dizzy spells and had a hard time to run the Drive-Through @ Starbucks and to stay focus. I contributed it to having already moved about 1500 Pounds of Mortar Mix and Stones into the backyard, 40 feet above the driveway and build a 6'x15' area. By Sept.10, I moved another Ton of supplies, was sleeping about 1-3hrs a night and went on a bike ride for Multiple Sclerosis Raising Funds. NOW, Sept. 15, my wife is about to divorce me, my daughter is 5 and my mental faculties are seriously diminished (right<>wrong, uncontrolled emotion, focus, background noise, bad channeling). BUT I FEEL ALIVE. I know I can make it and I hope the rest of my family can too.     I was given some Lunestra to help me sleep and I try to read some more about ADD. My wife and I are convinced I was miss-diagnosed w/ depression and that I ALWAYS suffered, mildly \"maybe\", of ADD-Deep Limbic. So I will be hard pressed to believe any \"Mental\" doctors unless...     I'll keep posting as I am going through Effexor-Detox.      My program consist of Physical exertion (Adrenalin Function), St. John's Worth (1000mg/day), L-Tyrosine 500mg (Mental Function), Thyroid & L-Tyrosine Complex (2 capsules).\n\n",

    "content": "I took Effexor 75 ER for a little over a year ..  During that time my systolic pressure has run very, but variably,  highover the day - but my research indicates Effexor affects diastolic pressure.  My doctor finally prescibed Dyazide for BP. When I read about drug interactions with Dyazide and Nabumetone, A NSAID I was prescribed, I tpered off of the Effexor. Coincidentally, I started re-corresponding with my sister, also on Effexor.  Her systolic pressure had also jumped, but not as high as mine,  (140-150s), despite our common long history of low BP.  During the year I took Effexor, my mulit-site arthitis and muscle pain got substantially worse - which I started to connect to Effexor this spring.   I have been off Effexor for 2 weeks.I have had no seriously bad side effects except a headache and very early morning wake ups.   However, a bulging stomach quite suddenly deflated.  My sister has grown enormous breasts and can't figure out why.  Neither of us gained more than 5 pounds, but \"blew up\" in different places. My bones feel substantially better and my blood pressure today is 110/68.  Did we  experience very uncommon side effects of Effexor?  I have not read any anecdotal information about them.\n\n",

I believe I had a very bad panic attack...I think.  I become uncontrillably hysterical hyperventilating, vomiting and trembling.  It was the worst experience in my life.  My aunt which the doctor prescribes Effexor and chose not to use it gave me hers.  It was an immediate transformation.  I have enough pills for about two months.  But my inclanation to post is because since I have been taking Efexxor my stomache has BULGED incredibly.  My diet has not changed but my stomach has.

    "content": "I have been taking effexor for about 10 yerars.  I have tried to get off it twice.  Once the side effects were so bad that I could net stand it.  I went back on it and later in 2003 I tried again with the supervision of a doctor.  I got down to one pill 37.5 mg and eventually ended up in the emergency room.  I was suicidal.  I feel like a junkie.  Hooked on this stuff.  I talked to a new doctor today and they are going to try to ge tme off slower than befor in smaller increments.  This drug is very powerful.  I advise that only severly depressed (clinically) be on this medication.  I was severly depress and before I started taking this med I had quit eating and was going to die.  At the time it helped.  But the Veterans Administration didn't want me to come off of effexor.  I do know that the pharmacudical companies pay the VA and or doctors to use thier meds.  At the same time they require notes on the progress of these meds while the are being taken.  The companies know about these things but they also balance out the cost of keeping this from others so that they can make billions off of it.  We are the test sunjects and they are the ones who benifit.  If I was a pharmacudical comany and made a med that made people feel better and said that the side effects in test subjects is weight loss and sleep loss as well as a matabalism issue over a long term use.  And the FDA approved it and then people took it and it became wonderfull for them but eventually destroyed thier livelyness and they became dependant I guess you can say that my company gave you cocain.  Becauls it does some of the same things.  It makes you feel good and it makes you function.  But it also causes dependance and also withdrawal simpoms as well as when you get off it you feel miserable.  Maybe I am wrong but I feel like I am addicted to a drug more than I am getting help.  I don't need to take this medication anymore.  But i have to for reasons other than what it was intended for.  I am angry and I feel like I have been misled.  Ty.  42yrs old.\n\n",

She taps at her keyboard and looks at me gravely and tells me its not a good time for me to want to change things.  But I do want to change things! I don't think I need it anymore. Withdrawal symptoms start right away - within a few hours of missing a dose. Muzzy-headedness, dizziness, confusion, lethargy, nausea. I don't eat, I don't want to move.. My whole body starts aching, especially around the joints. I'm not particularly anxious or depressed.. I just feel sick.  I hate being a junkie. I know, its a prescription, but I am equating my addiction with being a junkie. When I am in the withdrawal state.. I would do anything for my pill. I want to be off of these, but without my doctor to work with me, and without the money to see another doctor.. I just have to keep taking it, or go cold turkey.\n\n",

    "content": "I have somewhat recently gone off of Effexor myself. Apart from a somewhat upset stomach and occasionally feeling somewhat foggy, I haven't had the severe problems I've been reading about. I think that is partly because my dr. used a program in which I took a small dose of Prozac while also tapering off of the Effexor, which helped to  control many of the EXTREMELY unpleasant symptoms, which I have felt before, esp. the headaches. After I was successfully off of the Effexor, I also tapered the low dose of Prozac, and that wasn't difficult at all. Someone mentioned the short half life of Effexor, which I was also told about, and my doc said that the Prozac has a much longer half life, and she'd found that this method was the best way to control the discomfort of stopping the Effexor. I don't understand the science of it, what I wrote above is about all i undertood, but I do know that it worked for me. So I wanted to put it out there for others, if they wanted to try discussing it with they're own docs.\n\n",

The problem is that I am becoming more sexually active and I can't maintain an erection. Before the medication I was to depressed to want sex, but now I am no longer depressed and can't get an erection to save my life. I have been on both of these meds for about 8 months.  What can I do?  Can I combine viagra with those two medications?  I also have high blood pressure which is new from taking the Strattera as well. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi innocentidealist,  You are most likely having your problem getting erection due to the Lexapro, not the Strattera. Lexapro, like many of the SSRI antidepressants, cause a variety of problems with sexual functioning up to 50% of the time. Strattera rarely causes this. You have several options to regain sexual functioning. You can talk them over with your prescriber first; please don't try these yourself:  1. You can take a lower dose of the Lexapro, to see if you need the dose you are on, and if your sexual functioning will improve with a lower dose. 2. You can withhold taking the Lexapro on the day you plan to have sex, and take it right after. Do not skip two days in a row. There is a slight chance of some side effects from missing only one day. Some other antidepressants cannot be withheld for even a single day. 3. Your doctor can switch the antidepressant to one with a much lower risk of sexual function related side effects. These are few, but include buproprion (Wellbutrin-brand name), mirtazipine (Remeron- brand name), nortriptyline and desipramine (older, depression medications). Of these, bupropion is often the one preferred for situations such as yours. It has the added effect of sometimes being helpful for people with ADHD.   So, you are experiencing a common side effect to the Lexapro; you can discuss some of these options with your doctor and see which makes sense for you. Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "Feeling better from Zoloft, but urges to self-injure?",
    "content": "I'm currently taking 50 mg of Zoloft a day. I have been for about two months now. I can honestly say that my depression is pretty much non-existant. I'm a lot happier, chatty, funnier and more relaxed. This is not my first depression. I was diagnosed one before about 5 years ago. I'm 24 years old. The previous depression was not my first, I've had at least two episodes of depression prior to that, starting around age 8 or 10, I can't remember exactly, but I was very young.   When I was a teenager I had started harming myself, due to depression and what not. I stopped several years ago on my own by finding better ways of coping. What is disturbing to me is that when I was depressed this year, I didn't have any urges to engage in self-injury. I was coping and eventually saw my doctor to aid the process, but since starting Zoloft I've felt happier sure, but at times impatient and sometimes I even get moments of feeling quite elated or even high and euphoric, sort of like drinking too much coffee, but I've eliminated caffiene from my diet since starting the medication. It's somewhat intense and I've started pinching myself and inflicting very small injuries which calm me down when nothing else will, none that would break skin or anything like that. It's very odd since I'm actually feeling a lot better.   I took fluoxetine in the past, which made me feel both up and down and quite impulsive, the sertraline doesn't do this to the same degree and I quite like it. Should I tell my doctor? I don't want him to take me off these medications. I feel better than I did even before I was depressed. She wants me to seek help from a psychologist, but I've been to cognitive behavioural therapy in the past and it was quite boring and silly considering much of the information I already knew and just needed a push in order to do it and well, that's what the sertraline helps with. I don't see the point in talking to a psychologist when I can rationalize my mood, talk to my friends or my partner very easily and openly.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello idontremember,  The reactions that you describe can be a result of Zoloft, including the self-harm issues.  An adjustment in dosage may be all that is required.  You should discuss it with your doctor and be willing to try adjustments as needed.  There may be a related medication that would help you maintain the improvements in mood and actions, but without the side effect that you seem to be having.  While it can be frustrating to be advised to see a psychologist and consider behavioral treatment after having such treatment in the past, it doesn't hurt to see what is now available, plus a different psychologist may blend better with your personality and therefore be helpful.  You might benefit from keeping a log of symptoms, time of day, circumstances/situation, and share it with your doctor.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been on 2mg of Clonazepam per day (taken at bedtime) for treatment of mild/moderate anxiety for about three years.  I've been considering going off the drug because of the sexual side of effects (lack of desire-orgasm).  I recently did some web research and that has frightened me about the drug and my doctor.    I'm concerned that I'm dependent on the drug because it seems way stronger (and addictive) than I thought it was and, to make matters worse, it appears I've been on a high dosage (perhaps the top end of of the 'normal' range).  Withdrawal symptoms appear horrible and even include death for sudden withdrawal (when on high dosage--like me).  I'm concerned that my doctor is perhaps a bad doctor and that I should seek a new one.  I read that you should only be on Clonazepam short term and my doctor has had me on it for two years (going on three)!  I'm pretty confident this was good information because the article even quoted a study: \"If used for antianxiety treatment: This drugs should not be taken for more than four weeks ( Yudofsky, Hales and Ferguson . )\"  So to sum it up it seems my doctor prescribed me too much, too strong and for too long.  I can't really confront my doctor with this information as I cannot think of any way to present it that wouldn't put her on the defensive.  Please help!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Clonazepam worries ... please help!",
    "content": "I understand the concern.  However, it depends on the individual situation as to how long the drug is prescribed.  I have known of many people who have been on the same drug you mention for years.  I have also known of many to be on other types of medications within the same drug class and the clonazepam.  I do not necessarily believe you have a \"bad doctor\".   Yes dependence is a rist to an extent.  When on meds such as this for a prolonged period of time the body does develop dependence.  However, if in the long run you wish to discontinue this drug, it is best to wean off the med instead of dropping it cold turkey.  This would prevent alot of the withdrawal symptoms the body would have.  The dose should be slowly decreased over a period of weeks to minimize the symptoms.  As far as addiction, there is much confusion between the words \"addiction\", \"dependence\", and tolerance.  Addiction would be a craving for the drug for some kind of \"high\".  Normally if addicted you will take more than prescribed and continue to crave the drug as you increase the amount.    Dependence is really normal when on a drug such as this long term.  However, dependence of the body on many drugs run the risk of some withdrawal symptoms.  This would include many of the antidepressants on the market today.  Those drugs are not \"bad\" drugs just because the body develops dependence.  We are \"dependent\" on many meds we take.  Even if we do not have the risk of actual withdrawal symptoms, stopping a blood pressure med will have consequences even.  This is because the body is \"dependent\" on the medication to maintain our blood pressure.  What happens?  The blood pressure goes up when we stop the blood pressure med.  Also the line of drugs called SSRI antidepressants have documented withdrawal symptoms almost as bad as the \"bad\" drugs such as Clonazepam.  They must be discontiued slowly over a period of weeks if they are stopped in order to avoid the withdrawal symptoms.  Antidepressants are not even considered \"narcotics or controlled substances\".    Tolerance is natural when you take any medication long term which is in the same family of Clonazepam.  Also tolerance develops over time with the use of any narcotic medication.    Tolerance simply means the current dose of medication is not quite as effective as it once was.  So with any controlled substance you run the risk that it will not work forever at the same prescribed dose.   \\ However, with all the risks of addiction, tolerance, dependence, etc.  the doctor and patient have to weigh the risk vs. benefits.  Sometimes quality of life with relief of symptoms is more important than worrying about such things.  Some people are prone to \"addiction\".  Yet many are not.  I have read studies that show that less than 2% of people taking a narcotic for chronic pain will ever become \"addicted\".  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I wanted to know if there is any information about whether antidepressants can worsen your concentration, creativity, or visualization.  The reason is that I have been thinking about going back on antidepressants after not taking them for 4 years (i used to take zoloft).  I am a chess master and it is my \"profession\".  During the time I was taking them (approximately 2002-2005) my results suffered alot, and when I went off them I quickly got better.  I do not know if this is because of the drugs or other factors in my life, but it seems like a big coincidence.  I think my depression is related to circumstances in my life (being completely alone, inability to relate to people, and also having an unrequited love recently).  It seems i cannot connect with anyone, and I don't know if the depression is a cause of this or only an effect.  I would like to test it, but it is very important to me that it does not harm my results, or I will lose the one thing (very good achievements in chess recently) that is keeping me going.  Do you know anything about this?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi struuudog,  It is nearly always the case that when a medication has the brain as its target for clinical  benefit, that there is the possibility of trouble concentrating or some slight blunting of the quality of ones thinking. That being said, while not rare, it is not typical for people to report  cognitive or thinking problems when taking a standard antidepressant, including the widely used SSRIs such as Zoloft (as you took). If you found that the Zoloft blunted your thinking or creativity, you and your doctor have the options of either trying the Zoloft at a lower dose, making increases if necessary in very small increments and slowly, or trying another medication. Certain anti-depressants are more likely to have cognitive side effects than others. The medications that are most specifically act on the serotonin and/or norepinephrine brain nerve transmitter systems are probably least likely to have these side effects.  These would include Celexa, Lexapro and Cymbalta, for example. Zoloft and Prozac are decent choices, as well. Potentially sedating antidepressants (which affect other brain transmitters such as histamine and acetylcholine) such as Remeron and Paxil, or those making people prone to side-effects from their \"washing-out\" of the body quickly (such as Effexor) may be less preferable. However, antidepressant choice needs to be a highly individualized process requiring much discussion between a patient and her doctor. Good luck!  E. Seigle MD\n\n",

I have a doctor's appointment next week, but I was reading up on Cymbalta side effects, and hypothyroidism is an infrequent side effect, meaning that it occurs in 1/100 to 1/1000 of cases.  The website didn't specify the exact probability of hypothyroidism, but what that mean is it occurs in less than 1% of patients.  My mother has hypothyroidism, but she wasn't diagnosed until a few years ago, and judging by pictures, as a teen her thyroid was fine or she might have even had hyperthyroidism. I'm concerned I might be in that 1%, since it occurred often enough to be significant statistically.  I'd like to get an opinion since my doctor might not be that familiar with Cymbalta.  Should I try to get off the Cymbalta or switch to another medication just in case its the cause of my decreased thyroid function, or am I just being paranoid.  I was planning on getting off Cymbalta within the next year anyway, since my depression was caused by a traumatic event rather than being a long-term occurence.  Thanks for helping me out!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cymbalta causing hypothyroidism?",
    "content": "Hi kyori,  It is most likely that the listing of hypothyroidism is an ASSOCIATION with Cymbalta use, not a causal relationship. In other words, 1%, let us say, of people taking Cymbalta are also found to have hypothyroidism. Since hypothyroidism is very frequent among women anyway (it may be 1%, I am not sure), in my experience, this i likely a coincidence , rather than being CAUSED by the medication. I am not aware of any research that shows that Cymbalta causes hypothyroidism. That being said, you can discuss this with your doctor. An additional important issue is that you have found the Cymbalta to be quite helpful; to either switch medications or simply stop the Cymbalta entails you taking some risk. The alternative, to stop and/or change the medication, wait 6-8 weeks or more, and then re-check your thyroid function test, would probably be the only way to find out for certain if the Cymbalta is causing your hypothyroidism.   One approach would be for your doctor to treat you with thyroid hormone, if he/she feels that is warranted for your TSH level, continue with your Cymbalta until you and your provider decide that it is the right time to taper the medication. Then, after 2-3 months, you and your family doctor can decide if it is worth stopping your thyroid hormone for a period of time and re-checking the TSH.   I hope this clarifies the issue that you have raised. Thanks1  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I'm going to try and make this short.  I'm a mildly depressed guy.  I've spoken to my doctor about it and he referred me to a specialist and also said that I would most likely be treated with meds and therapy.  I never went because I've heard bad things about some of the antidepressants and thought they wouldn't work.  And I really fear going to another doctor.  Also no motivation.  My depression is mild sometime worse. I've been like this since my early teens.  I have no motivation to do things that really need to get done.( I am functional, I have a full time job as a software engineer)  I have problems falling asleep and then once sleeping have difficulty waking.  I can sleep 24 or more hours If I have no reason to wake.  I also sometime have mood swings. I've been told I mignt be bi polar but I never really feel the manic side.  At least not unless something really good happens to me.  I do have a family history of Bi polar on my mothers side.  My grandmother was hospitalize twice when she was young (once after my uncles birth and once when my grandfather passed away).  My mother suffers from severe depression.    The real question I have is. Recently I've taken Oxycodone 10mg to 20mg.  I wasn't prescribed it and it was taken for recreation only. (being honest)  One thing I noticed while taking the drug was I became very happy and motivated. I felt like completing things that I've had no motivation in the past to do.  I enjoy speaking to people and just felt happy.  I realize taking this drug is something I can't do on a regular basis but was wondering if I could expect similar results with antidepressants? I really for once think the quality of life could improve drastically if I could have the motivation and happiness I felt while taking this drug.  Any info would really help.  Thanks  My info 27 yo male I smoke cigarettes (been trying to quit but always fail.) decent physical condition I take no medication for anything I've had no known major medical problems Fully insured\n\n",

    "content": "Hi reefshark01,  Your experience with feeling happy, motivated, and enjoying normal things in life like social interaction, caused by what is called an \"opiod\" type of medication such as the oxycodone that you took, is both common and typical. People who suffer from chronic depression such as you often can say things like \"I felt happy for the first time in many years\". You are of course right on target that it would be quite risky for you to continue to use the oxycodone or other opioids in order to feel good; this would likely quickly lead to a state of dependence/addiction and the big problems that we all know about that accompany this.   The answer to the question as to whether an antidepressant would have a similar effect, is it absolutely could, though not as quickly nor as suddenly. If you have never been treated for depression with medication and appropriate psychotheray, I would strongly encourage you to consider this. People often can feel \"normal\" or happy for the first time in years, or ever. However, the process of feeling better usually takes at least a few weeks, and often a couple of months. Recovery is gradual and has ups and downs, often. With your family history of bipolar disorder, you may have a risk for future manic-type moods, and I would suggest that you get a psychiatric evaluation before receiving any treatment; you many warrant a different treatment approach than many with depression.   i have found that people such as yourself do best with BOTH of the good and well researched treatments for depression. The combination of medication, along with the two types of researched therapies for depression is often the best approach. the two types of therapies that are well researched for depression are called:  1. Cognitive-Behavioral therapy for depression 2. Interpersonal Psychotherapy for depression.   These therapies both take place about weekly and for about 5 months, and they help people work on changing the \"stuck\" patterns of thinking, feeling, behaving and relating to others, that often \"feed\" depression, helping to maintain the depressed state and preventing other feelings from developing (feeling happy, engaged in life, connected to others, motivated about life).  I hope this is useful to you. Thanks for bringing up your issue, as it pertains to many others. Your courage will help others to get help as well.   Good luck!    -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gus,  Firstly, it's possible for each of us to have reactions to medications based on our own physiology.  For instance, I knew a man who became very angry and obsessive when he was given regular insulin for his diabetes.  Obviously, the type of insulin was changed, and he did fine.  Regarding your specific question, Wellbutrin was most likely the medication you read about.  While not common, it has been known to cause hostility.  Cymbalta has been known to cause irritability, as has Lexapro.  When considering the information that any drug may cause an unusual reaction for certain people, that is why Psychiatrists prescribe in lower dosages and tritrate upward for the best effect.  The self-obsessed part is most likely part of the depression, when people have the symptom of focusing inwardly.  It could also be an exacerbated personality trait.  I hope this helps answer your question. Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doylestown,  This does appear to be a complex medication regimen with a fair number of medications. It can happen that such a large number of medications is needed, or sometimes people can receive unnecessary medications. You will need to talk about this with your psychiatrist. That being said, your list does contain medications generally used for similar target symptoms, and possibly not necessary, for example:  Citalopram and Wellbutrin are both generally used for depression, and both are at only low to moderate doses. They are sometimes used together when one alone doesn't work at a maximal doses or the largest tolerated, for depression. They work by different brain transmitter systems, which is why they are often used together. It is a bit unusual to use two antidepressants with a patient with bipolar disorder. Wellbutrin is sometimes used for ADHD, but you also have Concerta, presumably, for this. Both of these can contribute to insomnia.  The two are occasionally used together for ADHD, when necessary.   Clonidine is usually used in your situation for opiate withdrawal, but for this is needed 2-4 times per day, as it only lasts about 4 hours. In addition, you are well past your withdrawal period, as it appears. I wonder if this is needed; you might discuss this also with your doctor.   Benztropine is used for unusual side effects from Abilify and Seroquel, symptoms such as muscle stiffness, drooling, gait abnormalities, walking and moving slowly; these side effects are called \"Pseudo-Parkinsonism\". Sometimes benztropine is used preventatively for pseudo-Parkinsonism, in case the symptoms might occur, but it is possibly that you don't need it.   Seroquel is generally used for very emotional agitated states, depression that doesn't respond to regular antidepressants, manic states, and severe temper problems, also anxiety. It is sedating, so if it is used for one of the above, and insomnia is a problem, it can help both. If you don't have one of the above conditions, there are other medications that may be preferable for insomnia alone.   I don't want to pre-judge your psychiatrist, because I don't have enough information, and patients with complex conditions with multiple diagnoses sometimes need complex medication combinations, so yours may be appropriate. However, you deserve to understand the rationale and necessity behind each of your medications, as well as what other options you have, so I urge you to ask your psychiatrist if you can schedule an extra 15-20 mins so you can discuss your concerns.   Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

Recently i have felt a tremendous amount of dissociation (feelings like i was very removed from my body, or if my arms and legs did not belong to me)  I have felt dissociation before, but that was years ago during the height of my panic disorder.  I went on Paxil and after a while most of the feelings of dissociation went away.  I got off of paxil (was on it for 4 years) and several months later i began to have insomina.  The doctors tried everything, but trazadone works the best.  I sleep right through the night.  The problem is the heightened dissociation.  i have read some forums where doctors have taken thier patients off of trazadone because of increased dissocation, but the information is scant and the sources are unreliable.  Of course, I\u00b4m going to talk to my doctor about this but i want to hear from another source.  Can trazadone increase dissociation, even if only rarely?  Or is the source something different.  I was prescribed Amitryptiline before trazadone to help me sleep and the more i took the more anxious i got.  I know that amitryptiline is in the same class as trazadone so i\u00b4m guessing the increased anxiety might be causing me to feel this dissociation, but i\u00b4m not a doctor, and so that could be just some phony theory of mine.    all the best\n\n",

It seems possible that when you stopped taking Paxil (and started the trazodone), your pre-existing dissociation (which you reported occurred along with panic attacks), returned. The cause may have been stopping the Paxil, rather than an effect of the trazodone. Are you also having panic attacks again? This would tend to point toward the stopping of the Paxil, as well. In general, trazodone is not used as an anti-anxiety medication, including an anti-panic medication. I agree it would be a good idea to discuss this further with your regular doctor. Good luck!  E.

I had upped the Lexapro to 10 for three months at one stage but I just don't want to be on these drugs.  I feel I would benefit more from therapy, and having been on and off meds for 8 years or so I have never gone to  a pyschotherapist.

This drug has long half life thus it may require long time till the withdrawal symptoms disappear.  General recommendations for patients during withdrawal are: - Never go off medication without close medical supervision.   - By slow dose reduction , the brain can gradually adjust to the change in chemical balance . Some experts say, that it may need up to a year for a smooth withdrawal.  - Psychotherapy during withdrawal for withdrawal symptoms is very helpful and is superior to medication in the long run.   - Any external factors that may lead to depression or a panic attack should be avoided.  -Exercise help in, reducing stress, anxiety and insomnia, increasing sex drive and elevating self-esteem.   -Healthy diet, vitamin supplements e.g. Vit B6.  - friends and family are very important part of therapy. I hope this information will help.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm having trouble getting off of Paxil, which I've been taking for about 2 years. I'd been having side effects (nightmares, night sweats, fatigue) which had been getting worse so my nurse practitioner cut it from 40mg to 20mg. That didn't work so I decided to just get off of it altogether. She told me Paxil wasn't that difficult to get off of and told me to cut my 20mg tabs in half for 2 weeks and I would be fine. Well I had severe withdrawal--zaps, sweating, mood swings, nausea, no coordination, suicidal thoughts etc. So I ended up calling the emergency line on the weekend and got a dr on call to give me 10 mg for 2 wks. Well I cut it in half and have been taking 5mg for about 2 weeks now. I still cannot get off of it; I have the same symptoms if I skip even a day. My nurse says I'm just hypersensitive and that 2 weeks of 10 mg is standard procedure. She basically just blew me off when I called her just now. My question is, am I really just hypersensitive? I've read countless articles online and seen videos about people having trouble but I need to know a doctor's point of view.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello eal,  The gradual withdrawal of your Paxil is the recommended approach, just as your treatment provider is doing.  The symptoms you describe may actually be related to the Paxil itself, and it is possible to be hypersensitive to it.  Has your treatment provider considered replacing Paxil with another antidepressant that is easier to discontinue?  It would be in your best interests to seek evaluation and services at a local Mental Health clinic or private provider to assist you in managing the stress of these changes and adjustment to your overall condition.

    "content": "eal,   I just want to provide some moral support to you as someone who has taken antidepressants for 12 years. I am not a medical professional and do not claim to know any more than what has been told to you by the previous responder. However, I have experience with Paxil withdrawal as well as withdrawal from other antidepressants.    I stopped taking Paxil without going through the tapering off that doctors recommend a person do. I have also done it according to specific tapering off instructions and found that it made very little, if any, difference in the withdrawal effects I experienced. Having gone through what you have in my own life and having known others who have, you may (if you choose to stop taking the medication for whatever reason) need to be prepared to suffer for 10 to 15 days.    Believe me, I know what those side effects are like from withdrawal. They are rather debilitating. I am sorry that a Nurse Practitioner told you Paxil was not \"that difficult\" to get off of. Relatively speaking, perhaps it is easier to get off of than heroin, I wouldn't know. I just want you to know that there are many of us out here that have gone through this and that the withdrawal effects usually go completely away by the end of two weeks. I have known some people who have had them for longer but this seems to be what is most commonly experienced. I have empathy and sympathy for you and some health care professionals do not understand how difficult this withdrawal experience really is and cannot be expected to have the answers. I think it is most helpful to seek support from those who have experienced these things first hand in addition to maintaining contact with your prescriber and/or any other mental health services you use. My advice is to hang in there. Once the withdrawal is over you can and will discover whether you need to be on a medication. Feel free to respond. Take care and I wish you the best.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I believe that I am currently experiencing withdrawl syndrome from Zoloft. I need help!  I took 100 mg of Zoloft for two years for anxiety. After speaking to my doctor, decided to stop taking the medicine. He suggested taking 1/2 a dose for a week, then 1/4 dose for a week. I did this and felt so ill (brain zaps, dizzy, and with intense mood swings) so I decided to develop my own taper routine.  I took 1/4 dose (25 mg) for two weeks, then started taking 25 mg every other day for two weeks.  Eight days ago I stopped altogether.  This weekend (day 5 & 6 from medicine stopping) I started to develop the symptoms again. Am extremely moody and sensitive---sleep constantly, have brain zaps, can't stop grittin my teeth, have been having night sweats and intense violent nightmares.  I am having trouble driving and working due to the dizziness, lack of focus, and general fatigue.    Since I am already 8 days into taking no medicine, I feel like I should just 'push through' until my body rebalances. Is this a good strategy? How long does this feeling typically last, even with a dosage weening plan, such as the one I used?  Help! Thanks so much.\n\n",

I would suspect your symptoms are related more to your anxiety and/or depression returning than from withdrawal from the medication.  Your weaning schedule was fine but you may need the neurotransmitter treatment for your symptoms to be in control.  If there's a reason you need to be off Zoloft, perhaps another option would work for you.  Talk to your doctor about your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not expect any serious concern over switching the medication.  Both can be very effective and are in the same category - SSRI.  It is not surprising that the PA is not familiar with these because there are many and it takes a specialist to know the fine tuning of prescribing.  There are some that a quick switch could be harmful but to my knowledge this is not one of those.  MAOIs are a category that sometimes requires a break when changing, but the SSRIs can usually be switched from one to another without concern.  If this continues to control your symptom, and is more readily available, you should be fine with the change.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The medications do not sound excessive but if you feel it is having negative behavior consequences, you should discuss your concerns with his doctor.  While you would need your husband's permission for the doctor to give you information (and this would be ideal), you can still give the doctor information regarding him even without his approval.  In other words, the doctor can receive information about his patient from someone else but cannot give the outsider information without the patient's approval.    Fine-tuning treatment in mental/behavior health can take quite a while, lots of trial and error and good feedback on success and failures.  Blood tests do not give the information needed and so medication treatment can only be done through this complex method.  Family feedback is very important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Alcohol is considered a depressant.  Some people feel it makes them feel better so they don't believe this but that is a temporary benefit if any and each person responds differently to drugs - and alcohol IS a drug.  When there is noticeable personality change, it seems pretty obvious what the solution would be.  Trouble is, if she doesn't buy into that, nobody else can force it.  She could agree to a trial to see if there is marked improvement by stopping or at least limiting the alcohol.  Some people should not take any alcohol at all because of their own response to it.  It is believed there are genes involved in alcoholism which explains why some are addicted so easily and others never are.  Recognizing this and being open to the possibilities is important in making life decisions.  She may even benefit from being involved with AA while trying to go cold turkey on it.    If she is committed to the relationship and her own well-being, hopefully she will take some positive action.  If she decides to take this step, it would help if you would join her in her resolve to remove alcohol from temptation by not using it yourself.  Her desire for good mental health is evident in taking the medications and that is commendable.  Many people refuse to acknowledge such problems and self-medicate with alcohol or other drugs to counter the negative effects of their disorders.  Good luck to both of you.  She needs your love and support.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Fluoxetine and hallucinations",
    "content": "Hi lizzy302,  Your partner's hallucinations could possibly be a side effect from the fluoxitene, but one needs to be sure of the following as possible causes:  1. The hallucinations are due a worsening of the depression.  2. The hallucinations existed before starting the fluoxitene. In this case, they could be due to depression, another psychiatric condition, or a medical condition (unlikely, but possible). 3. The hallucinations are caused by a \"switch\" from depression to what is called \"mania\". This is an agitated psychiatric condition marked in part by decreased need for sleep, excessive activity, speaking a great deal and rapidly, impulsiveness, and an elated or irritable mood. (It does not sound as if this is the case with your partner).This switch is occasionally caused by people taking antidepressants, and can signify an underlying vulnerability to a bipolar disorder rather than simple depression.   Hallucinations from fluoxitene and other antidepressants as a side effect are unusual, but not extremely rare. If this is determined to be the case, your partner's provider will likely want to stop the fluoxitene, lower the dose, and perhaps later switch to a different antidepressant. Since fluoxitene is eliminated from the body very slowly, it may take up to 1-4 weeks for the hallucinations to go away, if they are a side effect. It is possibly that your partner's provider may want to use another medicine to treat the hallucinations if they are very disturbing are problematic in a serious way, while waiting for the fluoxitene to \"wash out\" of your partner's system.   Good luck; please have your partner, or help him/her to speak to the provider about these upsetting symptoms.   -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi eufsma,  The safest answer is yes, you should wait the full five weeks. However, if you under the close supervision of a psychiatrist, she might consider allowing you to start the Parnate sooner, with the proviso that you have the proper education regarding the possibility of a hypertensive crisis, so that you could seek medical attention. In addition, patients often are given to hold and take in case they experience the headache of a hypertensive crisis, special medications that can block this from occuring. Sometimes, chlorpromazine is used, in a single dose, and there are others for blocking the hypertensive reaction. Even so, it would be important to do this only under careful supervision and with a visit to an emergency room or your physician immediately should it occur.   -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Most doctors worth the money you pay them will intentionally set what seems like an unnecessarily long tapering off because going off of any med, especially antidepressants, is different for everyone, and can have some VERY serious withdrawal symptoms. This is to me the only medically (and morally) sound option. If your doctor sets something that's too slow for you, he can reduce it faster if he sees you're handling it well. If he sets something too fast for you, he runs the risk of making your life miserable, and possibly forcing you to go back up to your original dose anyway.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello redroses,  Jeffreytn has given you a fairly good response, but I will add to it.  Your pharmacist does not appear to be recognizing the length of time you have been taking your medication.  It is wise to use caution when discontinuing a medication like WellbutrinSR because it directly effects certain neurohormones in your brain.  When discontinue too quickly, there can be physical and/or psychological symptoms as a result.  The best approach for you is to ask your doctor for his rationale in the progressive weaning plan.  After discussing it with you, he may be willing to do it a little more quickly.    I hope this information helps you resolve your issue. Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

(i.e. come off medication one year after starting)  - What changes in the brain from the effects of the medication that makes it possible to come off of the medication?  - She currently isn't in therapy but is seeing a psychiatrist.

    "title": "Re: Coming off medication",
    "content": "Hello themonarch,  Your issue may already be resolved, since this is a late response.  However, I'll address it anyway, to be sure you have some information.  The diagnosis of \"borderline\" can mean several things.  The most intense is Borderline Personality Disorder.  Less intense and more responsive to medication is to have borderline personality features.  It sounds like your friend would be in the latter group, since she has had a positive response to medication and may be weaned off it.  It would be best to have her discuss it with her psychiatrist, since he might be trying to reduce her dosage to the lowest range possible while still providing the assistance she needs.  The changes in the brain are related to altering the amount of neurohormones; not all medication effect all diagnoses.  That is, some medications alter some neurohormones, and other medications alter other neurohormones.  Because of that, we are not able to identify what changes might be taking place in your friend's brain.  However, her psychiatrist is able to do so, and I urge her to discuss it with him.  Behavioral therapy might be helpful to your friend.  She could pursue treatment at a community mental health center, which would have a sliding scale payment system, in which a patient pays what they are able to pay.  Some pay little or nothing, dependent on their income.  Her psychiatrist could refer her, or she could pursue it on her own.  However, it's important that she keep her psychiatrist informed so that her treatment is coordinated.    We wish her good luck in resolving her issues. Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "title": "Seasonal Depression, yes. But possibly more.",
    "content": "Last year in November I was finally diagnosed with seasonal depression. I say finally because it wasn't something that I talked about to anyone up until November 2008. I was fed up with dealing with this problem alone, and I wanted to talk to a doctor. I can't really recall when it started, but I would say maybe around 2002 and I was 13. I'm not sure if it was really that early, but I remember feeling similar feelings then that I feel now. However, I don't think they were as severe. For the past 4 years or so, the \"depression\" has occured around the same time, which is around fall/winter time. But I have had years where the \"depression\" I felt, I experienced it in the summer and late spring.  So in all, I don't know if its just depression. I mean, right now I do kinda feel down. But I am taking some pills that somewhat help with my mood. They aren't the same ones my doctor prescribed though, my mom didn't want me on anything that had the side affects, she wanted something natural. So Im on these Sam E things that we bought from vitiman world.   My question really is, what else could it be? It's been like a rollercoaster these past 7 months or so. With this problem, I don't want to go out, at all. Which I know is one of the many common symptoms of depression. However there were times in December, which is usually the month I'm down going by previous year patterns, I wanted to go out with my cousins and socialize with friends etc. And because of that, I thought it had something to do with the pills I was taking. Its somewhat hard to explain, I can be up, loving life, everything is just great, and then I somewhat sense that I am about to go down again. And I do. Just last week I sensed I was about to go back under. I was off the pills about 2 weeks ago because I felt I didn't need them, but last week I started taking them again hoping to prevent going back under. Well, they didn't work as I am in the same mood I've been in for all the different times I've dealt with this throughout these past months and years.  I think there is more though. I'm usually a very confident, some would say cocky guy. I'm 19 and when I'm up, there is pretty much no stopping me. I'm active, I'm outgoing, I'm funny. And I like who I am. But even when I'm up, I still tremble. Shaking, I'm shaking like all the time. I can manage it better when I'm up and not feeling depressed. But even then, Im still trembling. When I'm down like I feel now, it's worse. I feel emberassed, I feel nervous, and tense. And like the whole world is judging me. I don't feel worthless anymore, though I have when I was down before. But I do find myself asking why continue to live if you're gonna always go back under and be down. I'm really worried because this affects my whole life. Many would probably say I look scared or nervous because of my constant trembling. And while at times I'm neither scared or nervous, it is true sometimes.  I have what I think are tension headache's like everyday when I am in my depressed phase. I find it hard to concentrate, can't get any good sleep as I'm just to worried or nervous about the next day or what happend the current day. Take me to school, the mall, anywhere where there are a lot of people around, I'm sure I'd stand out in a negative way, and I hate that. I feel pretty much hopeless. And I hate being in public when I feel like this.  This was not easy to do at all. I know my identity is safe, but still it's hard because I feel like I wasnt clear enough or this will be too hard to understand and too much. I hope I was clear, and though I know I have symptoms of depression, I'm really asking what the constant trembling, feeling nervous and tense, is? I mean my whole body shakes, and I look like a freak. Sweaty palms, shaky voice, lump in my throat, I have that all. My heart pounds a lot too, if you stand and stare at me, you could see it pounding through my shirt.   I don't know if there is such a medical diagnoses for my particular problem other than the depression. But its the depression, and the shaking that has me now asking what is up? Any help and insight I really appreciate it and really need. Thanks for reading, and I hope someone can help me. Any questions about a specific part that I may not have been clear on, please highlight and ask. I'll answer. And again, thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear TXpatient89,  Your symptoms are complex.  Your condition could be Seasonal Affective Disorder, as you described.  The other symptoms of shaking, being active and outgoing, and then lapse back into a depressive state, suggest a possible bipolar disorder.  It is very important that you see your physician and report all of your symptoms as you did to us.  There are conditions that respond well to natural therapies, but yours does not appear to be one of them.  Perhaps it would be helpful for your mother to know that nearly all medications start from a natural substance, but are just regulated into a pill, capsule or liquid to ensure a consistent dose.  The lack of consistent dosage is the problem with natural medications.  Your mother is mistaken in thinking that natural substances don't have side effects.  They may have many, but they are not listed on the package, because they are not regulated by FDA.  I urge you to see your physician and discuss all of this with him or her; he or she may be familiar with a natural product that would help you.  Because of the cycling of your symptoms, it's important that you at least see your doctor, and ideally see a psychologist or psychiatrist for appropriate diagnosis.    I hope this helps you resolve your issues. Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pamelar vs. Paxil",
    "content": "Hello, Both of these antidepressants are effective and often it's a matter of which works for an individual with the fewest side effects.    Pamelor belongs to the class of antidepressants called \"tricyclics\" and Paxil belongs to the class \"SSRI\" (selective seratonin reuptake inhibitors).  They effect different neurotransmitters and this is why it sometimes takes trial and error to find which is needed in your case.  Unfortunately, we're not able to run blood tests to determine which ones you may be needing.  The SSRIs have become very popular and they are newer on the market.  The main reason for this is that they usually have fewer negative side effects than the older tricyclics and they are sometimes more effective on other disorders such as OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder) or bipolar disorder.  But, again, this is a very individual thing.  Both medications can be safe and effective in the treatment of depression and other conditions.  Your doctor should take a complete history of symptoms, existing health conditions (thyroid, heart, kidney, liver, bi-polar or seizure disorders, other medications, etc.) in helping you find the right treatment for you.    With either medication, results can take a few weeks to be evident and negative side effects may improve in that time so patience is in order.  There are some similar side effects such as increased risk of suicide when starting the medication so you should be sure you are under a doctor and/or therapist care and report any thoughts of harming yourself.  You should also not discontinue either of the drugs without the knowledge of your doctor who may choose to have you reduce the dosage and wean gradually to avoid negative consequences of abrupt discontinuation.  Discuss any concerns you have about the medications with your doctor for more information.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lexapro long term side affects?",
    "content": "The SSRI's are some of the most commonly prescribed and taken medications in all of medicine-- while there is a large contingent of 'psychiatry haters' and 'antidepressant haters' out there who blame them for all of their ills, I am not aware of any evidence for long-term side effects.  I do not mean to classify you into the categories of people I mentioned, by any means.   There are discontinuation symptoms with some of the SSRIs and SNRIs, depending on the half-life of the medications.  Paroxetine and Effexor have the worst 'discontinuation-emergent symptoms', and Prozac (fluoxetine) probably has the least.    The 'brain zaps' and flu sensations are most common after discontinuation;  the way they are usually handled is to put the person on fluoxetine (4 bucks at WalMart or Target) for a month, then stop the fluoxetine-- it tapers itself over weeks or months.    As for the long-term effects, I just have never seen evidence for permanent effects on neurons--  the medications bind to the re-uptake site in a reversible manner, and do not do anything permanent. Just as much of the antidepressant effect is due to placebo, many of the side effects are as well-- that doesn't make them any easier to tolerate, but does suggest that the proper way to treat them is for your therapist to work with you to try to redirect your thoughts as much as possible.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I have been taking Paxil for about 8 months now, 20 mg twice a day; one in the morning and one at night. My body had adjusted to the medication and I was doing wonderful on Paxil. Only when I forget to take it, or take it off schedule do I have fierce side effects such as the fatigue and the fuzzy head feeling. I do have the dryness (in all areas! eyes, ears, nose, mouth, vaginal)   I recently started taking \"Cleansing DEEP DRAINAGE Body enhancement capsules\" and \"Invigorating CAL-METAB PLUS Body enhancement capsules\" through the company Elemis. (http://www.elemis.com) I have been taking them for 6 days now. (New Year...new me!) I feel as if the cleanse is cleansing away the Paxil. I have the extreme fuzzy head feeling, nausea, trouble focusing and just tonight I got hives for absolutely no reason whatsoever!  I was wondering if there was something in either of the supplements that was causing a reaction with the Paxil?    Thanks for listening and for any answers out there!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You cannot assume that all your symptoms are related to your medications.  There are other causes for such.  Irritable bowel syndrome, food allergies, and other GI problems can develop over time and should be addressed individually to be sure there is not an underlying disorder masked by the assumption it is a side effect of the medication.  The emotional symptoms can mean a return to the previously treated depression or anxiety.   Going off the medication can mean a return of symptoms because your body's neurotransmitters are out of balance.  That is the purpose of the antidepressantes.  You should be evaluated for the depression possibility by your doctor or mental health provider.  You would probably not have been prescribed the medications if you did not need them so to assume you can become \"normal\" as you say, after stopping treatment may not be realistic.  These disorders are just as real as diabetes and other more commonly considered physical ailments.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are wise to consider all risks and benefits.  You do seem to understand that the risk of depression and the resulting stress hormones created are not good for you or your baby so the treatment is reasonable.  Your doctor knows your history and may be the best judge of risk and benefit here.  The risk is considered to be in the last trimester; as opposed to other drugs which are more likely to do harm early on.  Because of this, I cannot reassure you that taking it later is safer.  It is a small risk overall; 99 out of 100 babies will not experience a problem.  If you elect not to take the drug, you should take other measures to  help regulate your seratonin.  Taking a daily walk and getting sunshine has been shown to be helpful.  Exercise releases the body's natural endorphins without risk to your baby.   Talk therapy can also help in many cases so combining these techniques might be an alternative to discuss with your doctor or midwife.  Depression is serious and sometimes severe postpartum depression can be avoided if you are treated prior to delivery so please do something to help yourself.  Good luck with the rest of your pregnancy and delivery.  Let us know how it goes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Persistent Pulmonary Hypertension in newborns (PPHN) is not only associated with immature lungs - it can occur in full-term infants as well.  And, without doing an amniocentesis evaluation, we cannot say at what point the lungs are fully developed anyway.  The studies that have determined an increased risk when the mother took SSRIs after the 20th week in pregnancy did not evaluate the older tricyclic antidepressants at all but generally they are considered just as the SSRIs, to be safe when indicated for the benefit to the mother and baby when depression puts them at risk.    I'm afraid the jury is still out on this and it is not known if PPHN is definitely associated with the use of the antidepressants.  More studies are needed on this.   To avoid or withhold antidepressants places pregnant women and their children at risk and, untreated, depression in the mother has been associated with poor neonatal outcomes, including preterm birth, low birthweight, and lower Apgar scores. The risk of PPHN is small - less than 1% in infants exposed to SSRIs in utero, so, many women with severe or recurrent illness may elect treatment with SSRIs during pregnancy.  If you are able to find alternative ways to treat the depression, you may feel more confident that no harm will result because of your treatment.  Maternal smoking and use of anti-inflammatory medication has also been implicated in PPHN.  These facts often confuse the results because the mother may have other conditions going on at the same time.  I have not heard of an increase in this syndrome among mothers who  used the tricyclic antidepressants but those come with side effects of their own and many women find them unacceptable.  Usually women respond best in pregnancy to the same treatment that worked before, if they were treated previously, so most experts believe it is not a good time to change their medication at this time.    Good luck.\n\n",

You should consult your regular doctor regarding the appropriate thing to do. What might be typically done in your situation might be one of the following:  1. take 75mg one day alternating with 37.5 mg on the second day, continuing to alternate every day.  2. Add a second antidepressant, typically bupropion, at a dose determined by your doctor (typically 100 mg is a starting dose) (also see #4, below)  3. Engage in psychotherapy to see what might be worsening the depression, restoring your EFFEXOR TO THE FORMER DOSE  4.  MIGHT SWITCH THE EFFEXOR TO BUPROPION IN LIEU OF USING THE TWO OF THEM  GOOD LUCK>    -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

Shortness of breath and ringing in your ears could come from anxiety, especially if it typically is part of your anxiety. However, with pain and shortness of breath, it may be important to rule out a medical cause such as pneumonia or other conditions, and if you havent seen your doctor, or if the symptoms are new, you should get yourself seen medically. One clue to understanding this, is did these symptoms start in the first week after starting the citalopram? If so, they may be more likely to be due to it? I suggest you also speak to your prescribing physician. Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Changing the time of day for this medication would be the first-line effort to try.  Chances are this will help but you will still need to give it a couple of weeks to see for sure.  Of course it could also be coincidental but sleep disturbance, especially in the early weeks of these medications, is common.  Many people find if they just hang in there a few weeks the side effects disappear.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Hydroxycut is a supplement; not a medication, and as such we have limited information about it - mostly supplied by the manufacturer.  It is not regulated by the FDA and not scrutinized and studied as other drugs are.  So, I can't answer whether or not it is a problem with the rest of your medications.  Just because it is a supplement does not mean you don't need to worry about this.  Interactions do occur and using the word \"natural\" or \"supplement\" does not mean it is safe.  The amount of caffeine in this product would alarm me and cause me to avoid it.  I see nothing to show any weight loss benefits aside from this because the other ingredients are in small quantity and have been shown to be ineffective in weight loss.  It appears the makers are using caffeine in the same way ephedra was used in diet products in the past.    You will likely achieve just as good or better weight loss using a tried and true method such as Weight Watchers, or other support group/solid diet and exercise plan without the risks that go with the supplement.  We all want the magic diet pill, but in truth, there is none.    As for the other medications, I cannot say why your doctor has prescribed all of these.  My understanding is that Lamictal and Seroquel are for the same therapeutic reason and seem something of a duplication.  But, often doctors do prescribe more than one antidepressant, for example, to affect different neurotransmitters.  You should discuss your concerns with your psychiatrist to learn his/her intentions.  Understanding your treatment is part of your care, so ask questions until you are satisfied.    The serious Lamictal rash is most often associated with children, people who also take Depakote (or another brand of the same) and during the first eight weeks of use in adults, especially if the dose is too high.  This drug is started in a small dose, and increased very gradually.  For this reason you should take it exactly as directed and report any sign of rash immediately (of course stop taking the drug if you do get a rash).    Best wishes.\n\n",

I too have bipolar disorder (BPD II), and I take Lamictal and Wellbutrin.  I am prescribed Seroquel, but I only take it as needed.    Although Lamictal is a mood stabilizer, it is not an anti-psychotic.  For most people, the Lamictal helps with the depression side of things.  The seroquel targets the mania.  For some reason, many people find that the addition of an anti-depressant couples very well with the mood stabilizer.    In my personal experience, and this is probably a silly analogy, the lamictal is like a boat keeping me safe and dry, the wellbutrin keeps the water from getting too still that I go nowhere while the Seroquel keeps the water from getting too choppy.  All 3 together, when necessary, keep things moving at an even keel.\n\n",

I plan on contacting my doctor tomorrow because its been holiday time and the panic just started three days ago.The first time this happen I couldnt take it. And now it is hard again. Do you think this is relapse or withdrawal from prozac from taking it so long? It has helped in the past but after usually 3-6 months on it I get bad anxiety and bad agitation. If this is withdrawal this time when should it go away? or should I take a prozac right away at 10mg Please advise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know of no vitamin to stabilize a person with bipolar disorder.   It is important for your mother to be evaluated to get a proper diagnosis.   You are right that she could be having both problems, but it could also be just related to menopause.  In either case this can be treated and I hope she would not be afraid of medication.  Many of the meds that we use are actually \"natural\" in that they come from naturally occurring elements.   Lithium, commonly used for bipolar disorder, is a natural element.  Just because a drug manufacturer markets the med, it doesn't mean it is unnatural.  There are various forms of natural or synthetic hormones to help with the emotional fluctuations of menopause.  She should see her gynecologist first and discuss the various options.  Some supplements marketed as \"natural remedies\" are in fact more dangerous than their man-made counterparts and they should be used with your doctor's knowledge to be sure they do not counteract the effects of other medications or aggravate the condition you are trying to fix.  In the end, it will still be your mother's choice whether or not to treat.  Seeing the doctor for diagnositc purposes does not mean she has to follow his/her recommendation.  Knowledge is important and it will be her choice whether or not to get treatment.   Best wishes.\n\n",

I am getting married in several months, and my finace and I intend to start having a family after the first year of marriage.  This seems a ridiculous question to ask, but is a year a long enough period of time to deal with the withdrawal effects and sufficiently get over them?  I'm hoping if I plan this out well enough, my future husband will not think I've gone crazy and ship me off after the withdrawal effects get worse (kidding, only kidding).  I've already experienced the brain zaps when I've missed a dose here and there over the last couple years, so I'm fairly realistic about what I'm up against, even though I'm not looking forward to it.  I've been relatively stable (depression-wise) over the last year, and do not want to be on any medication when I am pregnant, as I've heard and read terrible things about babies born to mothers taking this drug.  Any advice or suggestions would be greatly welcomed!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Weaning off of Effexor to get pregnant",
    "content": "Hello, You must consider both risks and benefits.  Sometimes the risks of NOT taking a needed medication are greater than the possible risks of taking it.  Depression is real and postpartum depression can be serious.  This can be aggravated in women who stop their antidepressants prior to this period.    While additional studies are needed, it appears that most of these medications are safe in pregnancy but when taken in the last trimester there are concerns about NAS (neonatal adaptation syndrome).  This is not considered to be a long-term problem but it sometimes results in the baby needing some extra attention in the special care nursery for a few days.  You may choose to take the medication until the third trimester but you should wean under the supervision of your doctor.    The way to wean off of Effexor is to drop your dose by 75 mg per week until you stop it completely.  Again, only do this after seeing your prescribing physician and if you do, once you become pregnant, make sure your obstetrician or midwife is aware of your history of depression and try to naturally increase your serotonin. through exercise and sunlight, a healthy diet.  You may find that it is not worth it to remain without the medication and you must also consider the effects on your marriage if your depression returns.  Discuss your options thoroughly with your doctors.  You may decide to try a different medication but only your doctor can really advise you on this, based on your history.  It is important to use antidepressants that work for year, since we're all very individual in our response.  Best wishes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

All of the people that seem to be having horrible withhdrawl symptoms really frightens me.  I was lucky last time and had no withhrawl affects at all.

    "content": "Hello, If you give the medication about three weeks to settle and for your body to adjust and you still have unreasonable symptoms, it would be best to talk to your doctor about possibly changing your medication to a different form.  Effexor does come in smaller doses as tablets (which may need to be taken more than once per day) or change to one that has similar properties, since you know this one is effective.  I would not advise dividing capsules.  Some meds are easily halved, but often capsules are designed to be time released and it would be difficult to divide exactly besides changing the mechanism of action over a time period.

    "title": "CYP3A4 enzyme:  SJW contraindicated with EVERYTHING",
    "content": "Hi all.  About 6 weeks ago, I came down with a bit of an Anxiety Disorder, which initially mostly manifested as Health Anxiety, but after seeing my neurologist is now mostly General Anxiety and perhaps some Depression.  I've seen a psychiatrist who is treating me with 112.5mg of Seroquel (75mg PM / 37.5mg AM) and .25mg Xanax (.25mg / day down from as much as 1mg / day when this started).    This week I've also started taking 100mg 5-htp (I know there is little evidence for efficacy, but there is some), 1g Valerian Extract PM, 3 * 100mg Kavalactone, and 3mg Melotonin PM on my own volition.  I tried to go over this with my Pyschiatrist, but he is the kind that only works or answers the phone one day per week, and I see him biweekly now.  (I'm not afraid of my Rx'ed meds.  I didn't believe in 'Herbal Remedies' 7 weeks ago, but when the house is on fire idealism goes out the window, and everyone grabs a hose)  I was originally Rx'ed Paxil, but I didn't want to take it as between the initial side effects, possible long term side effects, and the possible SSRI Discontinuation Syndrome I felt like it could draw out what I'm hoping is an acute problem.  Indeed I'm already a lot better than pre-neurologist.  I saw my psychiatrist after seeing my neurologist and getting a clean bill of health, so I was in a good mood, and he agreed Paxil might be a bit much and said I didn't have to take it.  I do think I need something for what might be mild depression, though.  I just think Paxil is like killing a housefly with a bazooka, and Seroquel won't address any possible Serotonin issues.  I want to take Saint John's Wort, but it is contraindicated with EVERYTHING because it is a CYP3A4 inducer, and can lower the plasma levels and half-lives of literally a majority of the pharmaceuticals in existence.  For instance, Xanax's half life and plasma levels are reduced by half, and that is one of the few psychoactive drugs that I can find studies for.    Another example:  Since I can't be on Xanax forever anyway I was thinking of completing the benzo-wean by switching to Valium.  Valium is apparently only partially (vs. primarily) metabolized by CYP3A4, or so some page on the internet said.  So, perhaps I could take the SJW with Valium, and expect only a 25% or less reduction in potency, for all I know.  Another example:  I was thinking I could deal with Buspar, and since Buspar usually works best with an SSRI I thought it might work synergistically with SJW.  However, once again Buspar is primarily metabolized by CYP3A4, so for all I know it's efficacy will be halved, or worse.  How much of a problem is this???  I can find no studies as to Buspar or Valium with SJW, however there is a single case study where Buspar + SJW induced Serotonin Syndrome, so that certainly confounds things a bit.  As of right now, I think what I wand to discuss the following with my psychiatrist:  #1  Switch Xanax to Valium...  I hear this is pretty common when coming off of Xanax, anyway, and while I don't think I'm ready to discontinue all anxiolytics, I want to be off Xanax ASAP.  I just like it too much for 4 hours then want it too much for another 20.  Also, as I mentioned I heard Valium is only partially metabolized by CYP3A4, so I'm hoping SJW won't affect it too much.  #2  Start Buspar...  One case study of Serotonin Syndrome doesn't scare me, and what have I got to lose but money if the SJW renders the Buspar ineffective.  Also, Buspar is a mild anxiolytic in and of itself.  #3  Start St. John's Wort...  Paxil is the strongest SSRI with the worst discontinuation depending on who you ask.  Everyone else says it's the 2nd best/worst.  I just don't want to take it.  SJW has been studied extensively, is Rx in some countries, is considered safe, and has little to no side-effects.  #4  Keep taking Seroquel...  I don't think it would be prudent to discontinue Seroquel after only 3 weeks.  For all I know it may be more responsible for my improvement than I give it credit for.  Hoover, once again, Seroquel is primarily metabolized by the CYP3A4 enzyme, so I might even need to increase dosage.    First of all, I'd like to thank in advance anyone who read all that.    Second of all, I'd appreciate very much any feedback, especially in the form of suggestions for or opinions of my current and proposed regimens.  Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  I think you may be overthinking the problem. First,  the anxiety problem does seem to be acute, but that's difficult to know. It's not there, then it is. It's less likely for it to just go away the way it arrived. Xanax isn't an ideal drug to manage anxiety, since it is really designed as a short-term \"rescue\" drug to abort panic attacks. However, if you \"like\" Xanax,  you'd likely love Valium, which has an even greater potential for dependency. Buspar is a good medication for GAD in many cases, and there's virtually no dependency potential. It works by itself or as well in combination with an SSRI, so if it's effective for you, it's probably the best deal.  As for depression, if you're diagnosed with  it (by a psychiatrist or psychologist and not by your self), then Paxil is a fine drug for many people, and if the depression is low-grade, then one would simply start at a low dose of Paxil (and, if needed, titrate upward til an effective dosage is determined). Doing it this way also reduces the potential for it (or any other SSRI) to aggravate the known anxiety symptoms, which sometimes  can happen if the patient is already having coexisting anxiety and depression.   I'd avoid the self-medication, as well as self-diagnosis, even with seemingly harmless herbal remedies, as they are not regulated, so are very difficult to dispense effectively. I'm not at all anti-alternative medicine, but I am very opposed to self-diagnosis and treatment. While it's great to be informed, psychopharmacology is a far too complex field for a layman to jump into without medical supervision.  By all means, if your doctor is willing, give the Buspar a trial. It sometimes works well with GAD (although not very well at all with panic attacks). If you like the Xanax too much, simply wean off it -- you don't need a substitute benzo to do this -- by slowly and consistently halving the dose. If you're unable to do this on your own, clonazepam is probably a better withdrawal aid.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please keep your psychiatrist in the loop when deciding to experiment with any medication, including herbal remedies.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Often side effects will go away after about two weeks, as your body become accustomed to the new medication.  Sometimes doctors start their patients on 10 mg daily to begin with.  The reason your doctor probably did not warn you of the side effects is because that is quite rare.  Most people can start this medication and hardly notice it; others may find a mild sleep disturbance corrected by altering the time of dosage.  There are also other effective medications if the way your body reacts to this one is not tolerable to you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Have not had anything like this for nine years but this year had vertigo, hemiparesis on right side and lots of involuntary movements.  Yet again all tests were normal so they were putting these things down to psychosomatic symptons hence the diazepam and the amitrypline.  Today things were quite bad and I had very slurred speech so the doctor has now prescribed procyclidine which to my surprise has worked.  My speech is back and the only spasm I have now is in my arm which comes and goes intermittently.  For the first time in ages I can actually tell that I have a headache and not just pains in my head.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My fiancee was taking Fluoxetine for a little under a year. She would enjoy sex, but was unable to orgasm and had decreased desire. Since we thought this was a side-effect of the SSRI, she decided (with her doctor) to move to Bupropion-XL.  She began tapering off of the Fluoxetine while taking a low dose of Bupropion-XL. When she stopped taking Fluoxetine, there was one night where she wanted to have sex. We were both excited that her sexual desire was returning, but it was only the one night.  She has now stepped up to a full Bupropion-XL dose (300mg) and is experiencing headaches, dizziness, constipation, weight gain, and no desire for exercise or sex. From what I have read online, the first 3 symptoms are standard for Bupropion-XL, but the last 3 are not, but could be from cessation of Fluoxetine.  She is extremely concerned, as she told me last night that if her sex drive doesn't return in 6 mos, that we might not want to get married. I told her that of course we would still get married; nonetheless, she is very concerned.  Is it possible that the decreased sexual drive is from ending Fluoxetine? If so, how long does it take to typically return? I have read some pretty scary stuff online about how Prozac can kill your sex drive permanently. We sure hope that is not what is going on!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Harrypancakes,  One important factor is how long ago the last dose of fluoxetine was taken by your girlfriend. It takes a full 4-6 weeks for fluoxitene to \"wash out\" of the body, so before then, the sexual side effects can remain. I am not aware of any evidence of permanent effects on sexual function from taking fluoxitene in the past.   In addition, if your friend's depression has returned, this in itself can cause a decrease in sex interest, drive and function, and this should be considered.   Finally, it is possibe, as you observed, that the Bupropion is causing headaches and other side effects, and this may be also lowering sex drive due to these side effects. In general, bupropion does not decrease sex drive. The dose of buproprion may need to be lowered if the side effects are significant, increased in a few weeks if the depression is continuing, or simply changed to another medication if the depression is not getting better despite increased doses.    In summary, there are several possible explanations for your partner's decreased sex drive continuing, and it would be important for her to discuss this with her physician. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "My friend was prescribed Lexapro for depression.  He has taken medication for depression in the past, but it has been more than 5 years since he was medicated.  He began experiencing anxiety and depression about a month ago and was presribed Lexapro almost 3 weeks ago.  He is taking 10 mg of Lexapro twice a day.  He is in his third week of medication.  He is exdtremely lethargic, sleeping 10 + hours a night, napping during the day, and not at all himself.  He has become withdrawn and rarely talks.  The sleeping is not as troubling as his personality changes.  I think he is over medicated.  Everything I have read, including the packaging on his prescription says \"1 tablet daily.\"  He says his Doctor prescribed Lexapro twice daily.  Although there is no prescription per se on the packages he received from the pharmacy.    I asked a friend who has been a pharmacist for 25 years and dispenses Lexapro daily.  He thinks the doctor may have written the prescription incorrectly.  My friend is hesitant to \"question his doctor\" and is not being rationale about this.    It seems to me that beginning with a lesser dosage of 5 mg or 10 mg a day to begin with would be the more sensible approach with an increase later if necessary.    What do you suggest?  Does 20 mg a day seem too much for an initial dosage?    If I can show him a response from you, I think he will then consult his physician.  Thanks much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wegas,  Often Lexapro can be started at a dose of 5-10 mg/d and this is an adequate dosage. It would be important to determine if your friends's lethargy is due to the original depression or came after he was treated with the Lexapro. if it is new since the Lexapro was begun, it very well may be a side effect, and it may be appropriate to lower the dosage. In any case, it would normally be important to discuss possible side effects with the prescribing doctor. While 20mg is often appropriate for some patients, it can be too much for others. I would encourage your friend to talk to his physician. You are clearly a good friend!  -Eliot SeigeMD\n\n",

Your friend's acne reaction seems to be an unusually extreme response.  Since we don't know what else he may have been taking, it's difficult to know if his reaction was related solely to the Lexapro.  Each person has an individual response to any medication, and any reactions should be reported to your physician.  He or she knows you best and will be able to guide you to the best dosage for you.  I recommend that you make an appointment to see your doctor and report your concerns to him, so that you get the best response to the medication.

    "content": "Hello -  Adipex and Wellbutrin are safe to use together.  One of the side effects of Adipex is dry mouth, which should decrease as you adjust to the medication.  Your unusual symptoms are most likely not an allergic reaction, since the lowered dose did not produce the symptoms that you identified after the larger dose.  That is, if you are allergic to something, any amount would trigger the reaction.    Your dry mouth may make it more susceptible to injury; it's possible that something you ate damaged your mouth, but it's very unlikely.  It's also not a good idea to alter the prescribed amount of Adipex without contacting your doctor.  I recommend that you review your symptoms and dosage changes with your doctor.  He or she is the best person to evaluate your symptoms and make any medication dosage adjustments.  Good luck, and please see your doctor soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Plasma monitoring to adjust dosages in a prescribed antidepressant are used when a patient is already on an antidepressant. Since depression is from the imbalance in brain chemistry and decreased serotonin levels, there are possible genetic testing to see what you would need. A psychiatrist could identify this genetic variant and then steer you to a different class of antidepressants.  Other genes may play a role in the adverse effects. This new field may also help find what drugs may produce toxic side effects to the patient. It can be tricky, since nearly all drugs are metabolized by a group of enzymes that vary greatly in activity from person to person. If you have a genetic mutation that results in either deficient enzyme activity or none, they would be likely to have serious side effects if you were exposed to the drug that is metabolized by the enzyme. A patient can be routinely screened for these genetic variations wich will tell your doctor which drugs to avoid. this could prevent major drug toxicity , which is a   major cause of illness and death.  I wish you lots of luck on your results to find a psychiatrist who will do this testing. There seems to be some states that have a higher percentage rate that do the testing. With new technology, it is a positive thing besides trial and error for use of antidepressants. So many people have to be on a numerous amount before finding the right one. simonne\n\n",

    "content": "Simonne,  Thanks for your quick reply.  However, can you provide the specific names of definitive these tests for determining appropriate antidepressant treatment?   Can you recommend psychiatrists or psychiatric centers who utilize and interpert these tests?  If you can provide this information, who can?  So far I have contacted the Phyciatric tepartments at Mount Sanai, NY Columbia Presbyterian, Mass. General and the Mayo Clinic.  All offer \"Expert Evaluations varying from 1-3 days and ultimately making treatment recommendations but only the Mayo Clinic option includes testing (their Cytochrome P450 test).  Ideally, I need the name of a local (NJ) psychiatrist that would test before prescribing yet another another antidepresson.  It's been 5 months of trial and error with no success.   InNeed\n\n",

    "title": "Zoloft and chronic diarrhea?",
    "content": "I've been on Zoloft for 2 months now. 100 mg and afterwards upped to 200 mg. Of course I had diarrhea at first but it leveled off. Maybe after that it could be described as \"looseness.\" Nothing major. Normal frequency, etc. Not a problem at all. At some point the dosage was upped but I was still doing decently.   A little over a week ago I started having horrible diarrhea. Basically liquidy mush 8 times a day sometimes...even an \"accident\" or two. My diet has not changed.  Otherwise I felt fine. My appetite is fine. No nausea. No vomiting. No fever. No abdominal pain. (Other than a little gas/bloating but it was \"that time of the month\" so I figured that was why.) I'm a little tired but that's to be expected, particularly since I quit drinking coffee just in case that was making it worse.  I tried Pepto B. a couple of times. No change. I tried Immodium. It slowed the frequency down but I still had the liquidy diarrhea. I began to only eat toast, rice, crackers and such. No change.   I called my shrink and he said I could try stopping the medication which I did. After 3 days I was still having the same liquid diarrhea. I haven't been taking any other medication except some Tylenol now and then. It's also possible that I've picked up a viral something or a parasite. Ewww. But I tried stopping the Zoloft first since it does at least cause some looseness.  My question is this...IF the diarrhea were caused by the Zoloft, wouldn't it have stopped when I stopped taking the drug? I would think after 3 days I would have seen a reduction at least. I know Zoloft has a very short half life.  If the Zoloft didn't cause this problem I'd rather keep taking it. It was really helping me, plus I can afford it. I'm just wondering if this type of thing would likely be caused by Zoloft or if it is more likely due to another factor.  Yes, I plan to see a family doc this week if the symptoms do not improve.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If Prozac worked well in the past, that would be a good choice now.  Since each person responds in his/her own way, it can take a bit of trial and error work to find the right one.  A history of successful use is an excellent starting point.  Not everyone experiences sexual side effects so all you can do is try it and see how it goes.  There is not just one that does or does not cause this problem.  Again, what works for one person may not for another.  Also, since emotion and relationship issues such as communication play such a big role in your sexual response, there are other ways you can help to counter any ill effects along this line.    Best wishes.\n\n",

You should discuss these options with your doctor.   Good luck,   Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jfrost,   I strongly recommend that you work with a doctor to help you safely taper very gradually from the diazepam. Your doctor may simply help you gradually lower the dose over a period of a month or so. It's important to have medical supervision due to the risk of a dangerous withdrawal syndrome. You do not want to simply stop suddenly (\"cold turkey\") taking the diazepam. Some physicians would simply taper your diazepam gradually, and others might substitue an similar medication called chlordiazepoxide and then taper that slowly.   Good luck!       -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a history of depression since 1995, then diagnosed with anxiety and agoraphobia in 1999.  I've been on a long list of drugs until my doctor found something that helped with my depression, effexor xr and zyprexa to sleep.  I was on that for nearly 9 years until this summer I consulted with my new physician, because I moved to another country, due to the side effects and I felt pretty confident my depression was gone AND i didn't feel like it was doing any good towards my anxiety and depression.  After successfully coming off the above two drugs I began to have terrible breathing issues.  I couldn't get enough air and enough deep breaths.  My GP checked me out and said it was a symptom of anxiety.  SO back to my phsych. and he has now put me on zanax 3 times a day of .5 mg each.  The anxiety is probably worse and so is my breathing.  I'm at my wits end.  I've been put on so many drugs I just don't know that I can go through another touch and go of trying drugs, especially with the stress i have living in this hostile country.  Is there anything in particular that you can suggest that I can recomend to my doctor to try to ease the breathing difficulties first and foremost and then help/fight the anxiety & agoraphobia.  I should mention that I pass out from my panic attacks.  Before you ask, yes I've been through a bountiful of neuro tests both here and in the US and nothing is wrong with me, I'm just one of those very rare people who manage to faint during a panic attack.  I've tried to consider taking natural herbs, but can't seem to find anyone here who can guide me on what to take versus what's available here in this country.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: anxiety symptom of breathing difficulties??",
    "content": "Hi Alagirl,   Typically the breathing symptoms that you describe are associated with panic attacks. I don't know your medication history, so it is hard to make suggestions. However, the following scenarios can be considered by you and your doctor:  1. A long acting benzodiazepine such a clonazepam is often better than Xanax, but this family of medications carries the risks of abuse, depression, and occasionally, dependence.   2. Zyprexa is one of a family of antipsychotics that works well for depression and panic disorder; it has a high side effect profile. Others in this family with a better side effect profile include Seroquel, Abilify, Geodon and Risperdal.   3. Often a SSRI or SNRI anti-anxiety antidepressant can treat both conditions. I am guessing that you've tried many of these, and if so, you don't want to go back there probably.   4. If you have depression along with your panic symptoms, you can return to the former medication family combination represented by Effexor and Zyprexa. This would be a medication from the antipsychotic family (above) and one from the SSRI/SNRI family (above).   My guess since you are asking help for only anxiety-related symptoms is that choices #1 or #2 may work best. But please discuss this carefully with your doctor as I can't make recommendations based on this limited interaction. Good luck!  Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

Since he has been consious he has been severly agitaed (he is restrained to his bed), he also seems to be in a dream like state where he doesn't know where he is or what's going on (he thought that I was my Mother when I last saw him).  He was given 24mg/ day of Ativan for the first 16 days, then they started to ween him off and he has been on Haldol and currently 4mg of Ativan. They said that the Ativan doesn't work so well on him- only for about an hour then he becomes agitated.  My father is now back in ICU as of 2 days ago so they can monitor him better.  He is still very agitated and I'm worried that they have given him too much Ativan and that he may be going through withdrawal.  Was he on too much Ativan for too long?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The dose of Ativan your father was given the first time, and the duration of that therapy, is pretty much within the standard of care for ICU patients, who often develop a psychological problem known variously as \"ICU syndrome\", and some other less clear ones. It involves disorientation as to time, day vs. night, etc., and these patients also often become agitated. Ativan has been the usual drug of first choice, but of course doesn't always work well. Your father may be experiencing some withdrawal symptoms, but with proper weaning that should be minimal, and he is now getting a lower dose along with Haldol (which also can cause paradoxical problems of the sort it's intended to suppress). The duration (16 days) of Ativan therapy was not outside the norm, and while it's long enough to require weaning at that point, it just doesn't always work (I've seen this happen a good many times -- most of the patients came around and did well once out of ICU and their essential medical problems improved first).   It would seem to be a fairly \"normal\" kind of situation, given the unusual atmosphere of the ICU and its effect on a lot of people. Hopefully your father will begin to improve and can be moved back to a regular room and regain his orientation, which should also help with the agitation.   Best of luck to you and to him. I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Papuca,  It does sounds like you have some type of anxiety disorder, perhaps panic attacks (panic disorder), or what is called a social anxiety disorder, or even components of both. Panic disorder and other anxiety disorders are very common, and they can occur even in the absence of stress.  It absolutely does NOT mean THAT you are going crazy, though most people feel as you do; it FEELS like going crazy, because it's so scary and one feels out of control. The good news as that your anxiety disorder, be it panic disorder or otherwise, is very treatable, to both cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy and medication. Many people need both treatments together. Medication offers the option of quick improvement, and psychotherapy will allow you to develop the skills to prevent attacks. You are on the right track, I suggest that you contact a local, recommended psychiatrist through your local hospital or through people that you may know. If there's a long wait, you can even contact your primary care doctor; he may be able to give you appropriate medication quickly, pending the psychiatric appointment. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "Antidepressants and ITP",
    "content": "Hi, so I am not 100% sure where to post this because it deals with both.  I am a 22 year-old-girl who was diagnosed with Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura four years ago.  About a year ago I was diagnosed with major depressive disorder.  After an initial try at Prozac, I started to take Lexapro for my depression.  It worked, but not as well as I was still having depressive symptoms pretty bad. This past June I was diagnosed with ADD/Anxiety.  My doctor and I are looking at a different medication for my depression that we will start in a few weeks. Since I have discontinued the lexapro however, my platelet count has risen dramatically, I am not sure if it is due to the discontinuation of the lexapro or a hold over from mono which I had last winter (I had a very severe case of it).  I noticed that a very rare side effect of lexapro is a decreased platelet count.  While I was diagnosed before, I am wondering if antidepressants aggravate the condition?  If so, as we are looking for a new antidepressant is there one that is safer for me to take?  I currently go to student health services at my school, and I have found it is best to go in there with some information as you don't always get to see the same doctors.  Sorry for the long post.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tareflamingo,  I am not certain of the answer to your question, though I am aware that some antidepressants have rarely caused thrombocytopenia (low platelet count). I will do a medical literature search and see what comes up. Please write to me on Monday to cue me to get back to you.  My guess is that a few antidepressants have caused rare cases. In your case, it is intriguing to wonder if the Lexapro was somehow depressing your platelet count, though the ITP came first. Alternately, the removal of the Lexapro may have contributed to a rise in the count without it having contributed to its depression, though I can't explain that. Let's see what the literature shows!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for replying! I really appreciate it.  I am now taking Wellbutrin XL, (which I didn't find anything associated with platelet counts), I started it about a week after my original post. Since I am not taking Lexapro anymore, and am doing well on the new antidepressant, it is more of a curiosity.  I really do appreciate the time you spent looking into this, and I understand you are probably busy.  :-)  Because of this you don't need to look into it (unless you are really curious yourself).  If you do I would be interested in what you find, but it isn't necessary.  Basically I just try and piece together any information I can find.  (The doctors I see at student health don't know a lot about ITP and the hemotologist I saw in the past was annoyed by my questions...as it isn't very serious compared to everything else they deal with, and I am in a safe range.).  But I really appreciate that you took the time to answer, it means a lot.  :-)\n\n",

    "title": "What to try next after propranolol, fluoxetine & sertraline?",
    "content": "I have suffered with severe anxiety from about the age of 17 and spent time on different types of medication including propranolol, fluoxetine and sertraline. I never really noticed any reall effect with the propranolol although I found the sertraline to be incredibly helpful. I came of the sertraline about 4 months ago (after being on it for two years or so) because I had been having CBT and felt really good. After tapering off really slowly I started experiencing extremely low moods and sadness. I also started feeling hopeless and worthless. When this started to happen I tried reintroducing myself to the sertraline, but it upset my stomach so badly that I lost a stone in weight and the mere thought of food made me feel sick. Most of my summer was spent experiencing day after day of what I call 'grey days'. It is the sort of day where you feel like you are living just to get through but not enjoying or being excited about anything else.  But more recently the low moods have thrown me into a depressive state. It's not so bad when I am work and not focussing on how I am feeling, but when I get home and sit alone in front of my computer I am often in tears with the fear that I will never live a normal life.On many occasions I have spoken to friends and family and told them that if this is what my life is going to be like for the duration then I don't want it. Although I believe that I would never opt for suicide, I have had times where I have sat and wondered about what I would do if that time came. It scares me sometimes to be driving by a bridge and think 'that looks like a perfect height'. I used to think that people who spoke that way were just buying for attention, so to think that way myself is incredibly frightening.  I want to try a different medication but I am frightened that with my current low weight and eating habits that another tablet would cause more issues with my eating. Is there any advice you could give me about what medication to try? I would quite like to gain weight so an appetite suppressant isn't good. And would an anti-depressant work on both the anxiety and depression?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Charlotte1984,  It's odd that you had so much upset stomach from the sertraline when you tolerated it well before. The fact that it was so helpful to you in the past would incline one want to re-start it and avoid the upset stomach. The following are possible: - you adjusted the dose to your target dose too quickly -your pharmacy gave you a different brand of the sertraline, made by a different company -you went to a higher dose than you used previously -you were on a medicine with the sertraline that lowered the level it reached in your blood.   If the first is true, then your doctor should help you adjust your sertraline. If the second (ask your pharmacist), you should go back to the manufacterer who made your old medicine. If the third, ask your doctor what your old dose was. if the last, you may need a different dose.   Finally, if for an unclear reason you no longer tolerate the sertraline, other options include Celexa, Lexapro, Cymbalta and Fluvoxamine. Speak to your doctor about this further. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While these symptoms are unusual for clonazepam, which usually causes few complaints regarding side-effects, in occasional patients this sort of thing can happen.  It may not be the drug, and the dose doesn't seem especially high (although some are more sensitive to a specific drug than average). You should, at the very least, contact your doctor and let him know what's going on and see if he feels, in your case, this could be caused by the medication. If so,  the dose could be halved for a while, or,  if he feels it appropriate, discontinued (by weaning off it). I assume you are taking clonazepam for an anxiety-related problem, so you don't want to stop it abruptly. Explain to your doctor that you cannot afford to be seen presently and would like advice on the apparent side-effects. If these are being caused by the drug your doctor should be able to advise you as to how best to try to minimalize the symptoms. He may also feel these may pass in a short while.   I hope this  is helpful. My best to you.\n\n",

Many people have suggested upping the Lex dose to 10 ML, however, I don't want to have to go through all the side-effects all over again with even more loss of appetite.

    "title": "Re: Lexapro for 5 weeks & still Loss of appetite",
    "content": "Hi there -  I think a lot depends upon the reason you were prescribed the Lexipro. It sounds as though you may have been given it for anxiety and it has made that worse. If that is the case, it may be too difficult to ride out the side effects (which, ironically, often include a temporary increase in anxiety or agitation, which often goes unnoticed when the drug is taken for depression). Also, half a .25 mg Xanax is hardly enough to make any difference at all. It's a low dose to start with, and halving leaves you with barely a trace amount to help with the anxiety you're feeling.   I have heard of some problems with discontinuing Lexipro, although I'm not sure why this is, since most of the older drugs in this family (serum serotonin reuptake inhibitors or SSRIs) can be d/c'd with little to no problem. For that reason, I think it's probably best you let your prescribing doctor know it's not working for you and that you'd  like to stop it and maybe switch to one of the other ones, or even to a different type of medication (such as clonazepam).   Knowing a little more about how you came to be on the Lexipro would make it easier to make a useful suggestion,  but I do hope this is at least somewhat helpful. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John - thanks so much for replying back to me. They prescribed Lexapro for me because I have not been feeling well for about 8 months - no energy, loss of appetite, dizzy, light-headed, just a general feeling of being ill - I went to the ER and was hospitalized for a night after what probably was an anxiety attack - they ran all sorts of tests - D-dimer to rule out clots, cardiac enzymes, heart monitor, CT brain scan, chest x-ray - all normal. I do have PACs-premature atrial contractions. I had taken Notriptyline back in 1991 after the birth of my child which helped and had no side-effects, however, because of discovering that I have PACs, the cardiologist said I can't take the Tricyclic anti-dep. so they put me on Lexapro. I have also read that Lexapro can increase anxiety - so I'm wondering why they prescribed that for me when my anxiety level is already high to the point of feeling physicalll ill. You mentioned another med - Clonazapam? Is that primarlily for anxiety? I never felt that I was depressed. The doctor just upped my Lexapro dose to 10 ML so I started that 3 days ago - still have the nausea and loss of appetite. How long do you think I should give the 10 ML Lexapro a chance to work? I can't have the feelings of increased anxiety and loss of appetite - that's what I was having Before I started the med - I was hoping it would help these things! Your insight is very much appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lexapro for 5 weeks & still Loss of appetite",
    "content": "Hi there -  While it's great you were able to have a very thorough physical workup to rule out anything physical and serious, the plan since then hasn't been that great, it seems. Tricyclic antidepressants were once used commonly to treat anxiety as well, but the side effects are so annoying for so many people that they've largely been abandoned except for the purpose of pain blocking. They also do sometimes provoke arrhythmias, but mainly ventricular ones. The PACs actually needn't have played a role in the change of medication, although in my personal opinion it's just as well.   The SSRI family of antidepressants, such as Lexipro, will often cause initial increase in anxiety, sometimes to an intolerable degree. Some doctors try to avoid prescribing from the benzodiazapine family of drugs (Xanax, Klonopin, etc.), because of their reputation for dependency problems, but this is only as a result of patients choosing to self-medicate or the doctor failing to give adequate instruction on the use (and usefulness) of these drugs. Klonopin (clonazepam) is part of this family, but while Xanax (which is far better known) is a \"rescue\" drug (to abort panic attacks, not to be used therapeutically to actually prevent them), it is often misunderstood and misused. Clonazepam, while from the same family, is a far more stable drug which has a 12-hour dosing interval and maintains a steady state serum level, which makes it ideal for longer-term therapeutic use. It also generally has less drowsiness-inducing side-effects (some people don't ever mention this, in fact) and is generally well-tolerated. It has a very low rate of dependency when used as prescribed, and often extremely effective in managing both generalized anxiety and panic attacks, sometimes with a limited supply of Xanax (alprazolam) sometimes prescribed for the occasional symptom breakthrough. Clonazepam is effective within a couple days at most, whereas the SSRI drugs like Lexapro often take weeks to kick in and also sometimes take as long for their agitation-producing side effects to wane. Then the patient finds out whether or not it's actually going to work at all or not. For this reason, while I am not qualified to make a recommendation, I definitely favor and argue for clonazepam in most cases, rather than one of the SSRIs (although the latter sometime work just fine). If an SSRI works smoothly and doesn't worsen the problem then I have no objection to its use. It just doesn't make a lot of sense, to me, to prescribe this (and this now goes double for tricyclic antidepressants) if the side effects make the situation worse, when there is a drug available which can usually get things quieted down quickly and smoothly. Then, sometimes, an SSRI can be started and the clonazepam slowly discontinued. It's usually just a matter of anxiety on the part of some doctors regarding abuse potential, which should be evaluated anyway, when anyone is being prescribed a psychoactive medication for any sort of problem.   I hope this perhaps gives you some ammunition for an informed discussion with your doctor, who seems pretty committed to the SSRI approach. One rarely hears of anyone complaining they've been \"hooked\" on clonazepam (although if you look for those sorts of stories you can find them -- just as you can find anything on line, it seems). Oh, clonazepam is also relatively inexpensive, if that's an issue.   Good luck to you with this. Anxiety is a terrible thing to live with, and the sooner it can be reined in, the better.   Please stay in touch, and thanks for following up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Female, 32 years old.   I am currently taking amitriptylene (15mg, 3X daily is the RX but I take all 45mg at night).  I was started on this a few months ago for chronic pain relief from Vulvodynia.  I was told that at my dose the only side effect I should get is a dry mouth but the truth is I have been experiencing a lot more and I wonder if it could be from the drug?   First of all, I have noticed that I have trouble achieving orgasm lately.  It has never been a problem before, but since starting this drug I can't hit climax.  Also, I have been the same weight (exactly) since I was in high school (at least 15 years) and have never had to watch my diet.  Now, within the last month I have gained 8 pounds even though my appetite seems to have greatly diminished.   I also occasionally have arm and leg twitches (maybe 4 per day) that started shortly after beginning the drug and I get dizzy and lightheaded when I stand up.  I had unbelievable fatigue when I first started the drug but now I just feel lazy during the day and then can't sleep at night.  A few nights ago I went to bed at 10pm but didn't fall asleep until after 4am.  I then woke up on my own at 7 and started my day on only 3 hours of sleep. All of this is somewhat frustrating but I don't even know for sure if it is all the drug or just coincidental timing.  I was told by both my gyn and my GP that I wouldn't have any side effects apart from dry mouth.  I don't have another appointment with my gynecologist for another 3 months and he is the one who prescribed it so I think I have to just deal with it for a few more months.  I know I have been babbling a bit here so I will make my questions more specific.  1.  Is it possible/likely that all these symptoms are from the drug even though it is such a low dose? 2.  If the drug is causing weight gain, will my metabolism go back to it's previous state when I finish the meds?  I have always had a high metabolism but I am worried that after having it slow down so suddenly, it might not end up going back given that I am now in my 30's.  A thirty something body might just be looking for a reason to slow that metabolism down...  Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While amyltriptiyine can be very effective as a pain blocker, it is rarely prescribed for depression anymore because of the side effects. It is also a decent muscle relaxant, and this is mainly due to side effects such as you've described. It carries a whole host of possible side effects and it is entirely likely the problems you describe are due to the use of the drug. It may also be, at least in part, due to the concentration of the dose all at one time, at bedtime, that's causing some of your symptoms. I'm sure you've determined it works best for you this way, and since it's not an excessive dose I'm not going to wrestle with you over the lumping together of the day's worth, which would theoretically give you day-long relief from pain, but which may be too little in the 15 mg. increments. I'm just speculating here. While I usually would advise a patient to adhere to the dosing instructions, I'm assuming it didn't work for you as hoped in divided doses. This may be part of the problem.  There are other pain blockers which don't have quite as annoying side effects as amitryptiline, although they do have their own side effects (and weight gain is a common one among all of them). And while some people do experience metabolic changes in their 30s, if you were normally active and otherwise healthy before starting the drug, you will very likely lose the weight when and if you decide to discontinue it. At least this is the usual pattern.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Lexapro Withdrawal - Shortness of Breath?",
    "content": "Hi -  I'm a 30 yo, male and I've been experiencing some Lexapro withdrawals and am concerned about being short of breath the last two days.  Not sure if it's just anxiety or what.  I've been dealing with GAD for the last 11 years, so I'm well versed in anxiety and panic attacks.  I'm giving some history here, so bare with me.    I've been on and off anti-depressants for ten years.  At diagnosis (1999), I was put on Celexa and Buspar.  I'd prefer not to take these drugs, so I'll be on them for a while and then stop because of how they make me feel and the fact that it really just addresses the symptoms and not the root cause.  A year earlier I was diagnosed with Acid Reflux/Gurd with some h. pylori and went through the regiment of high dose antibiotics.  I took Prilosec OTC for years until recently due to it maybe being linked to heart issues and have been getting by on Pepcid Complete chewables as needed.    In 2006, I was going through some wicked panic attacks and my PCP tried to put me on Cymbalta.  I refused to take it after reading about it.  We compromised on Lexapro and it actually did wonders for my anxiety, but not so much for my weight.  I have gained 30 pounds in the last couple years.     In 2005, I had a stress test due to complaints of chest tightness.  After I was done, I was sitting there recouperating (I'm a big guy, 6'4\" 330 pounds) and the nurse starts going into emergency mode.  Well, here I am, sweating like a pig, but otherwise feeling fine and within 20 seconds, there were 12 doctors and nurses packed into a tiny stress test room.  They thought I was in Vtach.  After 4 days of hospitalization and numerous tests (echo, angio, EP study, blood work) they concluded it was an electrical issue, no heart attack or Vtach - it was PSVTs and was told it was benign, I had nothing to worry about.  They put me on Toprol XL - 25mg to control the PVCs which caused the tach.  One notable about that whole experience.  My BP was always good, like 110/70...until I had that EP study done, when I came out it was high and has been every since.  Granted, I've only had it check when I'm at the cardio (and I'm not much for doctors offices - white coat syndrome, lol) and it has been running like 130/88.  The cardio doesn't seem concerned as '90' is the magic number and even then, it has to be constant.  I chalk it up to some doctor's office anxiety too.  Weight gain from the two drugs (30 lbs) is helping either.  The nurse told me last time, lose that 30 pounds and you'll see the difference.    So, I've been on both the Toprol and the Lexapro (I can't remember the dose, but it was nothing obscene, I *think* it was around 10 or 20mg) since 2006.  I was okay at first, but the longer I was on these two, the more and mroe I felt....well, like a slug.  I became more and more lethargic and withdrawn.  It got to the point where I didn't want to do anything or even leave the house.    I started doing some reseach a couple months ago about these two drugs.  Turns out other people were experiencing the same thing and feeling the same way I was.  I always felt like I was being...dragged down...like I was just carrying 50 pounds on my back.  Everything was an effort.    About 2007, the pharm (via my insurance) switched me over to the generic Toprol (metro-soemthing er other)...this is when all the lethargy and whatnot really started.    I did a little experiment.  First, I started cutting the Toprol in half, taking 12.5.  My cardio said it was such a low dose, even if I just quit it, it wouldn't have any effects on me (I was asking if I needed to carry a script, just in case I was travelling and they lost my luggage or something like that).  He said if I did have to stop taking it, that a couple days of weaning off and I'd be fine.  So I figured that just cutting back wasn't going to hurt (I see him in a month or two for an annual visit).  Within a week I noticed my energy levels were increased and I generally felt better.  I stated cutting back about two months or so ago.    Next was the lexapro.  I started cutting those in half too and was doing okay with only mild anxiety occasionally (I can control them pretty well, I'm a veteran at these things now).  I was taking the half dose for about a month or so and just stopped when I ran out on Labor Day weekend.    I was fine for the first week, but this past week, I started having the classic withdrawal symptoms.  At first, I didn't really know what was going on.  I had the cold shivers and sweats, shakiness.  I didn't think too much of it as it only lasted a few hours and then subsided.  But then the dizziness and wooziness started.  On Tuesday I felt in other world almost.  I couldn't even turn my eyes in my head without feeling woozy.  I had some waves of nausea, but never got sick.  I did a little house cleaning and was okay while doing so (didn't feel like I was gonna pass out, just a little woozy)...it wasnt' until after I sat down that I felt bad.  After a couple hours the dizziness subsided.    Today, it's not too bad, still a little woozy (it's still early though!) but I know have been having shortness of breath the last two days.  Especially when sleeping.  It's really affecting my ability to sleep and be comfortable.  I even had a dream last night that I was being intubated.    Basically, what happens is, as soon as I start to get into a deeper sleep, I wake up, gasping for breath and palps, so I've not really been able to get past that 'light sleep.'  I also have spasms in my right leg (I've also been dealing with a gout issue in my right foot this week too).  I noticed they almost coorelate, of course, it could be coincidence.  My leg will spasm (starts in calf and shoots up leg) which then wakes me up, taking a gasp and having my heart pounding.  Needless to say, this is not condusive to a good nights sleep.    Last night I tried sitting up when I went to bed.  It was better, but not 100%, just not as bad gasping.  I wasn't having the spasms in my leg.  I thought I was actually going to get a decent nights sleep.  Wrong.  Sitting up while sleeping isnt' exactly comfortable, so about an hour in, I laid all the way down (with two pillows).  That's when the spasms and gasping started again...and I didn't sleep well again.    Now, I am a web developer and have been working 15-16 hours a day on a website, sitting in this computer chair.  I did some more house cleaning yesterday, for about two hours and legs felt good.  I do try to get up every couple hours and stretch out, but that proves difficult, especially when time flies by, before I know it, it's been 3 hours.  I think the chair is cutting into my hamstrings and causing the spasm issue.  Also, along with the gout and my body tensing up for the pain that comes along with it.  Oh, and I did take two Advil Wednesday and Thursday to help deal with the gout pain - which has susbsided, I didn't take any Advil last night.    I have had this shortness of breath issue before (the gasping when sleeping), but it's few and far between.  The last time I had this issue was about two years ago and it only lasted a few days before subsiding.  Maybe it's just allergies or stress, could just be the change of seasons.    I also have neuropraxia of the branch of nerves on my left collarbone.  I forget their name.  This causes tigthness in my jaw, shoulder and pains/tingling in my left arm and pinky/ring fingers.  Sitting at a computer all day typing doesn't help either.  If I turn my head to the right, from my jaw down to my elbow is all one big pull.    My question is, is this shortness of breath anxiety related because of the Lexapro withdrawal or is it possibly something else?  I am under a lot of stress with this site and my financial well being is heavily tied to it.  Is it because I'm coming off the Lexapro, couple with some other things?  I'm comfortable it's not a heart issue (my big anxiety issue) since I was checked 7 ways to Sunday a couple years ago.  Even cutting back on the beta blocker I don't have to take (and it's been about two months, I figure I would have seen symptoms before now).  I knew that I would probably have some anxiety issues getting off the Lexapro, and breathing issues and anxiety go hand in hand.  I haven't had a drink in a week, nor have I smoked marijuana (which I had been doing for years) for the past week and I have stopped for good.  These were my two vices that kept me calm...even if the marijuana did cause some anxiety issues on its own.  I havne't had any coughing really, but I feel like I have a tickle or 'dirt' in the back of my throat.  I feel that little...knot of excitement, is what I call it, in my chest....typical for anxiety me thinks.    Maybe it's sleep apnea?  I was supposed to have a sleep study done the same week as the last stress test, but didn't make it due to my little vacation in the hospital.    Should I be concerned about all this or just ride it out and chalk it up to the lexapro withdrawal?  Wait and see?  I'm not going back on it, going on three weeks now, so why start the cycle over?  Maybe I bit off too much when quitting all my vices and the Lexapro at once?  Should I just throw back a beer and try to relax some?  I don't have an alcohol problem, I don't HAVE to drink, but it does relax me and I find my mood elevates if every few days I have a couple drinks.    Sorry for the long post, but when you go the doctor, I always feel rushed, like I have to spit everything out in 1 minute or less because they need to get onto the next person...maybe it's just been the doctors I've seen.  I'm also trying to give a big picture instead of just saying, yeah, I have this problem, what is it.    Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Baines77,  The issues that you present are certainly multiple and complex, but the following seems clear: your shortness of breath could be due to your heart, or to anxiety, or to withdrawal from the Lexapro. The serotonin discontinuation syndrome can last for quite a while. To be on the safe side, you might return to taking it at one-fourth of a tablet per day for 3 weeks, one-eighth tablet for three weeks, then stop. Also, I would consult your cardiologist or internist right away to make sure this isn't cardiac related. Finally, the shortness of breath being related to anxiety is also possible. Try these other things and see what happens; most important, being safe is the focus of my suggestions. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

I told my psychiatrist, who had never heard of such a side effect; but upon reading the possible side effects listed with my prescription, I saw that numbness was listed as a possible serious side effect.  I have also seen it listed as a 'less severe' side effect on WebMD.    Since my doctor had no idea on the subject, and only had the advice of stopping cold turkey to see if the numbness went away, I am hoping that someone has some information on this.  I am not too worried, but I do want to know whether or not it is a serious condition or not.  Thank you very much for your help.  z\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Numbness in fingers from Paxil usage",
    "content": "Hello -  While I've never heard of this side effect associated with paroxetine (Paxil), and although I've not been able to find it in my favored web-based sources nor the PDR, it doesn't seem unreasonable that this might  be a potential, though I would think minor side effect of the drug in some people. The fact, however, that it is, in your case, confined to one hand, suggests this is probably of some other origin, most likely orthopedic.   The \"cold turkey\" experiment might be worthwhile if Paxil were something that would clear your system in a matter of 24 hours or so,  but in fact it can take many days, sometimes a week or two, for it to completely eliminate, so that would hardly be worthwhile, especially if it is working well in its intended capacity.   You say you're having numbness in \"a couple fingers\" of your right hand. Would these, by any chance, be the 4th and 5th fingers (ring finger and pinky?). If so you would seem to have some sort of impingement of the ulnar nerve, and then would need to see either an orthopedist or neurologist if it persists.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi fergyjean,  The product marketed for weight loss is a combination of natural substances that do not appear to have been scientifidally tested for weight loss, excepting one component caffeine, known to lower appetite. So, I can't answer your question about this product.   Some other ideas: Could you get as much benefit and less weight gain from 5mg/d of the Lexapro? Have you considered weight watcchers program, I believe it's very good, you could consult a nutrtionist, often at your primary care doctor's office. Generally, the medications that promote weight loss have enough risks and side effects, that physicians do not prescribe them in this situation unless you've tried many other things.   A final option would be to combine the Lexapro with a low dose of Wellbutrin XR, to treat residual symptoms of depression, if there be any, and to revese the weight loss. Your psychiatirst may or may not be comfortable with this.  Good luck!       Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

I will check to see if there is any research about its use in depression that I am unaware of, and you can check in with me if you like. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mason4477,  I'm assuming that you haven't cut back your xanax (which might cause a severe withdrawal reaction), you are probably having the common SSRI discontinuation syndrome. It sounds like you started to have symptoms when you went from 12.5 mg/d of Zoloft to none, so if you are sure that this is what you want to do, you might consider returning to 12.5 mg/d for two more weeks, and then cutting to 6.25 mg/d for two weeks, and then, if you can get creative or have your pharmacy get creative, cut again to 3.125 mg/d for two weeks before stopping. This ought to be gradual enough. But, please discuss this first with your regular physican. Another approach is to switch to about2.5-5 mg/d of Prozac along with the 12.5 mg/d of the Zoloft, and after three weeks, stop the Zoloft. Finally, after that you can cut from 5 to 2.5 to 1.25 mg/d of the Prozac, taking each dose for a week before cutting it in half, and then you can stop it. Prozac remains in the body, washing out very gradually on its own over about a month's time.   Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cararyann,  In general, drinking alcohol while you are taking medications that are designed to affect the brain is discouraged. Brain depressants are clearly dangerous when used together with alcohol, and these include the family of drugs known as benzodiazepines (such as Ativan, lorazepa, or Klonopin/clonazepam), antihistamines, atypical neuroleptics and others. The SSRIs and SNRIs are not generally dangerous from a medical standpoint (like Ativan and alcohol causing the possibility of slow or stopped breathing), but mixing them can interfere with obtaining the therapeutic benefits from your medication. Cymbalta and Effexor are generally not dangerous with modest alcohol use (the equivalent of 1-2 beers over 2 hours), but one can't be sure. SSRIs and SNRI's that are sedating, such as Paxil, Luvox, or Remeron, may be more risky, and should be avoided.   To be sure, avoid alcohol use, or keep it to under a beer per night, taken a few hours before the medication is taken.   Good luck   -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "There is no other way for me to describe effexor. A waking coma. At one time I was on a 325mg dosage. It has numbed the bad but also the good. I have been trying to get it out of my system for 2 years now.  I have been pulling apart capsules and counting the granules for 2 years. Always hitting a platue about once a month where I have to stop at that dosage and wait a couple of months to start counting down the granules again. The last 5 months I have been platued at 75mg. Four days ago I went \"Cold Turkey\". God it hurts!!!! Emotionally and physically. I have vivid dreams and nightmares. Last night was the worst. I have read here that \"weed\" helps but I have never done it so of course I don't have any around nor do I know how to get it. Consequently last night, desperate, I drank 1 1/2 bottles of wine. I was so depressed. Bad idea! I had  suicidal thoughts,bad things from my past felt raw and new. I can't begin to describe how awful it was. I felt insane. Thank god I passed out before anything serious happened.  I haven't wanted to talk to a dr. about this because I am so worried they will try to change my mind or put me on something else to ease the withdrawal or they will change my prescription and make it a lower dosage. I wanted my full prescription filled because it made me feel secure even though I had to count the granules every day I knew I could always have a choice. I could always go back up even though in the last two years I have never allowed myself to rebound.  I am so glad for this forum. I know I couldn't have done it without being able to come here and read, but this is my first post.  Now, on my 4th day, wondering what is out there.... I'm scared. I cry easy, I'm still dizzy. I have horrible motion sickness just turning my head. I have a sharp pain in my head on the left side. How long will this go on and what will happen now?  What if I can't take it? What is a normal emotion? What do normal people feel?  Is there life long side effects to taking effexor for 7 years? I don't want the debilitating anxiety attacks to come back but I never again want to take another pill....ever!   Please help.. LittleBitNorth\n\n",

    "content": "LittleBitNorth,  It's been a while since your posting, so I don't know where you are at. If you are still having symptoms of the discontinuation syndrome, the strategy that you can discuss with your doctor is this: substitue fluoxitene for the Effexor, and then gradually taper this. Fluoxitene (Prozac) is much easier to taper than Effexor because it washes out of the body much more slowly, causing less of a \"shock\" to the brain serotonin receptors. It should be an adequate repleacement for the Effexor; the equivalent to the 75 mg dose of Effexor may be 5-10 mg of the Prozac. Let me know where you are at and how you are doing; it certainly has been terrible for you!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the advice. I didn't think anyone was really listening. (prob part of my problem=)  I have been off for quite a while now. I still am having withdrawl but its slowing a bit and effects me more when I don't get enough sleep.  I have started a detox diet of juicing and was told to start drinking mango juice and eating dragon fruit in the morning because it would give me an improved natural serotonin level. I have lost 28lbs and feel more energetic. I'm very stubborn as far as taking any meds again. I understand the concept but after this many years trying to get off effexor I am really afraid of taking anything, even asprin. I think all medication has side effects to some extent. I know that a lot of this paranoia is because I'm off the effexor and the panic attacks are back again. Compared to a coma though.. I will learn to live with this. Thank you so much, again for your help and advice.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: cipramil and cipralex",
    "content": "Hello -  The  two drugs are closely related in terms of molecular structure, activity, etc. They work in much the same way, but the manufacturer of both claims greater efficacy for Cipralex. If you notice any negative difference you should go back to the original, but both are available locally for you. The dosing is the same for both,  although since there are some  differences in their molecular structures it is possible one would require more or less of a dose to achieve the same results. In most cases Cipralex should be somewhat more effective, but clearly if it were totally superior Cipralin wouldn't be prescribed. I'd say go with the one that seems to work best for you and if they are equal, then make the choice based on cost. Otherwise I  see very little to choose between the two.  Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm trying to decided if I should try yet another antidepressant.  I'm on my third try and it's very frustrating.  Started on Prozac and within a week I was extremely anxious and agitated.  Swithed to Citalopram, it worked for the first three months, then I felt no better than I had prior to antidepressants.  I am now on Wellbutrin XL 300mg daily, have been taking it for about three months (started with 150mg daily for one month).  It seemed to be working well for the most part, but now I am always tired, moody, and feel like I could easily become majorly depressed again.    Should I see my doctor and ask about switching again?  I am currently seeing an internist, and he did suggest seeing a psychiatrist.  I'm just not sure what I should do.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LizaJane,  A referral to a psychiatrist is a good idea. That being said, I would ask if you have been treated with psychotherapy yet? Cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy can address issues causing depression that medication may not be able to do. Alternately, people are often treated successfully with medication and psychotherapy together. Regarding the Wellbutrin XL, your doctor may want to gradually increase your dose up to 450 mg per day. If this is not helpful, a common approach to your medication would be for your doctor to consider prescribing citalopram together with Wellbutrin, the combination working better than either medication individually. it would generally be within the area of expertise of a psychiatrist to be prescribing such a combination, and perhaps he/she could also either treat you with psychotherapy as well, or refer you to someone appropriate. Other types of medications can also be effective when standard antidepressants are not. Sorry it's been so difficult, it often is for a while finding the right antidepressant, and good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

My primary physician had given me a referral to see a psychiatrist, but unfortunately I canceled that appointment. At the time I canceled I was feeling fine.  I really didn't like the side effects of the citalopram, mainly the low libido. Being depressed causes enough of a low libido without adding to it.  But I do believe I could benefit from a combo of meds.  I think I'll call my primary physician tomorrow and see about a referral. Again, thanks for your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LizaJane,  I do think that a referral to a psychiatrist would be a good idea. Regarding the cause of medication when it doesn't work, the most common reason is inadequate dosing. For example, your dose of Wellbutrin at 300 is below the maximum, which is 400 if tolerated, and this might be the amount you need. We don't know how much Lexapro that you took, but doses can be increased up to 60 mg if done cautiously and you tolerate it. Often, internists can use anti-depressants at doses lower than those necessary.   Barring these increases, your psychiatrist might recommend one of the psychotherapies proven to treat depression as well as medication, or he might prescribe two medications that augment one another, such as Wellbutrin with Lexapro, or an SSRI plus a \"novel neuroleptic\" such as Abilify or Seroquel, or augment an SSRI with lithium or thyroid hormone, or finally, try a tricyclic or MAOI antidepressant.   In other words, there are many options, and these are best known by a psychiatrist. Often, psychotherapy along with medication is the optimal choice.   Good luck!      -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

I have tried other antidepressants, but none of them work for me like the Effexor has.  It has taken care of the anxiety and panic attcks very well, but I just tired of the side effects and they have been wearing on me over the years.  I stay groggy and require alot of sleep.  I fatigue very easily and my brain feels \"foggy\" much of the time.  I have been exploring natural alternatives lately.  I have been doing alot of research on amino acid supplements and I think this could work for me.    I feel that I have a definite neurotransmitter depletion and that amino acid therapy could help.  I am interested in taking amino acid capsules or powder and/or HTP.  I am just wondering about the reaction with the Effexor.  Can I take these two things together or are there any known risks?

If you take tryptophan along with Effexor, you are subject to the possibility of having what is called a serotonin syndrome, which is a potentially dangerous set of symptoms caused by an excess of brain serotonin.

    "title": "Re: Consequences of Anti-depressant withdrawal",
    "content": "Dear makotokamiyoshi,  There are two aspects in response to your question. Firstly, stopping your medication suddenly is likely to cause what is called a discontinuation syndrome. This is a very unpleasant set of bodily sensations that can last from days to weeks or even longer, and include, dizziness, shock-like sensations, tingling, feeling sick, and other symptoms.   Secondly, we can ask if the fluvoxamine has helped you with your problems, as represented by your diagnoses. If it has, how long might it take for those symptoms to return. They would likely return from within a week or two, to as much as several months or even more. Partly this would depend on your history of the pattern of psychiatric problems that you have had; their frequency, duration, recurrences, etc.   The bottom line is it's never good to discontinue suddenly, unless there is a medical or psychiatric emergency that warrants it. Please discuss it carefully with your prescribing physician.   -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

I have spent the last 2.5 years in school to become a firefighter (currently an Operations Manager). This career change has been a huge challenge and sacrifice as I'm married with 2 kids. I have juggled my family, night school, volunteer firefighting, fire training, volunteer St. John Ambulance and my current career to become a firefighter. I finally have all the qualifications to be considered and land an interview.......two in fact, one last week and one in two weeks from now. My question is, can anyone tell me or direct me as to how I can find out if my being on Effexor XR has diminished my chances of becoming a firefighter. I am aware that under NFPA (National Fire Protection Association) standards there are certain medical requirements. Each municipality uses their own assigned medical team to perform testing such as hearing, vision, stress test and blood testing. Do they frown upon anti depressant users? YOUR THOUGHTS? Keep in mind I do not want to contact the municipalities just in case.            Signed HOPING ALL IS FOR NOT.\n\n",

I love this pill, i take 10 mgs, and doze off like a cute little sleeping beauty, all fuzzy and comfy cozy, and i wake up perfectly.  I've only just started taking it and wall so happy with my combo platter.  but then i went online and read too many doctors articles about the 'weight gain' of ELAVIL.  Pretty much saying the same thing. that ELAVIL slows down the metabolism, is one of the highest weight gain'ers in this pills categories, etc etc.  I then went into quite a few forums, where i found hundreds of people saying pretty much the same thing:  \"i gained alot of weight on ELAVIL!!\"...AND other choice words, i shan't mention.  My question to you is alot shorter than this post, thank god.  Since Wellbutrin elevates the metabolism, much like speed', and Elavil does the opposite, would the wellbutrin counteract the effects of a slow metabolism from elavel? and if so how? and if not , why? could you explain it some details as i'm much more intelligent, than i type. and will be able to understand your answer, even if i have to bookmark 'dictionary.com'  while reading it.

    "content": "Dear problems101,  The antidepressants, amitriptyline and nortriptyline are used for chronic pain, for which they are effective. This probably occurs due to the serotonergic effects of these medication. It is known that the serotonin nerve cells in the part of the brainstem called the peri-aqueductal grey, travel downward into the spinal cord and connect in the spinal cord in specific regions with the nerve pathways carrying pain information from the body, lowering the transmission of pain back upward into the brain.   I hope that you are feeling better!          -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Dear nandayconure,  Lexapro can cause the SSRI discontinuation syndrome as can any other SSRI when it is stopped abruptly or tapered too quickly. Everyone's metabolism is different, and a safe estimate is to taper an SSRI over about a month, more with Effexor (an SNRI). Generally, one would have to be taking Lexapro for one to several months in order to then have a discontinuation syndrome. Hallucinations after one dose (or even many) are extremely rare, and very unlikely.   Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

You and your doctor should consider tapering from the 75 mg dose very slowly and gradually, over a period of one to a few months, depending on what you have needed to do in the past. I will check the published literature, and if you write back a posting in a week, I can let you know what I've discovered in terms of typical or average times for the withdrawal syndrome. Good luck, and please talk to your doctor so that you don't go through these symptoms for a prolonged period.   -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I finally decided to seek help the other day. I have bad anxiety and I've suffered from symptoms of PTSD and depression for over a year now (since being in a tornado).  My psychiatrist was 30 minutes late to my first appointment. When he came in, he seemed rushed and like he hadn't read my file. I watched him skim it quickly, then he started asking me a couple of questions about my problem.  About 10 minutes later (most of that was finding my medical history, not discussing my problem) he prescribed me both Paxil and Trazodone, without telling me what they were for and despite the fact that I told him I wasn't sure I wanted medication. He told me they were not habit-forming, but \"need-forming,\" and told me that I could go to all the therapy I wanted but would never get better without being medicated.  The visit felt rushed and the doctor was cold to me; I wasn't comfortable with the fact that he prescribed me medication so quickly and explained nothing about it. I was too nervous and stressed to think of any questions to ask him at the time. After filling the prescription and getting home, I looked up the medications and found stories of Paxil addiction/withdrawal and other generally horrible things. After research it seems Paxil is an extreme way to go, especially as my first try for an antidepressant. So I'm scared to try the medicines this man gave me because I have no reason to trust him.  What's worse is that I don't feel comfortable enough with the psychiatrist to tell him any of my concerns or ask any questions. I'm almost sure I'll switch psychiatrists soon, to see if there are any around here who might actually care about helping me, but I still wonder-  Is it normal to prescribe medication like that without actually getting to know your patient first? It just felt wrong.  Sorry for using up so much of your time. I'm just so scared to try to get help now.\n\n",

I don't think many people would have been comfortable being treated in the way that you described. Medications should be taken with caution, and it is unusual for your disorders to not be treatable with psychotherapy in lieu of medication, if that is what you prefer.   I am glad that you feel empowered to work with a psychiatrist who helps you to feel well cared for and that he/she is interested in you and your questions. You may want to either discuss your concerns with this physician, or ask around to find out which psychiatrists are felt to take care of their patients in ways that feel appropriate, patient and caring.

    "content": "Dear epix,  It''s some time since you've put up your posting, so by now you've probably figured out that you had some severe side effects to your medication, with the long period of sedation, dry mouth, and increased appetite all most likely from the Zyprexa. I'm not sure what has since been changed with your medications. Additionally, your doctor likely has someone available to answer questions during non-working hours, if he is not available. This is considered a medical standard.   Zyprexa can be used as a mood stabilizer for bipolar disorder is called a \"second generation antipsychotic\", and is notable for its tendency to cause increased appetite, weight gain, and sometimes associated diabetes and increased cholesterol; it is more likely to cause these side effects than other similar medications, such as Seroquel, Risperdal, Abilify and Geodon. Zyprexa is also more sedating than the former, in general.   You may have already discussed with your psychiatrist, or you should at some point, the need to regularly check your weight, sugar (glucose), cholesterol and triglycerides (another dietary fat). Sometimes the type of medication used, either an alternate second generation antipsychotic, or a mood stabilizer, needs to be changed.   Certainly you can't be sleeping such lengthy periods of time, and I hope that by now you have found a dose of the Zyprexa (lower) or an alternate medication that doesn't cause you sleep this way. Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

It's antidepressant brand name is Wellbutrin, and Zyban is the name used for smoking cessation. It's all the same drug, although there are different forms, including immediate release, slow-release, and extended release. The important issues include that your father receive an adequate dose, for an adequate period of time, that he be monitored regularly, that his target symptoms of depression be clearly defined and followed,  and that it be considered that he may need psychotherapy in addition to the medication.   I'm not sure why his doctor chose Zyban as the form of bupropion to use, though sometimes insurance coverage or the availability of free samples can be a rationale. You may just want to be sure that your father's doctor is treating your father's depression, and not smoking cessation alone.   Good luck!         -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi seriously12345,  Are you sure that you have ADD/ADHD; if not, you may not need a stimulant, especially as they can cause anxiety and depression. If so, you may want to use a different ADHD medication, which can treat anxiety and depression as well. Here are some options:  1. Find a psychologist or psychitrist who will give you a couple of sessions to simply listen to you and ask questions, so that you feel listened to. Defer any prrescriptions until a good asessment is done. See what diagnoses you are felt to definitely qualify for. Decide which are most important to treat first. Then, decide if they need medication, or if your doctor feels that they can be treated with psychotherapy.  2. If you do have ADD, along wiht anxiety and depression, consider stopping the stimulant to see if this is causing negative emotions as a side effect.  3. If it is not, and not helping the ADD, switch to  a medication good for ADD and depression such as Wellbutrin or Strattera. Wellbutrin may worsen anxiety.  4. If the stimulant helps the ADD and does not cause depression and anxiet as side effects, you can add an anti-anxiety/antidepressant medication such as Lexapro, Celexa, Cymalta, Zoloft, Paxil, or others.   5. You could try other stimulant medications if warranted, such as Provigil or methyphenidate.   6.. Consider getting cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy or interpersonal psyhotherapy in lieu of medications, as these are helpful, and provide us with inner tools for understanding anxiety;depresson and what to do about them.  Goodluck!  E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "HI Adam84,  Is the nortriptyline being used just for sleep, or for depression as well? The related medication, amitriptyline, is far better for sleep, and you probably will need much lower doses of it, perhaps 25-100 mg, unless it is being used for depression as well, in which case the dose will need to be higher. In any case, nortriptyline is not very sedating, and you could discuss amitriptyline as an alternative with you doc. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

I am only 20 years old and i was reading about how the drug may \"increase\" suicidal thoughts or acts in younger paitents.  I have NEVER EVER even thought of suicide or harming myself in any way, but with that being a known side effect just terrifies me.  Is that a warning for people currentley suffering from suicidal thoughs, or can it actually become a symptom that i have never felt before?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi in the 10s,  Not only Prozac, but nearly all of the similar, \"SSRI\" antidepressants, have been thought to occasionally lead to suicidal thinking in depressed individuals; this was most recently publicized in the treatment of adolescents. There is some controversy about this, in that its frequency is thought to be rather unusual, and that the rarity of this side effect warrants monitoring, but does not argue against the benefits of the use of these medications. Some think that the side effect of the SSRIs of feeling agitated, (known as \"akathisia\"), may lead to some suicidal thoughts in some.   The bottom line is that on one hand, no medication affecting the brain and one's mood should be taken without a doctor's careful monitoring, including for the rare occurence of suicidal thoughts as a side effect, depressed individuals can reap significant benefits from the SSRi anti-depressants, and should not have them withheld due to the fear of this rather unusual side effect.   If you depression is only mild to moderate, psychotherapy is as effective as medication, so you may want to consider this. Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "Flashbacks from 15 years ago - why now",
    "content": "I was sexually abused by my brother at the age of 12. I could not wait until I completed high school and left home. My parents did nothing about the abuse - I was told to keep quiet as it was a small town.  At the age of 17 I moved to the city and found a job and allowed a man to move in with me. I was looking for love. I continued to live with this man until the age of 25. During this time - the man was physically, mentally, and sexually abusive to me. Many times I seen my life pass before me - I was attacked in my car with an axe, he set the house on fire and I awoke surrounded by fire - I seen him physically severlely beat his brother who later died from head trauma - I was raped by his drug dealer friends to pay back his debt. I was physically, mentally, and sexually abused daily. I left the relationship in 1993 and lived in a womens shelter as I could not live at my home. I was constantly stalked. I began having panic attacks in 1993 and I passed out and had to be hospitalized. I told the medical staff of the abuse I suffered and was told to go to counselling and was put on meds. I stopped the counselling and meds when my doctor told me to. I was fine or thought I was fine.  Now its 2008 and my dad died in February and I was having trouble coping so I broke down and went to my husbands doctor as I did not have one. He was great he was not taking patients but I said I need your help. He listened to me for one hour - and prescribed me celexa 10 mg and zopiclone. What a lifesaver - I have been on celexa for six weeks and feel so much better. However, this week I started getting flashbacks of my past abuse - not being molested by my brother but the relationship. I see these visual flashbacks daily, nightly, they are constantly there. I get all panicky and it feels like I cant breathe. It does not happen for too long but its happening more often than I want. I don't want to have them at all. Is it because of the celexa that I am having the flashbacks. I am seeing my doctor in two months, and I am scared to tell him about the flashbacks, I was doing so good on the meds. My mind was so unorganized before and I could not function, could not sleep. Now my mind is too clear that I am remembering so much from the past. WHY NOW! I am in a great relationship with my husband and have a good job and like my life. So why am I getting so many flashbacks and why after 15 years. I am not understanding this at all. If I tell my doctor about the flashbacks I am scared that he  may commit me, it sounds so crazy. And am so scared to tell him about the past abuse... I am not sleeping only with the help of zopiclone by my doctor does not want me on it too long. I don't know what else to do. I want the flashbacks to stop. We had a fire this past weekend to roast hot dogs and I could not be there, I had flashbacks of waking up in a burning house. And I have had fires years ago, but I had no flashnacks, only while being on celexa. Or is it because my dad died and this was traumatic for me. He had a massive heart attack at age 95 and was put on life support but the hospital removed it, after consulting with the family. I saw him gasping for breath and though he had suffered, but my doctor told me that he did not suffer, so I feel better knowing that. CAN SOMEONE HELP ME!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Flashback,  You are exactly right, in that your Dad's death, which had some traumatic elements aside from that inherent in losing a Dad, has rekindled your brain's \"emergencies and danger\" system. This system is now on autopilot, known as a recurrence of your PTSD, and is likely causing your flashbacks and panic and other symptoms. People who have experienced trauma, especially the severe, repetitive, life-threatening traumas as you have, have their \"emergency/danger response systems\" to be highly sensitve and once triggered, the alarm bells keep ringing and need  special treatment to be able to turn them off. It's not under your control, so don't get down on yourself for that.   As your case is complex and severe, you probably need providers expert in PTSD, both a psychiatrist who can give you psychotherapy plus medication, or a psychiatrist for the medication and a psychologist  or other psychotherapist trained in treating PTSD for specialized psychotherapy, designed for treating PTSD. You would likely need to go weekly for several months or more.   You might consider explaining to your husband what is happening for you, even if you omit the specific nature of your traumas and just refer to some \" childhood trauma\". this is your call, or one to make with your providers.   Your doctor may wish to use another agent for sleep if you will need this long-term, or maybe not, but you may need some aid for sleep or awhile.   I applaud you as a couraeous survivor of abuse who did not give up and from the sound of it, have kept living life in full and saisfying ways, the best that you can!  Good luck,   Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding. I understand what you are saying - so its my father's death that caused the flashbacks, I was thinking it was the celexa and was going to stop taking it. I will try and see my doctor before my two month visit but I don't know how to tell him, I fear facing him and telling him that I am like a basket case right now. Maybe I will just write it out and give it to him. Just talking about it gives me the panic feeling. I don't know of any psychologist or therapist, is this someone that my doctor can recommend. Is there any meds that I can take to help me, other than celexa? I don't think I have the strength in me right now to start talking to someone about my issues. I remember back in 1993 talking to a counsellor and I was so physically and emotionally drained. And you are saying that if Idont get counselling or help that I will not get better... I was anticipating my fathers death for the last ten years that he was sick that I did not think when he passed away that it would hit me so hard, but it is. Maybe the reason I am not dealing well with it, is because of all the trauma that I experienced in my past. Maybe if all the abuse did not happen that I would not have any problem in dealing with his death. I don't know. You mentioned specialized treatment for PTSD, what can I expect from this. Is it like talking to a counsellor, like dealing with the inner child issue,as when I was in counselling before this is all that was basically talked about. I appreciate any comments, that you may have.\n\n",

    "content": "I was on Lexapro 10 mg for about 3 years. I tapered down over the past six months--first 1 pill every other day, then every two days, then every three days over the past month. I stopped taking them altogether on May 1.   I feel like hell. I have some vertigo, nausea, and the occasional brain zap.I'm usually a fairly physical person and I've wanted to sleep. My stomach has been amiss on and off. These symptoms really started on Thursday May 8. I was working with my personal trainer on sit ups and I got a very dizzy and nauseous during the workout.   I've been reading the internet boards about withdrawal and certainly my symptoms match--but I was taking so little, and tapered off so slowly that I'm astonished by how severe these symptoms are. I'm a healthy person in general not prone to complaining.   My questions: Should I see a doctor? How long will these symptoms last? Is there anyway to alleviate them without going back on the meds? Please help-I'm not able to exercise very much due to the vertigo, and htis makes me, well, depressed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lexapro withdrawal or something else?",
    "content": "Dear Volare,  I suggest you bring this concern to your doctor. That being said, a serotonin withdrawal syndrome can go on for quite awhile, and the way you tapered the Lexapro was not optimal; the recommended way would be to keep taking the Lexapro daily, but for your doctor to gradually taper the amount. To take it every other or third day is to expose your brain to widely fluctuating levels of the medication, perhaps worsening the withdrawal, and sending confusing messages to your brain cells' serotonin receptors. Your doctor might consider something like your returning to the 10mg/d  of Lexapro for a week, at which point your symptoms, should they go away, pretty well confirms a serotonin withdrawal syndrome as the cause of them. Then, to taper the Lexapro very conservatively since you've had such severe symptoms, you might go something like:   7.5mg/d for a week 5 mg/d for a week 4 mg/d for a week 3mg/d for a week 2mg/d for a week 1 mg/d for a week Stop taking the Lexapro  Discuss a schedule with your doctor, this is simply one possibility and might not be best for you.   While this is slow, it will give your brain cells (neurons) time to adjust to the decreased amounts of serotonin available to them, and go back to the re-regulation of serotonin receptors and of the way your neurons DNA is expressed through its guiding the proper production of important proteins in the cells.  If returning to 10 mg/d of the Lexapro for a week doesn't resolve your withdrawal-like symptoms, then your doctor will need to consider other possibilities.But, probably you'll feel a whole lot better! Good luck,     Eliot Seigle MD then stop.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, Paxil does NOT cause people to kill thier families!  It does not cause cancer!  These people do not understand how these medications work, nor what the ingredients are.  The FDA would never approve such a chemical.  Many of these effects people describe do not have anything to do with the drug.  People usually write in only to complain about the drug's side effects, genuine or not, usually not in praise of it, too, so remember you are usually only talking to people it didn't work for, which can happen.  That being said, there can be some unpleasant side effects, weight gain is possible, but no effect on weight and weight loss have also been reported.  It can sometimes have the opposite effect and make anxiousness worse.  All the side effects are what could POSSIBLY happen,  they do not happen to everyone.  If you are uncomfortable with taking Paxil, discuss with your doctor the many, many other options to help you with your depression/anxiety.  Whatever you do, do get help, you are more likely to attempt/succeed suicide without medicine than with medical therapy.\n\n",

    "title": "Paxil withdrawal",
    "content": "Hi.  I am a 39-year-old female, Certified Pharmacy Technician and Medical Transcriptionist.  My husband is a physiatrist (Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation).  My anxiety/panic disorder was diagnosed in 1989 and through therapy was controlled until October of 2004, at which time my father-in-law who had been living with us over the summer passed away, and within 2 weeks had over $100,000 damage to our home from different sources.  (Sewage backup, severe interior damage from roof leak in main house, tree cut and dropped through roof of garage.)  This all happened right around the time of the Florida hurricanes.  I was a mess.  I knew I needed something or I was on the verge of a nervous breakdown.  I asked my GP what she considered the best anti-anxiety medication.  She said Paxil, gave me samples and for 6 months I was on Paxil CR 25mg.  The medication DID work for me as it muted my feelings, which was exactly what I wanted.  I didn't want to get mad because one of the kids knocked some papers off the counter.  I didn't want to be yelling at my husband anymore.  I couldn't handle all of the run-arounds given to me by insurance companies, roof contractors and construction companies.  My husband went to a CME conference, which happened to be about SSRI's given by the University of California, San Diego.  He was told that Paxil was the worst about weight gain and loss of libido.  He knew I was upset about my weight gain and he was upset about his \"gettin' lucky\" loss.  He also didn't like how much I slept the entire time on Paxil.  They also informed that Paxil is reserved for sexual offenders (libido diminishing), anorexics (weight gain) and something else.  I was offended when he came home and told me to stop taking Paxil  because of these reasons.  I certainly didn't fall into either of these categories, and by gosh because of Paxil he was still intact.  They didn't bother to tell him anything about proper withdrawal.  I continued for a couple of days and then stopped so he would quit hounding me about it.  2 days after my final dose I was throwing up, dizzy, overly sensitive to light, noise and touch.  For 2 days I pretty much stayed in bed, except for the trips to the toilet.  Then I felt a little better.  Did pretty good for a couple of days.  Day 7, turned into the demon biotch from hell, yelling, back to the original position I was in when I started.  I still had not put it all together.  Occasional zaps or feelings of electric shock in my head, sometimes radiating through my arms to my fingers.  You can hear these zaps.  It kind of sounds the same as when you are yawning.  By Day 11, zaps were constant.  Blood pressure dropped from a usual 114/76 to 92/78.  Arms going numb if they were held up even elbow level for more than 4 or 5 minutes.  Headaches.  Whooshes, you're looking at one object, turn to look at another object but the brain doesn't catch up for a moment.  Someone described it as looking like the ship on Star Trek going into warp speed.  Did not feel safe driving as my brain would go into a deja vu thing, or it would feel like I was waking up out of a dream constantly having to refocus myself that this WAS reality.    I was enlightened by others who were going through or had gone through Paxil withdrawal on the safer way to withdraw.  Taper, slowly.  Since I had been off the medication for almost 2 weeks and I found some samples of 12.5mg CR I would go back on those to see if this indeed help.  Wow.  Life was back to perfect.  My 9-year-old even asked me after school the next day if I had taken my medication because I had explained to her why I was acting so irrationally that previous week.    I have now tapered to 2.5mg.  Life is complicated at the moment so I am holding at this dose until the fighting with the roofers, etc...is all over.    SSRI's are not a cure.  They do change your personality because they mute your response to stimulators.  For me, it was grand because my stimulators were going to lose a limb.  I do believe that SSRI's have their place, but drug companies have to quit lying about the side effects and withdrawal symptoms associated with these medications.  I did gain weight.  Big whoop.  Libido?  Frankly, hubby got it more while I was on the Paxil because I was more tolerant.  The other circumstances in my life were a little more important to me than my pant size going from an 8 to a 14, and 3 fairly young kids added to the stuff happening around me really didn't get me in the mood.  The withdrawal for me was horrendous going cold turkey.  I can not imagine what it is like for a child or teen to go through this as their brains and bodies are still growing, and hormones going rampant.  I couldn't drive because I didn't feel like I was in reality.  When your brain doesn't decipher between reality and dream-state, there is no limit to the possibilities of what can happen.  So no, I'm not anti-SSRI because it didn't work and I just want to blame Paxil for everything.  I am a medically educated woman married to a physician who has personally experienced these symptoms.  My father is a pharmacist.  The Paxil did work, but I will not encourage anyone to start on an SSRI because it is not a cure to the disease.  If you fully plan on taking it the rest of your life, don't mind gaining weight, don't mind your senses being dulled not only to the anxiety stimulators, but also the events that should give you joy...then this is the choice for you.  If you have hopes of stopping the medication at some point in your life, then be aware of the very possible withdrawal symptoms.  Make sure that your physician is aware of proper withdrawal via tapering dose.  Be certain that you include your family and friends in the knowledge that you are starting or withdrawing as there will be changes very evident to them.  They need and deserve to understand.  I have never used elicit drugs.  I am a social drinker, but twice a month at the most.  I am not a person to make excuses.  The decision is totally between you and your doctor.  Please do your research and discuss questions with your doctor that you find in your research.  Don't go in blindly because you will not like the sight when you come out.\n\n",

There are thousands if not more  people including myself who have had horrible nasty side effects and withdrawal symptoms.  AD's are over-prescribed and extremely dangerous.  What the drug companies and yourself claim that this drug does as far as side effects etc..is just the \"nicer\" more glorious things that happen.  Funny how the suicidal thoughts, increased anxiety, zaps, dizziness, flu-like symptoms, bowel troubles, headaches, vomiting, parathesia, numbness, tingling extremities, extreme depression, blurred vision etc etc. is never mentioned.  These things are never mentioned.  The thousands of people who are addicted to AD's and have to spends upwards of a year or two, sometimes even longer to get off these drugs.  Its not fun, and its very dangerous.  So unless you know first hand what these drugs do to a person, don't claim to know what its like.\n\n",

My mood had just totaly changed and everything was great. I stayed on the drug for about a year and then came off it very slowly. The main reason for coming off it was because i was experience a side effect of lack of sex drive. As a man its more \"noticable\" because certain things didnt happen when they should have...  Anyway after a few months of not taking it i started to feel depressed again so i started on a new drug which i later found out did nothing to help me. So i eventually got back onto Paxil and eventually (slower this time) my depression went away again.  Now i have been taking it for 7 years straight. Im a bit scared to stop taking it incase the depression returns but i think im going to try. A few things i have learned are these:  1) Stopping the drug or trying to \"come off it\" too fast gives TERRIBLE!!! withdrawl symptoms. Brain shivers, electric shocks in the head basically, and a really feverish feeling. Its one of the worst things ive ever experienced. So it has to be very gradual.  2) The side effects are awefull for some people. I rather be happy than depressed so i still take it but i have some terrible side effects. Heres a quick list:   1) Lack of sex drive. I don't feel like having sex as often as i should. I sometimes cant get an erection and when i do its not as strong as it used to be. Orgasms don't feel as good and sometimes don't feel of anything at all. Its a total sex killer for me... The worst side effect by far for me.  2) Sometimes i get muscle spazms where i kick my legs or punch my arm or something when i don't mean to. Its never really a problem and doesnt hurt or anything. And its very rare. And it only usually happens when im sleepy and sitting at my computer or something. But i do worry that i might be in bed with a girlfriend and do a big kick that scares her half to death or something.   3) I get a really dry mouth, and also it sometimes makes my smile feel crooked. A combination of the 2 means i sometimes smile and it looks wierd. Sometimes people look at me strangely when i smile like that but luckily its never happened when im with a friend.  4) Intence dreams are a bit more common. And i sleep ALOT.   Overall i would say its been a life saver. It stopped me from killing myself and feeling miserable and actually feeling ill from depression (tired and weak and nervous, and antisocial, and prone to crying). All those feelings have gone. But i still want to stop taking the drug this year because of the side effects. I just hope i have taken it long enough now for the depression to not come back. And i need to make sure i don't mistake any withdrawl for depression returning.  P.S. Advice or comments very welcome!\n\n",

I had very similar side- effects that you described. I came off it very slowly and did not experience any withdrawal side effects.  Felt very good!  It was about a month ago.... but now.......my problems are back.... Paxil abviously does not cure depression, it takes care of the symptoms, right?!   I am considering to go back on medication now; afterall, feeling good and not messing up my relationships with friends and family is more important than losing some sex drive.

    "content": "bizbizmarite,  If you hae made your decision to go back to Paxil, at least consider going back at a lower dosage to see if that will alleviate your symptoms.  You can always increase the dose after a week if you need to, but you will have to go through stronger withdrawal if you start out at the higher dose.  No, Paxil does not cure depression.  It masks it.  Somehow we all have to try to figure out how to deal with our depression, and it can seem impossible.  Going back on the Paxil will give you the relief you need to possibly get an idea of some coping strategies that may help when/if you decide to try to withdraw again.  These symptoms can sneak up on you at any time, a month after your last dose or even more.  They become less and less frequent if you can just weather them out.  You'll know when you're ready.  Best wishes for you!\n\n",

    "content": "I've been on Paxil for over 7 years now, and it was the best thing I ever did! My anxiety had gotten to the point where I would rarely leave my house, even to get the mail. I wouldnt even shower until my husband was home from work, for fear of falling and dieing in my own bathroom! How ridiculous of a thought is that? I did nothing but cry all day, and pace around the house. Once I started on Paxil it took about 2 weeks, and I was feeling much better. Not only did I leave the house, I even went out and got a job! Not just a job, but one driving a school bus even. (talk about stressful LOL)  Now mind you I didnt want to drive before either. Didnt really have any side effect from it to speak of. The occasional zap a few days before my period was about it. Well worth it in my opinion. Now suddenly am I am feeling axious again, and I think it may be because my insurance had made me start taking the generic form of Paxil. Seems this all happend about the same time frame. So you cant find the name anymore, due to some manufac. probs. I am switched to Paxil CR now, and still having some problems with anxiety. Maybe it needs time to build up in my system, maybe the dose isnt high enough, who knows? All I know is I would rather have side effects than go back to my pre-Paxil existence.\n\n",

    "content": "Switching to generic Paxil shouldn't have caused any change in your reaction.  Switching to Paxil CR could cause subtle symptoms for a few days.    Paroxetine, in any form, needs to be taken as close to the same time of day as possible.  The reason for this is that both forms (immediate-release or controlled-release) have the same half-life, or are at their fullest strength in the system, is approximately 21-hours after ingestion.    Immediate-release - Enters the blood stream within 30 minutes after taking and continues at the same strength through the blood stream for 20 to 21 hours.  Controlled-release - Enters the blood stream anywhere from 1 to 5 hours after taking, but only remains constant in strength between 15 to 20 hours.  Switching to the CR adds just a few extra hours, which could bring on what they are now terming \"discontinuation syndrome\", or the very beginning symptoms of withdrawal.  BUT this will clear up after a few days of continuing the CR.    If your bothersome symptoms continue after a few days, be sure to contact your physician.  The dosage conversion form IR to CR should be confirmed.  Also be sure to check that you were given the correct strength at the pharmacy.    Here's hoping things calm down for you soon!\n\n",

    "content": "I had been on Paxil for about 7 years when the generic was released.  Due to insurance reasons, I switched to generic.  After being on the generic for several months, my OCD gradually returned in full force, and I experienced all sorts of not-so-fun symptoms one would associate with paxil withdrawal.  My Dr. told me I have \"failed generic paxil\" (more like, it has failed me!), and has put me back on the name brand.  Only this time, instead of immediate release, I am taking controlled release pills.  Should I expect these to work as well as the original name-brand, immediate release drug?\n\n",

    "content": "Truly, the only difference between Paxil and Paxil CR is that it takes longer for the CR to be released into the system.  Their half-lives are almost identical, with the CR actually having a shorter half-life than the regular.  To explain:  Paxil - released full strength into body with 30 minutes to an hour after ingestion without a decrease in amount in the blood stream for 21 to 24 hours.  Paxil CR - Not released into blood stream for 2-6 hours after ingestion without a decrease for 18-21 hours.    The generic should not have failed you, but since it apparently has it may still be better for you to remain on the regular Paxil instead of the CR for the longer working time period and for the lower cost.  Restarting the brand name, give yourself a week or two before making any judgements as to your body's response this time around as it does take time to build up.    Take care of yourself, watch out for other side effects, and continue to get other therapy outside of the medication as Paxil is not a cure, but rather a cover-up.  Good luck!\n\n",

I took it for 8 years, and don't remember any kind of weight gain with it (that came when I had my son). I was bumped up to 60 mg at one time, but went back down to 40mg with the addition of Klonopin to my meds. During those 8 years, there would be times when I could not afford my medication, and I did not know of the gov't programs my state has. I would go a few days without taking the Paxil and got the withdrawl symptoms. I was scared out of my mind for years that I would be on it always, and would never be able to come off.   Last December, I decided I would try something else. The only side effect the Paxil gave me was loss of iibido, and my psych. reassured me that with while taking Lexapro, and tapering slowly, I could come off of it just fine. And I DID!! It was wonderful. I was finally free.  Then a few weeks ago, I started getting very anxious and irritable. I was crying all the time, not sleeping, not wanting to leave the house, I was a wreck. It took me a while to realize whta the problem was, but I finally figured it out - the Paxil really DID work well for me. Today I called my psych. and told him I want back on the Paxil. To hell with loss of libido - my husband and I are just fine and he wants the \"old me\" back. Besides, I didn't notice a change with the Lexapro.   So I say - go with what works for you. I'm going back to the Paxil - I said it in 1998 and I will say it again now, it has TRULY saved my life.   -KA\n\n",

Want to get out and after 2 days without get very uneasy, aggressive, impatient, etc.  Saw a Psyquiatrist, who decided to put me on Paxil and Effexor at the same time.(small dose on both) She says she can not preditc what will happen. Just have to try... I told her I had a car accident while on Paxil, but she did not think it was related.  Effexor have calmed me down but not really done too much for depression.  Was on Zoloft for a while,  and it did speed me too much. Was very anxious.My mind was very alert and clear. Did help with depression, but could not sleep.Was anxious and felt like I was someone else... not me.  Paxil, just made my day go easier. Can not remember. Was a while ago.  Not sure about this new doctor. Is this combination effective? Paxil and Effexor? Is it safe? I hear in your forum that paxil is also difficult to get off from. Any suggestions? What is a good way to get off effexor.  I hear there is a new medical specialty that deals more directly with these medications biochemestry and depression. Were should I go to get a really good expertise on these medications prescriptions.I have an HMO and restrictions about doctors I can visit. My insurance do not help too much about recommending any of their doctors. I am very concerned and do not know where to go. Can you recommend a physician in South Florida, Fort Lauderdale area? Are these dugs safe? I have other health issues.Please give me some direction and opinions. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi healthseeker,  It sounds from the way you wrote your post that you are taking medications for depression, but I sense that you are not receiving psychotherapy. I suggest that you also consider getting psychotherapy, and not rely solely on the medications. The combination of Paxil and Effexor is sometimes used, but to my knowledge there is not yet certain experimental proof that it works better than either one alone. However, it is not a wrong thing for a doctor to prescribe them together, it is within the standard of practice. My experience is that too many people expect too much from antidepressants, and don't have the opportunity to explore their patterns of thinking, feelings, stresses and past experiences that may be contributing to the depression.   Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

People with this disorder can experince blushing when anxious, and the SSRI medications may help with the blushing by lowering the anxiety level. So, if your blushing is associated with the significant condition that sounds like what I described, an SSRI might be helpful. Psychotherapy is helpful for this condition as well.

    "content": "I currently take effexor xr 75 once daily. I take this medicine for anxiety and panic disorder. I started having panic attacks last summer and really thought something was wrong with me and that I was going to die. I thought I was having a heart attack. After several tests to rule out heart probs, I was diagnosed with panic attacks and put on effexor xr 75. It does work well for me. I have been on it for about 8 months and only every now and then will I have a panic attack, but it is very mild, because I know that its only in my head. I do not have insurance at this time and thus cannot afford it anymore so I asked my doc to switch me to something that comes in a generic and is cheap that will treat panic disorder. He called me in celexa 20 mg. I don't think he knows alot about this drug because he had to call the pharmacist and ask what they recommended to self pay patients. Everything I have read online about it doesnt really say anything about it treating panic attacks, just depression, which I am not depressed, just overly stressed which causes my panic attacks. My question is, is this celexa a good choice of drug for the switch out of all the other ones that come in generic, before I start taking it or should I ask him for something else? Also, he told me for the weaning from effexor process, to just take one every other day for 2 weeks. Is there a better way? And when should I start the Celexa/ should I wait until I completely stop the effexor? Thanks to anyone who can help!!  Kristy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kristy,  Celexa at 20mg/d is a fine choice for an anti-panic medication. In general, one would start this right at the same time that you are tapering the Effexor, which will help to prevent panic attacks from recurring as well as helping to avoid a withdrawal syndrome while tapering Effexor. With the Effexor, people often have a severe withdrawal syndrome when they taper quickly. Cutting the dose to a tablet every other day right away may be too fast. I would probably taper your Effexor dose by one-fourth of the dose about every 3-4 days, working with your doctor to prevent a withdrawal syndome, possibly decreasing a little slower or quicker, depending on how you feel. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "depressants help OCD and Depression (not anti-depressants)?",
    "content": "Hi.  I have been trying to find depression & OCD meds for the past 2 years.  I see a psychiatrist for medication management every month.  I have tried Clomipramine, Lexapro, Effexor, Seroquel, Geodon, Wellbutrin, Zyprexa, Paxil, and Risperdal.  This without much to show for my efforts.  Before I went to a psychiatrist I used to self medicate with alcohol.  When I had an anxiety attack or close to one I would do a couple shots to relieve the anxiety.  Whenever I drank I was never depressed the next day either.  However, I quit drinking for religious reasons and then I started going to psychiatrists.     I have an appointment with him this coming Thursday, and I wanted to find out some information before I went to him.  My Dr has me write down how I feel after changing dosages so I can make a report to him accurately.   I have the prescription instructions to take 15 mg of Temazepam as needed for insomnia.  I have also been allowed to make the dose 30 mg if I just can\u2019t sleep.  I have been reviewing these and I noticed a pattern.  On the days that I have a decent to good day all occur after the days that I take 15 mg of Temazepam the night before.  After I noticed this I tried taking the 30 mg three times, and three times I had good days following taking 30 mg.  These were even better days than when I take the 15 mg.  I have been trying to research this as much as I can.    Something I tried was 150 mg of diphenhydramine hcl.  In the mornings after I did that I saw similar results to the benzodiazepines.  From my limited knowledge on this subject it seems to me that depressants seem to help treat my OCD and depression.   So my question has a couple of parts.  1.  I know benzodiazepines can be habit forming, but if they work would it be worth it to use them more frequently?  2.  I learned that benzodiazepines, barbituates, and alcohol react almost identical to one another.  Do they ever treat depression with barbituates?  Like with something like Buspar that doesn\u2019t have addiction potential?   3.  I have read that Tricyclic anti-depressants react similarly to benzos\u2018, barbits\u2019 and alcohol. Is this true?  4.  From what I told above, is there any medications that I can recommend that are either benzos\u2018, barbits\u2019, or act similarly to them?  Things are getting old so I thought I would ask  Thanks!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: depressants help OCD and Depression (not anti-depressants)?",
    "content": "Dear ddx50,  I am unclear about what conditions you are referring to when you describe having a \"good day\" after taking temezepam at night. Do you mean the OCD, depression, or at one moment you mentioned anxiety attacks. Here are a couple of thoughts and issues:  1. What are the maximum doses of each of the medications that you have tried? Be sure that you have taken the maximum, tolerated, clinically appropriate doses.   2. benzodiazepines such as temezepam taken for sleep are largely worn off the next day. Do you think that the temezepam gives you a good night's sleep, which then has a positive effect on your mood? If so, perhaps it is poor sleep that should be treated.  3. The benzodiazepine Klonopin is sometimes used for OCD, mainly as an addition to another medication, but sometimes alone. Klonopin is an excellent medication for anxiety disorders in general, though as you know it has some addictive potential which needs to be thought through and monitored. Some people with depression seem to have it as a result of a primary anxiety disorder, and treating the anxiety disorder helps with the depression.  4. Benzodiazepines, while physiologically are central nervous system \"depressants\", this means that they reduce the firing of brain cells (called neurons), rather than activating them. While it is well known that benzodiazepines are capable of causing the clinical condition of Depression (which is different than saying it is a brain depressant), this does not always or even usually happen; it's just possible and needs to be thought through.   All of this being said, since you have had your conditions treated with SSRIs, SNRIs and \"atypical neuroleptics\", it may be reasonable for you to be treated with a benzodiazepine if your doctor thinks it prudent, in light of some small risk of addiction and the possibility of its causing or worsening depression. It would not be unreasonable to take temezepam instead nightly for a trial period; perhaps doing what seems to be working is a good idea.   Please discuss this carefully with your psychiatrist. Also, you should know that cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy is just as effective, and perhaps better in its preventing relapses, for depression, anxiety disorders and OCD. Often people are treated with the psychotherapy along with medication.  Maybe it's time to give this a try if you haven't done so.  Best of luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

(Hereditary) I am 47 and had my first panic attack when I was only 3 years old...and I do remember it well! Anyway, Paxil was a lifesaver for me when I was first prescribed it in Feb., 2000. Before that, I had not seen a doctor for my anxiety since I was 21 yrs. old. At that time, I was diagnosed with severe anxiety and given sleeping pills and Vitamin C. Doctor said I had \"woman problems.\" After years of struggling through endless panic attacks, constant anxiety and horrible depression, I began to suffer from a new symptom - the throat closing, unable to swallow, lump in throat feeling. I finally went to a doctor again and was diagnosed with GAD and depression and prescribed Paxil. Suddenly I was feeling GREAT and living a life unlike I had known before! I actually experienced life for the first time. About a year ago, I began taking the generic version and noticed that my nervousness was increasing, especially during PMS. Over the last year things have gotten worse. The depression would set in about two weeks before I would start my period. About a week ago the panic returned. My period is due in about nine days now. My throat problem returned with a vengeance and the panic attacks and depression are almost as bad as they were before the Paxil. I've increased my paroxetine to 30 mg daily (which I do when PMS sets in) but I've found no relief. I don't want to go back to that horrible life of constant anxiety, panic and depression I suffered before. Is it possible that Paxil does stop working? What do I do now?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear terrbeary,  It looks from your posts that you've decreased your dose of Paxil quite a bit. Hopefully, this was done gradually, lest you create a \"discontinuation syndrome\" where you can feel quite poorly. If this has happened, you may need to increase the dose, and come down more slowly.  I would talk to your psychiatrist about the following possible options:  1. Adding cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy to the Paxil. This would give you some tools that you could be in charge of, empowering you to do something helpful when you are depressed or panicky.  Or, cognitive-behavioral therapy plus the following:   2. Add an atypical neuroleptic such as Seroquel to your Paxil, or in lieu of the Paxil, tapering this.  3. \"Augment\", or boost the Paxil with an agent such as clonazepam (can be habit forming, occasionally increases depression, reduces anxiety very well), lithium, or buspirone.   4. Substitute for the Paxil an alternate anti-panic, anti-depessant, either an alternate SSRI (serotonin boosting medication) such as citalopram, sertraline or fluoxitene,  or a medication that increases the levels of both serotonin and norepinephrine, such as Effexor, Cymbalta, or Remeron.   There are other alternatives. I would vote for you to engage in therapy now and to add an augmenting agent either now or in a month if you're not feeling better with the therapy. Bottom line is, talk to you psychiatrist, explore the options with their pros and cons. You should find some help, don't give up!  Good luck!  -E. Seigle MD\n\n",

(My father's side has many, many anxiety disorders and my mother's side suffers the depression. My maternal grandfather, 2 of his brothers and a nephew committed suicide.)  I have researched much on anxiety disorders over the years and have followed many relaxation techniques. My biggest concern now is that I was doing so well on the 20 mg of Paxil since 2000. Why would the panic return with such a vengeance? As of today, I am feeling much better symptom-wise, however, the thoughts that it will return again are extremely bothersome. Could this be hormone related? Considering I am nearly 48 years old could this be a menopause-related thing? I will be seeing a new doctor who specializes in anxiety disorders this coming week. Hopefully, we will find an answer. Again, I thank you for your reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi terrbeary,  We don't understand yet why anti-depressant, anti-anxiety agents such as Paxil stop working after a period of time. This occurs quite often. A higher dose may help. It sounds good that you will be seeing an expert in anxiety disorders. Certainly, hormonal deficits, such as thyroid deficiency, low estrogen levels associated with peri-menopause and menopause, vitamin deficiencies, and other medical conditions can be associated with depression. It's good to cover these bases, but most commonly, we find that patients just need an empirical change of the current medication dosage or the medication itself either within the same class or in a different class. Unfortunately, we often do not get the satisfaction of knowing why the Paxil at the old dose doesn't work anymore. Good luck!   -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Markmarkson,  It sounds like you are depressed, while your anxiety is much better. I would have some concern that the Klonopin might be contributing to or causing depression, as this class of medication can do. Are you still having suicidal impulses? If so, and you don't feel that you can resist them or have someone to call if they take over, you should go to a hospital emergency room. Barring that, you might want to tell your doctor (a psychiatrist?) about the suicidal thinking and that you might find it hard to wait an entire week. One possibility to discuss with your doctor is to gradually lower your dose of Klonopin, (do not stop it suddenly) to see if at a lower dose, you feel better. You may need a backup medication if your anxiety returns. If tapering the Klonopin doesn't help, then your doctor may either change the anti-depressant from Zoloft or add a medication to augment the Zoloft.   It's good that you are asking good questions, and don't hesitate to call your doctor with your concern. If your doctor is not a psychiatrist, then you should consider consulting one for these medication changes, as he may have more experience with your type of condition.   Good luck!       -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 19 year old male, and have really always struggled with gaining weight in general. I have an extensive history of playing soccer (14 years), so all the doctors I've asked link it to my \"fast\" metabolism. However I quit playing in the summer of 2006 as i was just starting to enter a state of depression, I decided to pick up smoking as well sadly. When I played soccer I would eat a lot due to physically exerting myself for at least a couple hours a day. However now that I don''t play anymore I just find myself not getting hungry at all (had a couple (3-4) glasses of water yesterday and nothing to eat). Could my lack of hunger be linked to being depressed? I have only been taking Cipralex 10mg for almost 4 weeks now. 2007-2008 I managed to lose 15lbs and am now down to 130lbs, being 6\"1 and that weight is unhealthy to say the least. So whether it is due to depression or not, is there any solution to gaining back weight? Whether its an over the counter or subscribed medication to increase hunger or a weight gainer in general (I have tried several weight gainers over the past and none seem to be able to add fat or muscle).  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Genetics play a big role in metabolism and body size but depression can definitely affect your appetite and therefore cause weight loss.  If I were you I would see a doctor about the possible need for an antidepressant.  Be sure the doctor is aware you don't need one that has the possible appetite suppressant effect.  After a few weeks you may notice a return of appetite but I would also add weight bearing exercises to increase muscle mass.  There are no quick fixes - no pills, potions or patches to help you gain weight but a good, healthy diet, rich in healthy omega 3 fats found in tuna, salmon, flax, and walnuts can help. Good sources of protein include lean meats, fish, poultry, nuts, seeds and legumes. Healthy carbohydrate sources include fruits, vegetables and whole grains.  You should get plenty of dairy products as well.    I will tell you this.  Smoking is not helping your situation.  It will actually decrease your appetite besides all the other damaging effects on your health.  Stop it now and do whatever is necessary to lick this unhealthy habit.  This may include counseling, getting help from a local Quit Line, or even using patches temporarily.  Do something about it before it becomes even more entrenched.    Good luck.\n\n",

I sleep some 10+ hours a night, it is hard to wake up. And throughout the day I feel lethargic.   I was wondering if there is anyway to counter that lethargic feeling, either through vitamins or some other med. I am concerned with this now rather then before, because I am now going to college and I wont have time to sleep 10+ hours.   I would try to get off the med to but I know it is helping with the Anxiety, which is the main issue, and without it I don't think I could control it as well.   I have read up on many vitamins, Vitamin-B complex, Magnesium, and many more, that are said to help in some ways. I am wary to take them though without knowing if they will help and if they will interact with Paxil in ways that are bad.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tempus35,  It is possible that you could use a lower dose of the Paxil and still get just as much benefit. It comes as a liquid, and using this, your doctor could very gingerly lower the dose by one mg at a time every 3 weeks or so, to see if the tiredness goes away at some point. Of course, there is a possibility that your symptoms could recur, but not necessarily. Some people use as little as 5 mg of Paxil or rarely, less. If you are not taking the Paxil at night, you should do this, or even take it in the evening, like at 7pm, as long as this doesn't sedate you too much when you need to be alert. This way, your blood levels will be slightly lower during the day.    If these strategies don't work, some suggestions your doctor might consider would be to switch to a less sedating anti-anxiety, anti-depressant agent (an SSRI or SNRI) such as Lexapro, fluoxitene, sertraline, Effexor, or Cymbalta for some examples. I am not familiar with any vitamins or natural compounds that would combat your fatigue, but this is not my forte.   Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle, MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, this can be a side effect, though in Wellbutrin (even the generic) it is usually not, at least when compared to other antidepressants.  But, you bring up an important question.  Many side effects are transcient, meaning, if you hang in there a few months your body adjusts and they are no longer a problem.  I would give it a little more time and if you decide to go off the drug, do it only with the advice of your physician because you do not want a rebound depression (or any of the other undesirable problems you were experiencing).  Those are concerns that affect your relationships and quality of life so you must weigh the risks and benefits.  It may be that you would respond better to one of the other medications.  Sexual side effects do vary considerably with the individual so, while low in this medication for MOST people, it could be a problem for SOME.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello elliot,  You didn't say why you were prescribed the Paxil and Xanax but since you're describing a lot of anxiety I am guessing that this is the reason the drugs were prescribed.  To answer your question, it is safe to take the Xanax and the Paxil at the same time, at the dosages prescribed by your doctor.  You may find the Paxil is very helpful for your anxiety, but it usually takes at least 2 weeks to be really effective.  Xanax is a benzodiazepine which is really effective at treating anxiety symptoms and works immediately, so it's not unusual to use a benzodiazepine with an SSRI during the first few weeks of treatment.  This should help to control the anxiety while you allow time for the Paxil to have maximum effect.  It is also quite safe to take acetaminophen (Tylenol) for your headache.  This should not cause any additional side effects or drug interactions.  I hope you are feeling better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you for your reply. I since stopped taking the Paxil. The side effects were way to intense for me. I am living in another country right now and only have a couple weeks until I go back to the United States, and I'd rather not spend the last days that i am here feeling so horribly. However I still have the Xanax for emergencies, and also to get me home. I have a huge fear of flying. Not that I will crash, just that I will have a panic attack while on the plane. Being in the plane for 5 hours not being able to get off when i want to scares me. But, I have to try the Xanax first, and I am afraid of the side effects. As you can see, I worry way to much, not to mention I'm a total hypochondriac so taking meds is very difficult. I was wondering what the best way to try these would be. I was prescribed 0.50 mg to use when necessary. I just took 1/4 of the pill.....so far its been about two hours since I took it, and I'm feeling ok. I guess thats a good sign. I looked up possible side effects and some of them are really scary, like nausea and vomiting (i have a phobia of vomiting and being nauseous brings on panic attacks) and diarrea doesnt sound good either. Just how common are those side effects and should I worry? How would you recommend I go about trying the Xanax? Im to afraid to just take a whole pill....  thanks for listening and for replying. I really appreciate it. elliott.\n\n",

    "title": "Does SSRI chronic use causes low testosterone levels",
    "content": "Dear Doc,  I am 36 year old male. I am taking SSRI/SNRI for last 8 years in mild dosages. It seems a mix of GAD and depression to me. But unfortuantely at same dosage one SSRI doesn't work for more than 10 months or so. Then the dose is increased or medicine is changed. I have taken so far Sertraline 50 to 100 per day, then venlafaxine 75 mg ( in between 150mg for 2-3 months), and then Escitalopram Ox. 10 to 15 mg. Presently I am back to Venlafaxine 75, but still my worries are not over.   I got some blood tests done, in which Total Testosterone came 180 ( normal range should be 250 onward), as well as TSH was also at lowest accepted range. For your kind information, almost all the times, I didn't have any interest in Sex, and I faced PM Ejaculation also some times.  I need to know:  1. Whether this Low testosterone level can be cause of my recurrant anxiety/Depression? Or it can be caused by chornic use of SSRI. 2. Whether this Low T needs to be treated? 3. Which alternate medicine I can take so that it doesn't affect the Testosterone levels adversely. 4. Any other hormone test or any blood test you suggest for ?  Regards, Kranti\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kran,  I am not aware of any research showing that SSRIs or SNRIs cause low testosterone levels, but I will check the literature. However, sexual dysfunction occurs in 50% or more of individuals who take these medications, usually in the form of low sex drive, trouble with erections, and trouble reaching orgasms. Premature ejaculation is not a side effect I am familiar with. You may want to consult your internist about your low testosterone level, and perhaps they will want to get the opinion  of an endocrinologist or a urologist. I am not sure what the significance of your testosterone level is. Your TSH being in the low-normal range is probably not significant, and while other hormonal abnormalities can cause depression, we don't usually check for them unless there are other symptoms of that hormonal problem. Please write in again in about a week and I will let you know what the literature search showed up.   Sincerely,  Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mason4477,  You are likely having a not uncommon adverse reaction to the increased dose of Zoloft. What you experienced yesterday sounds like potentially serious adverse reactions to the Zoloft, as well as common, less serious side effects to Zoloft and similar medications. It is encouaging that you are somewhat better today. An immediate reduction in your dose of Zoloft is likely appropriate, and I would discuss this right away with your prescribing physician. He or she may want you to take a day off from the Zoloft tomorrow and then restart it the next day at 75 mg per day, or simply reduce to 75 mg per day tomorrow. Again, talk to your physician tomorrow before taking any Zoloft. If stiffness, shivering, or fever comes back, it is a potential emergency (possibly representing an adverse reaction known as the serotonin syndrome) and you should call your doctor immediately or go to the emergency room. Good luck!  -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "title": "How Long to wait from Cymbalta to Lexapro",
    "content": "I have been taking Wellbutrin - the generic kind - off and on for a few years. It works pretty good, but if I take what is considered a therapeutic dose I have too much anxiety problems with it and need something for that also. So, I was taking a lesser dose and it has not seemed to be working too good for a while now. I went to my dr. and wanted to change. She gave me a month's worth of Lexapro to try, but I had heard a friend saying how good Cymbalta worked for her, so I asked about that.  She gave me the Lexapro, and we decided that if I could afford Cymbalta without insurance, we'd go that route. I found out the price, called back and she gave me a prescription to try Cymbalta for a month. I took Cymbalta for 3 days and was sleeping most of that time, and in a fog the rest of the time and decided it wasn't for me. I'll be talking to my dr. fairly soon, but would like to know how long I need to wait to start the Lexapro after taking the Cymbalta for those 3 days because I don't want to be off everything for very long. I have terrible times when I don't even get out of bed some days until I have to, and have been having depressing and upsetting thoughts about things,and just don't have interest in things I used to. There are days I just can't be around people because of the way I feel, and other days I feel up and perky. Sometimes I wonder if I have a mood disorder or something besides depression/anxiety. Anyway,  I want to begin Lexapro ASAP and see if it will help.  Also, I wanted to know if it is safe to take about 100 mg (the generic Wellbutrin - bupropion) along with the Lexapro if needed for the libido benefits, and if needed for energy. I don't know what kind of effect the Lexapro will have. Last question, is, is it okay to break the 10 mg. Lexapro tablets in half when I start them for about the first week until I see what the side effects are? Prozac made me very ill, and Zoloft made me get very agitated and angry at little things the last time I tried it, and also caused a problems with Restless Leg Syndrome. I am a little skittish about what kind of side effects may happen with Lexapro, but am needing to find something to help me feel more normal and happy. I'm so tired of feeling useless, sad, worthless and unhappy. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear hjgyet,  Let me preface this by saying that you should discuss this. and follow the advice of your psychiatrist; that being said, here are some considerations:  1. You can start the Lexapro right away, trying it at night initially in case it cause you to feel sleepy, and it is a good idea to take one-half of a 10mg tab. for a day or two and then increase to a full tablet. This will help to screen for side effects that you've had on other SSRI's.   2. I haven't seen a great beneficial effect of Wellbutrin on libido though it is used for that sometimes; it could help your depression, but worsen anxiety. We usually don't add Wellbutrin to Lexapro unless the Lexapro has been at a full dose for an adequate period of time, without enough benefit. I wouldn't use the Wellbutrin before talking to your psychiatrist.   Please speak to your doctor before making any changes. Also, are you receiving psychotherapy? This is often important and often not used in the treatment of depression. Good luck!  -Dr. Seigle\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the prompt reply. I have seen my dr. since posting and have started the Lexapro yesterday at half dose for a few days. I told her how the Zoloft caused me to get angry and agitated, and I think I told her about the up and down moods. She didn't say much about it. She is not a psychiatrist, but a PA. I really think there is a little more than depression/anxiety going on because of how hyper I feel sometimes, and then the times I don't want to even get up or be around anyone. Basically I can't be around anyone because of my mood - it's a little more than just not wanting to.  This has been most of my life and I'm used to it being like this, but would really like to be more normal and stable in my moods like other people I know are. My mother is similar. If I volunteer for something when I'm up, by the time the event gets here I never know if I'm going to be able to go through with it, or be in one of the down moods, so I seldom am what one would consider a \"joiner\" type person. I'll see what Lexapro does. Maybe I should consider a p-doctor instead of a PA or MD.  Thank you again\n\n",

    "content": "I have a question about the use of the drug Adderall.  I know it's normally prescribed in the treatment of ADD but I was prescribed it for a 3 month period to treat my depression.  It actually worked wonders for me but I found myself needing more and more of it to maintain it's effectiveness.    It gave me incredible energy, I was exercising every day, I felt a general sense of overall well-being, I was hopeful, optimistic, pleasant, upbeat, focused and motivated.  However, I didn't like how dependent I was becomming on the drug - but then again, don't people become dependent on regularly prescribed anti-depressants (SSRIs) as well?  A friend of mine said that adderall was like 'putting a band-aid on the problem and not actually helping to resolve the matter.'  I just don't understand why adderall isn't used more often in treating depression?  Or use an anti-depressant for the long-term and use adderall at the initial onset of depression and gradually taper off it?  What is it that makes this drug more dangerous than other more traditionally used anti-depressant drugs?  I'm curious for a psychiatrists take on this. Thanks, Taryn\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Adderall for Treatment of Depression?",
    "content": "Dear tce,  You ask some good questions about Adderall (and similar \"stimlant\" medications)and its use in depression. It is generally not used for depression alone for the very reasons that you observed: people rapidly develop tolerance (need increasing amounts for the same positive effect) to it, and because it cause a clear sense of increased well-being (one might even say \"high\"), people are prone to want to take increasing amounts on which they will clearly get \"highs\", which are then followed by lows or \"crashes\", a little like cocaine. In other words, there is a high addictive potential. Rather than reversing depression, one experiences (as you seem to have) more of a \"high\". Due to the development of tolerance, a doctor can't prescribe a modest, steady amount with a lasting, positive effect. People will often want, or even crave, increasing amounts.  There are also other abuse risks, including people using it for weight loss (\"diet pills\").  You came up with an idea that is actually used however. Sometimes, early in the course of treatment of a severe depression in which there is a lot of fatigue and apathy, a psychiatrist will temporarily prescribe some Adderall for a few weeks while waiting for the primary anti-depressant to begin to work, and then withdraw the Addrall. In addition, its use at a low dose is sometimes maintained as an adjunct (or \"helper drug\") to the primary anti-depressant with patients who do not make an adequate recovery with the primary medication. There is also a role for treating depression with apathy and low energy with cautious amounts of Adderall (or similar \"stimulants\") in the elderly population.   So, good questions, Adderall is  a potent medication which can be quite helpful clinically but can be very addictive and prone to abuse. For it to be used by itself in treating depression is quite unusual.   -Dr. Seigle\n\n",

    "content": "hi tce797,  Firstly, a clarification: Adderall and other stimulants can cause better concentration and decreased motor activity in people without ADHD or ADD as well as those with the condition. This is widely misunderstood. Likewise, in some people either with or without the condition, people will sometimes respond even at therapeutic doses by getting more agitated. This is increasingly likely when the medication is being abused- ie, taken in excessive amounts. The stimulants work for people with ADHD/ADD by increasing dopamine and norepinephrine functioning in areas of the frontal lobes, which are the brain areas responsible for regulating attention, concentration and impulse control- those functions which are impaired in ADHD. So, by improving attention and the ability to ignore stimuli and impulses which are not desired, people become calmer and more focused- hence a stimulant that calms. As to why it becomes agitating at time and at higher doses, that likely relates to the stimulants affecting brain regions other than those inolved in ADHD- I am not sure which brain regions, specifically, cause the agitating effects.  -Dr. Seigle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 47 Y/O male that was diagnosed with depression and DID (multiple Personality Disorder) 2 years ago.  I have been going to Therapy and the Psychiatrist for medication religiously and I don't hold anything back when I talk to my Therapist or Pdoc.  The thing is I am losing my Therapist he has to move on and he is used to my Suicidal thoughts.  If I get another Therapist I am going to have to go through all the safe routine.  I was a Crisis counselor so I understand why they have to worry when someone has a plan, but if I can't express what is going on in my head without the fear of being thrown into the psyc ward everytime how am I going to get any better?  I need someone to find out the source of my suicidal thoughts.  My alters are all settled and try to help me from seeing the bad things.  Right now I have a choice of discontinuing therapy, waiting for a new therapist or trying to seek a new one on my own.  I am not sure I can go through all that again so he or she will understand what went on in my past.  I can't see them reading my 94 pages of notes that we wrote to our therapist.  I want the suicidal thoughts to stop; I can live as a multiple that is not a problem.  The visions of me doing myself in, that is the problem.  If you have any thoughts or suggestions I would welcome them. Tattoo Man\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tatoo Man,  It must be very difficult for you to have to lose your therapist and start with a new one; you have disclosed a lot and it's hard to start over. I think that a key to your dilemma is to talk to your current therapist about how to make the transition to the new therapist as easy as possible. I don't think you should end your therapy without having a new therapist in place. Often, therapists such as yours would be willing to help find you a therapist experienced in treating DID and to help you make the transition. This could happen by them talking together about you, or I have been involved with meeting with therapists and their patients together so as to be introduced. In this way, you could meet the new therapist with the safety of your old one there. In addition, you and your therapist could discuss your concerns about your ability to discuss your suicidal thoughts freely without automatically being hospitalized- you'd need to have a way to indicate when such thoughts need to be responded to with hospitalization, and which just need good, supportive listening. Finally, your therapist would customarily provide your new therapist with a treatment summary to help to distill those 94 pages into a few, and thus to condense it and allow your new therapist to get the \"gist\" of your condition and its treatment. You might even respectfully ask to see a copy of the summary or even to consider helping to construct it- (this is a bit unusual, but might help involve you in your own treatment and allow you to highlight what you think is most important for you to have your new therapist know). In fact, you can write him your own summary in tandem with what your therapist does.  To summarize, speak up, discuss your worries and concerns with your therapist, and plan ahead for what will be difficult about this transition, and make a plan for what you will do to take care of the different hard possibilities.   Good luck. Remember, I don't know you, and this is not a psychiatric assessment nor recommendations,  so follow the advice of your providers who do know you in preference to mine.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Seigle, Thank you for your suggestions, I only have one appt left with Dave and then he is gone so that won't be possible for us to meet with him and a new therapist.  We have figured out the source of the suicidal thoughts and hopefully we will be able to figure out what to do.  You see we have inappropriate thoughts about men to the point that it interfears with our sex life with my wife.  I am unable to respond to her.  It took us a long time to put it together.  I know that being bisexual is not considered a psychological issue but it is very distrurbing for me.  The reason my name chosed is tattoo man is because that is how I have hurt myself in the past. My wife made me promise not to do that anymore so I don't.  She made me promise not to pierce anything else also and that was a relief when things got bad.  I do not like myself because of the things that were done to me and the things I did as a child.  It makes me look at men in a bad way.    I will discuss finding a new therapist with my wife though.  She doesn't know how frequent the thoughts run through my head.  She just wants me to be normal again whatever that is.  Yesterday I went to buy a gun but I fought the urge.  I know it is a permanent solution to a temporary problem but I do get so sick of living like this.   Thanks again Tattoo man\n\n",

    "content": "Im 19 years old and I'v had severe ocd and anxiety since I was little kid. I was also diagnosed with depression about 4 years ago. I'v been prescribed about every anti-depressant on the market, as well as a couple different bi-polar meds, all of which did absolutely nothing for me, except have negative side effects. I was also prescribed Klonopin for the anxiety, but I literally felt zero relief from taking 1mg, and higher doses didn't help either. They just made me forgetful and tired, but I still had racing thoughts in my mind and anxiety. I have smoked weed for a couple years now, and that was always the only thing that helped, but it didn't cure it. After all the frustration of getting no relief from the many different meds I had tried, I eventually got into Oxycontin, which literally made me feel normal. My friends that would do Oxycontin with me would always say how they felt \"****** up\", but I didn't really feel that way at all, I just felt more motivated, more confident in myself, had no feelings of depression, and no anxiety. I felt like it was my miracle pill. Unfortunately, I had trouble controlling myself with the Oxycontin, and after a month I was taking about 120mg a day. I stopped cold turkey and had to go to the hospital because I got so sick. They gave me Clonodine which helps a little because it just chills me out. Many weeks after being clean of the Oxys, and I was back to being depressed and all that **** that I hadn't felt while on Oxycontin. After much discussion with my doctor and my father, I'm now taking Tramadol 100mg 4 times a day for the mental issues as well as sever stomach pain and restless leg syndrome. I feel much more motivated and happy, not high at all, just normal. I don't have any desire to do Oxycontin any more, nor do I have the desire to take extra Tramadol because it works fine taking it as prescribed. I have been taking Tramadol for about a month now, and so far have had no signs of a tolerance issue, which is my doctors main concern since I am already taking the max dose for Tramadol. Now I'm prescribed Tramadol, Clonidine, Mirtazapine, and Lorazepam. I doing very good and have no depression and much less anxiety. (Turns out Lorazepam actually is more effective on me than Klonopin, weird). But has anyone one else had a similar experience?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nip1433,  It sounds like you've struggled with negative mood and anxiety for a long time and have tried many medications. Unfortunately, tramadol is not generally considered to be effective as an anti-depressant or anti-anxiety agent, and while it is seen by some as less likely to lead to addiction when treating pain than opioids such as Oxycontin, others feel that it has addictive potential that is considerable. I would see long-term use of this as risky for you in terms ofn potentially leading to addiction. You did not mention having had psychotherapy in your note; have you received cognitive-behavioral psychotherapy for depression and anxiety? It can be as effective than medication and you can learn the tools to feel better for use on your own when you need them.    This being said, it sounds like your case is complex, and you might want to have a psychiatrist with a subspecialty in addiction psychiatry working with you. Some subspecialists may be using tramadol with their patients- I do not know.  Undoubtedly you can be helped to feel better with a combination of some appropriate medication and psychotherapy, but watch out for tramadol and Oxycontin or other drugs known as opoids or any other drugs of abuse.  Ultimately, remember that this feedback should not replace the advice of your physicians, and should not be the basis for your medical decision making- your work with your physicians and therapists should guide you in this.   Good luck!     -Dr. Seigle\n\n",

Keep in mind side effects often disappear after a few weeks or months on the medication, once your body adjusts.    If the Effexor seems to not be doing the trick any more, it is probably unrelated to the Metformin but people sometimes need to have their antidepressant medications adjusted or changed after taking one for a while so this should be evaluated with the prescribing physician.  Good luck.\n\n",

Some people seem to experience withdrawal from the SSRIs more readily and more severely than do others, and no one has figured it why this is.  There is also the possibility that what you are experiencing is not really withdrawal but actually symptoms of your anxiety.  Klonopin is a sedative and anxiolytic medication (promotes sleep and helps anxiety), but Wellbutrin tends to work the other way in most folks.  It is not indicated for the treatment of anxiety.  Maybe a second opinion frrom another doctor is in order...\n\n",

Of course, keep in mind that Lexapro hasn't been around for a very long time, so things could show up after many years of use.  On the other hand, the other SSRIs, fluoxetine (Prozac), in particular, has been around long-term and there have been no reports of bad reactions occurring simply due to its use for several years.  Lexapro is very similar, and likely will prove to be safe in the long-term as well.  The manufacturer of Lexapro has not recommended any laboratory data be collected on a regular basis.  You should have a physical exam with some lab work done regularly, though, at your primary care physician's recommendations.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female who has been suffering with major depression on and off for 7 years.  This year in April I was taking 300mg of effexor but still felt low, so my psychiatrist added 15mg of mirtazapine (Zispen), I took these for approx 4 weeks, something stressful happend and I went into a manic phase without delusions which lasted approx 4 weeks,  this only ended when the antipsychotic drug Risperidone was added.  My psychiatrist believes the mania was just a side affect of the mirtazapine?!?  In Aug i stopped taking Risperidone and the Mirtazapine and reamained on Effexor but only 150mg, by sept was quite distraught so my effexor was increased to 225mg daily and lithium at 400mg was added, still felt awful for 4 weeks the lithium blood were taken and were not at therapeutic dose then i went through a hypomanic phase which lasted 2 weeks, felt that i could conquer the world!!! This last two weeks has been like a living hell again so don't know where I am, explained my symptoms to psychiatrist, she said I went hypomanic because of the increase in Effexor, eventhough I was only on 225mg and had previously been on 3oomg without a manic episode.  She had taken the lithium off me because its not at therapeutic dose and wants to decrease my effexor?????  Do you think that the manic episodes are as a result of the meds or do I need to look into diagnosing Bipolar Disorder.  Very confused and left in a terrible depressed state!!!\n\n",

    "content": "HI Deedeanjackharri,  I would certainly be suspicious of an underlying diagnosis of Bipolar disorder.  It is becoming increasing more known that people who are initially thought to have a depression disorder may actually be bipolar that have not yet had a manic episode.  The use of antidepressants in these people commonly will bring out a manic episode.  I would recommend you discuss this possibility further with your doctor.  Rather than decreasing the lithium you may actually need to increase it into the therapeutic range to get better control of bipolar disorder.  Keep in mind that I have not been able to fully examine you so please don't take my statements as absolute.  Only a direct evaluation would be able to properly diagnose bipolar disorder.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I tried taking Celexa (10mg) a few weeks ago and it did more bad than good. Just after 4 days of taking it i got panic attacks, I had a rapid heart beat and i felt very detached and confused. I had an awful time sleeping at night and then I couldn't stay awake during the day. It got to the point where i took a trip to the emergency room because i felt so messed up from it. My psychiatrist just put me on Zoloft (25mg) but I'm scared about taking it. I tried to explain to him what the celexa did to me but he didn't seem that concerned. Could the problem i had with the celexa been just a bad reaction or was it some kind of serotonin syndrome?  Do you think I should go ahead and try the Zoloft? Are they all pretty much the same or would one brand do that and the other wouldn't?   I'm just looking for some advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I certainly understand your concern but it is very likely you could do well on Zoloft in spite of the problems with Celexa.  It is very interesting how individuals respond entirely differently to medications.  Often you just have to try one to see how it goes, then change until you find the right medication for you with the least amount of side effects.  I suspect this is just your body's reaction but Seratonin Syndrome is a possibility.  Since that problem resolves on its own typically, you may never know if that was the case.    Your doctor has prescribed the recommended low starting dose of Zoloft so I would not expect a problem and would recommend you try it.  Choose a time when you have help if needed should you have an adverse reaction.    Good luck on this journey.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are a number of things to consider here.  Since you said she did not have a high sex drive before, this might suggest that it is unrelated to the medication.  Keep in mind that depression and/or anxiety can kill a sex drive too so not treating such disorders can make it worse.    Also, a woman's sex drive is typically different than that of a man and should be considered.  You could probably benefit from some sex therapy from a reputable therapist but you should have reasonable expectations and not hope for her to be just like you.  I would also recommend a book, His Needs; Her Needs that focuses on the differences, by Dr. Willard Harley.    He is an experienced marriage counselor and heads Marriage Builders - a program for successful marriage advice.  Also, Wellbutrin as well as Lexapro are antidepressants with few reported sexual side effects and Wellbutrin is sometimes added to a treatment regimen to actually improve the sex drive, so discontinuation of this drug could also bring more problems.  Each person is different in how they respond to medications but this is information that as a whole has been found to be the case.    Women can often come to enjoy the sexual encounters once they are happening even if they were not feeling a strong drive ahead of time.  This can result in a very satisfying sex life if the expectation is not unrealistic.  If you both concentrate on ways to please each other, show kindnesses before getting into bed and find ways to be romantic that will make her want to be with you, there will probably be a place where you can find mutual satisfaction.  Don't gauge your love life by what you see on the screen, in pictures, port, or romance novels - these are not real.  Accept the couple you are and you can be happy.  If you want her to be someone she is not, I doubt you will find this happiness.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm 32 and have been on effexor for about 5 years. I was having boughts with depression and was taking celexa, but i did not feel like it was doing anything for me.  So my gyn suggested Effexor.  Years later and hearing about the side effects of Effexor I decided to ask my gyn if I can ween off my medication.  I have done alot of research on side effects of effexor and spoke with my gyn(he was the one who put me on it). He told me that it will be an extremly hard process to get me off of effexor.  I was taking 75mg per day and over the past 4 weeks have now gotten down to 37.5 mg every third day.  This is where my battle is beginning.  The physical side effects I can deal with ( dizziness, nausuea, headaches, and so on) what is now throwing me for a loop are my mood swings.  I am happy and doing great for a couple of day and then my agitation and no patience starts to show.  I'm in a business where i deal with clients in a salon, so i need to be empathtic and understanding.  Well, when my aggravation starts to come up, i try to back off and control it (since i know its not normal) BUT then I start crying for no reason.  I feel like a basket case!  Its like I'm on this wave and it won't stop.  I understand that is the withdrawal of getting the medicine out of my system, but I feel bad for the people around me in my daily life.  Do I need to ask my gyn about reffering me to someone that I can talk to?  Do i just deal with it? I hate feeling this way.  This is not me.  Should I just go back on it?  I have never felt so out of control.  Could you please suggest my next steps?  Thank you very much for what help you might suggest!\n\n",

    "title": "No results with Effexor - what next?",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 29-year-old man with major depressive disorder.  My first episode occurred when I was 22, then one more at 25, then a third one at 27.  In all three cases, I was prescribed Paxil CR (12.5 mg daily), felt some improvement in a couple of weeks, and achieved full recovery in about a month.  I was so thankful that there was a medication that seemed to help quickly.  Between the episodes I was a very happy, outgoing, and relatively productive individual.  My fourth episode started three months ago.  In the beginning it felt just like the previous episodes, so I increased the dose of Paxil (I had been taking 12.5 mg every other day for a few months) to 12.5 daily, then 25 daily.  After about a month of that, there was no relief.  At that point a psychiatrist told me to switch from Paxil to Effexor.  The process of cross-tapering from one to another was slow and painful.  I got up to 150 mg of Effexor daily, but felt very little or no improvement after a month of that.  The doctor told me to go up to 300 mg.  I've been taking that dose for two weeks, again, with no results.  My family feels that I look and sound better (less agitated, less obssesive), but I don't feel any better at all.    What is the next logical step?  What are the odds of some other medication being effective?  Given the fact that I have a history of rapid recovery with Paxil, should Paxil or another SSRI be given another chance?  What would be the strategy?  My previous experience gave me the notion that I can cope with my illness.  Turns out that dealing with depression for three months is very different than dealing with it for three weeks.  My professional life has been affected in a rather devastating way (I am scientific researcher and my work requires a lot of energy, creativity and concentration).  I fall asleep every night hoping to never wake up again.  The thought of this continuing for three more months or for a year or years, is quite terrifying.  I would appreciate any advice.  dreamr  P.S. No history of mental illness in my family, but I strongly suspect that I have had ADHD since childhood, and was until recently dependent on cannabis.\n\n",

Many people do well when a lower dose SSRI is also initiated such as Paxil or Cymbalta.  unfortunatly there is no one medication for everybody.  One of the most difficult parts of depression is trying medications and tapering dosages when we find they do not work.    I encourage you to continue seeing your psychiatrist and discussing the possibly adding a new medication and seeing if this works.  Hang in there and good luck.

    "title": "So confused after taking Wellbutrine, Lexapro and Xanax",
    "content": "Whew, this is gonna be a long one, but I need to tell this whole story to SOMEONE who will listen.  I am a 21 year old female, no past medical problems/surgeries/family history of anything terrible/medications.  I am not overweight and until recently was in generally good health.  It all started about two months ago with some aching lower back pain (wrapping around groin, down to buttock and thigh) that landing me in my campus health clinic.  I was four weeks into my (successful!) attempt to quit smoking at the time.  The backache was determined to be a pulled muscle (everyone and their grandmother said they could clearly feel it).  I was prescribed Wellbutrine to aid in my smoking cessation.  Took the WB for two days and HATED the way it made me feel: slow, stoned, confused, dizzy, etc.  Discontinued use and on my third day WB free, while at work, I had the most terrible dizzy spell, which frightened me because I'd never really been dizzy for no reason before.  I considered it may be Nicotine withdrawal as this was my first full day without a Nicoderm patch.  Still felt dizzy the next day and went BACK to Campus Health, where they told me that despite my suspicions I could NOT be feeling any residual effects of the Wellbutrine because it COULDN'T still be in my system.  They handed me Lexapro and Xanax for anxiety and sent me on my way.  In the four or five days I was taking the Lexapro and Xanax and was in the emergency room TWICE for headache, dizziness, brain zaps, confusion, panic.  I cannot accurately describe how drugged up and frightened I felt.  I KNEW it was the medication, especially since I'd never been one to even take an aspirin I didn't REALLY need.  I abruptly discontinued use at the advice of my mother, and spent the next two weeks panicked, nervous, paranoid, and experiencing the worst nightmares and sleep problems imaginable.  Went BACK to the doctor where I was told that STILL, this was NOT the meds and that I really needed the Xanax, which I started taking in TINY amounts to ward off these intense lightheaded/trembly moments I was getting.  It seemed to work for that purpose, but not wanting to take any meds I abruptly stopped again after a week.  So here I am a few days free of all medications, obsessing over my health like I never have before to the point that it is ruining my life.  The back still hurts, I can't stop poking at the few little lymph nodes in my neck wondering if I have lymphoma, I have a splitting headache that includes my ear/jaw/pain during eye movement.  My face feels numb from time to time, I'm getting little electric shock sensations/pin-pricks/burning sensations intermittently all over my entire body (paresthesias I think they're called?), and it seems like one muscle or another is constantly twitching (including the ones in my face).  I know most of these are anxiety symptoms, but I can't quit thinking about cancer, MS, or worse.  It truely is destroying my life.  I can't concentrate, don't't know if I should go BACK to the doctor JUST to be told I'm fine, and all of my loved ones think I'm doing it to myself.  I'm at a dead end.  I know these are all anxiety symptoms, but should I leave this alone?  Everyone who loves me seems to think so. I have no fever, normal CBC, EKG, brain CT, neg. for all STDS.  I can't help but think about how I never would have THOUGHT to neglect my demanding college homework in favor of typing this freaking novel before swallowing those damn pills.  I'm a different person.  What happened to me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jitterpixie,  I apologize for the long delay in responding to your question.  This is not really my area of expertise but I think I can give you some helpful information.  While you are probably correct that many of your symptoms may be linked to anxiety, there are some people that simply do not react well to medications.  The \"drugged\" feeling you are experiencing may very well be a reaction to the medicines.  I would recommend that you consider seeing a primary care doctor in an office that can see you with some continuity.  Campus health is an excellent resource but sometimes these clinics are staffed by varying doctors so you may not see the same clinician.  Seeing the same doctor consistently is very helpful because the doctor can follow your symptoms over time.  This may also give you a chance to have a fresh perspective about your entire situation.    Let your doctor know (whether it be at campus health or another office) about your symptoms and tell them you are very concerned it is a reaction to the medications.  If you are needing medications for anxiety or other mental difficulties you may want to consider seeing a psychiatrist.  Psychiatrists have expertise in these medications and can recommend an appropriate medicine that will help treat your symptoms and hopefully not give you the severe side effects.  Best wishes.  Keep following up with your doctor.  Persistence is key in situations such as yours.\n\n",

I started experiencing increased sexual desire (which is good), but severe premature ejaculation. I can't even get to intercourse sometimes. Of course this started effecting our sex life with my wife and I feel stressed. Another thing that I have noticed is that I am having uncontrolled ejaculation during defecation. Are these normal side effects of reducing Zoloft dosage? Do I need to see a doctor for ejaculation during defecation?\n\n",

I've only been on this medicine for 4 days and after reading about the horrible withdrawl effects and with alcohol usage, I want off.   The soonest I'll be able to talk to my doctor about this is tomorrow, but I don't want to take a single dose more if I don't have to.   I'm only on 37.5mg. and as I mentioned above, have only taken 4 doses. Do I risk experiencing the withdrawl symptoms if I quit cold turkey now?   Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "hi, Julez4you.  Thanks for writing, unfortunately some medications have side effects when you stop taking them.  Effexor XR has been known to be one of these.  Since you have been taking Effexor for a short period of time and at a low dose, the chance for you to experience withdrawl is low.  Effexor usually takes 7-10 days before this medication is effective in controlling symptoms of depression and GAD.  Since you have been diagnosed with GAD and mild depression please discuss with your MD further options to assist in controlling these symptoms.  Good Luck and thanks for writing in. Sandy RN\n\n",

    "content": "Greetings!  I am a 27 y/o Male.  I currently suffer from headaches that form from stress, and when most severe, will numb the side of my face.  In addition to that, I notice anxiety issues, and light depression.  My doctor has me on 1mg Xanax as needed for the headaches as most of the other headache prescriptions failed.  I feel as though I should be on an antidepressant and want to discuss this with my doctor, but would like some opinions on what will work/not work with my Xanax.  Please keep in mind that I am overweight, so anything that may increase weight is probably not a good idea.  I appreciate any advice/tips I can get.  Thank you.\n\n",

Also, many of the SSRIs have actually helped people lose weight because of the effect on the seratonin.  Just express this concern to your doctor that you do not want a drug that has been shown to increase the appetite.  While each individual responds differently to medications, he/she could at least steer you to one that has a low reported incidence of this side effect.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 23 year-old female and I went to my doctor for depression about a year and half ago.  I had been on anti-depressants before and I decided to go back on them.  So, he first prescribed Wellbutrin XL, but I have a bladder disorder, Interstitial Cystitis, and it gave me a lot of bladder pain.  I don\u2019t even know if it helped emotionally because I was in so much pain.  So I came back and he prescribed the generic Prozac.  I took it for about 6 months, but it made me so sleepy that I went off of it.  I just didn\u2019t have any energy or motivation.  So I stayed off of it for about 3 months, but I just got really depressed again.  So, I went back on it and now I\u2019m exhausted again. I\u2019m not sure what to do.  I\u2019m scared to try any other anti-depressants because the bladder pain is so awful.  I don\u2019t know if there\u2019s something else I can try, or something I can do or take to supplement the Prozac.  I\u2019m just really stuck.  I can\u2019t go on feeling the way I do right now on the Prozac, but I get very down without it.  Any advice?  Current medication:  Fluexotine\n\n",

It becomes something of a trial and error.  Many people find the side effects decrease after a couple months on the medication.  Sometimes multiple meds are indicated, either for the depression so that different neurotransmitters are effected, or to counter side effects.

    "content": "The need for antidepressants such as Zoloft is related to chemical imbalance in the brain so try as you might, you may not be able to change the way you feel.  Unfortunately, this is something you can only get with a prescription from a doctor or advanced practice nurse.  Once you are stabilized you may be able to get some refills approved so you won't need to return too often.  Try contacting a community mental health service of some type.  You may be able to locate a provider who uses a sliding fee scale or something similar.  Check with your public health department for referrals or NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness).  They have a website and some places have local support groups who might be able to help you access services.  You can also read a book I recommend called, When Your Body Gets the Blues by Marie-Annette Brown and Jo Robinson .  It gives some non-prescription suggestions to help with mood disorders.

    "content": "Hi, ive posted on another thread before. Ive suddenly stopped taking Effexor 150mg, ive gone cold turkey, had midl withdrawel symptoms of numbness and feeling slightly fainty.  I went out socialising on Friday and did consume 2 bottles of alcohopops.  I cant really rememberd what happend but apparently i had a seizure, i can only remember waking up not knowing where i was, why i had an 02 mask on and lots of people around me.  Apparently the paramedics  assumed that i had taken something and thats why i had fitted.  i had ECG which was abnormal and had tachycardia, apperntly all of these symptoms confirm that i had taken something.  Once my ECG was normal i was allowed home.  al i wanted to do was sleep.  i cant really remember much but i no i slept through the whole night and most of the next day.  i no i didnt take any drug and that my drink wasnt spiked as it didnt leave my sight.  could this seizure be due to me suddenly going cold turkey on Effexor??  i was treated like a time waster and was given a lecture about illegal drugs.  Paramedics were not informed about me stop taking Effexor as my friends didnt know i took them. Maybe if they did relay that info to the paramedics i might have an idea why i did have a seizure??  pls Dr E, any advice again would help alot thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Helen,    I am by no means a dr, so I'll leave most of the answering to the medical professionals.  But I've read your posts before, and I'm kind of going through issues of anti-depressant withdrawal myself, so I could somewhat relate to what you wrote. (Also, professionally, I am a social worker in a mental health setting although I want to reiterate that I have no formal expertise in pharmacological stuff-- just want I have learned from my clients and from my own personal experience/research.)     I do know that \"neurological\" symptoms can be a side effect of withdrawal from SSRIs. (I think Effexor is technically an SSNRI, but the issue is the serotonin here.) A really common withdrawal symptom is what people refer to as \"brain zaps\" (It's hard for me to describe-- I'd suggest doing your own research on it.) For me, I only gradually lowered my dose (over the period of a month) of zoloft from 150 to 50mg, not stopped abruptly (although some people would believe that is fast, but I was seeing someone who had put me up on a high dose rather quickly and started seeing a different Dr in the same office), and it is under the supervision of my Dr. Even with being fairly cautious with this and following medical advice, I have experienced some adverse reactions-- specifically, really intense but short-lived headaches, accompanied with some dizziness. I couldn't imagine what it would be like to stop cold turkey!     At the risk of sounding overly worried, what you are doing sounds really unsafe. Again, I say this partially as a person on anti-depressants who can relate, partially as someone who has some professional experience with people who have stopped taking medications abruptly. I would say that I imagine the seizure was at least partially caused by stopping the effexor (probably exacerbated by the alcohol)-- but I'd also be worried about the effect on your mental/emotional state. Even if the med was not helping \"that much\" with depression, anxiety, or whatever it was prescribed for, stopping abruptly can throw your body/mind into such disequilibrium that it can make you feel like you are \"going crazy\"-- NOT GOOD if you are already feeling lousy from physical withdawal symptoms (not to mention a return of whatever symptoms it was managing). I know it can be incredibly uncomfortable to take psychiatric medications-- not only do the side effects suck, but also just the idea that we \"need\" to take something can be disheartening. However, even if you decide that you absolutely don't want to take medications anymore, TELL YOUR DOCTOR so he/she can taper you safely. Of course, I wouldn't suggest starting again abruptly now that you've stopped-- I have no idea how long it's been out of your system, and I can't give you that kind of advice anyway. At this point, I would suggest calling your Dr ASAP and telling him/her what happened-- if necessary, go to the ER so that you can be monitoring and detoxed/tapered in a controlled, safe environment.    Let me know how everything goes. Best wishes.  <3, Sam\n\n",

This particular type of medication can be complicated, as you noted, because it interacts with foods, beverages and medications.  I would discuss this with your psychiatrist.  It may be the right medication for you but the doctor may want to try some of the other SSRIs first.  It is important to give a new drug weeks to months to determine effectiveness so it requires lots of patience.  I would also recommend that you get some psychotherapy as well to help you learn to cope with this problem.  Best wishes for your health.\n\n",

I walk 5x per week, at least an hour per day. I eat healthy, I quit drinking soda or anything with HF corn syrup. I just don't know what else to do.

She may be wondering why in the world you want to stop taking it, while you're wondering why in the world you should continue it.  Perhaps the solution may be a frank, open conversation with your doctor.  In answering your questions about weight gain, though, the most prudent course of action would be a visit to your family doctor for laboratory work.  You may have a thyroid problem that could cause such weight gain.  If your thyroid is normal, then your doctor can help you with solutions for weight loss.  Good luck, and please come back to let us know how you're doing.\n\n",

    "title": "Weight gain with Effexor",
    "content": "Dear OAE:  It is difficult to tell sometimes what weight gain may be due to.  Effexor XR tends to be more weight neutral than other antidepressants and often decreases sex drive.  Your weight gain could be due to the fact that you went back to work, particularly if your job is more of a sedentary type work situation.  On the other hand, it could be that your anxiety kept you thin because of nervous energy or lack of appetite which are common symptoms of anxiety.  Now that your anxiety has been treated, you no longer have that as a safeguard against weight gain.  Another factor in your issue is whether or not you breastfed your infants.  Women who breastfeed have a much higher caloric requirement than those who do not.  After they stop breastfeeding, though, they find that their weight skyrockets because their eating habits have changed, but their actually caloric requirements are no longer as high.  Another related factor is hormonal change.  Also, when breastfeeding is discontinued, there is a hormonal change.  Many women do not menstruate while they breastfeed, but once they stop, menses re-starts.  If the Effexor caused the weight gain, what determines how well the weight will come off depends, again, on the reason for its gain.  It could be that the medication simply did stimulate your appetite; it could be that your appetite increased because you were no longer anxious.  Good luck to you.  See your physician if your weight continues to be a big problem for you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 21, male, and an athlete - I weight train 4 days out of the week.  Recently, I was diagnosed with depression and was given a prescription to Lexapro (10 mg) which I've responded very well to.  I got over the first two weeks of discomfort and now in my fourth week, the results have been great.  This has been my first time on any kind of medication for depression or related illness.  However, I'm concerned because part of my exercise regimen involves using dietary supplements to enhance my nutritional input.  Since I began taking Lexapro, I was  only taking protein, so I wasn't concerned.  However, now I'm set to begin using a product called N.O.-Xplode ( http://www.bodybuilding.com/store/bsn/xplode.html ) and part of the warning asks me to consult someone before I take it if I'm being treated for depression.  I've taken N.O before with very positive results.  Should I be seriously concerned when using Lexapro and NO-Xplode?  I left the link in my post with all the nutritional information so you can take a quick look at what's in NO-Xplode.  Thanks in advance for your time and your help.  - Buttons[/url]\n\n",

I took it for 1 year and it helped a little, but my depression came back after about 4-5 months. I don't understand why it stopped working. I was advised to increase the dose, which has not seemed to be effective, its just made me feel sick all the time. I have tried 'natural' methods such as st. Johns Wart and 5HTP and vitamin B12 - none of which seem to work either. Why am I so depressed, why won't anything help me? There is no family history so my family does not seem to understand what I am going through. Help please. I don't want to die or end up in some crazy mental hospital. I just want to feel normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SadWoman:  First of all, if you are not seeing a psychiatrist, then you should.  Family practice doctors are great for many many illnesses, but when a patient does not respond to a first-line therapy such as an antidepressant, then the problem is much more complicated.  Venlafaxine (Effexor) is just one antidepressant.  It is very effective for many people, but there are folks who get no benefit from it.  SSRIs (fluoxetine = Prozac, sertraline = Zoloft, paroxetine = Paxil, citalopram = Celexa, escitalopram = Lexapro) are another type of antidepressant, as are buproprion (Wellbutrin) and duloxetine (Cymbalta).  There are even more antidepressants, but those listed are the most modern and are effective.  Sometimes patients need more than one antidepressant.  Sometimes other medications are added to a single antidepressant (such as thyroid hormone, lithium, lamotrigine, etc.) for maximum effect.  And, many times talk therapy is added to medications.  Depression is a very serious illness that many people die from.  Luckily it is very treatable by psychiatrists.  Good luck to you.  Please stop back in and let us know how things work out for you.\n\n",

Combination problems such as anxiety and depression (with possibly other issues as well) can be very complex and it can take a while to get a good response to treatment.  For this reason it is important to be persistent and patient in your quest for health.    I would also recommend a book called \"When Your Body Gets the Blues\" by Marie-Annette Brown and Jo Robinson.  There are some good techniques here that anyone can use both with and without medications.  It may help you better understand what is going on with your body - remember the mind is part of the body and there are physical concerns as well as emotional.  It is important to get the neurotransmitters working properly for good health.    Good luck with this.  Please keep us informed on your progress too.\n\n",

I wanted to see how these medications would effect me if I were to get pregnant. I was in for a rude awakening as I read the many posts on this site. I'm actually scared to death due to the fact I already may be pregnant and the high dosage that I am on. I have only seen a handful of people on 300mg of effexor, not to mention the other medications I am on are extremely high as well (for ex. most people on trazodone take 25mg - I take 150mg WOW!). I am a 27 year old student, finishing a degree in Graphic Design/Advertising. I was diagnosed to be Bi-Polar when I entered a substance abuse treatment center in November of 2005. I have remained sober and clean, however now I'm learning that I am still on medications, obviously highly addictive, whether it is stated on the information packet or not!  I decided to stop taking everything but the trazodone. I have already began to wean myself off of it.  Yesterday I cut my doses in half then that  evening decided to do it cold turkey, due to the fact I am trying to get pregnant or very well may be.  Today I feel dizzy, and I'm getting shocks from my head into my arms, hands, and feet.  Am I going about this the correct way?\n\n",

You are taking these medications for a very serious illness--Bipolar Disorder.  One of your medications, lamotrigine (Lamictal) is an anticonvulsant.  When you suddenly stop an anticonvulsant you take the risk of having a seizure.  IF YOU DO NOT ALREADY KNOW, SEIZURES CAN BE DEADLY, FOR YOU AND YOUR FETUS!!!!!!!!!  What you are doing is potentially more dangerous than staying on your medications.  There is a way to withdraw from your medications safely.  You must see your physician immediately!\n\n",

    "content": "I am not a specialist with this but my information is that Klonipin is a very effective treatment for anxiety disorder; Wellbutrin more for the depressive symptoms you may have in addition to this.  It is also helpful for people with attention deficit, smokers who would like to quit, and for the sexual side effects that can be present with other meds.  The combination can counter some of those concerns.  But, in some cases Wellbutrin can cause the anxiety to become worse.  People sometimes do exhibit a kind of tolerance where medications need to be re-evaluated and what worked well at one time may need to be changed later on.  Some people can take the same medication for decades without problems, so we can't assume this is the case.    Talk to your doctor to see the best course for you now since this can change over time.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "My primary care doctor recently suggested that I start taking Prozac (fluoxetine) for my depression related to menstrual cycle. But I am a little bit hesitant to start taking it because of the list of side effects. In your experience with patients, does Sarafem tend to work better than Zoloft to relieve symptoms of depression related to PMDD? Also, how is Sarafem different than regular Prozac? Is it a lower dose of Prozac? I know that they are both SSRI's, but do any of them work better (with less side effects) for treating PMDD?\n\n",

    "content": "Sarafem and Prozac are the same (fluoxetine) and dosages vary depending on your needs, usually between 10 mg and 80 mg. daily.  It is approved under the name Sarafem for treatment of premenstrual depressive disorder (PMDD).  Zoloft is in the same class of drugs and can also be effective for depression, PMDD and other conditions.  I would not say one was better than another.  But, some people respond best to one or the other and the trick is to get the right one for you.  Everyone is individual and it can take a while to regulate the meds to be most effective so patience is in order when working on this.    All medications have possible side effects and most people take these SSRIs without problems.  Often the side effects are temporary and resolve on their own within a couple of weeks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sintwar:  Unfortunately, this is a common problem.  Venlafaxine (Effexor) is \"weight neutral\" for most and for some it has an appetite suppressant effect.  However, there are other problems with venlafaxine, such as the withdrawal when you quit taking it that make it less desirable.  Otherwise, it is a very effective antidepressant which acts fairly quickly.  Bupropion (Wellbutrin) is weight neutral, and also very effective.  Just because it did not work for you in the past doesn't necessarily mean that it won't work at this time.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am 39 years old male and I have been a heavy marijuana smoker for twenty-five+ years, i was an alcoholic for 20+ years, 6 years sober. Recently i went to the doctor as i have been severely depressed, anxiety, and some huge phobias for quite some time and felt i needed some professional help.  The doctor put me on Effexor XR 150mg, seven  weeks ago. Six days ago he put me on Concerta18mg.   My question is, will there be any side-effects if i continue to smoke marijuana while taking the Concerta and the Effexor XR? The doctor tried to put me on Concerta back in 2005 but i took my self off after about 6 weeks of using the medication because i couldn't sleep. The Concerta did help with my concentration in 2005 when i attempted some courses at DeVry University but like i said i had sleep issues.   I lied to the doctor and told him i quit smoking marijuana he knows i was a marijuana for 20+ years. As a stimulant he didn't want to prescribe the Concerta if i was still smoking. This is my 1st time i felt the need to lie to him, i have always been honest with him but i want the help that the meds will hopefully do for me.

    "content": "Banjo:  Actually Wellbutrin has much less anticholinergic effect than other antidepressants.  It is known to be helpful for attention deficit disorders as well.  According to your source, it is the choline that would be doing the \"dumbing-down,\" not the antidepressant.  Attention deficit disorders respond to dopamine and norepinephrine, and maybe serotonin, but mainly dopamine.  Wellbutrin is a dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, which means that it causes more dopamine and norepinephrine to be available to help the attention problem.    The happy coincidence (if you believe in coincidence, anyway--I don't) is that depression responds to norepinephrine, dopamine, and especially serotonin.  Acetylcholine opposes/moderates dopamine transmission, in some parts of the brain.  An excellent example that demonstrates the relationship between dopamine and acetylcholine is the difference between Parkinson's disease and Huntington's Chorea.  An oversimplified explanation is that in Parkinson's disease dopamine is deficient.  In Huntington's chorea, acetylcholine is deficient.  One of the lead-in symptoms of Parkinson's disease is depression.  Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor Withdrawal",
    "content": "Hi, everyone.  I have been taking Effexor for over 3 years for premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).  I am recently married and want to try to start a family soon, but knew I wanted off this drug before I began trying.  I have been attempting to d/c for over a month now.  I, too, have been experiencing terrible, debilitating side effects, and while I would not wish this \"hell\" upon anyone, I am comforted to know that I am not alone in this battle--and a battle it has been.  I had been taking 150 mg XR caps daily and decreased to 75 mg about a month ago with no ill effects other than some very vivid, disturbing dreams.  When I ran out of the 75 mg samples my physician had given me, I decided to stop \"cold turkey,\" not knowing the repercussions of my decision but understanding for the first time in years the origins of some very peculiar symptoms I had experienced, which I can now attribute to late/skipped doses of Effexor.  After d/c'ing completely, I was OK for the first 2 days, but then my symptoms became so severe, I had to contact my physician for an Rx for the 37.5 mg dose.  To my dismay, the pharmacy had filled the Rx for the tabs instead of the caps, which I didn't realize until I got home.  (In hindsight, I am glad I received tabs instead of caps.)  I took a tablet immediately and felt better within hrs.  That was 2 weeks ago.  Over the next couple of days, I again took whole tabs but soon began taking only a \u00bc tab each day.  I felt pretty lousy, but not as bad as I did when I went cold turkey.  Now, I have been trying to get by on the smallest dose possible.  Instead of regularly scheduled daily doses (in the AM), I have been taking \"nibbles\" of a tablet as needed to take the edge off my symptoms, which has amounted to less than a \u00bc tablet total daily dose.  I have also been existing on Advil (ibuprofen), Tylenol (acetaminophen), and Benadryl (diphenhydramine).  I am desperate to get off this Rx as soon as possible.  To put this in some perspective, I am not one who complains, and I have a fairly high tolerance for pain.  That being said, these symptoms have been some of the worst I've ever experienced\u2014far worse than the flu\u2014worse than any dizziness, nausea, or headache I've ever had.  And the \u201cbrain shivers\u201d!  Awful!  (Although I characterize them more as electrical zaps and jolts, as many have described previously; it is most definitely not severe dizziness/vertigo.)  The worst part about this experience is that I asked to be put on Effexor.  I was working at Wyeth at the time (I have a doctor of pharmacy degree and was working in their drug safety department, believe it or not).  Wyeth employees received any prescription-Wyeth product for $0 copay.  You think I would have known better, but I did not work on Effexor while at Wyeth and was only familiar with the \"success\" stories.  I do believe this Rx has a place in therapy, but I now believe that it should be reserved for severe cases of depression and anxiety for which other treatments have failed.  As a pharmacist, I know that antidepressants have been associated with withdrawal symptoms but had been told that if the dose is tapered, the effects are minimal.  I\u2019ve experienced first hand that this is not the case.  I would encourage each of you to pick up the phone and relate your personal stories to Wyeth--better yet, have your health care provider do this on your behalf.  (And while they\u2019re at it, they can request \u201coff-label\u201d information about how to discontinue the Rx, which they are not allowed by law to provide unless your health care provider specifically asks for it.)  That is the only way that Wyeth and the FDA will know the extent of Effexor's withdrawal symptoms.  By law, pharmaceutical manufacturers MUST inform boards of health worldwide (Effexor is marketed globally, not just in the US), of the safety reports they receive.  One caveat, however, is that reports of adverse reactions from consumers carry less \"weight\" than do reports from health care providers, especially in Europe, which is why I recommend that you have your health care provider submit the report for you.  Let your voices be heard, but just make sure that the right audience is hearing them!  You can make a difference.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old female.  I have a dx of GAD and Depression.  I started taking Effexor XR 13 days ago.  I started out at 75mg for 6 days and am now up to 112.5mg for the past 7 days.  I am having side effects that include (nervousness, tremor, dizziness, severe drowsiness, jaw clenching) The drowsiness wasn't bad the first 6 days but now that I went up to 112.5 it is terrible, I can hardly keep my eyes open during the day.   I did start to take the med at night instead of in the morning.  I do feel better as far as my constant anxiety and depression.  I still feel foggy minded though. I am able to function a little bit better but today was a bad day for me so it has me a bit concerned because I did so good for about 6 days straight.   My questions are, Will the side effects go away eventually? Are these pretty normal side effects?  When will I be able to think clearly? I have been in touch with my Pshyc doc and he believes this will all pass.  Thank you so much ahead of time! Heather\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old female.  I have had a bladder surgery and a c-section, a gallbladder surgery.  I am very healthy I get an occasional migraine.  Grandfather died of heart disease. Granmother died of cancer. Grandmother died of Anuerysm.  I am not on any medications right now. My problem is that I started Lexapro in january.  I had an adverse reaction which included ( apetite loss, weight loss 8 lbs in 11 days, severe anxiety, tremor, diziness)  My GP advised me to stop the medication after taking it for only 11 days.  She then started me on Xanax .5 a day and Effexor 37.5 a day for a week and 75mg a day after that.  I took it for 2 weeks and 5 days.  I then started having the same bad reaction to it.  I stopped the xanax the first day because I had these same reactions with them.  They stopped the Effexor and I have had all of the withdrawl symptoms.  I have lost 30 lbs all together.  I did have a gallbladder surgery 2 weeks ago.  I couldn't take any of the medicine that I had because it made me sick.  I would tremor, have dizziness and shake uncontrolably almost like I was freezing cold.  I also had nervous feelings with it along with feeling dissaccociated.    I did take a antibiotic last night due to a sinus infection.  Within 30 min of the antibiotic I started to have the above mention symptoms.  It lasted all night and half of today.  Is there something that could have happened to my nervous system when I had the reaction to the Lexapro?  Ever since then I have not been able to take any kind of medication at all.  I have been to my doc several times.  I have had a cat scan of my brain and everything is ok there.  I have also had an Echo because they found a slight murmor when I had my gallbladder surgery.  It came back great.  I have also had a series of blood work done and it is all normal.  The doc says it is from Effexor withdrawl and says with all of the trauma my nervous system has had in the past 3 months it is almost like PTSD. I also want to mention I get frightened at the slightest sounds or scary things on tv even if it is just the 5 oclock news.  I almost jump out of my skin.  I want to know have you ever heard of anything like this and how long can I expect it to last.  It is very scary to go through.\n\n",

Bipolar depression can be especially difficult to manage.  There are many medications out there and I would not completely discount their usefulness in the long run but it is important to find the right combination of medications and therapy.  I would recommend getting your wife a good psychiatric evaluation to be sure you are getting the right treatment to avoid future problems of this sort.  While a medication rest may help temporarily, it probably won't have long-term results.  You might also benefit from the support available through NAMI (National Alliance for Mental Illness)  http://www.nami.org  The family members need help as well as the affected person and in some locations they have support groups with that focus. Your concern for your wife is commendable.  Good luck!\n\n",

Unfortunately, the drug has essentially given up on me, so my psychiatrist want to switch me to luvox. Shes has me weaning off of celexa and adding luvox at the same time. So pretty much every monday, I will go down about 20 mg of celexa and up 20 mg of luvox until I am completely off of celexa. From what I've read, this can be dangerous to mix the two due to too much seretonin. Is this an ok process? Is it better to wean completely off of one before starting another? Any help you could provide would be great. Thank you. B.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  What your doctor is doing is the most common way to switch from celexa/lexapro to Luvox. There is a a small risk of inducing serotonin syndrome-like effects when two SSRIs are taken simultaneously, but being as you are decreasing one as you increase the other, the risk is minimal. Where you can run into problems is when you mix an SSRI like Luvox with another type of antidepressant like an MAOI or tricyclic. Also, ask you doctor about minimizing your caffeine intake while on Luvox, as it may interfere with the metabolism of caffeine.  Good luck!\n\n",

Are you in the field or do you also struggle with OCD?   She actually didn't tell me about caffeine issues. I drink coffee regularly. She told me to be careful of grapefruit and that was it. Does it cause stomach issues?   Also, she said it was up to me to determine how quickly I wanted to wean off the celexa.

Since I've been on celexa for 7 years, I don't know if that will be too fast, but I figured since I was replacing it with luvox, I might not have withdrawl symptoms?? Thoughts?

    "content": "Rina:  Every day, or maybe every Wednesday?  I'm not sure what you're getting at with this question.  A 75 mg venlafaxine with a 150 mg venlafaxine is 225 mg total, which is the recommended maximum dose of this medication.  It isn't unusual for a physician to prescribe more than one type of antidepressant, depending on the patient's history.  The number of pills isn't so important as is the total number of milligrams they add up to.  For example, if my patient needs to take 225 mg of venlafaxine every day and I've decided to give them samples of venlafaxine, I may only have the 37.5 mg strength available.  In that case, my patient would have to take six of them to have the full dose, which is an appropriate dose of this particular medicine.  On the other hand, if your concern is about five or eight different brands of antidepressants being taken simultaneously, I would say that it is a problem and whoever it is doing this needs to see a doctor immediately.  If you are unable to get this person to go voluntarily to the emergency department, you can always call 911.\n\n",

    "content": "Rina:  I see...  Well, 600 mg of venlafaxine daily is not unheard of, but very strange.  A daily dose of 1200 mg of venlafaxine daily is probably not healthy.  Venlafaxine is generally thought to be nonlethal in overdose ar larger doses than these, however.  The greatest health risk with that kind of dose of venlafaxine is seizure, which can definitely have very serious consequences.  I'd say that your friend needs help.  Unless this person has signed a release of information to allow her physician to talk to you, I'm afraid that making a call to that prescriber will not be helpful.  You could always try, though.  Alternatively, you could tell people who are close to her, if you feel safe doing so and confident that you are correct.  Good luck.\n\n",

I have been taking Effexor XR a few years ago (at 225mg) but stopped suddenly before having my first child.  My GAD started again after a year and now I have been tajing Effexor XR since early last year (gradually increasing up to 300mg/day - dose I currently on since the summer of 2006.  I am feeling more depressed than anxious for the past few months and have been wondering if the effexor is not working as it was before.  I am also prescribed to take clonazepam when needed (o.5mg up to 3 times a day - but I hate taking more meds, so I try not to take them).  I have to say that I do feel less anxious when I take half a 0.5mg tablet but its the sadness and depression that is really worrying me. The anxiety is still a big part of my life as I am constantly worrying if it will come back or that I am checking myself for symptoms.  Any advice is greatly appreciated  Thanks\n\n",

This is a poorly understood phenomena, and seems more common with the SSRIs than in any other class.  My personal opinion based on experience, is that Effexor loses efficacy almost as often as the SSRIs.  When I have a patient with this problem, I simply switch them to something else.  In your case, I would choose something that works differently than does Effexor, such as one of the SSRIs, since they are all indicated for anxiety.  A visit to a psychiatrist or your family doctor is definitely in order.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "effexor XR - when to take them",
    "content": "thank you for your reply... I have another quick question about the medications that I am currently taking.  I am prescribed the Effexor XR (2 tablets of 150mg a day) and I was wondering if it best to take them at one time during the day, or if it should be taken, for example, one in the morning, and the other in the evening.  Any advice on this?  Also, to help alleviate my anxiety symptoms, which are almost always present even if I take effexor, my doctor gave me a prescription for clonazepam (0,5mg tblets) which I can take 2-3 a day.  My question is, the prescription says to be taken when needed.  I try to avoid taking them.  Why? Not sure, perhaps it to try and do it by myself and try and control my symptoms but I am feeling very anxious and I associate most daily activities with past anxiety attacks.  Should I be taking them more regularly?  Will this help me feel more stable?  By taking a 0,5mg in the morning and one near supper, would this be a reasonable dosage for my GAD?  Also, does this medication help with some depressive moments?  When I take them, it sometimes help me look on the bright side and not think I am hopeless with GAD and that I may be able to enjoy my life more without obsessing about future panic/anxiety attacks.  Thanks again for your help!!\n\n",

    "content": "Anxious and Sick of It:  The only antidepressant effect clonazepam has is in its ability to relieve anxiety.  My belief is that there is no shame in using medicine to relieve symptoms.  After all, anxiety and depression are illnesses caused by chemical imbalances.  Diabetes and some types of hypertension are also caused by chemical imbalances.  The problem with using clonazepam for anxiety is that clonazepam is addictive for some people.  There are patients who can maintain a prescription for clonazepam for decades without it ever becoming a problem.  There are others, however, who are addicted and dependent after a relatively short period of time, e.g., weeks or a few months.  If you have ever had a problem with any type of dependency, then you probably should not rely on clonazepam or any similar medication (benzodiazepines = lorazepam, alprazolam, diazepam, temazepam, etc.), for relief of anxiety.  Clonazepam is less addictive than some other choices, but is still problematic in certain individuals.  If clonazepam is a good choice for you, the dosing frequency of morning and supper is a good plan.  Usually, the benzodiazepines are prescribed for a short period of time while waiting for the antidepressant to take effect.  Many of them, including Effexor, are indicated for the treatment of anxiety disorders.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

In about August I stopped taking the medication to see if I could deal with my problem. It's been about 5 months now and it's definately taking an effect on me. The syptoms are starting to come back.   So, I've decided to start my medication up again. The thing is, right now I don't have health care so I was looking into herbal remedies. St. John's wort sounds nice, but I'm worried about its effect on my birth control. I've been using the Nuvaring since June or July of last year and haven't had any problems with it.   So my questions is, is it safe to take st. john's wort with my birth control. I don't want my birth control to become less effective in preventing pregnancy.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Ms Crystallia:  St. John's Wort is known to be an effective antidepressant that is similar to fluoxetine, or Prozac.  The problem with herbal remedies, in the US, is that they are not regulated by anyone.  No matter what the label says, you do not know that each capsule contains the actual active ingredient or that it has the same amount as all the other capsules in the bottle.  You don't know anything about what contaminants there may be, because there is no particular labeling requirement.  To answer your question about oral contraception, St. John's Wort may decrease the effectiveness of birth control pills.  I understand the problem of having no health insurance.  Medicines are expensive.  However, there are many good antidepressants available as generic drugs.  For example, paroxetine (Paxil), fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa), and buproprion (Wellbutrin) are all available in generic form, which means they are much less expensive.  Good luck to you!  Please come back and let us know how you're doing.\n\n",

    "title": "Switching from Effexor to Cipralex for Depression/Anxiety",
    "content": "Sorry this might be a little long!  I am 23/f university student with past diagnosis of depression since my teenage years- was on 10 mg/20 mg Paxil for several years than went off because I was feeling better and the Paxil was making me feel numb- Doctors put me on 37.5 mg Effexor XR so I could taper off more easily. I was off ADs for awhile but ended up having to go back on when the depression came back full force a few years ago (I also believe now I was having anxiety although this was undiagnosed at the time). I was on 37.5 Effexor for over a year than recently, began having fainting spells and panic attacks and my depresison came back full force while on 75 mgs of Effexor XR a day. I believed the depression was being caused mostly by birth control pills (I had to up my Effexor from 37.5 once to twice a day while on BPs due to episodes of depression) so I went off of those, it helped a bit but overall the depression and anxiety remained, with the anxiety stronger than ever. Up untill I had the panic attack I never knew or realized I had anxiety, but thinking back I believe I had many of the symptoms of a generalized anxiety disorder for several years, particularly gastrointestinal symptoms (whenever I get even a little bit anxious, like going out with friends, I get nausea, diarhea, and feel like I can't breathe or have to get away from people, even a bit paranoid, as well as the feelings of depersonalization).   I went to my GP a few weeks ago and he suggested I switch to Cipralex and taper off the Effexor so I went from 75mg down to 37.5 mg of Effexor with 5 mg and then 10 mg of Cipralex for about a week, and was feeling a bit better. But now I am off the Effexor completely and on 10 mg of Cipralex and I am starting to feel depression and anxiety again. My GP told me that anxiety can increase initially on Cipralex but I have been on it for more than two weeks now, so I am thinking maybe I am having withdrawal effects from going off the Effexor. My symptoms are extreme agitation and anger often culminating in crying/depression, particularly anger at family and my boyfriend, apathy (I just don't care about doing anything- could lie on my bed and stare at the ceiling for hours), feelings of depersonalization/spaciness/general \"weirdness\" like I'm not really here, or I'm in some kind of dream world of altered state, minor headache, nausea, stomach upset, vivid dreams, and of course the anxiety symptoms (feeling like I will faint, be sick, have another panic attack). Also my thinking seems different- it is hard for me to come up with words, I lose my train of thought at the drop of a hat, and I find it difficult to talk to people (which has never been a problem for me- normally I think too much!). On the weekend it was my birthday, and before going out I was so anxious that I took half an Ativan (my moms) and it made me feel so much better, but totally spacey. I took another one the next day because I was going out again and same deal- I could actually eat and enjoy myself but quite spacey. But man are those things addicting. I knew I should not be taking them because they were not my prescription but my mom gave me one after having a panic attack and it really helped. Monday though I really wanted to take another one- like a smoker trying to quit, but I didn't because I don't want to get hooked on them- I am just putting up with the anxiousness.  So my questions are: 1. Is it possible to have withdrawal effects from the Effexor even though I am now on Cipralex? My doctor said I might have to take Effexor and Cipralex together but I really don't want to after reading about all the horrible times people have had trying to come off Effexor. Should I go back on the 37.5 Effexor and try tapering it off more slowly if thats what is causing these symptoms, or could it possibly be that my symptoms are from the Cipralex? I tried researching Cipralex on the internet but it appears to be a fairly new drug and there is not alot of info on it, although because it is similar to Celexa and lexapro, and I found that overall there seemed to be alot less negative stuff said about Celexa/Lexapro than about Effexor. Can anyone provide me with more information about Cipralex?  2. Would it possibly be beneficial for me to take an anti-anxiety medication along with an AD for my anxiety symptoms, or will inreasing my dosage of Cipralex (10 to 20 mgs) help with the anxiety? It was so nice to be able to go out and feel normal and enjoy being with people while on the Ativan, but I know I cant take that stuff because it is so addicting- is there any other medication that can have similar effects to Ativan on anxiety without being so addicting and making me so spacey?  Also, around the time I started taking Effexor I started to get IBS symptoms like really bad bloating that is there everyday and I really thought coming off the Effexor might make the bloating stop but so far it hasnt (although I've only been off for a couple of days). Is there any known correlation between Effexor or other ADs and IBS symptoms like bloating and gas?  Thanks for taking the time to read :)\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor to Cipralex",
    "content": "Sylpha:  Cipralex is not available in the US, so I'm not familiar with the name.  However, from the manufacturer's website, I'm reasonably sure that Cipralex is the same as Lexapro.  Question #1 Yes, you could be having withdrawal effects from the Effexor, but since you are on the Cipralex, it is less likely.  I think what is more likely is that these symptoms are from your depression and anxiety.  Most antidepressants do take four to six weeks for the full effect to be felt.  Question #2 Anti-anxiety medication may be beneficial, but likely, it could mean taking a potentially very addictive drug, like Ativan, or the very similar drugs, Xanax or Klonopin.  Klonopin is the least addictive of the three.  There are other anti-anxiety medications, such as Vistaril (hydroxyzine), which works well, is not addictive, but has some side effectws that some folks don't want to deal with.  The worst of these side effects are dry mouth, constipation, and urinary retention.  Increasing the dose of the Cipralex is likely to help with your anxiety, but it may take a few weeks for that to happen.  Question #3 I think the bloating could be due to your anxiety or the Cipralex, or even both.  Cipralex, along with most other antidepressants, can cause GI side effects.  Usually they are transient and improve gradually with time.  Try some simethicone (brand-name I am familiar with is Gas-X) for the bloating, even if you're not sure it is gas.  If simethicone does not help the discomfort, see your physician for other potential problems.  I wish you good luck!  Please come back and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

At which point my doctor wanted to up my dose to 40mg. I refused due to fear of side effects so compromised at 30mg for two weeks. He urged me to try 40mg which I did for 1 day and suffered unbearable side effects so went down to 35mg to compromise once again. It's been almost  2 weeks and these unbearable side effects continue, effects I did not suffer at all at 30mg. I know it hasn't been that long but I can't take it anymore, my work at the office is suffering, my family has noticed a great change in my personality and mood, my appetite is completely gone, I've shaky, nervous, I'm having panic attacks again..... unacceptable.  Spoke to my doctor on the phone this morning and he advised me to go back to the 30mg ASAP, then on Friday we'll chat about maybe trying another drug.  My question: Will I notice any significant difference tomorrow when I go back to 30mg? I've been told by a nurse I know that I will feel like myself again right away, and I hope that's true. I just can't believe the difference in side effects from 30 to 35! I can't live like this. I just want to go back to what worked, and be done with it.

    "content": "Dear aurora  the recommended dose for panic disorders is 20-60 mg orally every day.  individuals respond differently to antidepressants, therefore, your body might respond positively even with what seems a low dose (30 mg).  as advised by your doctor, you can start back on the 30 mg dose as soon as possible. However, yoy may or may not feel better right away the same way you used to feel when you were taking the 30 mg daily dose.  It all depends on how your body handles the drug. Usually, the steady state plasma concentrations are achieved within approximately one week and are expected to be 2.5 times the plasma concentrations observed after a single dose.   and since you have stated you have taken the 35 mg dose for about 2 weeks, it may take a couple of days until your body adjusts back to the 30 mg dose.  I hope you always feel better, and i hope you get rid of all the symptoms quickly.   i am glad you are seeing your doctor tommorow, let me know how things go, and if you have any questions  all the best, thank you very much\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response Dr!!  It is now day 2 of being back at 30mg and already I feel much much better. Still a little shaky mind you, but I'm still \"shaken\" up by how I felt this past week (on a side note, I was only on 35 mg for 6 days, not two weeks). It's curious, I had the same reaction years ago to Paxil. I was fine on a low dose, and felt unbearable effects when my doctor upped my dose after a few weeks, so went back down to my first low dose with improvement. I wonder... perhaps my body just can't handle more than a small amount of medication? Hence my inability to handle things like contraception without miserable day long nausea :P  At any rate, I feel better back at 30mg even if only on day 2, and I hope it continues.\n\n",

    "content": "i am a man , 27 years old    I have a question relating to a drug I started from a couple of days, I was feeling a state of high depression and anxiety.  I started to take celexa . I just took two 20mg  pills   But from this time I can not sleep at all. Even if I go to the bed early, I can sleep only like 1 or 1.5 hours and then I wake up suddenly and I can not get sleep again easily    Is this a normal side effect of celexa? Also, I feel changes in my sexual ability.   Actually I see my penis getting shrinkage most of the time. Very rigid while compressed I mean it is not in its normal size, it is always small rigid and compressed. Could this be a side effect of the drug or because my depression  state     I appropriate your quick answer   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Arabie 2310:  First things first--if you are having a painful erection (normal size or not), that lasts more than two hours, it is a MEDICAL EMERGENCY.  If/when you experience this you must go to an emergency room.  Failure to do so could result in loss of penile tissue.  This condition is called priapism and can be caused by many different agents/situations: trauma to the pelvic area many different medications,  including injectable drugs to induce erection, anabolic steroids, recreational drugs (most common--cocaine, meth, ecstasy, marijuana) various medical conditions, including sickle cell anemia idiopathic--this means no particular cause can be found, and surprisingly accounts for most cases This is only a partial list, and there have been rare cases caused by citalopram, or at least correlated with its use.  If you indeed are having priapism, call the physician who prescribed the citalopram (Celexa), and go to the emergency room.  Please come back and let us know what happens.\n\n",

    "content": "arabie 2310:  Anxiety and depression can very easily cause physical illness.  In your first post, you mentioned your dose.  If you did take 40 mg on day one without first gradually increasing it, then you have a much higher likelihood of having priapism/sexual dysfunction.  A starting dose of 40 mg is very high, and could make the anxiety worse before it gets any better at all.  I think you should definitely plan a visit to the prescribing doctor for evaluation of these adverse effects.  Please come back and let us know how things go for you.\n\n",

I take 75mg and have never experienced any side effects and it has helped with anxiety problems I have experience most of my life. I have forgotton to take it and experienced the shocks that have been described by other undergoing withdrawl but I think the benefits (for me at least) outwiegh the downsides.  I have three questions   1. Is there any evidence (other than withdrawl) that illustrates clear derogatory effects of long term use,  2. Is there any documented evidence that Cannabis (very light) / effexor combination is dangerous (because I get very positive benefit) and lastly,   3. in regard to sexual dysfunction (still Ok to a degree but lessoning with age 49) is there a similar medication that I could switch to with identical benefits without this side effect.     I would appreciate input those who have been on this drug for a longer period and if there is a doc or two out there with advice it would be well received - thanks for taking the time to read this.\n\n",

    "content": "companion:  First of all, I'm so sorry about your daughter.  For your first question, the answer is no, IF it is taken as prescribed and there are no potential drug-drug interactions between the Effexor and another medicine you may be taking.  There is a small chance of someone experiencing elevated blood pressure, but that almost always happens when the drug is first started, and its occurrence is usually precipitated by much higher doses than 75 mg/day.  Next question:  the answer is no, but only because it hasn't been studied.  There really is no way to reliably conduct such a study without administering cannabis, which of course, we are not allowed to do.  Last question:  the answer is no, because the way the medicine is able to give you beneficial effects causes the sexual side effects.  The side effects are inherent in any medication that acts in a similar manner, with the medicines available to us today.\n\n",

    "content": "Redscut1:  Of course it is possible.  Whether or not it is wise is another question.  Paxil is difficult to quit, but so are some of the other anti-depressants, for example, Effexor.  Some people say the Paxil withdrawal is mild in comparison to Effexor, others say it is about the same.  My advice is to talk to the prescribing physician.  If my patient came to me with a similar question and situation, I would probably try to \"cross-taper\" to a somewhat longer-acting anti-depressant which is not known to have a withdrawal effect.  However, having said all that, I really wonder if this is necessary.  He began to become depressed again when he reduced his dose.  That indicates to me that the medicine is still of benefit to him.  Antidepressants, even within the same class, for example, SSRIs, are not all the same.  Where Paxil may work at this time, a switch to another, such as Zoloft or Prozac, may not work.  Then your husband will have switched to a different medicine with a different list of side effects, and he may still experience depression and/or anxiety.  Unless there is a compelling reason for him to discontinue the medicine, I would continue it.  The recurrence rate of depression is 25% after the first episode of Major Depressive Disorder.  After the second episode of Major Depressive Disorder, the recurrence rate is around 50%, and after the third episode, the recurrence rate jumps to around 80 - 85%.  Depending on your husband's history, he may decide it is worth it just to stick with what works.  Merry Christmans to you too, and please let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor Withdrawl",
    "content": "I have spent hours searching online for some worthwhile advice about these extremely frustrating feelings that are going on in my body right now, but I am not finding the answers that are all that helpful. I am just learning more descriptions for what I am feeling and that does me no good.  I am a female andI have been on antidepressants for over seven years ( 25 years old), Effexor XR for about four or five of those. Two years ago I fell into a huge slump and had to drop out of college, live with my family and go to an outpatient program for some intense therapy to help find ways to live day to day with the evil spell of depression. After much support and a serious self evaluation I am now healthy and have a positive outlook on life. I am in the best place right now to try and live my life without relying on medication to feel well. I am constantly surrounded by people who care about me. I have a healthy lifestyle (exercise, diet, positive outlook) and I am on track with accomplishing my goals.  I first found out about the Effexor withdrawls when I accidentally skipped a day or two taking my pills several years ago. Basically I just felt out of it and easily agitated, but also easily confused, slower to respond and my mind felt like it was having an out of body experience. I call this being \u201cmind F*#&ed\u201d. This was scary at first because I assumed I was falling into a serious depression, but after reading about it I was relieved to find this was a rather common problem. I was also slightly disturbed by the fact that a drug that is supposed to make you feel better has such an effect on your body. After my first experience with this withdrawal feeling I swore to myself I would work on getting better and get off this freaky drug. Well, life doesn\u2019t always go as planned and I ended up having to increase my dosage by a pretty significant amount before making to where I am today. But, alas\u2026here I am.  I have been working slowly for the past five months or so decreasing my intake of Effexor XR. I wanted to a) not have this funky withdrawal and b) make sure my mind and body was healthy enough to make it without the drug in me. Every time I have made an adjustment (capsules and reducing amount in them) I feel funky for about a week and then my body adjusts. The funk is really not too bad and I am able to perfectly function without a problem. Several days ago I made my second to last adjustment before being fully free of Effexor. Basically I am only taking a few little seed like pieces of the medication a day. Just having enough of the medicine in my body to not be totally rid of it. The withdrawal is much stronger than I hoped. Similar to the feelings I would get when I would stop cold turkey accidentally.  I have expected some sort of this feeling, but I was really hoping it wouldn\u2019t be this bad. The people I work and live with are aware of what I am doing and how it may be feeling, but this is a bit frustrating for me. I am NOT feeling depressed, emotional or sad. I am just feeling very \u201cmessed up\u201d. My job is not too demanding so I am able to function at work, but it is bothering me. Does anyone know how long this should last? I am hoping about a week, since ever time I have decreased the strength the funkiness goes away after about that long. The withdrawal side effects just aren\u2019t usually this intense, and I wonder how much of it I can really take before my daily actions are going to be severely disturbed. I really do not want to go back to taking this medicine because the withdrawal side effects are too much to handle. That would be very disappointing.   ANY ADVICE OR WORDS OF WISDOME??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Discontinuation symptoms (withdrawal) are known with various antidepressants, including venlafaxine (Effexor).  Most withdrawal reactions starts immediately after stopping the drug and last 7\u201314 days, but occasionally the for several weeks.   General recommendations for patients during withdrawal are: - Never go off medication without close medical supervision.   - By slow dose reduction , the brain can gradually adjust to the change in chemical balance . Some experts say, that it may need up to a year for a smooth withdrawal.  - Psychotherapy during withdrawal for withdrawal symptoms is very helpful and is superior to medication in the long run.   - Any external factors that may lead to depression or a panic attack should be avoided.  -Exercise help in, reducing stress, anxiety and insomnia, increasing sex drive and elevating self-esteem.   -Healthy diet, vitamin supplements e.g. Vit B6.  - friends and family are very important part of therapy.  I hope this information will help.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Blood tests were normal.... I then went to GYN who said cyst was of no signifigance and I had an infection in my uterus and tube which was probably causing irritation in my intestine... He told me to stay away from dairy and to take Librax 1 time a day every evening for 4 days and call him in 7 days...In the meantime, I decided to quit smoking, and then Before 7 dayswas up I started getting pain in my chest wall, under my breast behind my rib cage, and all over my back, with headaches. I went to my Primary, who had me go for a chest xray and spinal and neck xrays... all came back with out signifigance. Since I have complained of different pains over the past 2-3 years and have had a history of some occasional anxiety issues, my Primary told me that I must have Fibromyalgia, and my anxiety is making my pains worse. he then prescibed me effexor xr 37.5 mg daily 1 week then 75mgdaily  there after and 10 mg of elavil at bedtime, in the meantime My stomach pains have came back, and even though my doctors know what the other has prescibed to me, I was told to take the Librax as needed for the stomach pain... I am scared of all these drugs combined, and have not started the Effexor or the Elavil yet... I still have pain in my back and stomach, and chest, and feel sometimes as though I am not getting a complete breathe, although it is obvious I am... What is my problem??? Anxiety? Fibro? Smoking withdrawls?(I have been smoke free 23days)... should I take all these drugs? I am sooo nervous about mixing drugs and making my body feel worse....Thank You!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi splume, Thare are different types of Ovarian cysts. Regardless of the type however, upon rupture or torsion abdominal pain may be significant. Anxiety attacks may produce physical symptoms, ie, shortness of breath, chest pain/discomfort, etc., and considering the fact that you have recently stopped smoking (congratulations by the way) may have increased the episodes of stress and anxiety levels causing symptoms but these levels should subside. Untreated infections of the uterus may spread to the fallopian tubes as seen in, for example, Pelvic Inflammatory Disease. This condition is typically identified through a physical exam, labwork, and diagnostics, ie., ultrasound, etc. Treatment generally consists of a course of antibiotic therapy.  Fibromyalgia (sometimes referred to as Chronic Fatigue Syndrome), is sometimes difficult to diagnose. Diagnosis is based on certain criteria, and after other conditions have been ruled out. The following information is provided by the drug interaction checker on Click here! \"You have searched for drug interactions between the following drugs: Elavil ( amitriptyline) Librax (obsolete) (chlordiazepoxide-clidinium), Effexor XR (venlafaxine) Please note: only generic drug names are displayed. Drug-Drug Interactions amitriptyline and venlafaxine (major Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR CLOSELY: Concomitant use of agents with serotonergic activity such as serotonin reuptake inhibitors, monoamine oxidase inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, 5-HT1 receptor agonists, ergot alkaloids, lithium, St. John's wort, phenylpiperidine opioids, dextromethorphan, and 5-hydroxytryptophan may potentiate the risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A receptors. MANAGEMENT: In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Close monitoring is recommended for signs and symptoms of excessive serotonergic activity such as CNS irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, myoclonus, ataxia, abdominal cramping, hyperpyrexia, shivering, pupillary dilation, diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents. The potential risk of serotonin syndrome should be considered even when administering one serotonergic agent following discontinuation of another, as some agents may demonstrate a prolonged elimination half-life. For example, a 5-week washout period is recommended following use of fluoxetine before administering another serotonergic agent. amitriptyline and chlordiazepoxide-clidinium (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Agents with anticholinergic properties (e.g., sedating antihistamines; antispasmodics; neuroleptics; phenothiazines; skeletal muscle relaxants; tricyclic antidepressants; class IA antiarrhythmics especially disopyramide) may have additive effects when used in combination. Excessive parasympatholytic effects may result in paralytic ileus, hyperthermia, heat stroke, and the anticholinergic intoxication syndrome. Peripheral symptoms of intoxication commonly include mydriasis, blurred vision, flushed face, fever, dry skin and mucous membranes, tachycardia, urinary retention, and constipation. Central symptoms may include memory loss, disorientation, incoherence, hallucinations, psychosis, delirium, hyperactivity, twitching or jerking movements, stereotypy, and seizures. Central nervous system-depressant effects may also be additively or synergistically increased when these agents are combined, especially in elderly or debilitated patients. Use of neuroleptics in combination with other neuroleptics or anticholinergic agents may increase the risk of tardive dyskinesia. MANAGEMENT: Caution is advised when agents with anticholinergic properties are combined, particularly in the elderly and those with underlying organic brain disease, who tend to be more sensitive to the central anticholinergic effects of these drugs and in whom toxicity symptoms may be easily overlooked. Patients should be advised to notify their physician promptly if they experience potential symptoms of anticholinergic intoxication such as abdominal pain, fever, heat intolerance, blurred vision, confusion, and/or hallucinations. Ambulatory patients should be counseled to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them. A reduction in anticholinergic dosages may be necessary if excessive adverse effects develop.  amitriptyline and chlordiazepoxide-clidinium (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically increased in patients taking multiple drugs that cause these effects, especially in elderly or debilitated patients. MANAGEMENT: During concomitant use of these drugs, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS and respiratory depression. Ambulatory patients should be made aware of the possibility of additive CNS effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion) and counseled to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them. Patients should also be advised to notify their physician if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities.  venlafaxine and chlordiazepoxide-clidinium (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically increased in patients taking multiple drugs that cause these effects, especially in elderly or debilitated patients. MANAGEMENT: During concomitant use of these drugs, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS and respiratory depression. Ambulatory patients should be made aware of the possibility of additive CNS effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion) and counseled to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them. Patients should also be advised to notify their physician if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities\".  I would suggest inquiring with your physician and pharmacist regarding the concomittant use of these medications and I would also suggest a re-evaluation. I hope you find this information helpful.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 19 year old daughter of a 37 year old mother whom has been perscribed to take Effexor as an antidepressant.  I don't know exactly when she started taking them, but I feel she is highly dependant on them.  I say this because, if she forgets to take it one day, she is in a bad mood the whole day and is extremely emotional.  Honestly, she is down right mean and I honestly try to stay away from her when she isn't taking it.  For example, I could ask her a simple question like, whats for dinner, and she could completely snap and say why should I fix you all dinner, you can make your own dinner.  Just an example of course, but she snaps very easily when she isn't on the pill.  Before she started taking depression medicine, she was never like this so it makes me wonder if this medicine could be wrong for her. Is this a negative side effect?  Should she even continue taking this medicine, and should she be switched to something else?  Please help me figure out what to do.  I'm going crazy dealing with what not taking the medicine does to her.\n\n",

Like other SSNRI drugs, Effexor might cause several problems. Concomitant illness may exacerbate or aggravate (hypertension); patients may experience \u201cdiscontinuation symptoms\u201d when treatment is withdrawn, particularly if too fast. Some of these symptoms include unpleasant mood, hypomania and nervousness.  Also, many adverse events have been described with venlafaxine. Among symptoms that should be reported to the doctor right away are persistently elevated irritable mood, hostility, and impulsiveness. These symptoms can be unwanted drug effect, or less frequently, precipitation of a manic episode in patients at risk for bipolar disorders, and Effexor is not approved for bipolar depression.

THEN EEG NORMAL BUT SLEEP EEG SAID \"EVIDENCE OF INTERMITANT FOCAL SLOWING IN THE TEMPORAL DEVIATION LEFT TO RIGHT. THERE ARE OCCASIONAL EPILETFORM ACTIVITY ON LEFT TEMPORAL SPREADING TO RIGHT ON ONE OCCASION\".  don't KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS? HAD MRI WHICH SHOWED A WHITE PATCH WHICH THEY THOUGHT MAYBE A SCAR OR LESION BUT TOO DEEP FOR HEAD INJURY.

THIS NEARLY HAPPENED 3 OTHER TIMES AT NIGHT WHEN I PASSED WATER BUT I SPLASHED COLD WATER ON FACE AND PUT HEAD BETWEEN LEGS WHICH PREVENTED.  WENT BACK TO GET SIBUTRIMINE 2 WEEKS LATER AND WAS TOLD BY PHARMACIST I CANT TAKE IT BECAUSE OF POSSIBLE INTERACTIONS EVEN THOUGH I HAD ALREADY BEEN TAKING THEM FOR 3 WEEKS TOGETHER BEFORE INFECTION AND TO SEE DR.  I FOUND WHEN I STOPPED TAKING SIBUTRIMINE AFTER SEVERAL DAYS I STARTED TO FEEL MORE DOWN AND VERY VERY HUNGRY. I don't WANT TO PUT WEIGHT BACK ON IT HAS GIVEN ME SOME CONFIDENCE BACK AND I FEEL IT WILL HELP DEPRESSION LONG TERM. AS WELL AS HEALTH BENEFITS AND REDUCING TABLETS.

I would strongly encourage you to listen to the advice of your pharmacist. You may also want to keep in mind that physical activity, ie, walking, has been shown to reduce episodes of depression and anxiety.

A medication that works well for one may not work the same for another (if that makes sense). Some of the symptoms of serotonin syndrome may include diarrhea, fever, increased sweating, mood or behavior changes, confusion, overactive reflexes, racing heartbeat, restlessness, shivering or shaking, incoordination, seizures, etc. Even though swollen lymph nodes are not specifically listed by no means implies the it's an impossibility relating it to this syndrome or to the SSRI itself. As you can see serotonin syndrome can be a very serious condition. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Medical history first, questions in bold at bottom... thanks.   I am a 28 yr old female with no major medical issues that I know of. I am 5'2\" and weigh about 240lbs.  I have what they describe as a \"heavy frame\" and a higher % mussle mass than most of my height and weight because I work in a job where strength is required (firefighter).  I have never had any children either.   I have been diagnosed with depression different times since I was a teenager.  I have never attempted sucide or been in the hospital for mental illness. All of the anti depressants they ever gave me caused weight gain (Paxil caused 40lbs in 2 months). I have had problems with my peroid being regular (especally when under stress) and generally have 8-10 days of moderate to heavy flow.  I was on birthcontrol for this at one time and ended up with a yeast infection that took months of antifungals and comming off the pill to alievate. I still had bad reoccurances of the Yeast infections until about 3 months ago (give or take a month) when I started taking a herbal supplment (see below)  I also have been diagnosed with ADHD, Sensory Intergration disfunction, Developmental Dyspraxia and anxiety (though the anxiety isnt an issue at pressent except socially).  Also I have a high IQ. I have had my appendix removed (1999) and my wisdom teeth removed.   There is a family history of high blood pressure and some heart related illnesses, as well as glacoma, stroke and most of us have a tendansy to be over weight.  My mother and all three of my sisters have asthma and fibromyalga.  My mother had lung cancer from smoking.  I have one great aunt on each side of the family that was hospitilized for mental illness at some point. I do not smoke or do any \"recreational\" drugs, nor have I ever.  I also rarely drink (maybe a dozen drinks in the last year, if that many and less than 20 in my life).  Also the developmental issues that I have are also present in a nephew and a second cousin. I take a multi vitamin, fish  oil, vit. E, B-12, B complex, Kelp, and an Agstrom Mineral (sulfer).  I started taking gulcocimine this week for my joints. My caloric intake, on average, is about 1300cal, with the max (not counting special occasions) about 1800 and the min (not counting illness) being about 900. I try to ballance my protien and sugar intake and  I drink organic milk and eat organic yogart.  Ok ALL that said, I have been seeing a counciler and a phyc. for a couple months at the refferral of my family dr.  We had discussed the possiblilty of my having Aspergers Syndrome and he reffered me.  The counciler and phyc think im ADHD and want to put me on meds for Bi-polar. I am not taking any meds.   I have, due to recent stressors in my life, experienced depression and melancoly in the last few months.  I DO NOT want to take meds that are going to cause me to gain weight. In the past I had lost a great deal of weight on Redux (had all the tests that say my heart is fine, thank God) and during that time I was not depressed.  I worked out a lot at the time as well.  When I went on Paxil, then Zoloft, then something else, I began to gain weight and the depression stayed (My dr put me on paxil b/c my sleep cycle was messed up and I was upset over a carreer failure)  That was about 8 years ago.  Since then I have gained almost 100 lbs.  I have lost a good bit and then gained it back as soon as I got stressed again (job issues, family illness and death that kind of thing) the stress landed me back on anti depressants and more weight gain.  When I did loose weight, I found that my symptoms went away, and I felt better.   I have a dreadful time loosing weight anyhow, so I try to eat right and excersize.   My mother and I think that the excess weight is the cause of much of my depression. My counciler said that was possible but still wanted to have the DR perscribe meds that cause weight gain in me.    Oh the Agstrom mineral (sulfer) was recommended by a herbal DR (phd in bio-medical something or another) for the yeast.  I found that it eliminated my yeast infections and made me just \"feel better\".  My phyc and family dr said that it was intersting, and to keep on taking it, but didnt comment on why it seemed to help.  MY Questions are: can you controll depression with diet and excersize? Is there a connection of these two things and Yeast?  What amount of excersize would be benificial and what type?  any recomendations as to reading material would be wonderful, as well as any suggestions along these lines.  I want to feel better overall, but I also want to know if there is something I can do becides meds to help eliminate my depression.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

This can boost the level of serotonin which helps alleviate depression and is specifically linked to mood. Exercise does not have to be vigorous by any means. Activities such as walking for approximately 30 minutes, 3 times or more a week, can have valuable effects on overall physical and mental health. I would also suggest an evaluation by an Endocrinologist to rule out any underlying thyroid/hormone/endocrine dysfunction. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Most of the time they are neutral(not bad but not good) but I have been having very bad dreams where most of the time my family members are dead or I am dead and I basically have to see my family members be unhappy because I am dead. Sometimes it is where my family members get hurt and I couldn't stop it. Overall, they are just really sad upsetting dreams and they usually make my morning very bad.  I get these dreams about... 2 times a week at least but every night I get a very vivid dream. Actually, every time I go to sleep. Usually the dreams wake me up in the middle of the night and then when I go back to sleep I have another dream. I'm pretty sure it's from the medicine and I was wondering if the dose is too high and if all antidepressants would do this to me. I'm probably going to talk to my doctor but I was just wondering what other's think about it.\n\n",

It would be next to impossible to state what affects other antidepressants would or would not have on you since the side effects experienced may be different for each individual based on body chemistry etc. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

When I swallow the capsule my stomach really starts hurting about 45 minutes to 1 hour latter and lasts for a good time.  Do you know why this is happening?

    "content": "Dear jon1234  the fact that lexapro is mainly and extensively metabolized in the liver, the amount of the drug excreted unchanged in the urine is very minimal. Therefore, I do not think the drug will cause major problems in your case.   Like you said , your concern has not been desribed in literature. However, if you take a look at the FDA  website ( for lexapro), and mainly at the side effects, there is a section of premarketing side effects of lexapro, right at the end, with respect to Urinary System Disorders -  Frequent: urinary frequency, urinary tract infection.  Infrequent:urinary urgency, kidney stone, dysuria, blood in urine.  Like i said, this small section appeared toward the end, it is was very rarely seen, and infrequent.  attached is the web address for your reference, the information i have told you is described at the bottom of page 23 of 28) on that PDF FILE.  thank you very much and have a great day  web site address and pdf file of lexapro at FDA SITE  http://www.fda.gov/cder/foi/label/2003/ ... %20lexapro'\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Im 29 and have a long history of anxiety and panic attacks I am extremely sensitive to anything I put in my body, I don't drink, smoke, or even drink caffine and very little sugar.  However, I was a heavy drug user about 10 years ago before I had anxiety symtoms and after I quit all the drugs is when I first started to notice the panic attacks and a little GAD.  However, I have not used anything in almost nine years and have been doing great. About 3 years after all the drugs I went to a doctor and he said that the symtoms I was having were panik attacks and he put me on Paxil.  I was on paxil for about 2 years for the panic attacks and it totally helped.  I quit taking it about 1 year ago and have been doing  great working out, eating right, but the stress in my job was starting to get to me and then aboutl 2 months ago when my doctor gave ultram for a sinus pain and I didn't know what it was (if I know how it worked I would've never taken it).  Well I took it for about 3 weeks and then once I stopped I started getting very extrememly bad panik attacks and GAD that lasted all day every day, and I was not sleeping well.  So I went to my doctor and he said I should go back on an SSRI and I started Lexapro and I started to get a racing heart rate high bp so I quit after 4 days.  I went back to my doctor and he said I should try to continue taking the lexapro so I took it for one more day and that night I went to the emergency room from a panik attack heart rate 178 for around 45 minutes and it finally subsided.  The emergency room doc told me to quit taking lex and gave me adavan to used in emergecies.  Well after that everything just got even worse.  Not sleeping taking .5mg adavan in the morning and the same at night for about 10 days.  So finally I went to a psyciatrist and he said I want you on effexor and I needed help so I was willing to try anything.  Well I slowly stopped taking the adavan and started taking the effexor and it made my heart go crazy and I felt like I was on crack, but my psyciatrist told me there was going to be treatment emergent episodes with this medication that would go away in a couple weeks.  Well its been 4 weeks now on 75mg effexor and Im finally sleeping like 4 or 5 hours a night so I don't want to mess with the dosage but my heart is still racing all the time 115 to 120 all day and even at night, and I have a tightness in my upper chest and adams apple.  I am feeling very weak and during the night is the worst, when I wake up in the middle of the night every night my heart is racing and I feel like Im shaking, but that doesnt really happen during the day......My doc says just keep with it and actually wants me to start taking zyprexa because I cant sleep.....I mean all I have is a racing heart and anxiety and it feels like this medication is slowly killing me, like one day my heart is just going to say Ive had enough.  When do I try something else??  And what??  Any help would be tremendous.... thx ryan\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ryan 1402  Since you are having anxiety along with increased heart rate including palpitations, it might be very helpful in your case to use beta blocker along with your anti-anxiety med.  beta blocker is a drug usually prescribed to treat blood pressure and control heart rate. However, physicians have used it in panic attacks and anxiety to help control the sudden increase in heart rate.  If you have no contraindications to the use of beta blocker, including , but not limited to some heart problems and asthma, you might benefit from the addition of a beta blocker like atenolol, a very low dose, plus your anti-anxiety med.  I hope you feel better, thank you very much\n\n",

If you are not on antidpressants and you are feeling blue more than a couple of weeks, you need to speak to your doctor about treatment.  If you have been on an antidepressant for 3-4 weeks and are not feeling any better, it would be best to let your doctor know as that you may need a medication adjustment.  Different medications, different doses work different on different people.  Hope this helps answer your questions. I hope that you are feeling better soon.  MaryAnn RN\n\n",

Her partner suffers from manic depression and take llithium to control it, approx 6 months ago he was also given diazipam and now he is very low, talking of killing himself etc. he is in his late 30's so he understands his manic depression, and knows what the low of that feels like and he felt that its was the diazipam making him feel worse. he does not trust the doctors as his father was also a manic depressant killed himself when he was 48 and didnt get much help or support. my friends partner is convinced he is going to die when hes 48 or before like his father.  He started cutting his diazipam down on his own, and then just stopped taking it completely as he really had it stuck in his head that it was wrong for him, hes now been given beta blockers which arent really making him feel any better. it is getting so bad, he wont go to see a doctor, and my friend is trying to cope with it all and i think she is starting to get depressed herself.  could this awful low be after effects of the diazipam (which he stoped taking about 8 weeks ago) or the beta-blockers hes on now? is so how long will it be untill hes feeling better. i did read somewhere that lithium and diazipam do not go well together, and that you should only be on it for short periods, not 6months!  have you any advise for me? Thank you for your time\n\n",

Insomnia or drowsiness are both a couple of the side effects of Effexor as is most of the SSRI's, ie, Paxil, Zoloft, Celexa, etc. This is probably the reason the physician didn't state which one had the least \"sleep disturbance\" affect. My question for you, if you were doing well on the Paxil, why was it changed to Effexor? If you physician advises a change in medications, remember that it is suggested when discontinuing Effexor, taper therapy is advised. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I was most likely depressed as well, listless, bored and in that general \"waiting for my life to begin\" mode that many of us unfortunately encounter at one time or another. I've decided to slowly reduce my dose of zoloft, until i will no longer be taking it at all. despite it's potential help, ANY kind of medication that is supposed to HELP stabilize emotions without changing WHO you are and how you look at the world...the withdrawl symptoms are fierce and frightening. i'm slowly lowering my dosage, very slowly, to avoid the increasing feeling of pre- head rush (the only way i can explain it). even if zoloft helps in the short term, i cant help but think fresh air may have helped me more. i feel good now, in my life, in general...with lows like everyone else...but now getting off zoloft after being on it for less than a year proves harder to deal with than the issues that attracted me to it to begin with. only you know what is good for you as far as meds go, and i know it's hard to deal with day to day life sometimes...but please research things extensively prior to becoming commited. i wish i had.  good luck to you everyone!\n\n",

Each are meant to be once a day dosing.  In other words, generic 10mg will have the same effect as Paxil CR 12.5mg and generic 20mg will have the same effect as Paxil CR 25mg.  (BIG money difference.)  But continue reading as there ARE differences in their pharmacology.  What I find interesting is that the half-life of Paxil CR is reported by GSK as being 15 to 20 hours.  The half-life of Paxil (paroxetine immediate release) is approximately 21 hours, which calculates out to the CR taking longer to get into the system, but leaving the system within the same time period.  So yes, you could be feeling a slight bit of \"withdrawal\" (for a short bit of time) because there was anywhere from 1 to 5 hours before the controlled release Paxil actually made it into your system.  This wil pass and probably has already since your posting.  If these feelings continue, be sure to contact your physician.  You may also want to discuss with your doctor the possibility of going back to the immediate release since there is no signfiicant difference in the two formulations.  Ask him to refer to his Physician's Desk Reference, gsk.com or Medline to verify this information.\n\n",

    "title": "Paxil Vs. Paxil CR",
    "content": "I am a 44 year old woman. I began taking paxil in March 1997 about 20mg. It was increased to 40mg after I was on the diet drug redux for a month and abruptly stopped. This caused me to become very depressed. My doctor then increase my Paxil to 40mg... problem solve. After the death of my mother and a chain of many unfortuante events I was increased to 60mg. NOTE: I was seeing a therapist the entire time at it was at her suggestion that I consider medication to help manage my panic and depression. Anyway with the increase to 60mg. I really felt much better. I gained fifty pounds ballooning to almost 280lbs. I was lucky enough to join a martial arts class (given by a family member) which with the level of meds I was on really put me on the road to successful recovery from depression and panic. the combination of the intense exercise and medication enable me to not only loose close to 80lbs, but I stopped going to therapy.  The martial arts school closed down but I continued to exercise and feel pretty good. Until....I was switched to paxil CR 75mg September 1 2005. Ever since then I have been on a steady decline. Could find the energy or desire to work out, gained 30 pounds, feelings of depression and a general \"i don't care attitude toward everything\" I went to the doctor she increased my dose to 100mg of paxil cr. Honestly it seems like every day I experience a new symptom. I am have thoughts of suicide. Which I don't want. I don't want to hurt myself but the thoughts keep poping into my mind. Today I felt numbness in some of my fingers on my left hand and I must constantly keep my leg shaking. (this is a symptom I experienced when I start paxil in 1997) I can tolerate this sympotom it just seems like everything is going down hill. I am taking the brand name because GSK is providing me my meds free of charges because I have not health insurance and have an very hard time paying for the meds myself. I was on the generic paxil when I have health insurance and it seemed to work okay. I don't know what to do. Also I experienced visual trails...this did not happen to me until last year   after being on paxil for almost 10 years. Where can I go for answers. Ultimately I will make the decision jointly with my doctor...but I just wonder if anyone else has had this experience and how they handeled it.  Thanks and sorry for the long post.\n\n",

Is there anything I can tell him about mixing scotch (which I know he needs to stop drinking) with his effexor? I am looking for an article or study that details what happens to a person that mixes these two drugs. He is like Jekyll and Hyde and I don't know where to start.

In your husband's case, psychotherapy and emotional support might help in this case, because as i said, there is no documented interaction between effexor and alcohol.   Try to encourage him to abstain drinking as much as you can.  Thank you very much, and my best wishes to you both.\n\n",

One bottle of Scotch would definitely exceed that statement.  This needs to be discussed with the prescribing physician.  Some AD's create an urge for alcohol in some patients, aversions to others.  AD's and alcohol both compromise the liver and this definitely has to be addressed before permanent damage appears or is worsened.  Good luck to both of you!\n\n",

I have been on a desperate mission to get answers for my hubby..brief history...He is disabled and has not worked in a few years..He is an admitted alcoholic who has asked docs to put him on something to help him stop,but they never do. I did research on alcoholism and found he has severe syptoms such as even the jaundice color. They had him on anti-depressents because of the chronic pain..but now we don't believe he had depression...but that one was no bother to him accept the sexual side affects. so, a new doc put him on wellbutrin...and I don't know how they missed the obvious alcoholism...but any way when he started them he was drinking vodka everyday...about the second or third night he got very mean....talking weird like saying something and changing it a min later and not remembering...cried.....and....even cut him self twice.....that was followed everyday by mood swings small....but after about 7 to 10 days of being on it....he quit...just stopped it....but kept drinking all day....about 7 days later, and he wasnt drinking much that day.....he REALLY got crazy....MEAN....saying things so mean he had NEVER said before....and when I didnt argue back....it made it worse....his rage was to the extreme scarey. I want to add....as much as he has EVER drank in his life...he has NEVER acted like those ways and YES...we are VERY VERY much inlove and get along TERRIFIC!! could the sudden stop of wellbutrin and alcohol have caused this and drinking when he first started?

Be aware that even after you have completely tapered off of the medication your symptoms you originally began taking the medication for will still be there.

Well, im having all the usual symptoms, but, i have developed a very bad temper.  I used to have a bad temper years and years ago but thats not how i am anymore, at least i wasnt.  I get mad so easy, i cant tolerate anyone or anything, i snap at everyone, hit doors, throw things, i cry all the time, ive only been off my effexor for 2 weeks.  I don't like the way i feel.  I can feel the anger inside and i don't like it.  I told the doc today that i was crying alot, and how i went off on several people.  He told me wait 2 more weeks then he might up the welbutrin.

    "content": "Discontinuation symptoms (withdrawal) are recognized with tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, SSRIs, and various other antidepressants, including venlafaxine (Effexor) and mirtazapine.[1]  It is not known how many people experience withdrawal syndrome as clinical trials examining this issue are lacking and limited to only trials that are either small or of short duration[2]or to anecdotal reports.  The symptoms observed following SSRI discontinuation can either be physical or psychological and are often grouped into the following categories:  1. Disequilibrium (e.g., dizziness, vertigo, ataxia) 2. Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, vomiting) 3. Influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fatigue, lethargy, myalgia) 4. Sensory disturbance (e.g., paresthesia) 5. Sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, vivid dreams) 6. Psychiatric disturbance (e.g., anxiety, agitation, confusion).[3,4]  So in your case it could be a withdrawal reaction from Venlafaxine (Effexor) or a manifestation of your depression. The latter will benefit from increasing the dose of Bupropion (Wellbutrin) to 300 mg a day.  Most withdrawal reactions are mild and transient, usually occurring within 1\u20133 days (up to 1 week) after stopping the medication and lasting 7\u201314 days, but occasionally the symptoms last for several weeks.[1,3] However, some reactions can be severe and may require acute treatment.[3]  General strategies to prevent and manage symptoms associated with the discontinuation of SSRIs include a gradual tapering of the dose when discontinuing treatment with any SSRI except for fluoxetine (Prozac).[4] If withdrawal reactions occur while tapering or at the end of treatment, it may be necessary to increase the dose and initiate a slower rate of taper.[1,5] Some authors suggest switching to fluoxetine (Prozac) if symptoms are severe and the patient is unable to discontinue the SSRI despite tapering.[1,4,6]   Keep your doctor informed should anything new arise.

Withdrawal symptoms have been shown in studies to occur in approximately 75% of patients, but keep in mind that not all of these patients have severe, debilitating withdrawal.

    "content": "Both cause weight gain and both cause loss of libido.  Paxil is an SSRI and Effexor is an SNRI, which means that Paxil affect one set of receptors and Effexor affects two different sets of receptors.  Paxil and Effexor are considered to be the two worst when it comes to side effects and withdrawal, or what the companies now call \"discontinuance syndrome,\"  which has been reported to affect 68% of patients.  No, you cannot stop Paxil and just switch to Effexor.  Neither of these medications CURE depression or anxiety.  You have to be finding other ways to deal with your symptoms while on these medications so you can eventually come off.  They both can have long-term effects on your liver and other parts of the body.  Glaxo just put out a press release warning about birth defects in children when the mother was taking Paxil during pregnancy.  Withdrawal of both medications can be debilitating.    Every person reacts differently to every medication, so you may not have any of the problems.  But please do your research into both medications and discuss possiblities with your physician.  There are a wide range of medications out there and you must start trying to resolve your depression/anxiety in other ways.  Trust me.  No matter how well they work for you, you do NOT want to be on them the rest of your life.  Wellbutrin and Lexapro are other options.  Lexapro is another SSRI, but so far has not shown the severity of side effects as Paxil.  Wellbutrin is not in this category of medications, but some have had success with it.  No matter what medication your physician tries, there will be horror stories somewhere.  You and your physician just have to find the one that is best for you and is the least dangerous.  I apologize for the long response, but this is the area that I specialize in.  Please do your research and discuss any and all questions with your physician.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have tried a variety of antideppresants for panic disorder,social and anxiety related problems I have been taking paxil cr for 9 days and feel more withdrawn,very tired finding it difficult to do the everyday things I need to do. I know I havent been on it very long but I just don't like how its making me feel not to mention I can't sleep on it and I take it first thing in the morning. I think I need an energy booster for more motivation and lift my spirts can anyone give me info on wellbutrin and how it works if it is good for my symptoms and does anyone know the side effects related to it? I was previously on effexorxr for around 10 monthes and had horrible effects coming off will discontinuing the paxil cr after 9 days give me any bad effects? thanks\n\n",

For anyone who is stil curious about this question, being on a medication for this short amount of time should not render extreme withdrawal symptoms.  When you begin a medication and experience symptoms, there is a problem.  There medications usually have NO effect for 2 week to up to 2 months.  If you are having reactions this quickly, then something is not being metabolized correctly and should be investigated immediately.\n\n",

Discontinuation symptoms (withdrawal) are recognized with tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, SSRIs, and various other antidepressants, including venlafaxine (Effexor) and mirtazapine.[1] The World Health Organization asserts that SSRI and SSRNI antidepressants cause dependence and that discontinuation symptoms can be troublesome and persist not withstanding taper therapy.[2]  General strategies to prevent and manage symptoms associated with the discontinuation of SSRIs include a gradual tapering of the dose when discontinuing treatment with any SSRI except for fluoxetine (Prozac).[3] If withdrawal reactions occur while tapering or at the end of treatment, it may be necessary to increase the dose and initiate a slower rate of taper.[2]   Some authors suggest switching to fluoxetine (Prozac) if symptoms are severe and the patient is unable to discontinue the SSRI despite tapering.[2,3,4] For paroxetine (Paxil), some suggest reducing the dose by 5 mg/d at weekly intervals to below the initial minimum therapeutic dose.[5]  References ========== 1.

    "title": "Effexor, withdrawal after short term use?",
    "content": "Hi folks, My history:  At the advice of my therapist I started taking effexor about three weeks ago.  At the same time I started the meds I also resolved a huge issue in my life.  I believe my \"depression\" was situational and might not have needed the Effexor.  After reading about the withdrawal issues, and dealing with significant side effects (nausea, be tired all the time, terrible impact on sexual functioning, dry mouth, rubber legs, etc) I've decided to discontinue the meds.  I had started at 37.5 for four days, upped it to 75 (which, after a couple of days, the point I started feeling terrible).  My plan (which I started today) is to go back to the 37.5 for about 4 days and then discontinue altogether.  My question:  Since I have been taking a fairly small dose for such a short period of time, am I unlikely to experience the withdrawal?  And..Does anyone else have any suggestions given this time/dosage combination?  For those of you that have struggled with this, you have my sympathy and best wishes.  For those that haven't started taking effexor, do your homework first!  Thanks in advance.  Bob\n\n",

I suffer IBS so an anti depressant that is body friendly as you can see is of very importance to me. One that has the least symptoms and won't damage my lungs any further, or flare the IBS but help with the anxiety and the pain. Any ideas that I could discuss with my doctor would sure be appreciated. PS I can not handle stimulating products of any kind which Wellbutrin was a stimulating one which I declined due to weight loss indications. I have already lost 41 pounds and can not afford to lose more weight. Thanks Mystify\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Unfortunately, antidepressants like any other medication, have side effects.  Antidepressant medications have been grouped as follows:  1. Tricyclic antidepressant medications 2. SSRIs, which include fluoxetine (Prozac), sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine (Paxil), fluvoxamine, and citalopram (Celexa) 3. Other antidepressant medications, including bupropion (Wellbutrin), nefazodone (Serzone), trazodone, venlafaxine (Effexor), mirtazapine 4. MAOIs, which include phenelzine, tranylcypromine, and isocarboxazid  The effectiveness of antidepressant medications is generally comparable between classes and within classes of medications. Therefore, the initial selection of an antidepressant medication will largely be based on the anticipated side effects, the safety or tolerability of these side effects for individual patients, patient preference, quantity and quality of clinical trial data regarding the medication, and its cost.[1] On the basis of these considerations, the following medications are likely to be optimal for most patients: selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), desipramine, nortriptyline, bupropion, and venlafaxine. In general, monoamine oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) should be restricted to patients who do not respond to other treatments because of their potential for serious side effects and the necessity of dietary restrictions.  Tricyclic antidepressants are known to have anticholinergic side effects which may include constipation and urinary hesitancy.   On the other hand, tricyclic antidepressants, mirtazapine, nafazodone and SSRIs have the potential to cause weight gain, especially if used for more than 6 months. In general, bupropion (Wellbutrin) is more likely to cause weight loss, and for long-term therapy it is less likely than SSRIs to cause weight gain.   Paroxetine (Paxil) as well as Venlafaxine (Effexor) are FDA approved for treatment of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD). However, Paxil has been associated with higher reports of withdrawal syndrome due to its shorter half life.   Finally, let me stress that for some people antidepressants work very well while others do not tolerate them, with some reporting alarming side effects.  Unfortunately, I am in no position to assess your case or to recommend which course of therapy to take. However, I hope that I have at least given you some information which will be useful to you when you discuss your options with your doctor.  Best regards.   References: ========== 1.

    "content": "Hello, My 14 year old son has been having chest pains for about 3 weeks.  All medical test are neg.  He began having pains up his back that feels like electric shock as he explains.  We went back to the ER.  All test still normal.  They advised us to seek physcological help because they feel he has conversion disorder.  He is in a day program to work on this.  I do see when he gets upset that his pain intensifies, but I also see when he is watching tv or playing on the computer he still has them.  He has been in the program for 2 weeks and every time he sees the doctor he comes home wanting to go on Prozac.  My son says he ask the doctor how can he cope with the pain, and the doctor has said deep breathing is the best thing to try to over come the pain, or If  you want I can put you on Prozac, just talk to you parents.  I understand my son wants the pain to go away, but to tell a 14 year if you want I can put you on Prozac with out the doctor talking to the parents first is a little alarming to me. Any help or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, General strategies to prevent and manage symptoms associated with withdrawal of SSRIs include a gradual tapering of the dose when discontinuing treatment with any SSRI except for fluoxetine (Prozac).[1] If withdrawal reactions occur while tapering or at the end of treatment, it may be necessary to increase the dose and initiate a slower rate of taper.[2,3] Some authors suggest switching to fluoxetine (Prozac) if symptoms are severe and the patient is unable to discontinue the SSRI despite tapering.[1,2,4] For paroxetine (Paxil), some suggest reducing the dose by 5 mg/d at weekly intervals to below the initial minimum therapeutic dose.[5]  Recommendations for patients: Work closely with a doctor. Think of your doctor as your partner in healing. Don\u2019t go off medication without medical supervision.   Taper the medication. Experts agree that the best way to avoid withdawal side effects is to wean off the medication. By reducing the dosage in small increments, the brain can gradually adjust to the change in chemical balance and slowly adapt to living without the drug. For some people, experts say, this process may take up to a year.  Get psychotherapy. While drugs can often cover up problems, therapy can help uncover and address the underlying causes. Cognitive behavioral treatment, for example, can work to change maladaptive behavior, bring out stifled emotions and provide you with the tools for dealing with future issues. In fact, extensive clinical research has shown that for some conditions, psychotherapy is superior to medication in the long run.   Time it right. It is best to go off medication when any external factors that may have led to depression or a panic attack are resolved or at least under your control. It may be beneficial to go off medication when not undergoing a major life change or enduring stress.  Exercise. Study after study provides strong evidence that exercise plays a major role in lifting mood, boosting energy, improving immune function, reducing stress, anxiety and insomnia, increasing sex drive and elevating self-esteem.   Eat a healthy, balanced diet. Consider consulting a nutritionist who can suggest foods that will positively impact mood, energy level or help treat (or at least not worsen) any other conditions.  Get your hormone systems tested. Treatable hormone imbalances like an underactive thyroid or deficiencies of amino acids and minerals can rob you of energy, sexual vitality and feelings of well-being.  Consider vitamin supplements. Some patients have successfully come off Effexor, for example, by taking 25-50 mg. of Vitamin B6 daily. However, there is no evidence for this technique and excessive doses on a prolonged basis can be toxic.   Turn to friends and family. It has also been suggested to make use of community resources such as church or support groups.  Please consult your doctor immediately.  References ========= 1. Macdonald L.

Rrisperidone is a psychotropic agent belonging to the chemical class of benzisoxazole derivatives. Pacitane (Selegiline) is indicated in the treatment of Parkinson's disease. It is very dangerous to decrease these medicines on your own. Decreasing the dosage of Daxid for example may be associated with withdrawal symptoms. You are strongly recommended to contact your doctor so that s/he may advise you which medicines can be weaned and which should not be stopped.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Discontinuing Effexor XR, how to?",
    "content": "Hello, I'm writing to hopefully gain some insight into HOW I am to discontinue my antidepressant without completely losing control and sending myself into the psych ward. I currently take 75mg/1x day of Effexor XR. I've been consuming this medication for about 2 1/2 years.  The benefits to this drug are nothing shy of miraculous.  I've never felt so incredibly confident, ambitious, happy, energetic, etc in all of my life.  Had it not been for this drug, I really don't know what I would have done to combat my depression. My depression was so bad that I was sleeping all day, not eating, lost interest in practically everything that made me happy, and was suicidal.  Now, as far as the side effects associated with discontinuing this medication? That's an ENITRELY different story. THOSE effects are nothing short of pure HELL here on earth. I know based on experience, and based on reading the experiences of others involved.  I miss ONE day and I\"m all over the place: Lethargic, nauseated, vomitting, 'spacey', TIRED, irritable, forgetful, etc. You name any side effect associated with withdrawal symptoms and I have them.  The share fact that missing ONE dose can have such a profound impact on my mental and physical well being scares the hell out of me.  HOW can I discontinue this medications safely with minimal side effects?  I've read a LOT of posts where people have removed the beads from their medication tablets. Is this effective?  I am so scared to do this and would appreciate any help and/or advice anyone can offer me.  I don't want to be reliant upon one medication for the rest of my life and I'm fearful that I will have to in order to spare my sanity and physcial capacity.  Has anyone had success with their own 'regime' for discontinuation? Success in going from 75mg a day? Do you have to take something else, like prozac, to help combat the withdrawals? Please help.  Sincerely, Danielle\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor XR",
    "content": "I was put on Effexor XR in March 2004, with the dose being increased over a period of months to 225 mg (75 mg - 3 times a day).The Effexor never had significant affect on my mood (with the exception of some initial side effects), and I had told my doctor this, but he kept insisting that I remain on the medication.  I stayed on, but with his agreement reduced the dose to 150 mg (75 mg twice a day), as there was really no difference between the 225 mg dose and the 150 mg dose.  The doctor has finally agreed to try a different medication (my preference was to try something natural like Sam-e before another medication that could cause side effects).  However, I will be switched to Celexa, after reducing my dose of Effexor XR to 75 mg for a week.  I am quite nervous because I have read so many horror stories about the withdrawal symptoms.  My questions are:  1)  Could my withdrawal symptoms be less severe because of my split dose?  2)  If I do experience bothersome or unbearable withdrawal symptoms, could supplementing with 500 mg of L-Tyrosine or another natural product (vitamins/amino acids) potentially reduce the withdrawal symptoms?  3)  Are there any withdrawal symptoms when a person stops using L-Tyrosine?  (I had used L-Tyrosine recently for about two weeks with my doctor's agreement, to increase my energy and motivation (starting with 500 mg, three times a day, reducing to 500 mg, twice a day and then 500 mg, once a day).  I stopped taking the supplements when I found my self becoming hyper and have now found myself going through a period of anxiety and apprehensiveness, lack of appetite and nausea.  I look forward to your response.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Discontinuation symptoms have been evaluated in patients taking venlafaxine. Abrupt discontinuation or dose reduction of venlafaxine at various doses has been found to be associated with the appearance of withdrawal symptoms, the frequency of which increased with increased dose level and with longer duration of treatment.   Withdrawal symptoms include agitation, anorexia, anxiety, headaches, hypomania, insomnia, nausea, nervousness, nightmares, confusion, coordination impaired, diarrhea, dizziness, dry mouth, dysphoric mood, fasciculation, fatigue, sensory disturbances, somnolence, sweating, tremor, vertigo, and vomiting.  If intolerable symptoms occur following a decrease in the dose or upon discontinuation of treatment, then resuming the previous dose with subsequent decrease in dose but at a more gradual rate.  The reason you didn't experience these side effects is because your dose was tapered. I don't think in your case you will benefit much from L-Tyrosine or other natural vitamins in the sense of treating withdrawal symptoms. I don't think the symptoms you are complaining from now are withdrawal symptoms you should however, consult your psychiatrist about your new symptoms as you may need to modify your dose of Celexa.

At 225 milligrams I developed Lavator Syndrome (sydrome not diagnosed by anal/rectal specialist until 300 millligram dosage).  Neither doctor would link Effexor to Lavator Syndrome.  Lavator Syndrome became debilitating: defficult to get up from sideways or tommy position in bed, could not drive a car.  On my own, against two separate pharmacist, I eliminated Effexor XR from my regime of pills (I eliminated each type of pills one by one to isolate Effexor).  I eliminated Effexor in 75 milligram steps spread over 4 to 5 day increments.  Lavator sysdrome deminished!   I still suffered from very mild withdrawals from Effexor two weeks later.  I still suffered mild and sporatic pain from Lavator sysdrome.  Psychiatrist and specialist say Effexor had nothing to do with it.  My wife accidentally put Effexor 75 milligram capsules in my pill caddy last week.  I took Effexor for four days by accident.  Levator came back in a rage and withdrawal sysmtoms came back strong from Effexor.  Once Lavator Syndrome starts will it be a permanent problem?  How long before these withdral effects from both disorders (Effexor withdrawal and Lavator Sydrome) are mostly gone?\n\n",

Good detective work on what was causing you intestinal problems on your part.  I can't give an answer as to how long it will take for you to get over the latest symptoms or the withdrawal.  I'm sorry that there is no definite information on that.  Withdrawal and recovery have their own timelines with each individual person.  Hang in there.

I have gone cold turkey off of 150 MG a day.  My last pill was on Sunday, November 27 and my week has been brutal.    Sonic Booms in my right ear, brain zaps everytime I move my eyes more than an inch, nausia, diarreah, and constant dizzyness.     I am POSITIVE in the next little while we will see the lawyers ads on TV with the headlining question \"Are you taking EFFEXOR...\"  Life on this drug was not life. And as much as I have been more emotional over the last week, I can tell you, at least I am me... my body feels again like my own, and I have excitement back - excitement over Christmas, seeing my puppy at the end of the day, going shopping. It is amazing what drugs can take away from you.  I say to anyone, DO THE WITHDRAWL - in the long run it is worth it.  This drug to me is no better then some dirty drug you can get on the side of the road - hey, they are all addictive right? Cant get off them right? But they make you feel good while you are on them.    What evil our doctors push forth!\n\n",

I decided to go off Effexor because that along with Metformin were keeping me running to the bathroom constantly. I was diagnosed with Type 2 Diabetes about a year ago, after gaining some wight due to the Effexor. I am now on Wellbutrin- still having side effects from Effexor withdrawal-it's been about 2-3 weeks. And I've switched from Metformin to Avandia8. My question is if there is any way the Effexor could have cause my diabtes.  There is no diabetes in my family, and I actually had Hypoglycemia since childhood, and still have episodes of that occasionally. I am 50 years old- was in pretty good shape before all of this happened. Now I just feel unwell all the time. I'm wondering if going off of the effexor may help with my blood sugar.    Thanks.\n\n",

You may want to discuss the possibility of this with your physician. If your blood sugar levels would return to normal then I would definitely consider a link.  Many factors play a role in Diabetes. Obesity/ being overweight, lack of exercise, insulin resistence, the inability of the pancreas to produce enough insulin to work effectively, etc. Keep in mind that It is possible that the Diabetes existed and was previously undiagnosed.

If you experience dizziness or drowsiness, avoid these activities.  Dizziness may be more likely to occur when you rise from a sitting or lying position. Rise slowly to prevent dizziness and a possible fall.  You should inform your doctor about this if you are still experiencing it the next day.

SSRIs are not likely to cause weight gain if used for 6 months or less.  Opinions vary as to whether they cause weight gain when used for 1 year or longer. Paroxetine (Paxil) may be more likely than other SSRIs to cause weight gain.[2]  In its revised practice guideline for the treatment of major depressive disorder,[1] the American Psychiatric Association acknowledges that the literature differs as to whether patients taking SSRIs beyond the acute phase experience weight gain as a medication side effect.[1]   Fighting weight gain once it has occurred can be very difficult, and it is advisable to consider the likelihood and potential consequences of weight gain when choosing an antidepressant.[2,3] It has been found that adding low-dose bupropion (Wellbutrin) (100 to 150 mg/day) or topiramate (25 to 50 mg/day) may help weight loss when used in addition to diet control and exercise.[4] In general, bupropion (Wellbutrin) is more likely to cause weight loss.

This resulted in her losing custody of her children in her divorce and since is unable to get them back.  My sister is a terrific mother.

Currently, the American Psychiatric Association has the following to say about lithium monitoring.  \"The clinical status of patients receiving lithium needs to be monitored especially closely. The frequency of monitoring depends on the individual patient's clinical situation but generally should be no less than every 6 months for stable patients. The optimal frequency of serum level monitoring in an individual patient depends on the stability of lithium levels over time for that patient and the degree to which the patient can be relied upon to notice and report symptoms.\"  You can find this is stated on their website.

Today I am starting effexor,  I was previously on Lexapro (She's taking me off due to the side effects, i.e. Night Sweats, Mania, unable to orgasm etc.)  My doctor has me taking half of my lexapro while starting the \"Starter Pack\" Effexor.

    "content": "Hello, I hope your therapy is going well for you now. Please let us know.  To answer your question: Sometimes stopping an antidepressant leads to what is known as a discontinuation (withdrawal) syndrome.  Discontinuation symptoms (withdrawal) are recognized with tricyclic antidepressants, MAOIs, SSRIs, and various other antidepressants, including venlafaxine and mirtazapine.[1]  The symptoms observed following SSRI discontinuation can either be physical or psychological and are often grouped into the following categories:  1. Disequilibrium (e.g., dizziness, vertigo, ataxia) 2. Gastrointestinal disturbances (e.g., nausea, vomiting) 3. Influenza-like symptoms (e.g., fatigue, lethargy, myalgia) 4. Sensory disturbance (e.g., paresthesia) 5. Sleep disorder (e.g., insomnia, vivid dreams) 6. Psychiatric disturbance (e.g., anxiety, agitation, confusion).[2,3]  Most withdrawal reactions are mild and transient, usually occurring within 1\u20133 days (up to 1 week) after stopping the medication and lasting 7\u201314 days, but occasionally the symptoms last for several weeks.[1,2] However, some reactions can be severe and may require acute treatment.[2]  All antidepressants do not have the same type or severity of withdrawal symptoms. In studies comparing fluoxetine, sertraline,  paroxetine, and citalopram, withdrawal from paroxetine was shown to cause more severe symptoms that may occur more quickly, even after the second missed dose [4-7]. Because of its long half-life, fluoxetine may have the least severe symptoms.[1,8]  Let me add to this by saying that the half life of Lexapro is within the range of 27-32 hours, so you may experience some of these symptoms.  It is not known how many people experience withdrawal syndrome as clinical trials examining this issue are lacking and limited to only trials of short duration or to anecdotal reports. Some people do well and do not experience any symptoms, hopefully that will include you.  Regarding Effexor XR the most common side effects include nausea, dizziness, insomnia, somnolence, and dry mouth. Anticholinergic side effects are significantly less severe. Sexual side effects are similar to side effects caused by SSRIs.  Effexor XR should be administered in a single dose with food either in the morning or in the evening at approximately the same time each day. Each capsule should be swallowed whole with fluid and not divided, crushed, chewed, or placed in water, or it may be administered by carefully opening the capsule and sprinkling the entire contents on a spoonful of applesauce. This drug/food mixture should be swallowed immediately without chewing and followed with a glass of water to ensure complete swallowing of the pellets.   References: 1. Haddad PM.

    "content": "Although loss of erectile or ejaculatory function in men and loss of libido and anorgasmia in both sexes may be complications of virtually any antidepressant medication, these side effects appear to be more common with SSRIs. The psychiatrist should ascertain whether the sexual dysfunction is a result of the antidepressant medication or the underlying major depressive disorder. If sexual dysfunction is determined to be a side effect of the antidepressant medication, a variety of strategies are available, including continuing treatment to assess whether the dysfunction will disappear with time, lowering the dose, discontinuing the antidepressant, or substituting another antidepressant such as bupropion (Wellbutrin).[1] Specific pharmacologic treatments that can be added for arousal or erectile dysfunction include sildenafil, yohimbine, or neostigmine; specific medications that can be added for orgasm dysfunction include sildenafil, cyproheptadine, or amantadine.[2]  Yohimbine Hydrochloride (a constituent of the herbal remedy yohimbe) is a prescription drug. Yohimbine is the only FDA approved drug for impotence and it is derived from the same natural chemical. It is also known to have aphrodisiac effects.  References: 1.

    "content": "When your partner went into rehab or therapy for his drug problem, did you also have some type of therapy? After a person has been verbally and emotionally abused for a period of time, they often need help to regain their self-esteem and all the other parts of themselves they have lost or had altered. When an alcoholic or drug addict is \"using\" they are often abusive to their partner. They don't want to take the responsibility for their own actions and so they blame the person closest to them. They then go into therapy and hopefully they 'get better' as you said. The problem is that if you have not had therapy, you are left with all of the feelings of poor self-esteem, sadness, sometimes fear, and also depression. You need to see someone to help you through what you are feeling. Either contact your physician or a psychologist in your area who specializes in 'abused women'. You may feel that what you experienced was not abuse because perhaps your partner did not strike you. Emotional and verbal abuse are much more difficult sometimes to overcome than even physical abuse. Please seek help, even if you need to find a free clinic in your area.    I know how you feel and I know that therapy can help. Take Care and let me hear back from you.\n\n",

I am very glad that you do realize that your partner's therapy did nothing to help you.  :D  Going into therapy is pretty scary.  :?  You have to trust the therapist you are dealing with. You will be telling him/her a million things that you never thought that you would tell anyone. You need to be very honest with your therapist, no matter what. Whatever you tell them, can go no further than that room. No one will try to get the information, unless your partner is overly curious. You have no law that says that you need to tell ANYONE what goes on in your sessions.You may find out things that you may not think you want to know about yourself and your partner. Therapy is not easy by any means, but it certainly is well worth it.  :wink:  Learning to like yourself and having back the self-esteem that one needs to function on a daily basis is  more valuable than one realizes. You also want to feel good about yourself so that you can teach your child how to have a positive self image. I wish you luck and am here should you need another ear to listen. I have been where you are and I do understand. Take Care.  :)\n\n",

Usually these side effects show quickly after beginning the medication and usually do not go away while being treated, so it is unlikely but not impossible that your lack of libido is due to your medication after 4 years.  At your age, it is common to start losing libido and/or have erectile dysfunction.  These problems can have many causes including high blood pressure, certain medications for high blood pressure, diabetes, and decreasing production of testosterone.    I suggest you have a thorough physical and a total and free testosterone level done to rule out other possibilities.\n\n",

And my point that the FDA regulates medications and not herbs/vitamins, and that natural remedies are often very potent as well, still stands. I'm not saying that natural remedies are bad - I'm stating a fact. The more someone is informed, the better choices they can make for what works best for them.

    "content": "I was diagnosed as bi polar. I was placed on Lithium 300mg, zoloft 100mg, and zyprexa ??mg, and adavan ??mg.. I then was placed on weight loss meds phentermine 37.5 mg. I was also already on premarin 2.5 for my HRT and cephalexin 500mg for a staph infection from recent surgery. All of these meds were prescribed to me within a week of one another or less. After two months of being on all of these meds at the same time, and quite alot of repeated alcohol consumption, I supposedly \"attempted suicide\" by overdosing on Lithium. I had just taken an adavan following a really bad event. I did not try to attemp suicide, at least not knowingly. Is it possible these meds were never meant to be mixed??? My lithium levels were NEVER checked at any time. Did I have some kind of toxicity that caused my unconsiousness that seemed to look like a suicide attempt? I must add that in the medical report it states only high levels of \"acetamenophin\" in my system at time of hospitalization. If I was on too many meds, or incompatible meds, how can I prove it? As I stated in another post, I do not even think I was ever bi polar. Is maybe what happened to me simply because I didnt need most of the meds to begin with?\n\n",

I had no problems prior to all of these events. I did not drink, take any drugs of any kind.

The problem I am experiencing is that since I have come off the Zoloft, I have not been able to have an orgasm. I ejaculate, but there is no feeling with it like there used to be.

    "content": "This is withdrawal you are experiencing.  There is no set time schedule on how long these symptoms will last, anywhere from weeks to months.  If at all possible, get to a physician and see if you can get a minimal dose prescription to get you through withdrawal.  I say minimal because the dose can always be adjusted up a little if needed, but would be more difficult to adjust down from the higher dose.  I was on Paxil CR 25mg for 6 months, went cold turkey for 12 days, learned about withdrawal and proper tapering and luckily found some samples of the 12.5mg CR in my cabinet.  Within hours after taking one tablet the withdrawal symptoms subsided.  I was then able to taper from 12.5mg to 2.5mg in 10 days with little trouble.  You have made it through quite a time span without any medication, so it is very possible that the minimal dose may be enough to get you back to functioning and you can taper down from that point.  Again, Omega-3 and magnesium have been recommended by several people I have learned from.    And just one last note to everyone reading, from everything I have learned through reading, talking, experiencing, or watching - Paxil & Effexor are the worst when it comes to withdrawal symptoms.  I originally heard this through a continuing education program through UC-SanDiego, and have continuously heard the same thing from almost every source with whom I've been in contact.    I know this is a lot of information and probably doesn't make total sense all at one time.  If you would like, ask specific questions and I will try to answer them one by one to the best of my knowledge.  You are not going crazy.  You are not alone.  And please let me know if there is no way that you can get in to see a physician, as the drug companies have programs set up to help supply medication for those who are in need.\n\n",

I feel like I am starting the vicious cycle that happened with previous meds, the ever increasing dose for + results.  I have been basically pretty pleased with my result in the last year but am worrisome now.  Is there another med that can be used in conjunction with Effexor XR for better results.  I know that recent events in my life have increased anxiety and stress levels but something has got to be better than how I feel now.  Look forward to your response.\n\n",

I am having problems with muscles contracting in my back and my hands swell and my knuckles have red caps on them.  This comes and goes.  It does not seem to have a pattern except that I cannot sit or stand for long periods of time without a lot of pain.    My doctors want to schedule a day of tests for MS.  I do not have any slurred speach or heavy limbs or balance problems other than the limp that I have with CP.    I went to my dad's doctor in Atlanta yesterday and he ran a ANA test, a sed rate and a RA test.  He emailed me that they were all normal.  He also did a lyme test.  If it were lyme, it would be a late lymes, since I have not felt well in a long time.  The results for the lyme test are not yet in.   I have read that lymes is very hard to diagnose and does mimic MS in many ways.  Can anyone help me?      MichaelO  windjammersetters.com\n\n",

MANAGEMENT: In general, the concomitant use of multiple serotonergic agents should be avoided if possible, or otherwise approached with caution if potential benefit is deemed to outweigh the risk. Close monitoring is recommended for signs and symptoms of excessive serotonergic activity such as CNS irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, myoclonus, ataxia, abdominal cramping, hyperpyrexia, shivering, pupillary dilation, diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia. Particular caution is advised when increasing the dosages of these agents.\n\n",

I found this post while searching, and am scared that others will read it and believe it, contrary to what you say:  This particular info was found on a docs webpage http://www.drbeckwith.com/Diet.php check it out.   >SSRI Needed  Phentermine by itself is only moderately effective in helping people to lose weight. When combined with an antidepressant drug in the SSRI category (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors), however, it is quite effective.   Various SSRI's  There are many antidepressants in the SSRI category. Prozac is just one of them. Others include Lexapro, Zoloft, Paxil, and Celexa. Phentermine works well in combination with any of these SSRI's.   How SSRI's Help Phentermine to Work  The antidepressant drugs help the Phentermine to work. The fact that they are antidepressants is irrelevant. There are many examples of drugs which can do more than one thing. SSRI's are just one example. The reason SSRI's help suppress appetite as well as treating depression is that serotonin is a brain chemical which affects both mood and appetite.\n\n",

However, because the literature includes this caution, pharmacists will often tell patients this, and scare them. Please be advised that this is not true.

In the one case series (32) in the medical literature regarding the efficacy of Phen-Pro in obese patients, the author reports that a total weight loss of 3645 kg in 557 patients over two years. No other data are available and thus the information is uninformative.   At this rate we're talking about 6.5kg/person or 14 pounds/person over a 2 year time span.  Hardly worth the potential adverse effects from either medication, in my opinion.  This method is totally off label and is NOT approved by the FDA in any manner.    Get in touch with your doctor about other methods of weight loss that can be monitored and won't affect so many systems in the body.\n\n",

The disorder is brought on by excessive levels of serotonin (a powerful vasoconstrictor).

    "content": "About 18 months ago a work collegue asked me if my left eye was okay, he said it was quite closed up and he thought I had something in there irritating it. I noticed myself that the pupil in my right eye is larger than the left pupil.  Since then more people have mentioned it and now I am trying to avoid eye contact with people. Whilst talking to someone I become very distressed and selfconscious, and then the facial flushing sets in. Its a nightmare!  I wouldn't mind so much if the flushing went away rapidly but it doesn't, it can hang about for hours.  Sometimes just the one ear will glow red or one cheek, even a left ear and a right cheek sometimes.  Anyway, what I'd like to know is: is the citalopram causing my weird eye situation?', and could it be causing the prolonged facial flushing too?\n\n",

An Important Myth About Phentermine and SSRI's Used in Combination The pharmaceutical literature contains one significant error. It states that Phentermine used in combination with an SSRI is dangerous, and can be fatal. This is completely incorrect. However, because the literature includes this caution, pharmacists will often tell patients this, and scare them. Please be advised that this is not true. This combination of medications is completely safe when used for the right patient. If, when you take your prescriptions to the pharmacy, the pharmacist has this concern, ask him or her to call and speak with your doctor about it.\n\n",

Is ther any truth to the medications causing a lack of motivation or energy due to my body having a problem metabolizing or dealing with the drug. Perhaps it's not \"too low a dose\" but actually too much drug for my body  to handle.   I know it is a low dose but could my body not be tolerating it welll and I  may be going through a SEROTONIN SYNDROME.????  I would like to rule this out, before my doctor's appt, if it is a myth, as someone I know keeps bringing it up.  Any input would be great Thanks again!!\n\n",

    "content": "The symptoms of the serotonin syndrome are: euphoria, drowsiness, sustained rapid eye movement, overreaction of the reflexes, rapid muscle contraction and relaxation in the ankle causing abnormal movements of the foot, clumsiness, restlessness, feeling drunk and dizzy, muscle contraction and relaxation in the jaw, sweating, intoxication, muscle twitching, rigidity, high body temperature, mental status changes were frequent (including confusion and hypomania - a \"happy drunk\" state), shivering, diarrhea, loss of consciousness and death.   It doesnt seem to match your symptoms of fatigue and lack of motivation, as well as the fact that it happens when two SSRIs are taken together or combined with MAO inhibitor or lithium. The tricyclic antidepressants, lithium, MAOIs, SSRIs, ECT (electric shock treatment), tryptophan, and the serotonin agonists (fenfluramine) all enhance serotonin neurotransmission and can contribute to this syndrome.  I think you can safely rule this out.\n\n",

    "content": "Celexa and Wellbutrin are two different types of antidepressants, and both have possible side effects of everything from fatigue to mania, depending on how a person metabolizes them.    I would assume that you are already on the antidepressant combination, so you already know what, if any, your reactions have been.  Your physician must know if you add cannibis (or want to add cannibis) to your regimen so that he/she will not misdiagnose a change in mood or other reaction you may have.  Adding cannibis can magnify any reactions.  Cannibis can increase the risk of seizures,  can bring on panic attacks, paranoia, can be a risk factor for schizophrenia, and can exacerbate depressive symptoms.  At the same time it could possibly bring on feelings of elation, or \"high\".  Be aware also that cannibis can cause irregular heart rhythm.  There are no direct studies available to me concerning the combination of these 3 specific medications.  Even if there were studies, there is still no guarantee that any specific person would have those reactions.  Keep in mind that the antidepressants can possibly cause weight gain...and cannibis is medically used to initiate weight gain.  In summary, there are no documented contraindications for the combinations of these 3 medications outside that each may exacerbate the reactions of the others or can exacerbate the reasons you are taking the antidepressants.    Again, be sure to discuss the possible reactions of each medication alone and in combinations with your physician.  Your medical history needs to be checked thoroughly for any significant risk factors.\n\n",

My family did not like the way the effexor changed my personality. I was told I was to carefree about situations and I found i started drinking alot of alcohol.I did visit my doctor and he wanted me to go back on the effexor there is no way I would ever take it again knowing how bad it can come back to bite you.. My questions are theese 1. Does antideppressants change who you are personality? 2. What is the most effective for anxiety/deppression/isolation(social situations) 3. one that does not cause weight gain? 4.does not have horrible withdrawl or sideeffects Thanks so much look forward to hearing someone..\n\n",

    "content": "1,  Antidepressants do not \"ultimately\" change your personality.  They numb your reactions and sensitivity to situations while you are on them.  Withdrawal tends to magnify your sensitivity to many situations and senses, including sensitivity to light, noise and touch.  Your personality will seem different while you are on the medication because you will not react with the same passion as you did off the medication.  Your personality with then amplify to beyond what it was before taking the medication as your brain is having to retrain itself how to handle the serotonin returning to the neurotransmitters.  This will, with tapering and patience, get better over time.  No matter what, YOU are still in there. 2.  There is no \"most effective\" for everyone except for training yourself to talk yourself through these situations, making yourself face the fears, and doing these things in baby steps so as not to overwhelm yourself.  Medications can help you at the beginning of training yourself to handle the situations that bother you, but these medications should not be used as a permanent crutch.  Alcoholism is an example of one crutch, chronic medication use is another.  There are several different methods, some which you can do with a therapist's help, some you can do on your own.  An example of one route you can try on your own is writing down the situations that intimidate you and then write down the worst-case scenario/s that could happen in each of these situations.  Then you can evaluate the best way for you to handle these situations, whether it be to removing yourself from the situation for safety or facing the challenge verbally with the strength you have gained thinking about the \"what ifs\".  Running away is not an option.  Walking away or standing up for yourself may be the best ways.  You'll have to decide for yourself. 3.  Any therapy not utilizing medication can decrease the likelihood of weight gain as long as you don't deal with the situations by binging or comfort eating.  Any medication has the possibility of weight gain with most, weight loss for some.   4.  The severeness of side effects and withdrawal symptoms can not be predicted for any medication for every patient.  There have been reports of severe side effects for all antidepressants, but not every patient has fallen victim to these either.    There are natural supplements that some people swear by, but again, not all supplements work for everyone and some people have reactions to these also.  Generally they are not as severe, but there is still a possibility.  I have never heard of anyone having withdrawal symptoms from the natural supplements, although that doesn't mean they don't exist.    Post again if there is something you want me to explain more clearly.  I wish you the best in whatever choice you make!\n\n",

I knew I would be best off reducing my dosage of my Zoloft gradually so knowing I had a full bottle (120 pills) I began cutting my dose by 50mg every week and a half.  I was down to 50mg and not doing to bad with the withdrawal effects but now that I have stopped completely (it\u2019s been almost 2 weeks) the side effects of stopping the meds are awful.  I am tired all of the time to the point of not functioning normally a lot of the time, I am dizzy all of the time, my face goes numb, I get this as I describe it \u201croller coaster\u201d feeling when I move my eyes.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I thought I would have been over it by now but it just seems to be getting worse.  What are the dangers of going off of Zoloft?  I though decreasing the dose would have avoided a withdrawal like this.  Is there anything I can do?  I appreciate any input anyone can give me.\n\n",

From withdrawal suggestions that have come out from the different anti-depressant companies lately, go back to that last step (or even half of that last dose you took to see if it works) and work you way down by 5 to 10mg to ease the discomfort.    You came a great distance getting to 50mg and that's something you should be VERY PROUD of!  If you need a little spritz to help with this final phase, it is not a failure.  Your body needs some help and you can take a part of the edge off for your comfort and safety.  BTW, try to refrain from being convinced to go on another anti-depressant to help with withdrawal.  They all have their own withdrawal experiences.  Work your way through this one with your physician's help and enjoy life when you've overcome the Zoloft!\n\n",

    "content": "okay so a month ago i had a miscarriage.  i have been completely a mess for this whole month.  i sleep all day, then wake up and don't eat until around 1 in the morning, and i stay awake until everyone in the house starts moving and i fall asleep.  i don't like to talk, or be around people.  i don't like to talk, and no one talks about it.  i don't like to be outside, or in large groups of people, or even my family.  my mood has changed DRAMATICALLY.  i was usually a very positive up beat person, but not i am either crying and extremely sad or really angry over little annoyances.  someone online told me to go to my doctor and ask about anti-depressants, that they helped her after she lost her baby.  does anyone have an opinion on this?  i don't kno what to do anymore.  i just cry and i even started cutting again.  anyones opinion will be greatly appreciated --Larissa\n\n",

    "content": "I, of course, would not suggest the anti-depressant route until all other options have been explored.  Talk therapy, group therapy (which will give you plenty of support from others who have actually gone through the same experience and can make new friendships that will last a lifetime).  Anti-depressants to do not \"cure\" the depression.  SSRI's and SNRI's only numb your reaction to situations, including situations of joy that you may miss out on.  Side effects can include sexual dysfunction and weight gain, along with many other possible (but more rare) side effects.  You may not have these side effects.  They can get you through a time of despair while you work on the cause of the despair in conjunction with the medication.  If you only take the medication and ignore the cause, the cause will still be there when/if you decide to come off of the medication.  Do as much research as you can on any medication that is a possiblity for you.  Ask your physician what your choices are in medications and therapy.  Before you take any medications (sample or before purchasing any medication), be sure to read the information pamphlets either online or provided by your physician.  The topics of particular interest will be contraindication, warnings and adverse effects.  There may be something in there that you have forgotten to mention to your physician pertaining to family history or something in your far past that may hinder your ability to tolerate a particular medication safely.  Also you will learn what to possibly expect when beginning and withdrawing from any medication.  And, as always, keep in close, regular contact with your physician with any option that you decide to go with.  Write down any and all question you may have about anything to ask your doctor...and then ASK THEM.  If something is a \"maybe\", be sure that you weigh those risks in your decision.  You will be the one that has to live with any side effects or withdrawal symptoms, therefore you should be in control and fully educated in what you are getting yourself into.  I am very sorry for your loss.  I can't imaging what you are going through and I wish you the best in overcoming your devastating loss.  Sending warm cyber hugs.\n\n",

It CAN be a good drug. the most alarming thing though, is that if your sister isnt competant to take it everyday, or often forgets, it can be dangerous. Inadvertantly mixing it with things can be dangerous. I would discuss with her doctor the problems relating to her inability to take it regularly. hope it helps\n\n",

If she is taking any aticoagulant (blood thinner), ibuprofen or aspirin, the bruising becomes even worse.  As far as the physician, see if you can set up an appointment yourself with him to discuss YOUR concerns.  Due to privacy issues he won't be able to tell you anything that he has in his files, but you can let him know everything that he may not know such as how all of this is truly affecting her daily life.  If she is only seeing him once a month, she may be putting on a great show in his presence without him having a clue how her outside life is actually playing out.  Good luck to all of you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm going to try and make this brief....any answers will be appreciated and followed up with a reply.  My girlfriend is 23.  She's been taking Zoloft for 2 years first starting with 25mg then 50mg, and as of 3 months ago 100mg.  It was originally prescribed to her for helping with her OCD and fear of blood.  As of 2-3 weeks ago, she has been trying to ween herself off because she's been having some very extreme panic attacks and nausea.  After missing too many days of work, they've fired her.  She seems to be going through severe withdrawals....and for some reason, when she decides to take Zoloft, she doubles the 100mg dosage to 200mg's.  When she does this, she can't even look me straight in the eyes.  It's almost like she takes on a different personality.  She doesn't quite comprehend what I say either.  Today she took the 200mg dose again and is vomiting in the bathroom right now.  This isn't the first time she's done this either.  This is probably the 4th or 5th time now.  It's been tough for the both of us.  She seems to lie about the dosages she takes too and is very defensive when I ask her.  I wouldn't wish this on anyone, and I hope that anybody thinking about taking antidepressants thinks twice about it.  It seems like any doctor these days can prescribe without an in depth consultation.\n\n",

    "content": "uh im not a doctor but i know quite alot about this....  You HAVE to stop her from taking 200mg.....  Ok first of all, withdrawl too fast from any of these types of medicines can cause REALLY bad side effects. I get them myself and its just really horrible. Read my other post a few below this if you want to see what i experience. Anyway its bad, so the only way to stop taking the drug is to come off it REALLY gradually and slowly. I take 200mg of an antidepressant which is 2 one hundred mg tablets. When i come off it, i am supposed to bit one of the pills in half (even altho they are tiny) so im at 150mg. And even then i get some withdrawl feelings but not TOO bad. And it can take like a few months at 150 until youre ready to go down to 100.... and then so on. Its really hard, and the more gradual the better you feel.  Secondly, DOUBLE DOSE IS BAD!!!! I cant stress this enough...... Like i said im no doctor your girlfriend taking 2 pills can kill her. It can cause liver failure, kidney failure, heart failure, things like that. And if not a \"failure\" then it can weaken them and basically ruin organs and stuff and its just a really bad thing. You can die from taking a double dose. On the slip of paper that comes with my pills it says in bold:  \"IF YOU MISS A DOSE, DO NOT TAKE 2 TO COMPENSATE!!!! JUST TAKE YOUR NEXT DOSE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE AND CONTINUE AS NORMAL\"  So thats what you have to do. You have to somehow make her just take the normal dosage to get normal again, and then if she wants to stop taking it, she needs to start using less GRADUALLY, bit by bit, and slowly. But the most important thing is NO MORE TAKING 200mg!  Good luck man\n\n",

She is panic stricken at times and completely calm at other times.  I've never seen anything like this in my life.

I don't understand it at all.  i also get depressed for no reason (i don't know if it's drug-induced depression or if i'm really depressed) i don't really feel motivated to do anythign anymore, when before i used to go to the gym regularly.

    "content": "I would say your problems are connected; you do have depression which could be caused by your drug abuse, if you weren't experiencing that before.  Using any substance to alter moods (as speed or alcohol does) upsets the balance of your brain chemistry, so you have mood swings.  You seem to also have an obsession with food and your weight, i.e. an eating disorder.    You need to seek help immediately, these conditions are potentially very dangerous, as you already know.  See a psychiatrist, not just your family doctor, as a psychiatrist will be able to treat all of your disorders.  Multiple disorders can be very complex to treat and do require a specialist.\n\n",

    "title": "Teen Depression",
    "content": "Hello Friend, Some additional info (your age, is the depression intermittent or constant, has there been a recent event that triggered the depression, are you having any thoughts of suicide, are you able to go about your daily activites, any family history of depression, are you comfortable discussing this with your parents and dr, etc..)would be very helpful, however, I will make an attempt to answer your question based on several assumptions. First, many patients have had extremely good results with SSRI's (serotonin re-uptake inhibitors) with minimal side effects. My favorite is Prozac and as a plus, it has been on the market long enough to qualify for generic formulas which are of the same chemical compostion as the original brand name. So the price for 20 mg/day is appx. $25.00/mo, even less if you have insurance and co-pay. With the SSRI's, they work with your normal body chemistry to enhance your feeling of well-being, motivation, decreases OCD's (obsessive compulsive disorders) such as binge eating, shoplifting, among others.  Once you start taking most anti-depressents, you will not notice an immediate change, but they will work in appx 10-14 days. Just 1 day you may notice \"hey, you know what, I feel ok, things just might be ok for me afterall\". I would highly recommend that you talk to your parents and make an appt to see your dr. If he shys away from rx you an anti-depressant, be honest with him and tell him how long you have been feeling low and if any thougts of suicide. It is very normal for folks to feel depressed from time to time, but if it is constant and ongoing, then it is time for medical intervention. Good Luck. Let me know how you are. Please be sure to talk to someone immediately. There is nothing for you to be ashamed of, the brain is unbelievably complex and easy for things to get unbalanced from time to time. Be well my friend. Life is not always grand, but the good times should balance out the bad and give you the strenght to carry on. Look to the future.\n\n",

    "title": "Effexor & Celexa Withdrawals",
    "content": "Hi Dr.,  I've been on Effexor (300 mg/day), Celexa (40 mg/day), and Trazadone (150 mg/day) since 2002.  For about the last 8 months I noticed that the medication wasn't as effective as when I first started.  I had gotten to the point where I would break down in tears at least once a week, I had no energy & rarely left my house on the weekends when I didn't have to go to work.  I see my psychiatrist every other month, and I finally convinced him to change my meds when I saw him on the 10th.  He recommended that I take half the dose of the meds on the following day (Saturday), no meds on Sunday, and then start on 75 mg of Wellbutrin on Monday while continuing on the Trazadone to help my sleep.  I became extremely ill early Monday morning with vomiting and diarrhea.  I was not even able to keep down water so I was not able to start the Wellbutrin on Monday.  I thought it was food poisoning, but now reading the withdrawal symptoms listed in this forum I believe it that was not the case.    The diarrhea continues (it's been a week now), and I am still having trouble eating.  It seems that the only things that agree with me are bannanas, yogurt & oatmeal.  I am also experiencing a severe tingling sensation in my face and hands, almost like my skin is crawling.  I've been dizzy, going between sweating profusely and chills.  I had the skin crawling sensation for a few months usually in the evenings, but my doctor insisted that it was not a side effect of the medication since I had been on it for so long without side effects.  The sensation is now 20 times worse, and I am sure that the medication is the cause.  After reading the posts about the symptoms and slowly weaning off these medications, I am now concerned about my doctor's advice.  I was wondering if I should start taking the Effexor & the Celexa again then start to wean off, or if I should continue on this path of cold turkey since I've already done this for a week.  I'm concerned because it is interfering with my ability to work, and I really don't want to end up in the hospital again like in 2002.  I will be contacting my doctor again in the morning, but I will also appreciate any advice you can provide!    P.S.  I read an earlier reply to a post where a member compared the withdrawal symptoms of Effexor to coming down from a Cocaine high.  Having now experienced both (although it's been over 10 years since using illegal drugs for me), I can say this is much worse.  Thank you in advance!!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Rntdj.  I called my doctor on Monday, and now he is suggesting that I start taking 1 capsule (150 mg) of the Effexor a day then stop after a week.  He is the same doctor that suggested that I originally taper off over a weekend.  After doing some reading on this site and others, I think he is still trying to take me off the medication too quickly.    Does anyone have any suggestions for a good tapering schedule?  I was thinking I should go back to the 2/day until my symptoms subside then do 1 & 1/2 capsules for a few weeks and continue on that schedule.  I'm not too sure since the information I have read is all for situations where people were taking much lower dosages than I was.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Keishan, Even 1 week is too short of an amount of time. Are you taking capsules or tablets? It is much easier to reduce the amount of tablets. For example, your regular scheduled dose is 150mg, after 1 week you may want to try reducing it to 75mg (1/2 tab), the following week, (1/4 of a tab) to equal 37.5mg. Take that daily for 1 week, then every other day x 1 week, then the following week every 2 days etc. etc. This is my personal opinion for an Effexor taper only because of the documented withdrawal effects and this seems to decrease those symptoms. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I suffer from depression, social anxiety, and panic attacks. I am going to start taking medicine again. Now, I don't know if I should continue once again with Paxil or try another medicine such as Zoloft. When I was on Paxil, everything was ok. I felt good. Except for the fact that I almost didnt cry for 2 years. don't know if thats a bad thing.. Anyways, should I give Zoloft a try? Or maybe another medicine? Or just start taking Paxil once again?   Thanks.\n\n",

Look at the reported side efects, read about other people's experiences. You seemed to do well on the Paxil, but obviously it left you feeling a lack of some sort. Perhaps a trial of Zoloft might be helpful, and then you can compare how each made you feel.  I feel sure that if you bring these concerns to your MD, he/she can discuss this with you and together you can come to the decision that will work best for you.  Good luck... if you wouldn't mind, let me know what you decide and how it works for you!\n\n",

Appearently she says that anxiety can cause you to unconciously breathe improperly, I still think I am dying of heart disease and no one cares but that's probably the anxiety talking since I have had quite a few tests and supposedly at very low risk because of my age.     Anyway, after reading up a bit it I am kind of terrified of taking a drug like Fluoxetine I was wondering if it might be better to just try and live with being lightheaded all the time or to take the drug.   My doctor didn't say either, she just said I could try to ignore it or I could take the drug, it was up to me.\n\n",

The consequences are usually worse depression that can last for several days after the drinking.  10 beers is very excessive!

If it gets worse or really bothers you talk to the doctor about it but DO NOT stop your medication without first consulting your Physician for guidance on how to discontinue it.

    "title": "Chest pain and Wellbutrin",
    "content": "I've been taking Wellbutrin XL 300 mg/day for 10 months.  In the first month, I had chest pain and difficulty breathing and went to the ER because the thought I might have a blood clot.  I didn't, and all of the tests came back normal except for my chest xray which showed that a lymph node in my chest was enlarged.  They weren't sure why.  Wellbutrin works well for me except that it makes me anxious and I still sometimes feel that I can get enough breath.  I also have chest pain--I feel a general tightness in my chest that becomes more intense if I stretch.  Is this caused by the Wellbutrin, and if so, why?  Is it something I should be very concerned about?  Does it mean I should go off of Wellbutrin?  I've been on antidepressants for 9 years now and would love to go off of them altogether, but everytime I try I crash.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Char,  Your swollen lymph node is concerning if it\u2019s still there, Wellbutrin would not cause that. Was the x-ray done 10 months ago? If you are still feeling tightness or pain upon stretching request a follow up on that.  Wellbutrin XL can cause anxiety, panic attacks and restlessness when you first start taking it, if you\u2019re still feeling these symptoms, please talk with your Physician right away. Don\u2019t stop taking your Wellbutrin without Physician supervision, this can cause severe symptoms.   You should always take the pill whole, don\u2019t crush it or cut it in half, it is made in a form that will release the medication and the \u201cshell\u201d will pass in your stool so breaking it will cause it to release too much at once. You should not consume alcohol, this will make any anxiety symptoms worse, and other medications may also increase the affects of the Wellbutrin. Nicotine and nicotine replacement patches or gum may cause your heart-rate to increase, rise in blood pressure and may make you feel like you can\u2019t catch your breath. I feel that you have been on this medication long enough to have adapted to the affects of it and that it isn\u2019t the problem.\n\n",

As for potency, if the drugs affected the system in the same way one could say this or that one is \"more potent\". The effects are opposite of each other. My apologies for not being more helpful.

The recommendation is always to start with the lower dosage first. A typical dose is 300 mg/day. The maximum recommended dose is 450mg a day. If you miss a dose DO NOT double up on the medication.

I recently had my thyroid gland tested and I am still not sure what my doctor was trying to tell me - he was a little confused himself.  He told me that my serum levels were double the higher amount that people are supposed to have ??  He also said he was on the brink of prescribing me anti-depressants, but he didn't want to as I 'will be on them for life, basically'.  Please, could you tell me exactly what is going on in my brain - and if I don't get anti-depressants just now, then what help can I get.  My symptons are that I am tired all the time, I stress out really easily and get 'ratty' very quickly.  I have no sexual desire and sometimes it is painful as I am completely not in the mood.  I grind my teeth in my sleep and my shoulders ache, and just recently my care for my studies has gone out the window - I just don't care about anything, I can't get into reading stuff for my essays - there is just a complete lack of will to do anything at the moment.  I am over emotion when watching TV and argue alot with my partner because I am so negative all the time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Garland37, Could you specify the test details, especially the TSH levels. If your symptoms are due to hyperthyroidism then you need to be investigated for what is causing your thyroid hormones to be that high. That would include a thyroid examination and an ultrasound scan of the thyroid. It may involve other tests as well. If your diagnosis is established then your depression may be due to the hyperthyroidism and may improve with correction of your condition. If not then it could be primary (endogenous) depression (i.e. unrelated to the hyperthyroidism). In that case you will need antidepressant therapy for a varying length of time.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Possibly suffering from Serotonin Syndrome & in need of",
    "content": "I think I have been suffering from Serotonin Syndrome but none of my doctors have ever heard of this syndrome, though I have, and it's the only thing I can figure out that is wrong. I took Effexor 25 mg tablets for about a year off and on, Buspar probley all year, and started taking Nortriptyline 10-1-04. The reason the Effexor was taken off and on is because I had trouble with the side effects though it was the only effective medication that worked for my \"past\" depression. Past side effects was TMJ, facial muscle pain, severe tension headaches, lightheadness, blood pressure & pulse elevating, pounding pulse, nervousness, nausea, stomach pain, bladder pain and post fluid retention of my bladder. One time I got off of it cold turkey and went into severe depression and had a short-phased manic episode though I do not have Bipolar, ended up having to taper off of the medication. I've had other antidepressants I used before taking Effexor that caused me to feel more depressed and suicidal and I could not continue taking them. I am not depressed anymore but I have generalized anxiety disorder and still need the Buspar. It's been very effective in treating that and post tramatic stress. I took valiums for years for anxiety and insomnia and Soma short term for my back pain but ran out of them near the end of September and my doctor didn't want me taking them anymore so I had to quit. I had a new prescription filled Sept. 20th for the Effexor. When I started taking it, I started having stomach and bladder pain. Took it for 4 days and quit because the pain was so persistant and the problems subsided the next day but I had major trouble with getting my urine out when going to the bathroom, that lasted about 3 days. The following week, I started taking the Effexor again in hopes that those was just short term side effects. And three days later I ended up with a kidney infection with pain in my left kidney. Also ended up getting TMJ again, severe lighheadedness and nausea. Two days later, both of my kidney's was hurting. I did not think the Effexor was causing that, or I'd of quit using it. I've never even had a kidney infection before. I took Bactrim and after 2 days of finishing that, my infection was worse than the start with so I took another course of Bactrim. At this time, I am starting to have extremely painful spasms (?) in my kidneys and low back. The spasms later ended up going into my stomach organ and chest. And later into my esophagus, neck, face, upper back, arms and legs. Also went to having wavy movements in my skin like if a baby was inside of you kicking you and it caused my arms and legs to jerk. The spasms are a very painful lightning and squeezing pain and is very sharp, burning and cutting. It comes and goes and causes pain to get extremely severe, reminds me of a charley horse and hard labor contractions but worse. The wavy movements never hurt unless it hits me somewhere I'm already sore. I also got this burning pain inside my body which made me feel really warm on the outside. I quit taking all of my medications Oct 18th due to severe nausea. I ended up getting urinary retension (decrease to 6 ounces in 24 hours) and could not sleep. I'd sit up 3 nights straight and then go to sleep for only 3 hours, this became a continuous problem and I went to the ER. I was tested for stones but did not have any and my infection had supposedly cleared up. They did a CT scan which showed an ovarian cyst and some other abnormalites in my urinary tract. They gave me Lortab for pain which has helped some. The next week, the infection started coming back with showing a trace of infection. My doctor did a culture but it didn't show up any growth and he gave me Ambien to help me sleep but it didn't phase me. At this time, I was very talkative, very anxious and nervous but I think it was due to not having any sleep and my blood pressure was high, 147/90 and puse was 101. Normally it stays at 110 over 60 but has been elevated to high since I got so sick. A few days later, my urologist checked my urine and it showed a trace of protein, moderate amount of occult blood, 1+ leukocytes, moderate amount of bacteria, microscopic showed 10-15 leukocytes, 5-10 red blood cells and many epithelial cells. I told my urologist the situation and he said that Effexor is extremely harsh on the bladder but was unaware of Serotonin syndrome. This day, I went to experiencing uncontrollable problems with talking my thoughts out loud. He gave me Cipro for the infection and sent me over to the hospital for an ultrasound because of the ovarian cyst and enlarged uterus distended with fluid. It showed that I have a complex cystic lesion on my left ovary measuring 3.5 x 2.2 x 2.7 cm which has an appearance of endometrioma. A cystadenoma or cystadenocarcinoma remains within the differential diagnosis. I am now going to be sent to a gynecologist to make sure that I don't have ovarian cancer. The ultrasound also showed trace free fluid within the cul-de-sac and bowel loops noted within the pelvis. What does that mean? Last weekend, I had a major amount of exhaustion hit me and was able to get some sleep and that started continually improving and I've taken Ambien when needed and am sleeping really good now. The spasms improved also after sleeping better but I took a Buspar tonight after being off of it since 10-13 and it caused extremely bad spasms in my kidney's and lower to mid back. Also went to having very sharp shooting pains in my abdomen. These spasms were attacking my organs very frequently and seemed to be locating at the areas I've had past trouble with. I have GERD which I wasn't having any problems with before the spasms but my esophagus and neck got raw inside from it and I started belching alot and I think my stomach organ got inflammed, problems are persistant. Have taken Prevacid but it isn't of much help.  Ephagastric region is extremley sore. I've had chronic pain in my back and it made it feel worse. I think my lower back is just hurting now because of the kidney inflammation or ovarian lesion. I had the spasms in my bladder and I have had cystitis for years but never encountered such a problem with it. It caused tenderness in my bladder and I now have constant pain in it also along with pelvic pain/pressure since last week. It caused pain and soreness in my left kidney that will not go away. I can only assume it is inflammed from the spasms and infection that I had for almost a month. Most of the left side of my abdomen (and going into my back) hurts really bad and is sore to the touch but my right side doesn't bother me. I've also had the spasms in the mid section of my abdomen and sometimes it felt like it was squeezing in my belly button. The spasms have been the worst and most painful in my left kidney and stomach organ. Lightheadness has improved, nausea is still really bad, had loss of appetite and some weight loss which has improved. Had been feeling down in the dumbs all day and easily cry so that's why I figured I needed to start taking the Buspar again but I think I must be allergic to antidepressants. My skin has been really itchy since but I haven't had any fever or rash which would more so concern me. So can you tell me what in the world is happening to me? Is this serotonin syndrome and if it is, how in the world am I going to get diagnosed with it when nobody around here has ever heard of it. And how long does it last? My doctor was in question to whether or not I've been having spasms because it is causing my organs to get very sore but I know that serotonin syndrome causes overreaction of the muscles. Could that be why the spasms are so bad? Normally spasms wouldn't cause that kind of problem. Can cancer also cause these type of spasms? I read in a forum earlier about a woman who has had bladder cancer for 2 months and is having painful spasms in her bladder and the pain is variating in intensity as mine has been. Is it possible to have spasms so severe, that it can cause inflammation? I have obviously gotten through the rough part of this syndrome, if that is what has been wrong, so will I be okay not being treated for it? Also am wondering what kind of severe problems and pain people encounter with cancer. And if there is any effective treatments for GAD and PTSD other than an antidepressant. Any information would be sincerly apprieciated. I have been so worried about this and lack of information is definetly not helping matters any. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I did some research on this syndrome and discovered it is more well known by pharmacists.  According to J. Allen Scoggin, Pharm.D., MPA  Associate Professor of Pharmacy Practice and Pharmcoeconomics, at the University of Tennessee College of Pharmacy,  \"Serotonin syndrome is described in the literature as a potentially serious drug-related condition characterized by a number of mental, autonomic and neuromuscular changes. Although serotonin syndrome can cause death, the condition is mild in most persons, and with supportive care alone they tend to recover completely.\"  \"Serotonin syndrome is most often reported in patients taking two or more medications that increase CNS serotonin levels by different mechanisms. The most common drug combinations associated with serotonin syndrome involve the MAOIs, selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), and the tricyclic antidepressants.\"   Mild to moderately severe cases of serotonin syndrome usually resolve in 24 to 72 hours. Though most cases can be treated and resolve within a week  Mental status changes are the most frequently reported symptoms associated with serotonin syndrome. Other commonly reported features include motor abnormalities, cardiovascular changes, gastrointestinal problems and miscellaneous changes such as diaphoresis and fever   No specific therapeutic approach to the treatment of serotonin syndrome has been fully evaluated in the literature.  Initial treatment should consist of supportive measures aimed at reducing hypertension, tachycardia, hyperthermia and respiratory distress if these conditions are present.  Since it seems that it is the combination of two drugs that affect the serotonin levels it is imperative that whoever is treating you and prescribing your meds be aware of all the meds you are taking and how often you take them.  When one gets medications from different doctors then you have a potential problem where you take meds from different doctors and can actually cause serious side effects.  Its like mixing ammonia and bleach.  Apart they are both good cleaners but together they cause a gas that is lethal. I hope this helps you. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "After being on Effexor XR for 6 months with very little effect, my doctor has finally agreed to switch my medication.  Until four days ago, I had been taking 150 mg of Effexor XR (split dose - 75 mg. am; 75 mg pm).  For the past four days, my dose has been reduced by my doctor to 75 mg. (which I take in the morning)  I am to stay at 75 mg. for another 3 days and then start Celexa.  Over the past few days I have found that when I take my 75 mg. in the morning I am very nauseaus.  I actually feel better in the morning before I take the Effexor.  Could this be because I had been taking a split dose or that my body metabolizes the drug quickly?  Also, could starting the Celexa upon discontinuation of the Effexor XR help ease the potential withdrawal symptoms?   Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Follow-up to Effexor XR (from tjford)",
    "content": "Thanks for the quick response to my questions.  Actually, I have not yet gone off Effexor XR.  Today is the first day at a reduced dose of 75 mg.  I am to stay at the reduced dose for one week before stopping completely and starting Celexa, which is why I am somewhat nervous about not only the withdrawal symptoms, but also serotonin syndrome.  (I am not much of a medication taker, which is why I am being a bit neurotic about this.  I probably only take Tylenol a few times a year and use vitamin supplements such as a multi, B-Complex.  Recently tried adding amino acids but only for a very brief period).  If I reduce to 75 mg. from 150 mg. for one week and then stop completely, could I potentially experience withdrawal symptoms?  I have another question.  In my previous e-mail, I mentioned that I had been using an L-Tyrosine supplement for about 2 weeks (starting with 500 mg, three times a day, then 500 mg, twice a day and finally 500 mg once a day for the two week period).  Are you able to tell me if a person can experience hypomania while using the amino acid L-Tyrosine or experience withdrawal symptoms after stopping an amino acid.  I have been nauseaus and very anxious since I stopped the supplementation.  I did a lot of research on amino acid supplementation prior to taking anything, and did not see anything about toxicity, side effects or withdrawal.  The only other explanation I can think of for how I have been feeling for the past week and a half is perhaps the Depo Provera my doctor put me on to regulate my periods (Unfortunately, I did not know much about Depo before being given the injection and wasn't told much by my doctor).  Any ideas?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been using Sarafem for about three months now, for mood problems related to PMDD and menapause. It helped at first, and doesnt anymore, so I stopped taking it. I became nauseous, dizzy, weak, and just felt terrible. I went to my doctor, and it was only then that she told me NOT to stop it that abruptly because of withdrawal. SO, now I am back on it for a week, and after that I will be starting Lexapro to see if one, it works better, and two, it is supposed to have minimal sexual side effects. Is anyone familiar with Lexapro? Does it work? Does it decrease sexual desire?  thanks~!\n\n",

The switch here is justified since you became intolerant to Sarafem.  Please check our lexapro page for more info on the way it works and its possible side effects.  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Phill, Please check this our Aurorix page for details of possible side effects. Of note that this drug is not FDA approved and therefor not available in the U.S. Usually the FDA approval requirements are very strict and drugs take longer to approve in the US than in Australia. Its a relatively new drug and not all its side effects are known.  One important point regarding your symptoms is it could be liver pain, kidney pain or simply muscle pain. This drug is known to raise the liver enzymes. According to the manufacturing company there have been no reports of clinical consequences due to the raised enzyme level. Liver enzymes are raised in various types of liver injury.  Do not stop this drug suddenly. Rather contact your doctor and get a liver profile lab test to check your liver enzymes. A physical examination of your liver is very important.  Best regards.\n\n",

I won't stop unless my doctor says so but I was wondering if I maintain this dose for a few more weeks will I have withdrwal symptons when stopping.  Also could the Paxil already be working because I read it can take two weeks.  If thats so and I feel better everyday, is it a good idea to ask to maybe to not take them at all. Thank you.  Also is it ok to have a beer or to while taking Paxil CR?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello jigsaw, Paxil can take up to 4 weeks to start having an effect. Paxil. Withdrawal symptoms can be more likely to happen and may be more severe if one is taking a high dose and/or have been on it for a long duration of time; this is why it is generally recommended that the medication be tapered under the direct supervision of a physician.   I think you are correct to discuss discontinuation of Paxil with your physician since as you said you are improving too soon for it to be caused by the drug.\n\n",

One approach is to keep switching to different ones till you find one that doesnt affect you that way. Ofcourse this is usually easier said than done.   Your doctor would be the best one to judge the drug to switch to.  Some good results have been found for treating depression when antidepressants are combined with cognitive behavioral therapy. Again your doctor would be the better judge of this approach.\n\n",

    "content": "Currently there doesnt seem to be enough information on the effects of long term use of paroxiten (Paxil).  There have been reports of some abnormal movements resulting from SSRIs; e.g., muscle twitches or stiffness. In theory, long-term use of these agents might--I emphasize might--predispose some individuals to such abnormal movements. But this theoretical risk, in my opinion, must be weighed against the debilitating effects of severe (major) depression--which has a 15% mortality rate. Of course, there are other classes of antidepressants that have been around much longer, and which do not seem to pose these theoretical risks--i.e., tricyclic antidepressants. But these are also much more potentially toxic than the SSRIs, and have their own side effects.   Having said that, it must be conceded that we do not yet know the long-term effects of Paxil or related agents (called SSRIs, and include Prozac and Zoloft), if by long-term, you mean, \"after 10 or more years of use.\" These agents are still too \"new\" to generate that kind of data. So far as I am aware, there are no convincing studies showing any serious long-term effects from the chronic use of Prozac, which is a closely related medication used since about 1988. So, all in all, I think the risks of taking Paxil indefinitely are probably quite small, but the jury is still out.\n\n",
