    "title": "Left supraclavicular region mass",
    "content": "Hello,  I have some questions regarding an enlarged (left side) supraclavicular lymph node.  First, I'll give you some history.  Four weeks ago I had a sore throat.  Didn't think much of it as I have some history of allergies.  A week later I noticed that my lymph nodes on my left side had enlarged.  Again, I didn't think much of it as I've seen the ones just under my jaw do that before with colds.  I went in to the doctor and he put me on Zythromyacin (Z-pack) and the swelling began to subside.  I did have some external redness (inflammation) that spread from (if I were male) the adam's apple area around the left side of the neck all the way to the spine and up into the scalp.  The redness went away after a week, but the supraclavicular lymph node increased in size - to almost the size of two jawbreaker gumballs.  The node was hard and not moveable.  When the swelling did not go away I went back in to the doctor.  He did a cat scan and a chest xray.  The chest xray came back clear (yay) and the ct scan showed a line of enlarged lymph nodes in my neck.  I don't have the results of that cat scan, but due to the results of it my doctor asked for a biopsy of the node ASAP.  That was over a week ago now.  The results of the biopsy were inconclusive and so I've been referred to an ENT doctor for an excisional biopsy.  The ENT doctor suspects that it is due to infection and not cancer (as do I).  Here are the results of the biopsy.  Diagnosis: Mass, left supraclavicular region, FNA: Atypical cells present (see comments) Comments: The atypical cells in the aspirate are difficult to classify due to the extensive necrosis.  This porcess may represent a necrotic lymph node from either an inflammatory or neoplastic process, but again, the extensive necrosis precludes a definitive diagnosis.  Clinical correlation is suggested with additional evaluation and follow up as is clinically indicated. Miocroscopic Description: The four Pap stained smears have abundant necrotic material with acute inflammation, lymphocytes and numerous clusters of small cells with dark round nuclei.  Viable epithelial cells, clusters of histiocytes, multinucleated giant cells or viral changes are not seen.  I believe that the reason this node is enlarged is likely due to infection, but a question niggles in the back of my mind due to what I've been reading about these supraclavicular nodes.  My question is, is it possible that my cold (infection) could have brought to the surface a problem in this node?  Meaning, is it possible that there could have been something (perhaps lymphoma or other cancer) brewing in the node and the cold have enlarged it enough to be noticed?    FYI... I asked the doctor who did the biopsy, after he took a look at the CT scan and palpated the mass, what he thought.  He stated that he thought it could go either way.  He was concerned with what he saw on the CT scan.  I'm a veteran and the biopsy needed to be done ASAP and the only ones who could do it are outside the VA.  I went back in this past week to the VA ENT doctor and he didn't seem much concerned and decided to schedule the excisional biopsy for 2 weeks away (on the 22nd of June).  I'm just a little concerned and would like to hear what the doctors here say.  Thanks for your time - I know this was a long post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your history is very akin to the description of the condition known as erysipelas. Most cases of erysipelas are due to Streptococcus pyogenes (beta-hemolytic group A streptococci).Sometimes, non-group A streptococci can also cause this.It is primarily an infection of the skin(unlike cellulitis).  Commonly, a feeling of general illness, high fevers, rigors, fatigue, headaches and vomiting,  occur within two days of the initial infection.Typically,Erythematous, skin rash with charecteristic raised borders & orange peel-like feel apppears. This can occur anywhere in the body but most common over the legs,arms & the face.  Acute lymphadenitis in the area of drainage of the affected skin is fairly common.Sometimes the lymphadenitis may persist as a chronic lymphadenitis.  Only your doctor who treated you will be in a better position to make a firm diagnosis.However, if the persisting lymph node is worrying(hard consistency), one should either repeat an FNAC or perform an excision biopsy. Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor!  Thank you very much for your reply.  I didn't mention before that the skin was smooth - not like an orange peel... it just was inflamed.  This lasted about 5 days from the beginning until it was completely gone.    I visited with my ENT doctor/surgeon on the 16th.  He felt the node and stated that it had not gone down in size and was hard.  He had expected it to go down in size.  He stated that we are definitely doing the excisional biopsy on the 22nd.  I'm of two minds on this whole situation.  That this is just a reactive node that has not gone shotty or that it is some sort of cancer (lymphoma or metatastic).  It seems to me that it has grown a tiny bit in size, but that may just be a bit of paranoia on my part.  I am really interested in knowing if the infection and subsequent swelling could have brought an existing (cancer) problem to the surface.  Thanks again for your time doctor.  I appreciate that you took the time out of your day to respond to my query.\n\n",

Areas commonly affected are the scalp, eyebrows, eyelids, and creases of the nose, lips.  They usually flare in winter and become less in summer.   Specific lotions and shampoo are used for treatment.   - Folliculitis is an infection of the hair follicles. Forming small, white-headed Bumps in hair follicles (roots).  Lesions may be Itching. Superficial folliculitis resolves spontaneously in a few days, while deep or recurring folliculitis should be medically treated.   - Lymph node enlargement is common to occur as reactionary process to scalp, skin and ear infections.  Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes of lymphadenopathy and small abscess.  I advise you to seek direct clinical examination.  Keep up us updated. Best regard.\n\n",

Sometimes small subcutaneous lesions are difficult to be felt and may be considered  normal changes in the skin consistency especially in the scalp where many skin changes occur.   But serial examination is more important to notice any change. Thus you either follow up with the same Doctor to make her see the new lesion or to directly consult a dermatologist.  Local hygienic measures to keep the scalp less greasy and clean with the careful use of non irritant or allergic compounds are important to avoid infections and skin inflammation.  Keep us updated.

    "content": "Hello,  It is very difficult to tell what this could be without direct clinical examination however, nodules of this size are usually related to sebaceous (oil) gland or hair follicles.  Oil glands secrete oily substance known as sebum. They are found every where in the body with the exception of the palms and soles. When the duct becomes clogged with hardened sebum, a cyst is formed.  They are less likely to  be lymph nodes but clinical examination is essential for diagnosis.   I advise you to go for dermatological consultation.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I need advice before I go out off my mind with worry.  Back in February I had a very bad viral infection and discovered a small lump on my neck, as I was having other treatments at the time (signoscopy & gynae problems) I forgot about it until about two months ago and it was still there.  I went to the doctor and she ran bloods and I have had Toxoplasmosis in the past (all other bloods were clear) which she explained is prob the cause of the lump but because a second one had appeared (in the space of a week-one month ago) she referred me for a biopsy, my date for it is in two weeks time.  The reason i'm outta my mind with worry is because everytime i search my symptons ie, the fixed, multiple lumps seems to come up as malignant.    I've had night sweats but no other symptons (these are never as bad that i've to change my clothes)my lumps are also about 0.5cm each right beside each other.  Sorry if this is a bit mixed up but any advice you could give me would be greatly appreciated, maybe other answers rather than cancer.  I'm so scared.  PS: I'm a 26 yr old female.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Generally, lymph Nodes that are suspicious of malignancy are larger(nodes <0.5 cm are usually considered benign), firm,rubbery or hard in consistency.Fixity is also makes them suspicious.Matting is usually seen in tubercular lymphadenitis, but also may be seen in lymphomas(peri-adenitis) and other malignancies.  Hard consistency of a lymph node is generally indicative of malignancy but, there are benign nodes which can be hard as well!, for example, calcified tuberculous lymph nodes.  Perhaps there are more causes of benign lymph node enlargement than malignant ones.  Toxaplasmosis is a well known cause of cervical lymph node enlargement.Immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk.  One needs to be concerned about lymph node enlargement, but,it is better to be left to the doctor to decide,investigate and arrive at a diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

He sent me for a CT SCAN on the neck and my lung doc wanted one on my chest. I have sleep apnea and a lung problem from over weight. I'm 5'10 and 250 lbs. I used to weight 305 and lost all that weight and I'm still too heavy.  When I lied down for the scan, I couldn't. I got a shortness of breath and got panicky. The tech didn't want to inject me with the thinner and IV until she was sure I could do the entire scan. I couldn't.  My lung doc said it is because of my diaphram pushing weight into my lungs. It also had hernia 5 years ago. I'm 62 now. He administered breathing tests that were terrible but my oxygen level was 93% after losing 10 lbs from the last visit.  The nose doc aborted the surgery refusing to do a local anesthia on my nose.  They want me to go back for the sanc in a month. I've lost 5 more lbs.  The nose doc said the lump is a cancer but not malignant but it will spread.  Now I'm scared that I won't be able to have surgery on it or the polyups and tonsils.  I take care of my 85 yr old mother and administer her insulin. She needs me.  I'm scared.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "HI I am a 26 year old female. I have similar questions....I have a bump on my right side of my head, it is right next to my ear(tragus) and jaw/cheek ....about the size of a pencil eraser and is movable and not hard. I first felt pain about 1 and 1/2 months ago due to sleeping on my right side, the pressure of laying my head on that side would cause pain when I would wake up. that would last for a couple of hours. So I think this bump might have been there before much longer than when I noticed it.  I have taken Ibuprofen to stop the pain.  I went to the doctor and they said it was a swollen lymph node, they checked my ears and I have no ear infection. They didnt give me any antibiotics.  I have allergies and have dealt with them my whole life so I am thinking this  could be part of it? The bump has not gotten bigger or smaller. I have trained myself not to sleep on my right side but it is very annoying still. I do not have health insurance. I go to a free clinic. This makes me worry even more. I have been searching the internet for info. I don't have fever or night sweats and as long as I don't mess with the bump or sleep on it, it doesn't hurt. I have another appointment march 30th. They said if it does not go away I should get a biopsy. I have looked up Lymphoma and the one symptom I have is the itching besides the bump. Should I ask for a complete blood count? Should I ask for a CT Scan? What about LDH levels? I just want this bump to go away. Should I ask for a throat culture to see if its mono? Again I have no fever and don't feel under the weather. I have been taking a lot of vitamin d trying to boost my immune system. I eat healthy. I don't know what to do besides try not to worry.  Please someone respond. I will update after the next appointment. I really don't want it to be cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm just a little concerned and need some advice. Now... I admit it was a really bad choice, but I smoked for about 6 years. I just recently quit. Over for the past 4 months I have had a really nasty sore throat on and off; at its worst it's been difficult to swallow. It lingers around my tonsils -- although, it seems to switch sides. I also have a lump on my neck; however, I've had this since the age of 14, after a bout of mono, so I'm not sure that there is a connection. There really have been no other serious symptoms; a light cough that goes away, no fever, no abnormal weight loss/gain; just the sore, and occasionally swollen throat.  I am scared that those years of smoking have caught up with me. I've been to the doctor three times, and every time he has given me a different answer. The last time he said it was likely strep throat, and gave me an antibiotic. It cleared up for about two weeks, but feels like it is coming back. What should I do? Could it be cancer? I am terrified!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  There are numerous causes for recurrent sore throat.But in your case,(as you have recently stopped smoking -how recently, i am unaware),  one needs to think about the possibility of these being  nicotine withdrawal symptoms.  Some of the more common nicotine withdrawal symptoms are, - Headache  - Sweating  - Tingling in the feet & hands  - abdominal symptoms (nausea, cramps) &  - Common-cold like symptoms    (sore throats, coughing, and  other signs of common-colds)  It may take at least 2-3 months (or more, depending on how long one had been smoking) before a person starts to get over these symptoms.  If your doctor, after examining you, does not find any other cause for the sore throats, then, nicotine withdrawal symptoms would be the likely cause. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: koilocytosis of the distal esophagus",
    "content": "Hi,  Koilocytes are a type of 'dysplastic' squamous cell found in potentially precancerous lesions - cervical intraepithelial neoplasia(ex, uterine cervix).They are believed to be changes in squamous cells brought about by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection(not conclusively proven).   Papillomaviruses are well known to be oncogenic (cancer causing) in animals. In humans they are associated with benign squamous tumors (condylomata acuminata,verruca vulgaris,and papillomas) in a number of body sites.   Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection of the esophagus,is being increasingly reported.  Esophageal squamous papillomas (ESPs) have been identified.These are believed to be caused by Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.The lesions of ESPs show presence of significant numbers of Koilocytes.   In the west, mostly they are seen to occur in the lower third of the esophagus. However, in the japanese (in whom severe reflux disease is rare), they have been reported in the middle third of the esophagus.Curiosly, japanese women(more often  younger women around 40 years of age), seem to be affected.   Two etiological factors of ESPs have been proposed... a) hyper-regenerative response of the esophageal mucosa to  mechanical & chemical irritation such as chronic food impaction, alcohol consumption, repeated minor trauma,  cigarette smoking, gastroesophageal reflux diseases (GERDs)and previous gastroesophageal surgery. b) Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection.  There are case reports of mastication of verruca vulgaris associated with esophageal squamous papilloma.   Thus there is emerging evidence to link esophageal cancer to HPV via Esophageal squamous papillomas (ESPs).   If indeed some of the esophageal cancers are found to be linked to HPV, whether these tumors will behave any differently and their prognostic significance is as yet unclear. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have recently discovered a lump on my neck. I've had a neck CT done which showed a well circumscribed cystic lesion filled with fluid about 2.9cm in diameter. In addition I have an enlarged lymph node on the other side of my neck which the report said to just monitor as well as a cyst filled with mucus in my nasal passage. I am 28 yrs old and have no health problems but am really worried I have something really bad. I have been to two ENT specialists, one suggested removing the entire parotid gland, the other said he would recommend just removing the cyst. I have recently had a needle biopsy done and am waiting for the results. During the biopsy the doctor sucked out two syringe full of fluid which he though was saliva. The cyst is considerably smaller now to the point where you can't feel it by touching it.  The doctor said that the cyst could still be malignant and he would do a tissue biopsy upon extraction. My question is that I have read that a cyst filled with fluid are generally non cancerous, is it better that this is a cyst and not a tumor? Why would I also have an enlarged lymph node (just one)? Are the two problems related and is the lymph node something I should worry about. The doctor doesn't even recommend a biopsy on it at this point.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Growth on parotid salivary gland",
    "content": "Hi, Cystic swellings involving the parotid gland can develop in several conditions.   Unilateral parotid cysts secondary to obstruction to one of its ducts have been reported.Also,a unilateral solitary lymphoepithelial cyst in the parotid gland(unrelated to HIV), is occasionally seen in adults.  'Poly-cystic' parotid disease, is congenital and manifests bilaterally in girls and women.  Malignant neoplasms of the parotid gland often have cystic components arising as a result of cellular secretory activity or may represent areas of cystic degeneration.  In practice,cystic involvement of the parotid gland more likely represents either papillary cystadenoma lymphomatosum ( PCL or Warthin\u2019s tumor), or, lymphoepithelial cysts associated with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) disease.    Similarities between these two pathologic entities exist. Clinically, both are slow-growing, soft, cyst- like, painless masses involving the superficial lobe of parotid gland.Bothh can also at times can be multicentric or bilateral. What clinically differentiates these two entities is the presence or absence of lymphadeopathy.  Lymphadeopathy generally supports a diagnosis of  lymphoepithelial cysts as well as elevated CD8 counts.  Incision or excision biopsies of parotid lumps is not advisable.Superficial conservative (facial nerve sparing) parotidectomy is the minimum surgery currently advocated.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello \u2013 Please assist me with my question.  I\u2019m a 40 year old woman with a lump on the left side of the hard pallet on the roof of my mouth for at least four years.  It is not unusual in color or texture. It\u2019s almost impossible to feel it with my finger, but it is definantly felt with my tongue. I have been to my GP twice and a Maxillofacial Doctor who told me it was just swelling of the saliva gland.  The issue is that the lump is always there. It does not change with eating or drinking. Most recently I had a lump on the left side of my neck which the doctor said was swelling of the artery (common in smokers).He also looked at my throat which he said was fine. In addition to that, for the past 3 weeks I have experiend pain under the left side of my tongue, and under my chin toward the back of the throat.  Today I noticed a lump about two inches behind my ear at the hairline, again on the left side.  I\u2019m very concerned that this is cancer. I have been to three different doctors and a dentist. I feel because Doctors do not see a growth and it\u2019s difficult to feel with a finger, they don\u2019t believe me. After anxiously waiting for appointments, I leave the office with the same concerns I had before entering. This has caused me so much concern and anxiety. The stress of thinking the worst is affecting me.  Do you feel that these lumps and issues are related in any way? If these lumps are not cancer, can you please tell me what they may be? If there is any other possibilty I would like to know for peace of mind.  Please help with you r insight and expertise. Thank you in advance for your advice!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your situation appears to be highly unusual.There can be no dispute that the tongue is a very sensitive organ(perhaps more sensitive than the tip of one's finger).However,if a swelling is definitely palpable by your tongue, an experienced doctor would most likely feel it.  Lumps in the hard palate are always viewed with suspicion(because it is the commonest site for a minor salivary gland tumors- most of which in this location are malignant).  The hard palate could be imaged by a CT or an MRI scan.  The lump behind your ear could be a post-auricular lymph node.Your doctor sould be able to guide you (after examining you) if the node needs to be subjected to an FNAB(fine needle aspiration biopsy) or an open biopsy.

    "title": "Oral Cancer and Anal Cancer",
    "content": "I am having a bit of a hard time and I really need some advise.   About a month ago my fiance told me he was convinced he had tongue cancer. He said he had a bump at the base of his tongue that was raised and painful. He said he thinks it had moved to his neck glands because he has had a sore throat, headaches, body aches. etc.   My fiance is 29 and has been unemployed for 6 months, not eating well, not sleeping well, not having the best hygiene either. The bump pretty much just showed up... pretty quickly. All of the symptoms he listed are all just very common complaints (aches/sore throat/etc.) other than the bump on his tongue. I honestly think that it is something else but he has been smoking for about 15 years so I know that it is a possibility. He REFUSES to go to the doctor. He says he's too scared. I'm worried for his health and mine as well if it could be something contagious.  About 2 weeks later he said he had symptoms similar to \"hairy tongue.\" His tongue is white and his \"buds\" are overgrown and it's just kinda icky. (sorry for the oh-so-very non-medical terms but I don't know proper terms) He has been scraping his tongue like every day and brushing it. However his oral hygene has never really been the best. It's not clearing up at all and he says the bump is getting more painful and red/swollen feeling. He has also had an issue with one of his teeth for about  2 years now, they were going to remove it but he couldn't afford it... could it be an issue with that?  Then..... about 5 days ago he said he thought he now had full body cancer. He said he hadn't mentioned it before because he was embarrassed but that he had a lump inside his anus that has grown slowly over the past 6 months. He says it goes from the anus up about an inch or so and is about the size of a cigarette lighter. So now he is convinced he has both cancers. I know something like that could also be something like an assess but I am no doctor and obviously this is not something anyone would try to examine on their own.   He has been a bit of an over-exagerator in the past with health issues but I am worried and I don't know how to make him see that he needs to go too the doctor. Everyone is worried, especially me and his mother, he needs to get healthy. I do think he is most scared about the tongue issue but I also know that many men are very nervous/scared/embarrassed about issues regarding their anus.  As I understand it full body cancer would basically be impossible as his body would have pretty much completely shut down by now, if it was in both his tongue and anus.   I need some opinions and help on how to get him into a doctor. I love him more than anything but anything I say seems to make him just get angry.   Please help in any way that you can.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 24 years old, back in 2003 i fractured my skull (if that's helpful). But anyway, For a while, (probably a good year), I have noticed small things being wrong with me. My head began hurting ridiculously, it isn't a normal headache. It's the feeling of electrical shocks stemming from the back right of my head to the front left. They last for a few seconds at a time...but are enough to stop me in my tracks, make me want to pull my hair out or just scrunch up in a corner. That has gone on, like I said, for about a year. Around May-ish, I noticed other strange things happening. My eyesight began to go blurry for a few seconds at a time, then come back. Sometimes, when I try to read I feel like I am almost staring THROUGH the words, and can't actually comprehend what they say. The periphrial vision on my right eye sometimes seems to be non-existant and  Dizziness has become an every day occurance. Also, i have ear pain. This is probably the worst of all of them, minus the electrical shocks. It began to feel as if the inside of my right ear is numb. When there is a lot of noise, I can't focus on anything..I can't comprehend what people say with out truly trying. sometimes, I just want to cover my ear, the pain is so bad. I also have random tingling in my arm, and numbness in my face. I've been to a dr and they said it's probably Occipital Neuritis, they gave me 800 mg of motrin 3 times a day, which doesn't help any of the symptoms at all. And The other day I noticed a large lump on the right side of my neck (the back where the base of the skull meets the neck i guess) I don't really know what it is?  should I be worried?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: electrical shock headaches?",
    "content": "Hello --  This may be occipital neuritis (and if it is I'm not too surprised it hadn't responded to Motrin), but could also be several other things, especially since you mention pain in the ear and dizziness along with that lump (and these things are often something which was already present but in a heightened state of awareness is suddenly discovered -- then again maybe it really is new). At any rate, there are enough symptoms to cause some doubt about the occipital neuritis, but there is also the possibility of more than one thing going on at the same time, which usually clouds the picture. This is called co-morbidity, meaning, well, that more that one thing is wrong (means two things, but can actually be any number). They  may even stem from the same underlying cause.   The \"electric shock headaches\" do sound like the pain from an inflamed cranial nerve, perhaps the occiptal one, perhaps another (there are eight to choose from). This may also be causing the pain in your ear, in which case it may be a different cranial nerve affected. This could be due to the skull fracture but just as easily might not, since it is often a sequel to shingles, which when it has occurred in the scalp can often go undetected. Anyone who's ever had chickenpox may at some later point in life develop shingles and if, as is so often the case, it manifests in the scalp area, can go largely unnoticed except for some pain, itching, or vague discomfort.   You do have some other extrapyramidal symptoms as well (symptoms that fall outside the obvious pathway we are exploring) but these often are related in some indirect way or are the result of built-up anxiety over the earlier symptoms.   A neurological workup is appropriate to rule out any more serious structural problem, but it seems likely this is a neuralgia (virtually interchangeable with neuritis) of one of the cranial nerves. When this doesn't respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as Motrin (ibuprofin) it usually requires something different that will act as a nerve pain blocker, something like Neurontin or Lyrica (which were originally anti-siezure meds). These can have annoying side effects, but one of them may well work for you well enough to disregard any modest drowsiness or random annoyance it may cause  in exchange for relief from these current symptoms.   First order of business, however, is a neurology consult. After that, hopefully, a diagnosis is reached and a treatment plan initiated. Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated as to how things go. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Schwannomas, (neurilemmomas), are uncommon benign nerve sheath neoplasms that may originate from any cranial, peripheral, or autonomic nerves of the body (exceptions -the olfactory and optic nerves).  They can be intracranial or extracranial (cervical or intrathoracic).  Most ideal treatment is excision with preservation of the vagus nerve (not always feasible).  Excision and end to end anastamosis is the next option (again not always feasible).Post-operative vocal cord palsy usually results.  As for your question of \"how small does the tumor have to be in order to reconnect the vegus nerve\", this will depend on an individual case and the existing local anatomy.  Vagotomy is an operation which was once popular for 'decreasing' the acid in the stomach. Post-vagotomy symptoms are quite a few(diarrhea,vasomotor dumping symptoms etc).  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I had tenderness and swelling on the left side of my neck. My doctor said it was Carotidynia. Normally, I would accept that this was the problem and move on. The issue is that in addition to the recent Carotidynia, I have had a bump on the roof of my mouth (left side) that swells for 3-4 years now. Also, since April, the left neck muscels have been sore. A few weeks ago I noticed there is a lump (again left side) of the back of my head about 1.5\" from the earlobe near the prominent skull bone (anatomy is not my strong suit). I find it concerning that these symptoms all occur on the left side and would really appreciate any suggestions of what could cause this. I of course think the worst, and it is causing me a great deal of anxiety. Thank you!\n\n",

Some believe that it is not a disease entity but, a symptom complex.Mostly affects women and curiously, a sizable number of sufferers of this malady have been reported to have 'Cancer phobia'.  The lump on the roof of your mouth (i guess, the hard palate) should be evaluated soon.Lumps over the hard palate could arise from accessory salivary glands and their nature should be confirmed(malignancy should be excluded).Your doctor would no doubt assess the swelling behind the left ear at the same time.

Just to name a few... - The sternoclavicular syndrome (variously called as arthro-osteitis,sternoclavicular hyperostosis and SAPHO syndrome,) - a group of ill-understood chronic inflammatory disorders. - Friedrich's disease - an aseptic necrosis of the medial end of clavicle has been occassionaly recorded since its first description by Friedrich in 1924. - somewhat more common are the arthritic disorders involving the sternoclavicular joint (rheumatoid arthritis,psoriatic arthritis,reactive arthritis,spondyloarthropathies etc). Further investigations may include ESR,HLA-B27, and a biopsy.  Only a rheumatologist may be in a better position to investigate you further to diagnose your condition.Good luck!\n\n",

The area affected is probably the sternoclavicular joint (SC joint).  It will be important to get an MRI or CT scan of the joint to better see what is going on. I have seen a couple cases now of either inflammatory reaction or infection/malignancy in this joint. If after imaging the joint with appropriate labs (CBC, sed rate, CRP), and empirical treatment (antibiotics and/or corticosteroids) the condition persists and without specific diagnosis, a biopsy is indicated. Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "inflamed bilateral occipital nodes, positive SCC blood test",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 27 year old cauasian male with no family history of cancer.   About 3 weeks I noticed that the left occipital node on the back of my neck was swollen, it was around 1.5cm in diameter and coincided with a really nasty bout of itchy scalp (I am an eczema sufferer). A few days later I noticed the node to the right of my spine had flared up also. Neither lypmh node was painful, they are firm and movable under the surface of the skin (to a cm or so either way you push them)   Shortly after I had a routine blood test to check for Squamous cell carcinoma. And here's where it gets complicated. My SCC blood test came in real high at 7.6ng/ml above the bench mark of 1.5ng/ml. At this point I should mention, I live in Japan where the SCC tumour marker test is regularly used. I realise it isn't used in the West for a number of reasons, one including the raised level in skin disease sufferers (such as me).   My scalp itch died down about a week ago, the left lymph node could possibly be getting smaller, it's difficult to tell. The right one seems roughly the same size, but I am a little concerned about the shape, it's not perfectly round (like the left) but more of an odd bean shape that is fatter at the top than the bottom (maybe 1 - 1.5cm in length). A camera in the nasal and oral cavity detected no obvious tumour   I've taken an FNA and am 5 days away from the results, I'm wondering if there is anything else I should be concerned about? It seems that SCC occuring at first in the occipital nodes isn't the norm but is entirely possible in lymphoma. Also, are infected lymph nodes always painful? Or is that a case by case affair?  Any help or advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: inflamed bilateral occipital nodes",
    "content": "Hello,  Enlargement of lymph nodes can be due to many causes like infections, inflammatory conditions, and malignant diseases. Lymph nodes generally enlarge in reaction to inflammations or infections in the area drained by them. Since you have skin problem that involves inflammatory changes in the involved part, it is expected to see enlargement in the drained lymph nodes, the occipital group in your case.  When the inflammation or the infection occurs in the drained area in a more or less a chronic course (like yours), the enlarged nodes may enlarge without typical signs of inflammation like being painful, or this phase may pass unnoticed. Nodes generally regress in size with recovery but never disappear. They then from recurrent attacks of inflammation may become enlarged enough to be easily felt.   However, they may become painful if an acute inflammatory changes or infection occurs on top. Direct clinical examination is essential to identify the character of these swellings. If they are benign looking like any non specific nodes (smaller than 1cm, mobile, painless, and soft to firm) your doctor may recommend a follow up. The whole different characters rather than the shape itself are important.  Serial clinical examination is essential, since nodes that continue to grow, or increases in number, as well as the appearance of other involved groups are signs that warrant further investigations.  To my knowledge studies regarding the use of SCC marker in the diagnosis of different malignancies were not conclusive  enough to adopt its recommendation in the clinical practice.  If malignancy is suspected, the best way is to do a histopathologic examination by a biopsy.  Other causes of skin lump like skin cysts and lipomas are also possible. One of them is Sebaceous cyst, an oil secreting glands when blocked they form swellings that are mobile, painless, smooth and roll under the skin when touched.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thanks for all the advice so far.   My FNA results came back from the lab, both tests came back as \"Class II Lymph node\" which the doctor explained means that it is just a normal lymph node. Something I forgot to ask at the time is: \"Does this mean it came back negative for all testable cancers or just SCC?\"  The doctor (a different one from the first one I met) mentioned that we could probably safely end the investigation here, stating that SCC blood test results are always higher in patients suffering from skin inflamatory disorders like eczema.   However, the doctor the previous week said that, if the results come back negative then we should perform a PET scan or open biopsy anyway, as FNA has a relatively high false negative rate. I'm a little confused about what to do. I have a PET scan booked for next week, but my insurance will only cover 70% as it's not classified as \"treatment\". I'm wondering if it's worth taking or not as it'll cost me somewhere in the $400 range after insurance.   Either way, it seems like good news so far *fingers crossed*\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vonwebster, Serum SCC antigen (Squamous cell carcinoma antigen) is one of many epithelial tumor markers. Serum SCC antigen testing is not widely used in clinical practice because it has been found to be elevated in many conditions (such as oral squamous cell carcinomas,some lung cancers, carcinomas of uterine cervix and others) and its sensitivity and specificity (statistical terms which indicate the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have the disease and those who don't) have not been found to be satisfactory. Therefore one needs to be wary of over-diagnosing cancers (such as oral SCC) based on this test alone (sensitivity and specificity has been shown to improve when interpreted in combination with other tumor markers).

    "content": "I had a persistent sore throat, and fatigue from about end of January through mid March, so I went to my PCP.  I told her the exact spot that was bothering me...checked it out - said yes, red spots...sending you to ENT. I also explained my fatigue - in that I could not \"recharge my batteries\" with a good nights sleep, etc. By the time I went to the ENT a week later - said did not see red spots.. I told him the spot that had bothered me...by then it was not constant... would come and gone... seemingly when I was rundown or tired, and I had constant fatigue... Said he did not see anything of great concern, however has had patients present with same symptoms, and they had lymphoma.  Put me on a course of Keflex for two weeks, in case I have an infection going on in my tonsils....   I had significant side effects of persistent headache, and mental confusion, so he just changed me to a Z pack.    Well when washing my hair this morning I noticed a sensitive spot on the back of my head/neck.   Its on the left side where the skull and neck meet.  I think this must be were a lymph node is?  I had basal cell carcinoma on my face a year ago...  I also have lost 15 pounds in last two months, however I had attributed it to cutting beef out of my diet.   Thoughts? My follow up with the ENT is Monday, however of course these have been the longest two weeks of my life....   Anxious as my mom died of cancer 12 years ago... a week to the day we found out she had breast cancer.....  Would would be the next steps, if sore throat does not go away?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Tonsillar cancers usually present as neck masses (lymph nodes).Most common lymph nodes to be involved are the upper deep cervical lymph nodes (jugulo- digastric in particular).Your symptoms and signs are very unlike that of tonsillar cancers.Throat signs and symptoms usually appear late.The suspected lymph node that you mention (possibly occipital group) is also a very unusual site for a tonsillar cancer.Therefore please do not worry (although it is natural that you are concerned due to the family history).Please follow up with your ENT specialist.Good luck!\n\n",

Two not so common possibilities which occur to me are... calcinosis cutis (deposition of calcium salts in the skin)and  osteoma cutis (bone formation in the skin). More commonly, some of the benign skin lesions (ex: epidermoid cysts)may calcify as well. It will be extremely difficult to hazard a guess without actually examining the lesions.Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 37 year old female.  I have had an enlarged lymph node on the left side of my neck in the back right at the hairline.  The Surgical Pathology Report read:   The lymph node sinuses are moderately expanded by a population of histiocytes containing abundant melanin pigment.  There is no evidnece of lymphoma or other neoplastic process.  Dermatopathic lymphadenopathy is often associated with nearby chronic skin conditions such as dermatitis and psoriasis.  Clinical correlation may be helpful.  Gross Description:  Sumbitted is an oval shaped portion of golden yellow fibrofatty tissue which measures 1.8 x 1.6 x 0.8 cm.  Sectioning reveals a 0.5 x 0.5 x 0.4 cm apparent pink-tan lymph node surrounded in part by lobules of golden yellow adipose tissue.  Additional discrete lesions or areas of nodularity are not identified.  Rep. sections including the entire lymph node are submitted.   There is an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node but the surgeon did not remove that one, he said we would wait to see what the one on my neck showed.  I have not had any skin conditions that were suggested above so I wondered what all this means and if I will now have to have the other lymph node removed.  Thank you,  TLK459\n\n",

    "title": "Possible nose/sinus cancer?",
    "content": "Hi, I hope someone can respond, I'm pretty worried about this at this point.  I can't sleep at night I'm so worried.  Here's what's going on.  I have had sore/ raw areas on the inside of my nose for over two months now.  They seem to have a white outer edge if I let my nose dry out.  I waited one month to see if they would go away before seeing family physician.  He thought it was just caused by dry air.  He suggested I try saline gel for two weeks.  I did, no help.  He did refer me to an ENT though.  The ENT tried me on two weeks of Bactroban Nasal.  It helped a little with the local pain the areas cause but now than I'm finished with that the pain is more intense.  Perhaps it just kept the area moist?  I still felt a little pain with Bactroban, but not as bad.  Now, two months later, my sinuses are hurting.  They alternate between burning, like someone is holding a match to them, and dull ache to moderate throbbing pain.  I have to take Advil to help it.  I don't feel like I'm healing and I'm intensley worried that this has something to do with Fiberglass insulation exposure I had about 4-5 years ago.  I installed some in the attic of my new house for about a week, every day.  I had a normal dust mask on, but not a NIOSH approved one.  I had a sore throat after that for a few days.  I tried to make sure I breathed through my nose so I hopefully I didn't get much in my lungs.  My family Physician and ENT seem to just discount this exposure.  I'm a very healthy 38 year old male, no drugs, eat healthy and exercise often.  If these sore areas in my nose are caused by dry air, wouldn't the month of gels I tried heal them?  Also, I have kept the humidity in my house at 45-55% for the last month.  It seemed to help at first, but now the pain is constant.  Also, now, in conjunction with my new burning sinus pain I'm really worried.  I have no cold, no nasal discharge, no sore throat and feel fine.  ENT doesn't think it's cancer b/c he says he sees no ulcer in my nose.  However, he has not even done an endoscopy to look into my sinuses.  Of course, I have read online and seem to have all the symptoms of nose cancer-pain without discharge.  I'm extremely worried because I have read nose cancer can be fast growing and fast spreading, and is usually diagnosed too late.  Also, cancer doesn't have to form an ulcer or tumor to spread.  I'm TRYING to just get them to rule it out early, or find it if that's what it is to start treatment.  It's seems they think I'm worried for nothing.  Does anyone have any thoughts on this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better. I understand your anxiety but you have been to the doctor and you have been given a chance to express your concerns. I think you should be confident in your doctors decision for now. I am not saying ignore your symptoms. Should your symptoms remain unresolved you should continue to seek medical attention.   Nasal cancers are two types those arising from the vestibule and those from the nasal cavity. Common symptoms include a nonhealing nasal ulcer, nasal bleeding, nasal obstruction.   As you can see with the exception of the nonhealing ulcer the symptoms are not specific for cancer which is why most of these cases go undiagnosed until they present with an advanced stage. Also in contrast to other tumors of the head and neck lymph node involvement occurs only rarely in nasal cancer.   Also note that nasal cancer is relatively rare.   I hope this information helps. Please follow up with your doctors.\n\n",

    "title": "Growth/Lump Behind Tonsil, on Oropharyneal Wall",
    "content": "Thank you for taking the time to read my post.  I recently got over a bad cold and sinus infection. I had the usual symptoms---sore throat, bad congestion, cough, fatigue. I got better for a couple of days and then suddenly some of my glands under the left side of my jaw become painful and swollen, but I did not have a sore throat. I decided to check my tonsils to see if they were enlarged or had any white spots, etc. I admit that I looked more thoroughly than even before and when I pushed my tongue down, I noticed something protruding from behind the left tonsil. It's not very big, smooth and rounded, and it's growing from the side wall of my throat. It's somewhat behind that second arch that encapsulates the tonsil, and low...at the base of my tongue. It seems to be a bit lighter in color than the tissue around it. Sort of yellowish at the tip.  I don't seem to have this on the other side, but the right side is a bit more difficult to see because I have a cyst on that tonsil. I understand you'd need to examine me to be certain of a diagnosis, but any idea what this might be? I suppose there's a chance it's been there for some time, since I never look so closely. Could it be part of my tonsil? Or just normal tissue? Another cyst? I recently went to an ENT, but he did not look much in my mouth and I fear he missed it.  I was put on antibiotics for the sinus infection and my swollen glands have been gone for about a week and a half now, but the lump persists. I have no sore throat either. I do have chronic allergies that I'm just now trying to get a hold of with a steroid nasal spray. I also suffer from tonsil stones..  I'd appreciate any insight you could provide. Best, J\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Growth/Lump Behind Tonsil, on Oropharyneal Wall",
    "content": "Hello --  First, I'm troubled that the ENT didn't examine your mouth and throat! But that's in the past now. The thing you describe, along with the history surrounding it, sounds like it is probably a cyst, perhaps a superficial lymph node which lies near the inner surface of your throat. Neck glands are located in both the inner and outer walls of the neck structures. This could also be part of your tonsil or at least closely related to it. Again, the ENT could have laid this to rest quickly had he only done a complete office  exam.   Sometimes a lymph node (or tonsil root) can develop a cyst, and cysts can sometimes be so walled off that antibiotics don't affect them. This does sound, just from your description, like it's probably cystic in nature and, due to your history, one has to suspect the tonsil. I hope you'll go back (or to a different ENT) and have this looked at. It probably isn't a major concern, but now that we know it's there we can't just leave it alone.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

By sticking my finger down my throat, I found a hardish small lump below the left tonsil that has not gone away with antibiotics in the past.   If I press on it, it gives a dullish pain around the surrounding area. The pain is now starting to become worse in the side of the jaw and neck and inside the ear.

    "title": "Re: hard lump below left tonsil with pain for 2 yrs",
    "content": "Hello,  It is very difficult to tell from your description without clinical examination what this swelling could be. However, different causes to be looked for include:  - Chronic tonsillitis that usually results from recurrent inadequately treated acute forms of tonsil infections.  - Recurrent infections especially bacterial ones cause deposition of certain chemicals that makes the tonsils feel hard, a condition known as tonsil stones.  - Lymph node enlargement due to past infections in the throat can also give similar clinical picture.  - Less likely to be a tonsil cancer since it has been of the same size without progression for 2 years. But the unilateral presentation and your past history make exclusion of this possibility mandatory.  You did not mention in which part basal cell carcinoma BCC lesions were diagnosed and how you have been treated. This is very important to exclude disease or treatment related complications.  Clinical examination is essential and investigations (like CT Scan of the neck) are required to exclude serious causes like cancer.   I advise you to seek ENT (ear, nose and throat) specialist consultation..  Hope you find this information useful Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I am a 26 year old female, non smoker occasional drinker. About 4 months ago I discovered an ulcer on the right side edge of my tongue, I told my dentist and he has referred me to the dentist hospital but my appointment is not until march. Before Christmas I discovered that the back wall of pharynx is swollen on the right side but thought I have it checked when I go to the dental hospital.  This week it has got worse, it feels like its obstructing my airways and I have a tingling tense sort of feeling inside my mouth mostly on the right side.  I checked my mouth for any lumps yesterday but couldn't find anything, but there is a redness on my lower gums on the left side and a line just under the root of the teeth. I also think I have a lump in my neck just under my right tonsil.   Over the Xmas break I caught a cold and had fever for a couple of days and my tonsils, especially my right tonsil was swollen. But when I felt the right tonsil there was another lump under the tonsil that felt really tender to touch. Not sure if it was a separate lump or the tonsil but it felt like another lump.  I also had a lot of problem drinking as it felt like I couldnt breathe, almost wheezing and the same happen right after a meal.  I discovered that by taking a couple of ibuprofens this would get slightly better. I had this breathing problem for a week and only felt it again after drinking an alcoholic drink, so I havent been drinking alcohol since then.  This week the problem has got worse as all my right side in back of throat feels swollen, it feels unconfortable eating, I have a feeling of being full constantly even though i get hungry. I have a pain in my chest where the ribs meet and it feels like someone is squeezing the pipe from my throat down to my stomach.I also get tension head aches really bad and I normally never have problems with headaches.  Is this cancer or could it be something else? I constantly worry that I have got mouth or eosphagal cancer.   Thank you for listening.  Vanilth\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Four weeks ago I noticed the growth of two neck lumps, each approximately three to four centimeters in extent, lying symmetrically, on both sides, in my supraclavicular fossa,  between clavicle and trapezius. Interestingly, their size is varying. A week ago, they were almost gone; Now they reappeared.   Their shape has no special features. They are very smooth, and painless - both in a normal and in a pressed state. There are no harder structures beneath the lumps (at least, I am not capable of feeling anything). I am not experiencing any difficulties.  The first time they appeared I was having long and daunting conversations, due to my job, and I was constantly sitting in a most uncomfortable way. Hence, my back/shoulders hurt and I often had a dry throat. I seldom drink water.   Additionally, I smoke regularly. I am worried that it might be something more serious.  Thank you in advance,  - Celestis\n\n",

    "content": "I am 31 years old, diagnosed with Ankylosing Spondylitis (Arthritis Disease) and Osteoporosis. I have been on Remicade for one year, then Humira for 6 Months, then switched to Enbrel and I am currently taking 50Mg Weekly. About 6 months ago, I found that I had some swelling on my left shoulder. My Rhuematolgist says it was muslce related or could be some fluid built up. A few months later, I go to Rhuematologist again for regular appointment and show him that I still have soft swelling at times on my left shoulder/neck. He suggest an MRI to be safe. They diagnosed me with a Benign Tumor of the Fatty Tissue and said this requires no treatment and it is not a big issue. I have done some research on the net and found out that there is no way they can tell if it benign or Malignant unless they do a biopsy of the soft tissue. Is this true? Also, since I have a swelling there, I have recenlty (in the past two years) gained 40 pounds. This weight gain has been mostly in my belly area. I have had a good appetite since I have been on the biologic medicine, but what if I have growth there and didn't know it? I am scheduled to go to an oncologist (my choice) for a second opinion. I am concered of the medicines I am using. They are known to cause certain cancers. Can this benign tumor lead into malignant? What is the survival rate of having a benign tumor?  Your answers would be appreciated very much.  Thanks, Phil\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is very difficult to tell what a swelling could be without direct clinical examination. Associated symptoms and signs are very helpful to characterize the swelling and guide in defining the possible causes.  MRI can give a good idea about the anatomic characters as well as the possible nature of a swelling like being a cyst, or solid and its fat content. On the MRI scan, the lipoma is seen as a bright, well defined mass and although MRI can make a benign tumor more likely to be the cause exclusion of malignant nature is not possible. However, the results of the MRI in the context of the clinical information can be strong enough to exclude malignancy.    Based on clinical results, the physician may consider a follow up examination of the swelling if the swelling is thought to be of benign nature.  Swellings that continue to grow are alarming and should be investigated properly.  It is true however; you can never know the nature of a swelling unless tissue diagnosis is done (biopsy and histopathology studying).  Taking a second opinion is always a valid option and hope you will be reassured by the results.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Base of the tongue mass bilateral adenopathy - not cancer?",
    "content": "I'm a 42 years old male, about 5 month ago, I had a severe sore throut very hi fever that would not come down with Motrine Tylonol. fever mantained 40 C degrees and with motrain will stay at 39.5 C. It all started on Thursaday with a feeling of havenies in my throut and by friday morning I woke up with chilles hight fever and sore throut that will radiate to my ears wehn trying to swallow. I spent all friday and all night with hight fever and sore throut. on Saturday I went to doctor and they did a culture for streo throut that came out negative, the throut was red but no other findings. the DR gave me an antibiotics shut and pills for ten days and asked to come back the next day if things stay the same. fever went down to 38.5 C with 3 pilles of motrain at a time. The next day i went back for the second antibiotics shut and gradully by monday the fever started to subside but the sore throut took about 2 weeks to get better. since then and for about a month I always had pain in my right side of my front neck that is vertical and into my jaw and occanssional dull ache in my ear with stiff neck and ache throut.  about four weeks after this, I went to my doctor for the pain that I'm having so she orderd a CT scan for my neck. the result of the ct scan showed Mildly enlarged Lymph nodes scattered on both sides of the neck roughly equally on both sides and are present in the submandibular region, the largest node on the left measuers about 1.05 CM and is seen anterior to the Jugular vein at the level of the hyoid. There is also soft tissue prominence in the area of the valleculae. The conclusion of this scan was: Some Cervical adenopathy is present and appears to be fairly symmetric side to side, there is also soft tissue Fullness at the region of the base of the tongue and Valleculae, this may also relate to lymphoid hyperplasia, althought it is difficult to exclude a mass in this region, Correlation with direct visulization is recomanded.  My Dr reffered me to ENT and I was seen by his asisstance who preformed a endoscopy of my nose and throut and told me that she can see some fullness and the area is irretated. after telling her that I have reflux and I take omeparzol for it she gave me a dose of 2 weeks Amoxilene 825mg and asked me that I take my reflux medication and repeat the CT scan after 3 weeks.  I so did, after 4 weeks I repeated the CT scan in a different facillaty then the first sacn. and was scheduled for an appoitment with the ENT after two weeks, the 2nd scan result showed the following:  Base of the tongue mass which occupies the vallecula bilaterally althought silghtly larger on the right. The mass mesaures 2.5 CM in transverse X 2.0 CM in AP dimension.  Bilateral level II to level IV lymphadenopathy. the largest on the left jugulodigastric lymph node measures 1.6 CM and the largest on the right mesaures 1.6 cm, several subcentimeter level V nodes also noted bilaterally. small posterior neck nodes are noted the largest on the left measureing 1.0 CM  Conclusion was :  1- Base of the tongue/vallecular lesion consistent with head and neck squamous cell Carcinoma, Lymphoma is also a possible differential consideratin, Biopsy is Recommended.  My ENT DR called me and asked me to make may visite to his office this week rather then in 2 weeks.   I went and he took another look and he told me that he is not 100% convenced that it is cancer and he wantetd me to go for a biobsy in 2 weeks. when I asked him what is persantge he said 50/ 50 %.  So if possible if the MD in this forum can make sence to me on this.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Base of the tongue mass bilateral adenopathy - not cancer?",
    "content": "Hello,  At the initial presentation your symptoms were very suggestive of infection in the upper aerodigestive tract (throat, and tonsils that spread to the ear). However, the fact that it lasted all of this period is not reassuring. In this case doctors would think of an abscess formation, chronic inflammatory condition from chronic irritation or a malignancy as the underlying cause of this chronic pain.  Nasopharyngoscopes allows a thorough visualization of the upper aerodigestive tract in the clinic and is very useful to see lesions in the base of the tongue. Your first CT results were suggestive of reactionary lymph node enlargement (post infection) and an inflammation in the base of the tongue and your throat (complicated).  Your physician is absolutely right to recommend another FU CT scan to exclude serious causes like malignancy. A contrast enhanced is a reliable technique to detect both the presence of neoplasms, and its spread to surrounding spaces as well as to lymph nodes but it is never diagnostic.   Although the tongue lesion became more prominent as well as the involved lymph nodes, this could be due to chronic inflammation or infection in the upper aerodigestive tract. The fact that you have GERD makes this a likely scenario although it GERD a risk factor for developing malignant tumours in the upper GI tract.  The only way to confirm the nature of this lesion is by histopathological examination for a biopsy.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor, only by thorough history and clinical examination the proper management can be reached.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You are welcome. The CT scan can only take pictures of different parts of the body describing characters of a mass; where it sees a mass, its boundaries and possible intralesional changes like break down etc. So its value is in making physician more suspicious about an aetiology and as a guidance to his next step in investigations.   So the idea is not that the CT reports a malignant mass and it turns out to be benign, but it suggests that this mass warrants more investigations to exclude malignancy. And this is what your doctor is doing regardless how likely the mass could be malignant.  Your physician said his estimate based on your clinical course of the disease and the CT findings, so he can not be certain unless he sees the histopathology report.  Hope you find this is useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Hope your wife is getting better.  First I would like to mention some information about Squamous paplilloma of the tongue. It is a benign proliferation of squamous cells that is thought to be due to infection with certain type of virus known as human papillomavirus (HPV).  They are treated with conservative surgical excision and some physicians may leave it under follow up since there are no reports that suggested its transformation into malignant disease.  Regarding multiple myeloma, it is a disseminated malignancy of monoclonal plasma cells (blood cells). The plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow resulting in bone marrow failure and bone destruction. These two sites are the main sites affected by the disease. Thus patients usually present with anemia, recurrent infections and bone pains. Renal functions are frequently affected in this disease by different mechanisms.   Patients are usually diagnosed based on different laboratory blood and urine tests, skeletal survey and bone marrow aspirate and biopsy. Laboratory tests include CBC, LFT, KFT, Serum and Urine electrophoresis and immunofixations. LDH and B2 microglobulin are routinely requested and are indicatives for the tumor burden.  Based on laboratory tests and clinical findings, patients are divided into those with indolent or active disease that needs treatment.  Treatment of multiple myeloma has been in progress in the last few years although none of the available approaches is considered curative. The disease however is very responding to treatments.   It would be more helpful if you can provide us with her results and the possible treatment recommended by her doctor.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

It doesn't hurt, unless I feel it more than not, then it slightly aches.  My jaw on that side has been aching off and on, but I'm not sure if it's because of the lump, or randomly because of my TMJ which hasn't acted up in years (and still isn't, really).

    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to tell what this swelling could be without direct examination. Associated symptoms and signs make it more easily to think of possible causes. However, a swelling in this area could be an enlarged lymph node or salivary gland related swelling.  Since most stones of the salivary gland ducts do not block a duct completely, they usually result mild gland swelling, and dull pain over the gland that increase after meals especially sour ones. A stone of the size you described may lead to complete occlusion of the duct resulting in more pain and swollen gland.  So early diagnosis and proper management is important. Proper hydration would be helpful while waiting for your doctor\u2019s visit.  A stone can be seen by X-ray picture.  The other possibility would be an enlarged lymph node due to inflammation or previous infections in the area drained by them. In this case the drained area would include the oral cavity, the tempromandibular joint, the gland and the ear.  Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude any other causes. Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Diagnosis of any swelling mandates direct clinical examination. Diagnosis of any lump would be easier when associated symptoms and signs are present. This includes mobility, tenderness, pain, consistency (soft, firm or hard) and any systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss.  However, at this site it could be an enlarged lymph node (posterior cervical group). If infection or inflammation occurs in the area drained by these nodes, they grow in size and become painful. When infection or inflammation subsides they regress in size but never disappear. This group of lymph nodes drains the ear, scalp and the skin of the upper back and the posterior part of the neck.  So, these nodes remain palpable, painless, rubbery in consistency and usually less than 1 cm in diameter. They may be painful when you frequently press causing a sort of inflammation. Other causes of lymph node enlargement include systemic diseases and cancer.  Other causes include: A folliculitis which is inflammation of the hair follicle forming a swelling that is soft to firm, painful or tender, warm and may decline in size or disappear after recovery from the infection.  Lipoma, a benign tumour of the fat cell that is felt soft mobile and not painful or tender unless inflamed.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Direct clinical examination and a thorough history are essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

So he sent me for a FNA the test results for that came back and they told me they were benign. And the doctor sent me to a specialist. The specialist said my symptons sounded like Hashimotto's disease he also sent me for a CT scan with IV contrast which came back saying that i have no significant cervical lymphadenopathy with occasional subcentimetre lymph nodes noted likely reactive in nature unlikely to be significant. And the study is otherwise within normal limits what does this mean.  Also i am very tired all the time and have noticed a lot of bruises on my legs and arms and don't know how i get them.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: multinodular thryroid and subcentimetre lymph nodes",
    "content": "Hello,  Hashimoto's thyroiditis or chronic lymphocytic thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease in which the body immune cells attack cells of the thyroid. This is a common cause of thyroid hypofunction. However, an increase in the level thyroid hormones released from the damaged thyroid gland occurs early in the course of this disease.   So patients usually present initially with thyroid gland enlargement make them feel throat tightness and swallowing difficulty. Patient then go into a phase of thyroid hypofunction, so they may complain of fatigue, depression, difficulty in concentration, dry skin and excessive sleepiness. Some patients have also antibodies that attack their platelets causing thrombocytopenia and easy bruise (an autoimmune thrombocytopenia).  Complete history, physical examination and investigations are essential for diagnosis and exclusion of other causes of thyroid dysfunction (benign or malignant).   Lab tests include thyroid function tests: T3, T4 and TSH. Typically, there is an elevated TSH while T3 and T4 are low (may be normal or high initially). TSH help determine if the cause of hypothyroidism is central (low TSH in hypothalamic or pituitary causes) or a primary thyroid disease (high TSH).  Testing for thyroid autoantibodies is also helpful to diagnose Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Thyroid US and CT scan are recommended as needed.  US is used to guide for thyroid FNA. Hashimoto thyroiditis is also diagnosed based on histology with diffuse infiltration of the thyroid gland with inflammatory cells.   Treatment is usually medical with hormone replacement according to symptoms and lab results. While surgery is kept for complicated cases.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with your symptoms. Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

My doctor thinks it gas because my CT scan didn't show anything. Other than that I haven't develope any other symptoms and I also recently visit my doctor again and took another blood test and again didn't find anything strange.

After treatment of infection with adequate course of antibiotics, they should regress in size but some may never return to normal size.

    "content": "Hello, Most of the thyroid nodules that are discovered accidentally are benign; however diagnostic evaluation is mandatory in suspicious cases.  The most common approaches for diagnostic evaluation of a solitary thyroid nodule include: complete history taking, clinical examination, measurement of the serum TSH level, thyroid hormones, and FNAC.   Nodules smaller than 1cm are usually benign while those of 4 cm or more are highly suspicious. Nodules in between are investigated accordingly considering other risk factors like patient history of neck irradiation, age and gender as well as their characters by ultrasonography.  Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) test can only distinguish euthyroid status from hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism.  Low TSH level indicate hyperthyroidism while high TSH makes hypothyroidism a possibility.  If TSH level is normal, FNAC should be done.  Thyroid ultrasonography can help determine if this nodule is solid or cystic and as a guidance for FNAB. Malignancy uspicious criteria by ultrasonography include central hypervascularity, microcalcification and irregular borders.  Treatment approache whether medical, surgical or both is decided according to the results of investigations including the cytopathology.  Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 38 year old female with a history of smoking.  About 3 months ago I noticed that my neck on the right side was becoming very sore.  It has continued to worsen and I noticed a small hard lump on that side behind the muscle in about the middle of my neck.  I have pain inside my neck and ear areas and now another lump in front of my ear.  I don't know if they are lymph nodes or what.  I have been to two doctors, one of which is an ENT and have been prescribed Analox for 10 days.  But I've never experienced such a stiff and sore neck for such a prolonged period.  The ENT told me to come back for a scan if the lump gets bigger.  My question is, how long do I wait to see if this thing is ever going to go away?  I don't seem to have any other symptoms of cancer, like weight loss or anything, but what could this be?  I don't want to sound like a worry-wart but I would like the lumps to go away and my neck to go back to normal.  Any advice you give me would be really appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The swellings you have described are probably enlarged Lymph nodes as they occur in lymph node regions and are associated with an infection in the area drained by this lymph node group which include the ears and the throat.   Following infection, lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender.  They regress in size and become painless only when the infection is treated. So you should expect them to resolve when all inflammatory signs subside.   Infection is controlled after complete course of antibiotic which may takes two to three weeks according to the severity and site of infection. The critical point is recognizing the source of infection for proper antibiotic description. This may require culture and sensitivity from the throat or any discharge.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

When this happens they still function normally but are able to be felt easier.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written an article on lymph nodes that you may find helpful.  It can be found here.

    "content": "Hi, I am 15 years old and about a year ago I noticed two lumps right behind both my ears, kind of on the bone that runs behind it. They and kind of soft but a little hard and you can move them a little, they are kind of like the lumps dogs get when they get older but these are smaller, kind of bean-sized. Scince then I have noticed 2 more around the middle right and middle left of my head, around the same place on both sides. They don't hurt at all but they seem to sometimes be smaller or larger than other times. I've been quite worried at what these are for some time now. I've though maybe they could be a build up of fat because I am quite big. But I am worried so if someone could please help that would be great. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  About 7 months ago I found a hardish, pea sized lump in my right cheek. It is very difficult to feel and is sort of situated almost under my cheekbone about 4cm from my ear. I went to my GP who referred me to the hospital. The Doctor there felt it and said that it was a lymph node. She asked me if I had any symptoms, which I didn't and then said that I should go back in six months.She said that ideally they would do a scan, but they couldn't. I have since been to my Dentist and told him about it, he didn't seem unduly concerned and said that there was nothing wrong with my mouth. I am due to go back in about 3 weeks to the hospital and am now getting a bit concerned. The lump is still there, I have had a few symptoms, for example a few nosebleeds and a sinus type pain on that side of my face. Sometimes my ear or my eye socket ache a bit too. I don't know what to make of it all really. To make things more confusing, this morning I woke up and found a red rash on both my lymph glands either side of my neck. Can anyone shed any light on this? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pol70,  Occasionally after a lymph node has enlarged due to infection they may not shrink back down to their previous, unnoticeable size.  Instead, they remain slightly enlarged, usually about the size of a pea as your has.  These lymph nodes are still functioning normally just a little bigger.  Your new symptoms may be due to a new viral infection.  Also, occasionally lymph nodes can become infected so if the lymph node becomes tender to the touch and the redness develops above it you should have it checked out.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written an article on lymph nodes that may be helpful for you.  It can be found here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Young Female With Lump Behind Left Ear",
    "content": "Greetings! I am a 24 year old, generally healthy and happy female.  I'm average weight and average height, maybe a 10 lb increase in the winter because of all these yummy holidays!  I have identical twin daughters who are 8 years old (yes, the math doesn't lie, I was the warning for all of my peers!)  I've been pretty active and healthy all my life with only the usual colds and bumps and scrapes.    After my girls were born I did go through a depression which was successfully treated with anti-depressants for about 2 years.  I go to the doctor every few years for my check-ups, don't smoke or do drugs but I do drink a few times a month with my girlfriends at book club meetings.  I've coached the softball team for both my girls and I've always been the person to always be up for anything... even though I do love my 10 hours of sleep I can occasionally survive on 6 if I must.  About a month and a half ago I thought I might be suffering from depression again because I was constantly tired and run down and wanting to sleep all day long but no other real symptoms of depression.  I was put on Effexor XR 150mg.  I've also taken an oral birth control (Yasmine) for the past 5 years faithfully with no side effects.  In the past month I've began having severe night sweats (so bad I drench my husband!) and during the day I will have excessive sweating also.  And still I've felt constantly run down and I come home from work and have to MAKE myself do the things I love.  I called the doc (who is great, by the way) and gave the nurse a run down and she passed on that those things were probably side effects from the  effexor.  Makes sense to me.  So I still take my meds and I still have the side effects and they aren't getting any better or worse so on I trudge.  On Thanksgiving of all days I discovered a lump behind my left ear (not one behind my right ear) that isn't really painful or sore itself but I think it is sort of pressing on the area and causing the skin to stretch uncomfortably around it which was why I discovered it.    The lump is about an inch behind my earring back and up a smidge (is that medical lexicon or what!?!) and it feels like it is maybe a little bigger than a new pencil eraser.  It's still there today (Saturday evening so 3 days and counting) and hasn't changed that I've noticed.   I haven't been sick myself but everyone I know is battling a sniffle or cough or whatever else is going around right now.   So I googled \"lump in neck behind ear\" and this was the first result and here I am after reading some other questions.   What I would like is some piece of mind... is this something I can watch for a few weeks until the next winter break and then make a doc's appointment (I'm an assistant at a public school...) or is this something I need to take care of soon?  My husband is apt to think I'm probably fine and jokes that the worst thing it could be is an alien implant (haha...) and I want to think so too... but darn that google and that wikipedia too... waaaayyyy too much information for the masses!  :)   I appreciate any help or guidance anyone can offer.  It is a Saturday evening, after all, and I have to live with any self-imposed fear until at least Monday morning so any calming or soothing will be much hoorayed! Regards, Laura Gayle PS... do not even joke that my hubby could be right about the implant thing... he would get too much enjoyment out of it and I'd never hear the end of it!  :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Laura,  The lump you are feeling behind your ear is likely an enlarged lymph node.  With your symptoms of fatigue, night sweats, etc. and this lymph node I wonder if you actually have an infection rather than it being side effects of your effexor.  In particular, I am suspicious of an infection with a virus called Ebstein Barr Virus, the virus that causes mono.  Depending on where you live, this may also be an infection such as Valley Fever (from coccidioides immitis).    I don't necessarily think this is an emergency, you should probably be seen soon.  It is probably reasonable to wait until break if you need.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr, Thankyou for you time and assistance. I am a 32 yr old Female, non smoker who is relatively fit and active. I have previously been diagnosed with Sphincter of Oddi Dysfunction, for which I have undergone two Sphincterotomies via ERCP. I have Eczema, mainly affecting my hands, legs and scalp and regularly suffer from Tonsilitis and Pharyngitis, though have not had an infection for several months. There is Cancer on both my maternal and paternal sides along with Renal disease, Cardiac Disease and IDDM. As a teenager I had several hard lumps on the back of my skull, behind my ears which would intermittently be painful and swollen and at the time, these were diagnosed as Sebacious cysts. I've never had need to question this and have put up with their \"flair ups\". Recently, however, I discovered an extremely visible and palpable, yet painless lump on the Right side of my neck on the line of my Sternocledomastoid muscle. My GP sent me for Utrasounds and the report was that this, along with the \"lumps\" on my skull were in fact, benign reactive lymph nodes. Why are these nodes intermittently painful (skull) in the absence of any apparent infection (my ezcema on my scalp is no infected) and why does this node in my neck appear to fluctuate in size?  There is a smaller, yet corresponding node on the left side also. It is not really painful, though is tender if palpated. The Nodes on my skull, which I believe to be the Post auricular nodes as well as some sub occipital nodes are firm and rubbery, though a couple are very hard and solid. In total, I have clusters of about 8 on each side. Should I have more investigations? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Concerned Rvn,  Lymph nodes often will swell and shrink as they are actively fighting an infection.  A person may or may not actually become sick.  Actually, if the lymph nodes and the immune system are successful the person will not become sick.  So, most likely, you are noticing the lymph nodes swelling while they are fighting off an infection that you may or may not have been symptomatic from.  Occasionally, after a lymph node has become enlarged, it may not shrink back down to it's original size.  Instead, it may stay about 1 cm in size.  When this happens the lymph node continues to function properly, only it is a bit bigger than before.  These nodes are referred to as \"shotty\" nodes because they can feel like B-B's under the skin (similar to buckshot).   My colleague, Dr. Fouad, had written a very good article on lymph nodes that you may find helpful.  It can be found here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your question is very theoretical and hard to answer in a specific manner without a more specific description of the situation. Generally speaking, in most cases that already have cancer, trauma to the cancer can increase the local symptoms, simply because the surrounding tissue is usually friable and weak in its resistance to trauma. However, from a biological perspective trauma per se is not a factor that alters cancer biology or leads to the progression of cancer.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thank you very much for taking the time to read my question. I am a 37 year old female. Have a lymph node on the back of my neck about an inch below the hair line and midway between ear and spine on the right side. I know its a lymph node because I found it early in the spring time by accident...I ended up taking Allegra and never found it again...fast foward to late August, I find the bump again!   I (and I am not kidding) ran to my pcp to have her look at it. She said it is a lymph node and she wasnt worried about it, she asked if I had any allergies or had a cold. I told her yes...then its gone again...  The other day the middle back of my head felt sore, so I had my friend look at it, she says...eeewww...there just a red spot, then a few days later, hubby looks at it...says its a zip and squeezes it!! Nice...I wasnt expecting that...anyhoo...  A day or two later I notice that the right side of the back of my head is sore...down low near the base of my skull...like someone rubbed it really hard...I do wear a baseball hat almost everyday to keep the sun out of my face. So, my friend looks at that area and says...its a bit flakey...I do not normally have dandruff or anything. So...my husband says to me at 1am...whats that? While rubbing my neck...and sure enough, the lymph node is back...so I PANIC and then he says...oh, thats always been there...  I have a friend who is a neurologist who told me to \"leave it alone, it'll resolve itself\" I don't want to seem paranoid...but I am...  I am wondering (and I did miss two doses of the allegra before my husband found the bump again) if missing the allegra d and then having what I am assuming is a pimple of some sort could have caused the lymph node to reappear?  It is round, sorta pea sized, and isnt really hard, but isnt squishy...doesnt move much...it was this way when doc felt and saw it...also...and I had hubby check too...after taking two more doses of allegra d...it appears to be slightly smaller...and I almost always have post nasal drip when I don't take it...  I am completely beside myself with worry...and am afraid I am going to die from this...  Any idea?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Scaredsilly234,  Lymph nodes can swell and shrink repeatedly.  They generally swell when there is an infection in the body and reduce in size once the infection improves.    Generally, lymph node swelling is not caused by allergies, which the allegra treats, so missing the doses of allegra is unlikely to have contributed to it returning.  It may be that the small pimple you had (which is actually a small infection) was the reason the lymph node returned.    If the lump itself becomes painful you should have it evaluated since lymph nodes, themselves, can become infected.  Otherwise, it is unlikely to be a problem and you should be ok just having your doctor check it out the next time you are in.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have never taken keflex...I don't know if I will have any probs (hate taking meds)...I am going to use the Nizarol they gave me and see if that helps...  Anyhoo...he indicated the nodes were swollen due to the inflammation/infection being filtered through the nodes...nice...  BTW and preference for choice of meds?

Since then I have had an enlarged lymph node located by the back of my right jaw and below my ear. The node is tender to the touch, and hasn't changed much in a little over one month. Back when I had my Strep diagnosed I also had a CBC done which came back reading normal levels. I have not experienced any fatigue or weight loss and appear otherwise healthy. My main concern with this though is that my brother was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma back in 2003 when he was 21. Should I be concerned from a genetic standpoint and have a doc check it out, or should I wait it out, seeing that the lymph node was probably a result from the infection in July?

I would recommend you have this evaluated by your doctor because you may actually have a smoldering infection in the node that may need further antibiotics to help it clear.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rosie75,  Unfortunately, I am also uncertain why this would happen.  My only thought is that sometimes when we do more invasive tests like a biopsy we find out that what actually is present is different from what we thought was present.  Perhaps your nodule was firm all along and the studies simply gave the impression that it was cystic.  I'm really not able to give you a good reason why it would become solid if it really was cystic in the beginning.  If all the preliminary tests are coming back benign (not cancer) it is most likely that the final will as well.  It is still important to follow up on this though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Recently i noticed a lump above my collarbone on the left side.  I have constant pain in my shoulder, collarbone, throat and neck area on the left side and sometimes i get this weird/pain feeling in my throat when i talk/sing. I have been seeing my doctor and surgeon and they say its just an enlarged lymph node. but it is really hurting and affecting my work and everything. i cant get through an 8 hour shift without going home early due to pain. i keep telling the doctor that it hurts a lot and they just say that it will go away. i had a ct scan and my surgeon said he couldnt see anything wrong. This is the worst feeling i have ever had and i don't know what to do about it because the doctors don't have any answers. i see the doc on tuesday and am demanding to see a specialist. Another condition i have that might be related is that i got this red spot on my ankle that turned into a scab like spot and another appeared on my arm. its just a small spot but why is it there.why do i get these dried out/flaky spots. Im only 21 and i have these weird things happening and no one knows why so i thought i see if anyone else has the same symptoms and if anyone can help.\n\n",

There is a large lump next to my ear only when I open and close my mouth, which my NP and dentist say is a swollen TMJ (I have had clicking and pain for a long time). I also found a small lump directly beneath that which I believe is a lymph node. It is not visible but I can feel it. I also have had a movable pea-sized node in my lower neck that I noticed about 3 months ago as well. I'm told the nodes are soft and are not sizable enough to be of concern, and the one in front of my ear is probably enlarged because of the TMJ swelling. I have an appt with an ENT, but not for a month and a half. Does the diagnosis sound plausible? I've never heard of node swelling with TMJ. Thank you.\n\n",

It has not changed in size, but I feel like there is somethng stuck in my throat and I have pain under my arms and in my left shoulder. I have not been running a fever or lost weight, but I have been very fatigued and my memory seems to be getting worst. My GP said it was assoicated with a bad tooth. He ran a thyroid test, it was normal. I had a root canal on # 13 four years ago that has failed. I am having that fixed in two weeks.   My questions are: Should I be worried if this doesn't correct the lump, pain etc. I was talking with my mother and she reminded me that my grandfather had to have his lymph nodes (in same area) removed due to cancer. How much does his history increase my risk of cancer?  Should I wait to see if the second root canal corrects the problem or see a different Doctor?\n\n",

I just turn 32 years old today and scared about it being cancer. I will have ultrasound done on Monday so that my doctor can schedule surgery.

The one is 4mm and the other two is 2mm and all on my right side of my thyroid. My left lympth node is still enlarged and no infection. The enlargement of the left lympth node and hardness is caused by thyroid nodule. I go for thyroid and lympth biopsy on Aug 2 to determine what it is. They think that the rapid heart beats,headaches,and neck swelling has to do with the thyroid nodule. Being that there is more then one nodule and still swelling is it better to take out the right side of thyroid and left lympth node rather then medication? I can not take any oral medications due to gastroparesis it will flare it up to the point that as soon as I take oral medication three hours later I end up in the er and admitted. Any medication I have to take for infection or something else it has to be injection or iv infusion so basically I am a tough case. Is surgery the right route for me? If he would say to wait 6 months or a year to see if any changes can I opt to say no and have him take it out on my request as a precaution?\n\n",

    "content": "I' m sorry for posting this twice (in another forum) but I noticed there were different doctors in this forum and may you would have a different opinion.  Brief history...I smoke. I smoked for 10 years, quit for 5 and have been smoking again for about 4 years.I am wanting to quit and trying, but it is difficult.  I am a white female, age 39. I have what feels like a lump in my throat. I went to the doc back in February and discussed the lump as well as cronic heart burn. I underwent an Upper GI which came back clear,(no Peptic ulcer, no damage to my esophagus, no hernia) but showed I have reflux. The doc put me on Prevacid and my sympoms cleared up, however....the lump has returned. I started getting a little breakthrough acid, so I started supplementing with Pepcid AC, which I have OK'd with my doctor. I also take Flonaise and sometimes a decongestant or Alavert as I have allergies. I have been under some stress and recently quit my job, as that was the primary cause of my stresses. The family and I took a vacation and the lump went away while we were on vacation, but has since returned. The lump was so bad this morning that I vomited, because I felt I was being gagged.  I also notices a mild wheezing sound but that went away upon clearing of my throat, which it seems I do that a lot now.  No major cough or even a smokers cough.  I just need to clear my throat a little more than usual.  I found this information on the internet and was wondering if someone could read it and tell me if this could be what it is. I do not have any symptoms of cancer (I used to suffer from some minor hoarseness, but that has since cleared up and I haven't had that problem in several weeks) no unexplaned weight loss, no Coughing up blood or anything like that. My mother thinks it is post nasal drip, but I can't be sure. Can you check out this web sight and let me know if this is legit, as it describes my symptoms to a T. The lump disappears when I sleep and when I eat, it comes back after eating and shortly after I wake up in the morning.   http://www. voicedoctor. net/therapy/cps. html   Could this be what I have, or do you think I need to maybe increase my doseage of Prevacid or maybe change to Nexium, which from what I have read, helps heal the esophagus?  Thanks for any information.\n\n",

    "content": "After going through a lymphoma scare earlier in the year, it was discovered by a hygenist that I have a lump in what appears to be the Parotid gland area, more under the ear in between the ear and the jaw.  Went to my Primary - he sent me for MRI and the to ENT.  Saw ENT on Monday and MRI was normal, but he did not seem to think an MRI would show anything anyway.  He can feel the lump, I just think he thought it was the wrong test to do.  He is leaning towards a Parotid Gland tumor, but said of course it could be a lymph node as well.  He put me on antibiotics, but seeing as I have not been sick he does not think it will help, just protocol.  I go back on Monday and he said if it is still there they will do an FNA.  He said if it is cancer he thinks we will have caught it very early.  Any advice?  How would he know if it was a lymph node or tumor?  Will he do and FNA even if he does not know which one it is?  Thanks!  Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Great questions.  This is a relatively common issue that people deal with.  The location you are describing is an area where lymph nodes are commonly found.  This, alone, does not rule out a parotid tumor since these also would be found in this area.    The FNA (fine needle aspiration) is used to determine which of these (or some other option) the lump is.  Your doctor does not need to know if the lump is a lymph node or tumor since the FNA will give the answer.  If he is able to determine which it is, the FNA may not be needed.  A FNA is a relatively simple procedure.  A small needle is used to remove a small part of the mass.  This part is then analyzed under a microscope to determine what the lump is.  Following up with your ENT doctor is the key.  I would certainly not be certain that this is a tumor as the chances are good that it may be a lymph node.  However, it is far from 100% so if there is any suspicion that it may be a tumor the FNA is probably a good idea.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If it is a non cancerous tumor - will they know that from the FNA as well?  Or will I just get answers as to if we need to remove a tumor or do open biopsy of lymph node?  I am sure you understand the waiting is the hardest part!    I had previous DCIS on left side - same side as node or tumor and had radiation to chest wall and breast on that side.  So, of course I get a little nervous about these things.  Also, he could feel some small lymph nodes on my right side of neck - where I originally earlier in the year had big lymph nodes that were a scare for lymphoma - but, never biopsied.  I go to ENT on Monday so will update you on what I find!  Thanks again!  Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "The FNA is likely to be able to answer all the questions as to what the lump is-cancer, non-cancer or normal lymph node.  Usually preliminary results come back relatively quickly, 1-3 days or so (even though these days may seem eternally long).  If more specialized staining of the tissue is needed or other specialized tests it may take longer to get these results.  Generally the answer of cancer or not cancer can be made in the first reviews of the tissue.  If, unfortunately, it is cancer the more specialized tests may be needed to help specifically type it and get information about how to treat it.  Having lymph nodes swollen on the other side at the same time actually tends to favor an enlarged lymph node (statistically) although this, too, does not rule out cancer.  Having the previous DCIS does increase the chances of having a recurrent cancer, although it seems a less likely area for breast cancer to spread to.  The radiation should have been well focused to minimize exposure of the parotid gland and other structures except those in the direct path of the radiation beam.  This makes a secondary tumor in this area less likely but, again, not 100%  I look forward to your update.  I completely understand how long the next few days will seem to you.  Try not to dwell on it being cancer.  Best to stay optimistic and await the answers.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I also have a very small cyst found on my kidney about 5 years ago that has been watched with CT scan and has not changed, don't know if that is the cause or not? saw Oncologist today that saw no reason for additional blood work up but was sent to  an ENT today had light run down throat again said it looked like inflammation at base of tongue could be causing a shooty node or spent node from childhood to swell.  I will be having a more indepth look next week under sedation and they will biopsy the base of my tongue while in there.  no one seems to want to biopsy the actual node because of location it is close to my jugular  any thing else that I should have checked out?  does this sound like the right course?  I'm just at a lose right now and worried to death\n\n",

I am a 30 yo female with a very hard, fixed, golf ball size lump just above my collar bone(along with drenching night sweats, severely itchy legs to the point I scratch until I bleed and radiating pain down my left arm). This started out as a pea sized lump in November. I finally decided to seek the advice of my dr. He sent me to get a CT scan with contrast and it came back clear. I am so confused and wondering if I should seek another opinion. I am not feeling well and need to get this resolved. Any help would be so greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Just below the skull is another one right below the first one on my neck, I assumed it was an insect bite or something, but it isn't going away, no redness. I am a little worried about it, but have no health insurance and do not want to go rushing into the dr. for nothing. Any advice would be very nice.

    "content": "Dear Adriennesmom, Are you having any headaches with these bumps or are they only locally tender?  An insect bite would not necessarily become reddened, and could stay swollen for several days. If you suspect an insect bite, you may wish to check with your MD if taking Diphenhydramine (Benadryl) may help.  An insect bite that swells is actually a tyoe of an allergic reaction to the toxin of the insect.  Diphenhydramine and even OTC Ranitidine (Zantac) may help.  The former is an antihistamine commonly used for stuffy noses and as a sleep aid in meds such as Tylenol PM.  The latter is a H-2 bloccker - a different type of histamine blocker.  You may also try applying an ice pack to the area for 20 minutes on and 20 minutes off for a couple hours and see if it helps decrease the localized inflammation. If there is headache or changes in vision or sensation anywhere else, it would be wise to be evaluated at the local ER, or urgent care clinic.  As always, if the bumps change adversely in shape, size or pain, please be seen as soon as possible by a medical professional..\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure if I am posting this in the right forum and if not, I am very sorry, but I am at my wits end.  I am a 33 year old female and about 3 months ago while doing my breast exam, I ran my fingers over my left collarbone and felt a small, pea to bean size lump.  The lump is VERY movable as in one second it's on one side of my collarbone and the next you can't even feel it.  Other times, it will sort of \"travel\" up and down the collarbone when I push on it as if it's loosely connected to the tissue underneath.  I have been seeing an ENT specialist for a lump in my mouth which has taken up residence where my tonsils used to and he has felt it and said it didn't feel like anything to worry about.  He is going to biopsy the lump by the way in a couple of weeks but also feels confident this is nothing to worry about either.  I have also had a couple of other physicians look at the lump, but sometimes they can't even feel anything because it will \"hide\" if I am sitting a certain way.  I know, sounds strange.  It's not painful, I am not running fever nor have I been sick.  I may be worrying about nothing, but given the fact that I just lost my father and grandmother and recently found out my grandfather has cancer, I am a little hypersensitive right now to anyone mentioning the \"C\" word.    I am on Delestrogen injections as I had a total hysterectomy in March 2006 or a uternine prolapse, if that has any significance to my situation.  Please tell me I am not going crazy.  I just think it's weird that I have this lump that is moving all over the place in my neck.  And it's not just a little movement, it is a lot!  Thank you doctor.  Kat\n\n",

It is likely that your wife has some lymph nodes that were swollen at one point to fight an infection and subsequently never fully reduced in size.  This is fairly common and leads to the term \"shotty adenopathy\" due to the lymph nodes feeling like BB's.  If the nodes are hard and immobile they should be examined to investigate the possibility of a cancerous node.  If they are freely mobile and rubbery (or even somewhat hard) it is likely that they are OK.  If there are any concerns it is always best to have lymph nodes evaluated directly by a doctor.

Interestingly, hyperthyroidism may also produce similar symptoms.  Some forms of hypothyroidism do have some genetic component.  Diagnosis of hyper/hypothyroid is quite simple and requires a blood test to look at the levels of TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) and T4 (one of the thyroid hormones).  A high TSH and low T4 is hypothyroid; Low TSH and high T4 is hyperthyroid.  There are some more complicated aspects to this, but all the tests that have been ordered are appropriate.  If hyper or hypothyroid are discovered, antibody tests should also be done to help decipher the underlying cause.  Treatment varies depending on the type of illness.  Best wishes, hope this helps.

    "title": "Mass under Mastoid",
    "content": "I am a 34 y/o female. I have had a stationary, firm mass under my Left Mastoid Process for over 5 years. Tha mass is an almost linear growth under the Mastoid in the neck tissue. It is approcimately 1.5 CM in length and seems to be coming from underneath the Mastoid. In the past several months it seems to be getting slightly bigger and there seems to be a radiating heat sensation up the side of my head and down the side of my neck. I sometimes feel the heat down my left shoulder. A lymph node under the mass is recently tender -but not really enlarging. I have to wait a couple of months until my insurance kicks in -but I wanted to get some idea of what this may be or if there was a sense of urgency about it.  Past history: I had a CCA [Cavernous Malformation] located in the Left Hemisphere of my Brain with the initial bleed in 2001. I had a craniotomy in 2003 to resection the area. A venous anomaly is still present. I was wondering if such a mass could be related to this (e.g., draining from the bleed and surgery left such a mass). This is separate, but I also had some type of dermo fibroma removed from my upper back about 7-8 years ago. I was told it was pretty rare. I was thinking this may be a form of fibroma -since it is in my history too.  Thanks for any help. I would prefer to wait until my insurance kicks in. I am up to the limit in medical expenses at the moment with all of the other stuff related to the CCA [Cavernous Malformation].   Best, Jamie\n\n",

It could be related to your previous procedure but I think a clinical examination should easily identify it. If that is not the case then a CT scan may be required.  The presence of a neck lymph node could be related to an infection. Are you feverish.  I hope you are feeling better. I am sorry I am unable to judge how urgent / or not this situation is given the limitations of the internet. I would recommend you contact your doctor as soon as possible.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor,  The only thing I was told was that it appeared to be a swollen gland. It just seems odd that it would be swollen for over 5 years, growing and firm.   I am not feverish. [low grade < 100]. I did get into the doctors a few days ago. He said he wasn't worried at this point. He prescribed Z-pack and wants to see me in 6 weeks. He said that he is not impressed by the size and that it would have to be a much larger mass to alarm him. He said he has seen masses the size of a baseball. Hence, wait and see. If it gets really large in 6 weeks -then he will pursue a more aggressive approach. Granted, I understand the wait and see -and that many things resolve on their own in about 6 weeks anyway. But this is awfully close to my brain and my medical luck has not been the best -so I'm a bit nervous.   By about day 2-3 on the Z-pack, the heat sensation surrounding the mass calmed way down. It is now an intermittent sensation that is almost gone.  I still don't know what it is,  why it is present, why it's unilateral, growing, and so on. If it is aggravated by an infection, I would like to know what is infected. Nothing is apparent at the moment.  I do appreciate your input. Thank you very much for your time.  Best, Jamie\n\n",

It is common for glands to enlarge and to remain felt for years following infection - shotty nodes.  I wouldn't worry about the proximity of this lesion to your brain because you do not have any neurological symptoms.  Should you develop any new symptoms you should contact your doctor immediately.

The neurosurgeon [Dr. Aurthur Day] said that there was a lot of staining left on my brain after the resection. I have intermittent facial numbness on the left side of my face and down my arm -similar to the path of the heat sensation with the \"mass.\" Oddly, the facial numbness was on the opposite side of my face. Now, it is on the same side as the mass -and I hadn't had any real symptoms associated with the CCA since the surgery until the last several months when I had a hysterectomy and was put on hormone replacement [Estrogen excites the brain -so oops!]. This was another reason I was concerned. The new neuro symptoms and the mass getting bigger on the same side of my head. But doctors typically pawn things off to the bleed and reminants of the CCA -even though the sypmtoms are on the opposite side now. I have another venous anomaly in the Right Frontal Lobe -but it has always behaved and presented with no symptoms.    So, that's the story.  Thanks for your time.  Best, Jamie\n\n",

    "content": "It is completely possible that you have a viral infection that has caused the nodes to swell a little.  The size you describe is very common for lymph nodes to be; however, they can be quite a bit larger.  The nodes may or may not shrink back to their original size.  It may take several weeks for the nodes to return to their normal size.    Occasionally lymph nodes can develop a bacterial infection within them requiring antibiotics.  If the nodes truly are in the posterior cervical region this is incredibly uncommon.  The anterior cervical chain has this happen a bit more often.  If the nodes become painful or if you notice redness developing in the skin above them I would recommend that you have them evaluated by your doctor.  Otherwise, time will likely result in their resolution.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I have woke up with 2 large knots on the back of my skull just above my hairline.  If I look up they are painful, and they are painful to the touch.  My scalp has been itching lately, no matter how many times I condition my hair a week....which I wash and condition my hair 4 times a week, basically every other day.  My nose has been runny, but it's clear, my ears are draining slightly.  I have had an ear ache recently but it went away.  I have woke up sweaty, but I think that is because I sleep under 3 blankets, with 2 pairs of socks and pajamas on.  I seem to have a low grade fever, but it goes away and comes back during the day, it's just off and on.  These 2 painful knots on the back of my skull are what my worry is right now.  Should I go see a doctor is this something that will pass??  They seem swollen and tender, they aren't hard knots.  I think my dry scalp is due to the weather, my skin gets dried out during the winter time, I think that comes with getting older.  What do you think, is there cause here for alarm??  Should I be worried, or is this just me? Thank you for any advice you can give me, I appreciate your time and attention.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  I am a 23 year old male, previously in average to good health. I used smokeless tobacco for approx 2 years (yes, I AM an idiot). Around Christmas time, after driving home in my car, i noticed that my entire throat (both left and right sides) and neck was inflamed. At the time, I felt that this might be due to mold in my car (there was quite a bit in it, and you could smell it---it has since been cleaned), as the trip was around 5.5 hours long. I didn't think too much of it, and when i would go to Church and sing, my vocal endurance was not very good (I am a musician, but not a trained singer). I thought that perhaps it was GERD since I do have quite a bit of acid reflux. Several weeks passed by and I noticed that I had a \"\"lump\"\" on the right side of my neck. At first I thought it was a lymph node, but here's the issue. I can see no visible node. The muscle (sternomastoid (sp)) on the right side is very taut and firm. I cannot feel a node however. Based on my info, is this a node or is it muscular?   BTW, I found this \"thing\" about 2.5 weeks ago. To my knowledge, no one in my immediate family has ever had oral cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  If got correctly the information you provided, you have got a sore throat, followed by a swelling in the right side of the neck, but you do not feel a lump and your muscle on that side is in spasm. Clinical examination is essential for the initial evaluation of any swelling.   Diagnosis of a swelling becomes easier if there are any associated symptoms or signs. You have mentioned that you have got a sort of sore throat or upper respiratory tract infection recently before you felt a swelling on the right side of the neck.  The swelling you have described that is felt on the Right upper side of the neck  could be an enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region.   When infections and inflammations are controlled they regress in size but never to normal size.  Though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency thus known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. You normally do not see them but you may feel them by palpation.  Your muscles on that side are in spasm which could be for many causes including improper posture , viral infection, local inflammation etc. May be related to the inflamed Lymph nodes in that area, and may be unrelated. It is possible also that the swelling you felt is due to the spastic muscle.   Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Keep us updated.

For the past several months, I've had what appears to be slightly enlarged left tonsil, and some bumps behind the tonsil on the pharyngeal wall. I was hoping its just lympathic tissue, as I also have raised/reddish lingual tonsils on both sides of my tongue, but Im a bnit worried.  The tonsil looks a bit puffy, and it has some white streaks on the top of it, like small white scratches. Had halitosis ( bad breath) for a while, seems to have went away, and that I ahve not had a dip in about 5 months, and no longer plan to  I also still have my wisdom teeth, and while the top 2 have come in, the left bottom wisdom tooth is severely impacted, and I know it is swelling the gum area around my other back left molar and is often sore, (think its called Pericoronitis).  The only area where I usually feel any pain in my mouth is directly under my impacted left bottom wisdom tooth. Sometimes I can feel a bit of pain coming from the tonsil area, but not severe. I will also ntoice I do not feel any swollen lymph nodes, nor is there any actual sweeling in my neck/throat.  I've gained alot of weight in the past 3 years (went from 200 to 275'ish) and  while it may be from the weight, I've also suddenly started having sever sleep apnea (waking up gasping for air [usually as im trying to fall asleep], feels like i stop breathing) and I'm not sure if its related to whats in my throat.   I'm just worried its cancer, and I'm open to any suggestions, as I have not been to a dentist beacause I do not have insurance, to get an opinion beforehand is my only option because it will be extrmely expensive.   Many thanks, and I hope I'm worried over nothing...   ~justin\n\n",

    "content": "I have read up about swollen lymph nodes, and have noticed that most of the replies on the Lymphoma area, and this area are all the same posts. They all say the exact same thing, and some of the \"symptoms\" contradict themselves. A malignant lymph node should be hard, fixed, irregularly shaped, non-tender, and firm, while it is also said that some of these things can constitute a lymph node fighting infection so it is difficult to differentiate which is which. I know it is impossible for a complete diagnosis online, however it is possible for someone to retain information to speak to their doctor about, specific questions to ask, etc. The purpose of this post is to ask a few questions regarding a swollen lymph node in the neck. A swollen node fighting infection would constitute rubbery, firm, and mobile correct? I have heard of different sizes, even some up to 2 inches big that can be normal. I would appreciate if the same information is not said to me yet again, as I would like to retain new information.   I am over 50 years old (would prefer not to state the exact age), and I have a swollen lymph node in my neck. It is not extremely large, and is only visible when tilting my head completely to the right. I have an autistic son who is prone to colds and respiratory illnesses which passes along to the rest of my family, so we all encounter approximately 4 colds per year, while some may have only one a year. As of now, I do have a cold that is beginning to subside which was caught from my grandson. I do not have any night sweats, no difficulty swallowing, no feeling of fullness in the throat, or anything of the sort. The lymph node in my neck is approximately 1.3 cm in height, and 1.9 cm in width. It is not painful unless pressed on, does not restrict the movement in my neck, and has not been bothersome other than its presence being there. It is not hard as a rock, it is not fixed to the skin or any underlying tissue, but is mobile when moved from side to side, up and down. It is not overly soft, but it is not hard either. More of a chewy consistency, or rubbery as it has been called. What I am asking here is, are malignant lymph nodes hard or soft? Are they mobile or fixed in place? Are they irregularly shaped as stated before? General size of a malignant lymph node? Any information would be of great help.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Update:  My recent cold acquired from my grandson seems to have had some sort of effect on my swollen lymph node. Now that the cold is subsiding, so is the lymph node. It is no longer very easy to see when my head is tilted to the side, and does not protrude from my neck as much. It is now flatter, and definitely not as large. My worries will not be completely over until the swelling is completely gone, or enough to the point where I will not be able to easily see it or palpate it. Ibuprofen could have had some effect as I have been taking that to help with the swelling. Although there have been no replies to my post, I would like to thank those that have taken the time to read my posts, might have learned something from them, etc. Thank you\n\n",

Ive been too alot of ent's and doctors and they all say it normal.On the net i read people had cancer with a 1cm node and my concern is i have 6-7. I don't know what to do and im scared to death.No doctors or ents think they need to be biopsied because of the size well what about the quanity ?I have had these for a year almost since i found them.Whats the best test to determine the actual size?

    "content": "Hello,   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer.   Sometimes, following infection, Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (about 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Individuals with history of recurrent upper respiratory, ear, throat dental, and scalp infections tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes.   So, the probability that the lymph node you have noticed is due to previous infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is high.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring.   Hope this information is useful.  Keep us updated.

Early this week I woke up and noticed a painful, hard lump at the back of my right ear, at the same level of earlobe. The next day the lump got larger and spread upward.  I visited a government clinic and the medic assistant said it could be a gland infection and prescribed me amoxicillin 250 mg for 5 days, prolase for 3 days and mefenamic acid 250mg. A day after taking the prescribed medc, I noticed another hard lump at the back of my neck, about an inch to the left from centre and below the hair line. I also noticed some pain at the top of my head.  Should I go back to the clinic? Should I continue with the prescription?  Is the prescription corect? I don't have any allergic reaction to medicine.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The swelling you have described that is felt on the Right upper side of the neck behind the ear is probably enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region. Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.   Following infection Lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender.   A history of scalp infected lesions, or Ear infection may be present, as this lymph node could be a reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group.   The other swelling could be another lymph node draining the other side of the scalp and also a reactionary to infection.  After treatment of infection with adequate course of antibiotics, they should regress in size but never to normal size.   Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are significant and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   It is unusual to get another enlarged lymph node after a course of antibiotic as the antibiotic should clear also the primary infected lesion (e.g. scalp infections like folliculitis), however it is possible with inadequate therapy.  Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes like abscess, lymphoma , etc.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

I was also having papitations, hair loss, fatigue.  EKG normal.  The sono found the mass  to be 5x3 but also found a parathyroid/thyroid lesion that was 1.2 cm.  All labs are normal.  CBC, TSH T4, Mono, are all normal.  Theses have been repeated and are still normal.  CT of thorax and neck.  No pulmonary nodules found, no other adenopathys (hilar or mediastinal or left supraclavicular). Heart was normal size.  Nothing wrong with any other glands.  CT diagnosis is Right Matted Supraclavicular Lymphadenopathy. Some scattered less then pea size nodes.  Before the CT we knew that I had one inlarged submandiular node and another little one to the left.  I found them because they were sore. They recommended a PET Scan as a follow up.  My physician has sent me for a FNA but the radiologist is not sure he can get to the thyroid lesion since the larger mass is in the way.  It is pressing on the jugular vein.    Any opinion would be helpful.  All the info on the web is just plain scarry.\n\n",

FNA is the gold standard for the diagnosis of a thyroid nodule especially if the thyroid hormones are normal.  The radiologist has to decide whether he can get to the nodule or not? If not a second best option would be to take a FNA from the node (mass) or to get the PET scan done.  Please keep us updated.  Good luck!\n\n",

My dentist has said it is geographic tongue.  But I did not think you could get that underneath the tongue.      One area in particular underneath will form and then go back to normal and then form there again.  Although it does move around as well.  I am concerned because I have read a lot about HPV being linked with oral cancer.  If a lesion heals and then forms again, can that be cancerous?  Or does it have to be there consistently.    Any advice would be really helpful as I have become extremely anxious about the situation.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The submental lymph node is located just below the chin. It drains the lower lip, floor of mouth, teeth, submental salivary gland, tip of tongue, skin of cheek. Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis. Sometimes when the submental salivary gland becomes inflammed and swollen it can be confusion with this condition.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.   Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  You should have a doctor look at it as soon as you can.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 43, Female, newly diagnosed as diabetic with high blood pressure, high cholesterol, underactive thyroid.  I had a laparoscopy - pelvic area - over six months ago.  I had a slightly sore throat before surgery.  It's been chronic and repetitive ever since.  It will not clear up.  Also, under times of intense stress, twice now - but not recent, all my gums and teeth would set on fire.  Pain like I've never felt before.  I was prescribed an anti-inflammatory  and that would take care of it.  I've also noticed dark ridges above the half moons in my finger nails which will not go away.  My doctor reluctantly has filled out the paperwork for an eye, ear, nose and throat specialist.  He says the specialist will ikely just \"send me home\".  This doesn't sound very intelligent when my doctor has examined my throat several times and seen it's inflamed.  Anti-biotics did not work.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e.g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.  Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake.   Being diabetic, and with hypothyroid function , make you more susceptible to recurrent infections as sore throat.  Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems.  Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat.   In some cases it is believed to be due to a postnasal discharge.   If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.   You better try to avoid exposing yourself to any precipitating factor like cold drinks, smoking etc.  A sore throat that does not improve or repeated with a short period of time should be investigated properly. By complete history and proper examination your physician can evaluate the cause of this recurrent sore throat and recommend treatment.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,      For the past year, I have had a lump in my lower lip.  It is not discolored or anything like that, it is just a lump.  The lump in hard and when I first noticed it, I was able to squeeze \"Puss\" out of it. One time, I pulled a small peice of silicone-like thing out of it.  Well, today, i was biting it and messing around with it as I always do, and it was hard and I bit down very hard on it and it felt like I was biting into a peanut.  The ahrd lump broke into small peices.  It never bled or busted open, but imediatly afterwards, i kinda felt weird, like shaky or \"not quite right\" and have felt that way for a couple hours now.  Any ideas what this could be?  Should I be alarmed?  What type of doctor do I need to see, or shoud I just go the the hospital?  Thanks in advance for your time.  Galen, Savannah, GA\n\n",

Abscess is the body responds to bacteria or to a foreign body as white blood cells migrate to the affected area, attack and destroy them forming pus.  Abscesses may develop in the lip line when the oil (sebaceous) glands become blocked or after minor wounds to the skin.    Recurrent, chronic abscess are formed due to inadequate treatment of acute infection.  An abscess may form on top of any other swelling or mass.

    "title": "lump under tongue",
    "content": "hi. wondering if anyone can offer suggestions. i have a lump (about the size of a fat lima bean) under the left side of my tongue. i have done extensive reading to see if i could have some knowledge on the subject prior to my dr. visit. (which by the way took 1 dr.visit to primary care, given antibiotic, followup 1 wk later - referred to ENT). waited for ENT appt (2 weeks) and could only see the physician's assistant (PA). whew!   i have been told i may have sjrogren's syndrome in the past...   also have salivary gland stones. but i don't think this is a stone, since the stones are extremely painful and this has no pain what-so-ever.   also have been diagnosed with Rheumatoid arthritis.   during my visit, the PA (physician's assistant) said that my sjrogren's syndrome doesn't have anything to do with this problem. when i asked him if it was in the sublingual gland, he said there was no such thing. oh my gosh! i think i should be concerned, however the dr. is great. just don't know when i can see him.   PA ordered a saline test that measures the flow of the saline through the salivary gland to determine whether the lump is in the gland or along side it. while this makes sense, in my reading it says over and over again by many, many sources that the lump should be removed whatever the reason (benign or malignant). it also said that this type of test is very rare for a dr. to order. the articles suggested an MRI and 2nd option as CT scan.   hope i haven't rambled too much, just concerned that i am not being taken seriously - the text goes on and on and on about if lump remains after a month, immediate action needs to be taken... blah blah blah.   i guess my main concern is whether it's in the gland or along side it. and what gland it is actually in. the submandibular gland has a better outcome while the sublingual has more malignancy.   any input?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear hickory,  Without clinical examination, it is difficult to tell what this lesion could be. Tthe best thing to do is to be examined by the NET specialist as soon as possible.  The lump could be of benign cause, like a cyst or or any lesion in the duct of the submandibular salivary gland.  It might be also mucosal changes associted with one of the systemic disease that you have been diagnosed with.  For example, oral Lichen planus which occurs in people having immunologically mediated disorders. Oral lichen planus (OLP) usually  seen as bilateral white striations, papules, or plaques on the buccal mucosa, tongue, or gingivae.  Oral lichenoid lesions similar to OLP which results from drug reactions in patients receiving one of these drugs:NSAIDs, beta-blockers, sulfonylureas, some ACE inhibitors, etc.  Lichenoid lesions  of unknown cause are known as idiopathic OLP.  In such cases Dermatological examination is necessary.   At same time exclusion of malignant lesions is important. The possible investigations to be requested in your case are X-ray, CT , or MRI and biopsy if needed.  Early malignant or premalignat lesions in the oral cavity can be removed surgically with good outcome.  Best regards,\n\n",

Also, I had told him I was having constant dull pain in my left arm (which had been previously operated on).  I do not seem to feel better and actually notice my left side of my neck to be very sore with the left ear having pain from time to time.  My left arm pain is still there and is starting to feel tingly.

    "content": "Dear JenO,  In most of the cases with neck, shoulder and back pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause.  This usually results from wrong , sustained positions or following a sudden improper movement.   Muscle spasm alone can cause severe pain which can be of an unidentified cause.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, hot therapy and physiotherapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, or if the pain is associated with numbness , weakness, the pain is more likely to be due to other causes, like:  Herniated disk, in which the intervertebral disc press on his nerves,  Spondylosis which is similar to arthritis but affects the spine etc   You mentioned that the X- ray imagine showed no changes. MRI is of choice in the diagnosis of these cases.  These are conditions that need specific therapy.  My advice is to follow up your doctor and  to consult your him for further investigations like MRI.  Best regards,\n\n",

Also, she needs to eat mints/mouth fresheners as she always has foul smell from her mouth. Like you said, this could be more of a dental problem.

    "content": "Hi PrettynPunk, Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The preauricular lymph nodes are located in front of the ears. They drain the eyelids and conjunctivae, temporal region, pinna. Common causes of enlargement include diseases of the external auditory canal. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders). Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Upon evaluation your physician may watch and wait for a 3-4 week time period to see if there are any changes or treat with a course of antibiotics if he/she suspects an underlying infection. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "ok i just turned 30, im male. alomost 12 months ago i noticed a bumper behind my ear, from out of nowhere it popped up. I didnt notice till a friend mentioned it. There was no pain assosiated with it.   what seemed wierd was it didnt seem to be attached to anything, it was the size of a pea, and i could \"pinch\" underneth it as if it was JUST below the skin. IT was perfectly spherical, and seemed to be just under the surface of the skin, i could pinch it and lift it off the underlying skin. It was located at the bottom level of my ear lobe, about 3/4 dirctly behind it(basically right over and JUST behind that soft spot behind my earlobe) Anyways, i let it go for about 9 months, worried sometimes and not others, i had no previous infections, and had no ill side effects whatsoever, no itching, no wieght loss, infact i gained weight, no noticable fatigue other then when working long hours. Well after about 9 months... I was too scared to go to the dr's and fet up with it being there, i started messing with it one night, pinchin at it and manipulating it, then finally, it became sore! in the matter of the next 2 days it swelled up and got horribly infected, (note it had NEVER been sore or infected before) it sweeled up to the size of a walnut in the matter of 24 hours, obviously infected now i was worried, so i was gonna head to the dr, and i jumped in the shower and it had sweeled so quickly the skin had become dry and cracked, it popped while i was showering! looked to be a bit of blood in there with some water..I was pretty exicted! AS popping it had flatted it out 100%!!! it was gone, in the matter of the next week, the lil scar from where the skin was cut open was the only noticable thing there. Enter today, 3 months later with no signs of anything...i look in the mirror and i see something again!!!  only this time its about the size of a BB, no bigger, same characteristics, i can lift it off and move it around.  Question obviously is...does this thing seem like a lympnoid? If so, could i manipulate it as i explained? I understand the nodes are close to the skin, but this felt like it was JUST under the skin, like no more then a pimple. Also, if it was a node, and it popped like it did, why would it reoccur exactly the same spot? Wouldnt that node be scared and dead now if you will?   So to summurize, could this be a cancer, if so, why after a year do i hyave no symptoms other then the lump and hpow the heck if it or was a tumor, how does it pop!?   any input will be greatly appreciated!!\n\n",

Characteristics of cystic lesions as a result of, for example acne, or an abcess resulting from an infected hair follicle, etc., would have charecteristics of pus, bloody drainage etc. I would suggest an evaluation to identify the causative factor but in my opinion it would not be related to a lymph node.

    "content": "Hello Moby Dick,  Most common cause of lymphadenopathy (enlarged lymph nodes) is infection. Lymph nodes can also become swollen from inflammatory conditions and cancer. Other causes of enlarged lymph nodes are unusual.  Lymphadenopathy is described as a node larger than 1 cm, but this fluctuates depending on the site where the node is found. Inguinal lymph nodes larger than 1.5 cms. are consider abnormal. In contrast, palpable supraclavicular, iliac, or popliteal nodes of any size, and epitrochlear nodes larger than 5 mm are considered abnormal. Although there is no uniform nodal size at which one should suspect a malignant origin, the presence of one or more lymph nodes larger than 1 cm in diameter calls for further investigation if a definite cause cannot be identified (except inguinal nodes).  Under 30 years of age, lymphadenopathy has an infectious or inflammatory origin in 80% of the cases, while in people over 50 the enlargement is neoplastic 60% of the time.  Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy has more chance to be caused by cancer, in particular, hard feeling ones on the left side.  I think that any adult who recently notice a supraclavicular lymphadenopathy, without specific explanation (e.g., local infection), and feels firm, non-tender, should undergo a biopsy.   Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

You don't mention if she is aware that she has a problem or if she would be receptive to treatment. My suggestion would be for you to talk to her about seeking help.

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  There is no replacement for an examination by your doctor, please get an appointment if its still an issue.  Best regards.\n\n",

A few days latter i noticed a large lump in my from neck, feels like its on the wind pipe, near where the neck and lower jaw meet.  I was planning on visiting the doctor but after a couple of days the pain was getting better and the feeling of something in my throat went away.  But i still had the marble size lump.  The pain completely went away, but the lump stayed for about 2 weeks. Then suddenly the lump shrank to about the size of a BB iin a matter of a few hours.  I though this could have been a cyst. Then the bump began to grow again, got up to about pea size, lasted a few days, now its back down to smaller than a BB, its actually hard to feel it now. And again it shrank very suddenly. One hour it was pea size, the next smaller than a BB.  I now have no pain in the neck or throat, and no more feeling of something stuck in my throat.  But what could this lump be that grows and the very suddenly shrinks.  Any suggestions?\n\n",

I had a submandibilar lump appear approximately3 years ago right where my chin and neck meet, right in the middle rather than left or right.  IT's actually more toward my chin than my actual neck.  The size has not changed.  It is not tender.  I cannot tell if it is hard, soft, mobile or immobile since when i try to move it I cannot tell if that is my skin or the lump.  I have not found any other lumps.  Before the lump occurred I did have a root canal that had gotten badly infected and required more dental care and antibiotics.  Can you please give your opinion on whether this sounds like cancer.   Can you also please tell me what symptoms suggest cancer and also tell me what this could be if it isn't cancer.  Thank you!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  The submental lymph node is located just below the chin. It drains the lower lip, floor of mouth, teeth, submental salivary gland, tip of tongue, skin of cheek. Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.

    "content": "Four days ago i noticed one lump behind my left ear right behind the bone that runs there, then later that day i noticed three more above it. they were at first kind of big and hurt to touch or to move neck a certain way. i had gotten stung in the top of the head by a red wasp (which i am allergic to) the day before the lumps popped up so i thought maybe it was because of that. i have been taken benadryl for 5 days now and the lumps are still there. the one that first popped up is now the size of an M & M and the other 3 seem to be a little bigger. they are real sore feeling when i first wake up then durning the day the pain kind of goes away then comes back later that afternoon. i am really freaked out about this. i have no idea of what it might me. i have no other signs of illness that i have noticed. please help me figure this mystery out and ease my mind a little. i am not the kind of person that really freaks out about stuff like this but this really worries me. if anyone has anything like this or knows what it could be please please let me know. thanks and God Bless !\n\n",

The lump hasn;t grown in size at all, it has remained in the same place, same hardness and about the size of a small pea.   Its a fingertip width away from my nostril, right where my sinuses would be I think, Where the doctor always taps you to see if it hurts when you have a sinus infection.

For months my jaw has occasionally popped after waking in the morning.   Within the last few days I have developed a swelling behind my jaw, at the base of my ear. It is uncomfortable. I also have a very slight fever.   I have had a runny nose and some sinus issues. I also have a few broken teeth in that area of my face. Just to let you know all the factors.   Mostly I am just uncomfortable. However my Mother had a tumor removed from her cheek about two years ago and she said that my symptoms were similiar to hers.  Should I be concerned? If so, do I need to go to an ER or can I schedule a regular appointment with my PCP?\n\n",

It changes alot sometimes I grows bigger and becomes very hard and sometimes becomes soft and you can move it a bit. Theres sometimes constantly throbbing pains where the lump is and spreads to a headache - that is when i usually take some pain killers. During the time Ive had this lump, I been feeling very tired, sleepy during the day, cracking my neck(before I never cracked my neck before).  Ive been to more than 1 doctor to complain about this -and all they eve say its an inflamed lymph node and it would go away. But it hasnt - now i have another lump on the right hand side of my neck and its doing the same thing as my left does. Its constantly throbbing with pain.. i massage my neck but it does very little.   Sometimes I cant sleep with a pillow at night .. sometimes when I do I have pain on one side of the neck .. usually where my lumps are..

    "content": "I have a small raised bump under the skin of my neck,  halfway between my chin and my Adam's Apple.  It is about 3/4 cm X 1/2 cm.  It is not miscolored, and is visible if i raise my chin.   It appears to be soft, and it does not hurt when pressed or touched, but i'm a little wary of squeezing it to determine how solid it is.  I noticed this bump about 3 years ago... I do not know if it was there prior to then. The Scheduled, mysterious part: It only exists during the morning, until about 12pm or so, and then at night, from 9pm on.  During the middle of the day, it is nonexistent to sight or touch. I have gone to see a doctor about it... unfortunately, it was in the middle of the afternoon, and so i had no physical proof.  The doctor told me that it is probably a swollen salivary gland... but, er, I didn't think salivary glands were located there.  But I'll be glad to hear that I'm incorrect on that.  (Unless a swollen salivary gland is something to worry about.)  Is it second opinion time?  Or is this something about which i shouldn't be concerned?  Any advice is appreciated.  Thank you.  -david\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Its very hard to evaluate your post over the internet. However, let me add a few thoughts.  You are right that this is not the position of a salivary gland but its not the position of a lymph node either. The submental lymph node would be directly the chin bone while the pretracheal lymph node would be below adam's apple.  The fact that it varies in size is not consistant with anything I know of. If it does recurr be sure to get it checked while it is there. I am sorry I wish I could be of more help.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 26 year old Male, who doesn't smoke and rarely drinks. About 6 months ago I noticed a small, 1/2 inch lump on the right side of my neck. my doctor took a look at it and didn't seem concerned. said it was just a lymph node. I had bronchitis at the time.   The bronchitis cleared up in April and I was okay for a while. Then in May I came down with strep. Treated that and it went away. A little over a month ago I went in again with a sore throat, strep came back negative, but doctor said I had an ear in fection in both ears. put me on amoxicillin. By the end of my course, the ear infection was gone, but I had a nasty sore throat. Went back and was diagnosed with Strep. 3 days after finishing the amoxicillin. I was put on Z-pac and a nasal spray for PND. Cleard up for a couple of days. But I've been feeling run down ever since. And I've had this odd discomfort on the right side of my throat near my thyroid. There was minor discomfort swallowing but it seemed to go away after the strep.  Last week I've had some bad pain on the right side of my neck. Made turning to the right a bit painful. I noticed a smal (1/2 inch) bump near my thyroid, right above the collar bone. Again, it's not huge, but it does feel like a lymph node. While the pain in my neck is mostly gone, that wierd feeling is still there.   Today, I feel like i'm coming down with the flu. Achy, dizzy and have the beginnings of a sore throat. I'm sick (haha) of going to the doctor's. But this is getting rediculous. I hang out a lot with friends who have young children (5 & 2), but it just seems odd that my immune system is this lame at taking care of anything they might have. Neither of them seem sick, and I've been hanging out with them for the last 2 years.   Should I be concerned about the frequency I'm getting sick, or should I chock it up to hanging around children coupled with a \"I shoudl really get around to having my wisdom teeth out\"? Or is it something more serious?  And while we're on the subject, No, I don't seem to be running a fever, having night sweats, and sadly, there's no apparent weight loss.\n\n",

I also have 3 others (largest  is 13mm) in my neck that were only discovered on CT. None of these were there 1 yr ago.  Symptoms I am experiencing include episodes of burning pain on left side of tongue and discomfort under jaw and at base of skull under swollen node as if something is there that shouldn't be.  Bloodwork over the past 3 years has been consistent with my most recent as follows: Out of range: WBC 3.3 Platelets 120 Grans# 1.5  In range: RBC   4.4 HGB 13.2 HCT 37.7  Bone marrow biopsy 2yrs ago was inconclusive for Hairy cell leukemia or lymphoma which is what the hematologist suspected.  Gran% 45.5 Lymph% 47.3  My question is what could cause the lymph node  to be quite swollen when I wake up in the morning and gradually dimenish throughout the day? I also get burning pain there at times. MRI shows cervical spine is completely normal. My GP suggested the node is lying over a nerve causing the pain and needs to be removed then re-do CT every 6 months for 18 months to follow other nodes.   Two surgeries last year: removal of elongated calcified styloid ligament and total thyroidectomy (benign).  Thank you  for any input.  Sorry my post is so long...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry but something is not clear in your post. You mentioned that two years ago you had a bone marrow biopsy and this lead to your doctor suspecting lymphoma vs. hairy cell leukemia. So have you been diagnosed with any of these diseases?  I do not have an answer really for why you feel your lymph node to be more swollen on waking up other than that it could be a result of edema that results from pressure on the lymph node while sleeping.  Of note is the fact that at their current size they do not seem to be clinically significant. However, given the results of your blood picture it is advisable to pursue investigation further.  Have you had any biopsies.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx.  Given the limitations of the internet in clinical evaluation, you are advised to seek medical attention.   If after evaluation the lymph node enlargement is unexplained, then your doctor may choose to put you under observation for 3 to 4 weeks and then re-evaluate the node. The doctor may also recommend a course of antibiotics based on his evaluation.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a heart transplant patient out 8 years. Two years ago I noticed a growth on my left eyeball. Next to the pupil. Turned out to be Squamos Cell Carcinoma. It was removed. Last Aug. I finally went to see a surgeon for what I thought was a hemmoroid. I waited about a year to see him because I was embarassed. Plus ...as a transplant patient I've seen to much hospital as it is. When the pain got so bad I couldn't take it anymore I  went to see surgeon. When he looked at it he said it was a wart. (Common among transplant patients.) He removed the wart and sent it to biospy. After the surgery he said he was sure it was nothing to worry about. Well, he called me in a week and said I needed to go back to surgery to have more tissue removed because it was \"invasive squamos cell carcinoma.\"  This time he removed A LOT of tissue.  Again I'm told everything is ok. Now....I noticed a lump in my lymph node behind my jaw bone under my ear lobe. I have read a lot of online reports about lumps in glands and swollen glands. These all seem small compaired to mine. I can \"grab\" mine and it feels a little smaller than a golf ball. Its shaped like an egg. It feels hard but not rock hard. I can move it if I move everything it seems to be connected to. There is no pain. For the last 4 or 5 weeks I have been a little short of breath and have had a slight cough. I have also had a hard time sleeping. What do you think? When people have \"swollen\" glands - how big is swollen? By the way.....one year after TX I had a bad case of Humoral Rejection and was treated with TLI. (Total lymph Irradiation) in very large doses for 3 months. It worked but the doctors told me I could never have radiation again. I'm a \"healthy\" 52 year old male.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mochazzz,  Sorry I have not been able to respond earlier. Even though the only way to be sure of the nature of your tumor is to have it in front and examine it properly, I will try to help you based just on the information I have. Behind the jaw bone (retromandibular) and under the earlobe there are many structures (skin, bone, nerves, lymph nodes, the parotid salivary gland, etc). A bump can develop from any of those structures, and could be of benign or malignant nature. From your description of the tumor, it appears to me it could be either an enlarged lymph node or a parotid salivary gland tumor.  As you may have read online, the most common cause of bumps or swollen lymph nodes in the neck are infections. But, when an adult presents a lateral neck mass, in the absence of obvious signs of infection, it is deemed to be cancer until proved otherwise (75% of lateral neck masses in adults over 40 yo are malignant). However, no symptom or complex of symptoms is strongly correlated with cancer.  About your question on how big is swollen, cervical lymph nodes larger than 1 cm. should be considered abnormal. Therefore, a node a little smaller than a golf ball is like 4 cms in diameter, and calls for further investigation. Additionally, it is well documented that solid organ transplantation with its inherent immunosuppression is complicated by an increased incidence of malignancy, particularly cancers of the lymph nodes (lymphomas); and radiotherapy increases cancer risk. As well, retromandibular lymph nodes can directly mirror squamous cell carcinomas of the pharynx, larynx, tonsils, tongue, and tumors of the parotid gland.  Almost 80% of all salivary gland tumors occur in the parotid, and 75% of them are benign. The most common type is the benign pleomorphic adenoma, usually a slow-growing, painless lump at the back of the jaw, just below the earlobe. These tumors are more frequent in people exposed to radiation. Besides, if someone has had radiation treatment to the head and neck area for other medical reasons, the risk of salivary gland cancer increases.  My intention is not to scare you, but due to your past medical history of total lymph irradiation, immunosuppressive treatment, and squamous cell carcinoma arising in two different sites, I strongly encourage you to seek for medical attention.  Sincerely,  Dr Torax.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a small lump directly behind my ear, on my head for as long as I can remember. I asked the doctor about it years ago, but he told me it was nothing to worry about. It's never grown, so I never worried about it. However, this morning I woke up and found a smaller, harder lump about an inch below, just about the area where my head starts and my neck stops. The lump behind my ear I'd say is about the size of a peanut, and has never grown. This new one is smaller, but I don't know how long it's been there. I only noticed it today. If someone could offer some advice, I'd appreciate it. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks, rntdj.  I asked the doctor about Palifermin and he said that sometimes it can cause hypotension so we are opting to take a wait and see approach.  My husband withstood the final round of cisplatin (no 5FU, which is thought to be the cause of the mucositis) a few days ago without any complicatons, except for the ongoing mucositis.  His mouth sores seem to be decreasing a bit and he is not spitting as much, but it looks as if we still have a ways to go. He is still not able to swallow at all.  I was worried about him developing a stricture, but the doctors have assured me that  it will just take  a little more time because he is just 3 weeks out of radiation. This is his 8th week on a feeding tube.  10 cans of Glucerna a day.  He is managing to keep his weight  stable at 200 pounds!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi niceboy_017, Lymph nodes commonly enlarge do to infection from bacteria or virus states and may not return to their pre-infectious size after an infection subsides. Lymph nodes that continue to enlarge despite treatment are more disconcerting. Infections of the mouth/throat may cause these nodes to enlarge. Enlargement of these nodes may also be associated with systemic disorders, for example, lymphoma, autoimmune disorders, HIV, etc. Other presenting symptoms are usually apparent. If you are experiencing drenching night sweats, my suggestion for you is inquire with your physician about a CT scan. My second suggestion would be, if you have been sexually active, involved in drug use, etc., that you also inquire about a HIV test. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Squamous Cell Carcinoma | Tonsil Primary",
    "content": "(this is a copy of the last post from my Lymphoma thread, which I am \"moving\" to this category from Lymphoma and also the Cancer of Unknown Primary)  I know a positive attitude is essential in every study I read and everyone I talk to so maybe the Dr's telling me 50 to 70% survival chance are using inflated odds to improve the odds?  Here's why I am concerned:  I've read that people under 40, in no other risk groups who get this (ie: \"me\"), usually have a much more agressive neoplasm. This is what I've heard from a couple of sources...So, maybe the Dr with the 70% odds he's using, for his outlook; has demographics of generally older patients who smoke, etc who don't have such an agressive version.  4 ENT's & 1 Oncological Surgeon have said 50-50 chance of 5 year survival.  There's tremendous consistency in that number...It's also a \"safe\" bet, meaning whatever happends, they are right..   But, maybe there's some code out there that say's \"if the patient has less than 50% chance, tell them 50-50 just to keep them sane..\", or maybe that's what they say when they don't really know.  That is the bottom line after all. They DON'T really know. No one does, and that's the problem with statistics.  I have this mental block about all the 50-50 projections, I feel like I would be measurably more resolved if they would have all said 55 or 60% chance...Crazy huh?  But, again, that's what following statistics is...\"CRAZY\". None of us is a statistic.  SO...I've decided.  I'm 36 DAMNIT! I'm a healthy male (other than the whole \"cancer thing\"  )  I'm not going to fall into the crowd on the failing side of the 50%.   I've got way too much life left in me and too much to live for.  Just do me a favor everyone, on those days in the future when I forget this, please give me a gentle reminder    Now for my plan:  1) Radical Tonsilectomy  & Modified Radical Neck Dissection  next week 5 hour surgery! (Please keep me in your prayers that day)   Top ENT Surgeon @ Stanford  2) 2 weeks of recovery at our resort my partner and I own on the North Coast. We'll work on getting computers setup, phones forwarded, systems in place, people trained, hired etc for our absense.  3) Right after our busy July 4th weekend, we'll leave for So Cal where we have a home and all our familes and lots of friends live, to start Radiation/Chemo, maybe using one of two new drugs in combination, Motexafin Gadolinium &/or Proxinium, and possibly Erbitux. This will likely be a six week cycle. This will be supervised by the Stanford team and administered by a great local oncologist (the 70% guy!!). Friends and family will help my parter and I run our resort remotely (as much as possible), and help me with trips to radiation and chemo, and meals, chores, etc. Every weekend or two, my parter (me too when I'm feeling up to it), will run up there and check things out in person (9 hour drive each way!  ) Returning to be back in time for the next radiation treatment. Family will stay at the place occassionally to check on the employees, releave people, etc.  The radiation I plan to use is the new TomoTherapy. I've read a ton about it. It's not available up North, and my charts are being reviewed by the chief of radiology at one of the installations now. He said it is brand new and they plan to use it on a lot of H&N cancers.  Okay, so that's the plan. There's a chance they won't get it all on surgery. There's a chance they won't get it all with radiation/chemo, and there's an ugly chance it will return with a vengence! But, I'll be ready..!!  I have several other things up my sleeve, like Gendicine, Avenox and more ideas.  Plus, I'm radically changing my diet to be \"cancer resistent\".  I've gone 8 days now with ZERO coffee or caffeine! (Unbelieveable I was a total espresso junkie 2 weeks ago)  I am going to be more active, exercise and be overall healthy.  Plus, everyday I am going to visualize my body eating up all the cancer cells (my Dr (from Stanford!!) actually suggested this!!!!)    That's the plan...! Help me stick with it!  I feel so connected to all of you. Thank you for all the inspiration, prayers and good wishes.  Hopefully, my surgery will go smooth, and they will find good results in the biopsies (ie: Little tissue involvement, no spreading, clean small margins, and no other nodes.)  Sorry for the LONG post\n\n",

I've worked Surgical ICU for 7 years and will be happy to answer whatever I can. Also, so that you are prepared, it might be a good idea to visit the unit that you'll be going to after your surgery BEFORE the surgery. Your surgeon should be able to tell you where you'll be going. Ask the nurses what to expect, and how the routine of the unit works. Ask about any equipment you'll be seeing when you wake up, so that you're not startled by anything. I've found that this has helped many patients have less anxiety, and it also gives them a familiar face to see when they arrive from surgery.   You are in my thoughts and prayers for a good outcome to your surgery and a speedy recovery. Get online as soon as you can after surgery so you can update us, and so we can \"assist\" you in maintaining that positive attitude!   (((hugs)))\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately your friend is right about the dry mouth!! If I had a dollar for every time a patient complained of that I'd be a wealthy woman!  Some anesthesia has the side effect of dry mouth. Believe it or not, some surgical patients can be overloaded with fluid and yet be terribly thirsty! One way to deal with that is the lip balm. Another is to ask for mouth swabs... dip them in ice water and swab your mouth with them. I'm not sure if this will be an option for you right away due to the type of surgical procedure you'll be having, but again, your nurses should tell you and/or your partner what is permissible.   A few more pointers while I'm thinking of them:  Clarify everything with your surgeon. Ask questions about the immediate post-op period. What unit will you be in right after surgery? Will you be on a ventilator (breathing machine) for any length of time? (This may be necessary, for a short time,  to protect your airway from the swelling that can occur after such a long surgery in the throat/neck area. You will want to know this ahead of time so that you are not scared when you \"wake up\" with a breathing tube in.)  DO NOT try to be a hero and \"deal with\" any pain. Ask for, and take, pain medicine. It helps you rest better, and your body needs this to recover! Also, people in pain tend to not want to move around, and this can also lead to complications like pneumonia and blood clots.  Limit your visitors in the beginning. I understand that people love you and want to come see you to cheer you up and keep you company. The usual issue I've found in this scenario is that the patient feels obligated to entertain the visitors and winds up worn out, in pain, and generally feeling like crap. SO, ask anyone outside your immediate circle to save their well-wishes for when you're feeling up to company. And DON'T feel guilty about it.  Anyone, ANYONE, who enters your room is to thoroughly wash their hands, or use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer, before they touch you, your bed, your call-light, anything. NO EXCEPTIONS. NONE. I cannot stress this enough. Wash your hands frequently as well, especially if you have a room mate. And for God's sake don't walk around bare foot!!    Okay, I've written a novella here... so I'll climb down off the soap box. Again, if you have any questions, please feel free to ask.   P.S. What date is your surgery again??\n\n",

    "content": "I have been DX as Stage IV, T1N2, or T2N2.  I have now seen or spoken to 26 Drs.  About half of them ENT/Surgeons. The other half are made up of Radiation Oncologists and Chemo. Onocologists.  I am more confused than ever.  Several of the Oncologists STRONGLY recommend against surgery as the 1st line in my case, stateing that the best chance I have is from a combination Taxol/Carbo and Erbitux (which according to recent report is showing \"statistically significant improvements\" in H&N SCC.)  The problem, I'm told, is that when I have the surgery first, the blood vessels and scar tissues damages make it impossible for the medicines to reach the areas of need.  My surgeon calls them \"neophites\", and say's that if I don't have the surgery I will die, and even if I do, there is a 30-50% chance that I'll make it to the 5 year mark anyway.  He say's that since I am under 40 years old and don't have risk factors, that in his experience, the neoplasm is always MORE AGRESSIVE, to justify surgery NOW.  Is the concern over the surgery scars and blood vessel damage justified?  The surgeon plans a Right Side, Modified Radical Neck Dissection and a Radical Tonsilectomy.  I am so confused and don't know what to do!?!?!  I feel like I NEED to get started NOW with whatever course I'm taking, but of course I want to do what's best.  Can anyone help me understand?\n\n",

There are a lot of confusing opinions and that is why the National Cancer Institute publishes its recommended guidelines. These are regularly updated.

    "content": "I hope this is the right forum..  Ok, about 4 days ago, I noticed my tongue feeling weird, constant tingling, a little numbness, and a little burning. I felt some pain when I would lift my tongue up all the way. I had also noticed some soreness on the underside of my tongue. And it seemed when I woke up in the morning, my tongue was swollen (I don't know if this is common or not, it hasn't been for me). Then I looked in the mirror to see what was going on, and on the underside of my tongue, I noticed some bumps and I think some of those bumps became a little um...tentacle looking, not too long, but it was like a flappy fin, but just as small as the bumps though. Now, 2 days later, I notice the same bumps and fins developing on the side of my tongue near my wisdom teeth, and all along the side of my tongue to the very tip of my tongue (its as if they're developing points on my tongue, picture the points on an octagon, thats how its starting to form), from the back, they are bigger, and get smaller as it goes toward the front. All of these bumps, on the side and back are reddish in color. I believe I had some growing on the other side of my tongue also, but for some reason, it went back to normal. My throat felt a little funny too, kind of sore, I actually remember this being the first symptom, my throat was really sore before the problems with my tongue started. Also, I understand that white bumps on the very back of the tongue is normal, right? Well, I have some big red ones, is that normal? And what kind of doctor would be in the best position to treat me?\n\n",

I always get really bad headaches and I usually blame it on my TMJ, although I am not sure if that's the cause or not. My neck is sore and shoulders are sore as well. It's the back of my neck, not the front. I haven't been running any fever and I don't hurt anywhere else. I haven't been to the doctor because I do not have medical insurance and can't afford to go unless I absolutely have to. I know that you cannot diagnose me over the computer but can you give me an idea of different things that this could be? I am really desperate here! Thank you so so much. Melissa\n\n",

Most of the time it would start when I laid down. This went on for a couple of days and by Saturday night I was hurting so bad that I had no choice but to go to the emergency room. Of course, they ended up admitting me and doing surgery. I had many many many Gall Stones!!! On the sonogram it was really bad. My gall bladder was full of stones. And now I am home from the hospital and am in pain from the surgery and from the urinary tract infection I got at the hospital. Yeah, sucks huh? Anyway, I am relieved that it was something that could be fixed. Why do we even have gall bladders anyway? We can live with them or without them.\n\n",

Here's my situation:  I'm a 17 year olf female.  wthl a lot of cancer in my family, on both sides.  my father had colon cancer and brain cancer, my grandfather had cancer, my cousin has non-hodgkins lymphoma, and this list continues from there.  as you can see, cancer is common in my family.  back in January, i found a lump in my breast.  i went to get an ultrasound done, and they said it is just a cyst, but to come back in 6 months.  2 weeks ago, i found a lump in my neck.  it is slightly larger that a kinda flaty, deformed-shaped pea.  it is not tender, not it is rock hard.  it moves slightly, and i know that if it moves, it is not a need to be alarmed.  my mom seems rather concerned about this lump compared with the earlier one in my breast.  she wants me to go to see my doctor.  i, of couse will.  in the meantime though.....any ideas or commenets?\n\n",

    "title": "losing voice, sore throat, and lump",
    "content": "Right up front - I smoke. I have smoked for 34 years.  Over the past year, or so, I have developed an \"on again, off again\" sore throat. The soreness is isolated to the right side only. Sometimes, it feels as if I am trying to swallow a small lump, other times it feels as if there is something very small stuck inside, and other times I feel nothing at all.  I have a cough. Sometimes it is clearly a \"smoker's cough\", but other times it is a \"tickling\" cough. When it's the \"tickling cough\", I have no control over it. The coughing, more often than not, leads to a bout of sneezing. The \"tickle\" that I'm trying to cough away will make me sneeze. Over and over until the coughing subsides. Cough-sneeze-cough-sneeze, etc..  Since this all started, I also began to lose my voice. It's gradually become worse. At this point in time, it's become so bad that I cannot sing anymore at all. If I try to sing, my voice will simply disappear even though I'm trying very hard to push out sound. If sound does manage to sneak out, it will change pitch uncontrollably and the \"noise\" will come and go, come and go (i.e., noise-silence-noise-silence). Also, if I talk for any length of time - even sometimes right from the onset of speech - my voice will quickly turn hoarse and then start breaking up.  Could my voice/sore throat/coughing problems be completely related to irritation of the throat caused by smoking? Or do these symptoms sound as if it might be something a bit more serious?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "About a week ago I noticed a lump in my neck.  The lump is submandibular, directly midline, just where my chin and my neck meet.  The lump is fixed, hard, and tender, though not painful.  It doesn't seem to have any invovlment with my throat and I've had no hoarsness or recent URI's.  I have not noticed any enlargement of any lymph nodes and I have been without fever.  I have, however, been very fatigued lately.  I have not had any dramatic weight loss.  I saw a physician today and because they were very busy I felt as if I was not assessed as I should have been.  This physician noticed a blemish on my chin that's small and scabbed over.  She did not do a complete H&P, collect any labs, nor did she enquire about s/s I might have.  She said that this lump was likely an enlarged lymph node r/t my pimple.  I explained that I have had the lump days before the pimple appeared.  She left and came back and wrote me a prescription for an antibiotic.  She said that I should come back in two weeks after taking the antibiotic and if the lump has not gone away.  My question is whether or not it's likely that a blemish could be the result of this lump in my neck and should I continue with the antibiotic as she prescirbed and follow up afterwards or should I see another physician?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Tenderness is one sign favouring inflammation to cancer as a cause of your lymph node enlargement. How large is your lymph node. Depending on your examination if the index of suspicion for malignancy is not high the standard procedure would be to prescribe an antibiotic and check after 2 weeks. Take into consideration that the most common cause of lymph node enlargement is infection.  It could be related to the scab you are describing or to a hidden septic focus. Either way I would agree with your doctors decision.  Best regards,\n\n",

I  don't really know when they appeared.  I can not remember.  Over they last, oh say  the last 5 to 7 years, I have had facial twitches that would last about 5 min. off and on.  head aches not migranes off and on.  Migranes don't happen that much.  I have an acitiy bitting sensation when I eat, off and on, that  cause me to have problems when I swallow.  Right now I have several glands swallen down the left side of my neck.  Sometimes when I read or when I am on the computer or consentrating on something for a hour or so, I have weird things happen with my eye sight.  sometimes like a hallo around what I'm looking at or like things are jumping or sliding around.  Like someone is jiggleing the book when I am reading.  Or it looks like something is sliding across the table in millimeters oooches.  Sometimes when I grab something I think I have it and I don't,  I have to grip tighter so that I don't drop it. What is in bold just started happening resently,  about 5mths give or take.  Can you help me figure out if I should be worried.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

The cystic neoplasm is surrounded by a lamina of lymphoid tissue which occasionally contains germinal centers, but no lymph nodesinuses are observed. Nevertheless, syudies have demostrated that most cases resembling squamous cell carcinoma arising in a branchial cleft cyst turn out to be nodal metastasis with subsequent demonstration of another primary source.  I hope I have provided the correct info. Thanks for your reply.  Here are a few words from an onocologist I am seeeing:  \"I did speak to the pathologist. Apparently the pathology was not labeled properly and so nodal counts which are usually done on neck dissections were not done. One node was involved with cancer and there was no extracapsular spread. The size was 3.5 x 5.0 cm on the CT scan which means it is a stage N2a. Your base of tongue biopsy also shows dysplasia which is suggestive  of an underlying malignancy in the base of tongue.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Its possible that the associated tongue dysplasia is the culprit, hiding behind it the source. As for whether you should receive radiotherapy or not, it all depends on the extent of neck dissection that you have undergone. It seems that in your case unfortunately the lymph node count was not performed. This puts you at risk of inadequate therapy. I personally think that combined surgery and radiation therapy is mandatory in your case. Radiation fields may involve the base of the tongue as well. Please speak with your radiotherapist about the procedure and possible complications.   Best regards,\n\n",

Her surgeon now wants to remove her mandible, which she is not willing to do. They are considering coming to the US to seek out some other treatment. From what I have gathered from other sources, a bone scan should be performed to see if the cancerhas metasticized to other areas, however I have also heard that there should be some recovery period between the radiation therapy and the bone scan. Does the radiation-induced damage interfere with the interpretation of the bone scan?   Any advice is greatly appreciated!  Thank you\n\n",

Was there an improvement seen with the 1st MRI to the second along with improvement in healing of surgerized area??  Having discomfort still since 24th of September would not be out of the ordinary considering the treatment; again, the extensiveness of the surgical treatment, biopsy results are important..  What concern me is that from your statement, the Surgeon wants to remove the mandible ---> my assumption is that he sees something from post-op tests and physical examination....  Let me say here and now that with the magnitude of the Squamous Cell Carcinoma diagnosis, the seriousness and/or aggressiveness of proposed treatment requires anyone in this situation(even a lesser one) to get a 2nd opinion; any good Doctor with anyone's health in mind should always tell a patient to get a 2nd opinion especially given this situation...  Yes, the radiation treatment could create a slower healing process and therefore this should be taken in consideration when doing a bone scan ===> again allot depends on the initial invasive procedure.... If coming to the US is an option for a second opinion and viable, then by all means do so...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear CED, Thank you so much for replying to my message.  Sorry for the vague details about the surgical intervention. I'm relying on an engineer to translate the medical document. Also it seems that some of the  eastern European medical systems provide minimal information to the family and patient regarding their condition.   In regard to the intial surgery, cancerous lesions were removed from the right side of the tongue in May. So only soft tissue removed. Following surgery there was a disagreement between the surgeon and the radiologist whether radiotherapy should be started. They decided not have radiotherapy and check every two weeks. (looking back this seems like a bad choice).  During one of these check-ups two months later, a biopsy indicated more cancer in the tongue and radiotherapy started the next day. They did *not* do a pre-therapy MRI, nor investigate problems with her teeth. Radiotherapy, totaling 70 Gy (not sure if this unit is correct) proceeded 5 days per week for 35 days. The fact that they started radiotherapy the following day after being told they were booked solid indicates that they were deeply concerned.  Based on two MRIs, 3 and 7 weeks following the radiotherapy, removal of the manidibula was suggested.  I am trying to get the MRIs reviewed within my network of colleagues but it is a pretty slow process as I am three or four people removed from the radiologist.  She is scheduled to visit the surgeon today but I think they are going to put off this drastic surgery until she can be re-evaluated at a cancer center in the US. We are looking into MD Anderson, Sloan-Kettering and the University of Michigan.  What you say about the discomfort following radiotherapy jibes with what I've heard from other sources. Apparantly there was almost no information given to her addressing  these issues (she was told to take an aspirin).   Again, thank you for responding.\n\n",

I have had bronchitis or sore throats, etc since Novemeber this go around. Omnicef, zpacs, etc. Now I feel something when I swallow...like somethings in there. If you drew a line straight into my throat from the bottom of my ear and straight back from my last molar..its in that area. Additionally I have had ear pain. My ears are clear according to the ENT. He cant see any fluid etc. But my right ear hurts periodically and the same side right under the bottom of my skull hurts to move my head to the side or back. When I bend over it feels \"fluidy\" in that area under my skull base behind that ear. What could this be that the shots and medicine don't seem to clear up. What would cause someone these symptoms for 2-3 years? (this skull thing and feeling when I swallow has developed just last 6 months). What type of dr should I go to?\n\n",

After about the third visit my gp basically told me it was all in my mind and i was just simply suffering anxiety.  However, during the last 6 months things have changed even more.  on looking in the mirror at the back of my mouth i noticed what looked like a small underneath of a tongue. So, after yet another visit to the gp, he agreed to look inside my mouth. He was totally astounded at what he could see. He told me it is the tip of my epiglottis, and that he has no idea at all about what has made it come into view. He is referring me to ENT at last. Judging by his surprise and bafflement i am feeling freaky !!!!! joking aside, it is becoming harder for me to eat and being under weight anyway the weight is already showing signs of becoming a problem. AND I AM HUNGRY!! i have a feelong of food getting stuck into a big ball for some time before it filters through and i am gagging when i eat anything and when i am not eating too! has ANYONE got any clues as to what the freaky reason could be? Please answer, I have only joined the internet so I can find out for my self! Thankyou very much in advance, I hungrily await a reply!\n\n",

It may well not be so.  Anyway, it is most reasonable to have an ENT specialist evaluate and examine you.  Most likely a direct visualization will be done to understand more about what was found and what is causing your symptoms.  If anything unusuall is identified, then perhaps a biopsy will be done.  I cannot be any more helpful since epiglottis problems that aren't related to cancer are outside of my area of expertise.  Again, seeing an ENT doctor is the way to go.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Worried,  Thank you very much for the update.  From what you mentioned, it looks that your dad was worked up very well to rule out any local malignancy in the neck that could be pressing on the veins of his neck cauing this or any mass in the chest as well that could be pressing on the big veins of his heart as well. Does your dad have swelling anywhere else like his feet although this is going to be hard to tell as he is getting hydrochlorothiazide for his high blood pressure which is a diuretic so he might have swelling in the feet but since he takes a diuretic it could not be apparent.  i am not sure how bad is your dad's swelling and where is it localized to or is it more prominent in some parts of the head (like the eyes for instance) more than others?  This is a situation where i can only tell you a few thoughts that you might want to consider taking to your doctors if you think they sound reasonable enough as obviosuly your dad has been taken care of very well so far, as the things that you mentioned were done for him were first on my list as regards to his age and symptoms.  You have not mentioned anything about your father's smoking history but he now has asthma. i am not sure whether he has emphysema or not as well (if he was a smoker a long time ago). Sometimes, if a patient has emphysema, he will develop mild swelling of neck and eyes as well. Will fell a headache and has chronic fatigue, reason being that the patient has low oxygen in the blood and sometimes high carbon dioxide as well which give rise to these symptoms. So my suggestion is to have your dad have an echocardiogram (an ultrasound of the heart) to see if your dad has high pulmonary artery pressures in addition to any other abnormality that could be there and affecting the venous flow to the heart. Also, to have your dad have a pulmonary function test done to see his overall lung functions. If his pulmonary artery pressures are high and his lungs functions are normal or not severe enough to justify high pulmonary artery pressures then he should have a sleeping study to rule out sleep apnea (which can give all these symptoms as well especially the chronic fatigue).  Also, just in case your father has not had any blood work done, i suggest that he has a liver function panel, kidney function tests and urine analysis to see if this swelling is related to any dysfunction of these organs.  i am not sure whether the mri and/or the ct scans were done with contrast or without contrast but if they were done without contrast, i think the best next step is to repeat them with iv contrast injection as it allows better visualization of the vascular system.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Oral cancer?",
    "content": "Hi, i'm sure this is nothing but i want to be sure. For the last couple weeks i've had a bit of pain in the back left side of my mouth near the last tooth. About a week ago i noticed a little(smaller than a pea) bump under the skin in side the side of my mouth above my last tooth on the bottom. I was assumeing most of the pain was do to my wisdom teeth which i'm gonna have removed in a couple months. This little bump under the skin isn't really painful. Its not a canker sore i've had those b4. From the outside it just looks like the normal part of inside my mouth. I was wondering what this could be, i've read about similar symptoms being oral cancer, but i'm a 19 year old male, who has never smoked(although both my parents do), and i rarely drink(maybe once every couple months). Is this something i should be worried about and should see a doctor right away?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recurrent orbital hemangioma",
    "content": "Dear Dr. Agrawal,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Not being an ophthalmologist or a pediatrician, i searched the electronic litterature and found some information about orbital hemangiomas in children.  Because the majority of hemangiomas require no intervention, the decision to treat should be based on location and depth of the lesion, age of the patient, and likelihood of complication.   Indications for intervention in cases of orbital hemangiomas include: 1. Amblyopia. 2. Compressive optic neuropathy. 3. Proptosis with globe exposure.   Treatment modalities include  1. Intralesional corticosteroid injection. 2. Systemic corticosteroids. 3. Radiotherapy. 4. Laser therapy. 5. Systemic interferon. 6. Surgery. Surgery should be considered for localized, noninfiltrative lesions, or for those that fail to respond to corticosteroids 7. Interferon. 8. Embolization can be used to treat cutaneous hemangiomas that have not responded to medical therapy.  This is a summary of what i found.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
