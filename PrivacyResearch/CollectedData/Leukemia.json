    "content": "I am a 42 year old male. I had Hodgkins (stage 4a) in 1989. 1 Year of Mopp and ABVD, been in remission since. About a year ago I went from 173 pounds down to 160.I have not lost any recently. I went to the doctor for fatigue and tightness in abdomen area. They checked liver and kidney functions, everything ok. They noticed my blood work was strange. They did a flow cymetry test and said that my lymphocytes count was high. I guess normal is around 40-42%, mine was at 80%. They did mri scan and pet scan to check for hodgkins reoccurance, it was ok. They thought during this time that it was early stages of CLL. They did a bone marrow biopsy and aspiration, and said it was ok, so that ruled out Leukemia. He said he did want to see me again in 6 months. He said it could be high due to previous chemo treatments. My question is do you think I should continue to get this checked out or wait for 6 months to see where I am at then.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Normal white blood cell count WBC in children aged 6 years is in the range of 5-14.5 x 109/Liter. Lymphocytes represents 20- 42% of the total WBC count. Thus the absolute lymphocyte count in children aged 6 years is 1.5-7.   Relative lymphocytosis is commonly seen in children due to infections. Absolute lymphocytosis is defined by absolute lymphocyte count of > 7 x 109/Liter Viral infection is known to cause lymphocytosis (relative or absolute) with or without neutropenia. Infectious mononucleosis or cytomegalovirus infection, respiratory syncytial virus infections, etc are all examples of viral infections that give this picture.  Another rare cause is chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Normal platelet count in children and adults is  150\u2013400 x 109/Liter. High platelet values occurs following bleeding, in iron deficiency anemia, and other diseases like cancer or bone marrow disorders (levels are very high in the last two causes).  The given results for your daughter does not make leukemia very likely but in the context of direct clinical examination and complete medical history I assume that her doctor found it more reasonable to consult hematologist and exclude the most serious causes. This is very reasonable and I agree with him to do so.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I have an 8 year old daughter who was hospitilized recently with an acute case of asthma. During the hospital stay, many tests were done, such as chest xray, cbc, they tested her for pneumonia, swine flu, etc. All of her lab work and test came back normal. There was no underlying bacterial infection. She also was not on any kind of steroid therapy at that time. Her CBC showed WBC as 6.6, RBC as 4.16, HGB as 12.5, HCT as 36.9, MCV as 88.7, MCH as 30.0, MCHC as 33.9, RDW as 12.5, PLT as 198, MPV as 10.6, Neutophils as 95.2, (High) , Bands as 1.0, Lymphocytes as 3.8 (Low). She has nosebleeds around 6-7 times a month and has been getting bruises on her legs that are unexplained. She seems to be more tired than usual, going to sleep every day when she gets home from school. I am very concerned that she may have leukemia as her uncle passed away from it and she has a cousin who is suffering with it now. Does this all sound like something I need to check into further? I would really appreciate an answer as I am very anxious and wooried. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mature vs. immature cells in bone marrow",
    "content": "Hello,  To comment on the cellularity of the bone marrow aspirate alone would be nonspecific. Hypercellular marrow can occur in many circumstances including normal conditions as well as in certain types of benign diseases, and malignant ones. Determining cellularity is very important in the diagnosis of malignant blood diseases because the percentage of malignant cells must be reported in relation to the cellularity for correct estimation and diagnosis of the disease.   A lot of other changes in the bone marrow are important when diagnosing malignant blood diseases. All these factors are taken together as there is no single test that can tell you right away what the diagnosis is.  Regarding your question about immature cells: certain types of leukemias e.g. the acute leukemias have immature malignant cells while chronic leukemias have more mature malignant cells. It really depends on the stage of development at which the blood generating cell undergoes malignant transformation.   MDS may show immature cells (up to 20% blast cells, immature red cells) as well as abnormal mature cells (dysplastic).   Malignant hematological diseases are complicated and therefore not always easy to understand. I hope that helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First degree relatives of CLL patients have been found in some studies to have a higher risk of CLL as well as other tumors a phenomenon referred to as familial aggregation. Although this disease is not hereditary and there is no evidence of genetic transmission. It may be that certain genes that run in a family make it more likely for family members to develop these tumors.   Although, there aren't any formal guidelines for special screening of family members of CLL patients, it would be a good idea to let your family doctor / Aunt's doctor know of your concern.

It could be several things really including chemotherapy toxicity. This would depend on the type of chemotherapy that he has received. Cytarabine can cause central nervous system toxicity especially when given intrathecally. L-Asparaginase is another drug commonly used in the treatment in some leukemias and can cause central neurotoxicity. It could also have been a transient metabolic disturbance among other things.  I hope he is doing well.  Best regards,\n\n",

Other causes are high blood pressure, trauma (even nose picking), allergies, alcohol abuse and rhinitis.  Rarely there is a bleeding problem.  If you are worried about serious problems, you would need to have blood testing to rule out such disorders as leukemia.    Best wishes.\n\n",

As for genetic disorders - yes, you can be diagnosed even when you don't find others in the family.  It's just a clue that can help you zero in on a possible cause.    Some people find they are worse in the winter when air is dry due to forced air heating.  If the season change doesn't help, see a doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Leukemia is a lab diagnosis and your blood counts could suggest the diagnosis. In such a case they may increase or decrease (in more severe cases).  Mononucleosis may present with generalized lymph node enlargement (neck, armpits, groins). It appears to me that your lymph nodes are restricted to the neck area and this may be consistent with your upper respiratory tract infection.  Keep us updated!\n\n",

Since a FiSH study was done and did not show the Philadelphia chromosone does that rule out CML? Should I request a PCR test to be sure? Following are the bone marrow results: This is straight off the pathologists report: DIAGNOSIS: LEFT POSTERIOR ILIAC CREST (B08-162-A, B08-162-B)  NORMOCELLULAR BONE MARROW (80%) WITH MYELOID AND MEGAKAROCYTIC HYPERPLASIA  RARE \u201cSEA-BLUE\u201d HISTIOCYTES \u2013 SEE COMMENT  NO LYMPHOID AGGREGATES, GRANULOMAS OR ORGANISMS SEEN  ABSENT IRON STORES \u2013 SEE COMMENT  COMMENTS: The findings of myeloid hyperplasia, small megakaryocytes, and sea-blue histiocytes raises the possibility of chronic myelogenous leukemia. Although rare in patients of this  this age, testing for BCR/ABL has been requested and will be reporteed separately.  Sea-blue histiocytes can also be seen in storage diseases, mostly notably in Gaucher disease. If there is splenomegally, or other manifestations of storage disease then additional testing may be of benefit. However, as a findings, sea-blue histiocytes can be seen in the amrrow where there is high metabolic turn over. The marrow findings could be accounted for by aggressive steroid therapy (increased mature neutrophils, sea blue histiocytes). Clinical correlation is recommended.  The lack of iron stores could be correlated with serum studies of iron status.  The FISH study results: Left Posterior Iliac Crest Bone Marrow B08-162: NOT DETECTED  Total number of cells counted: 200  % of cells showing dual fusion: 0.0%  Comment: There is no evidence for the BCR/ABL fusion associated with the translocation 9.22 (Philadelphia Chromosone) in the cells examined, using the BCR/ABL dual fusion probe system from Vysis, Inc.  Wonder if the abnormal bone marrow results can point to something else, and can I rule out CML because of the FISH study results?\n\n",

Other laboratory findings include high serum levels of vitamin B12 and transcobalamin and lactic dehydrogenase (LDH).  2- The bone marrow examination shows: - a hypercellular marrow, with cellularity of 75%-90%, - myeloid-to-erythroid ratio is usually 10-30:1.  - increase megakaryocytes which are smaller than the typical normal megakaryocytes may be seen in some early stages. 3- Philadelphia chromosome in CML represents a translocation between the long arms of chromosomes 9 and 22 and is found in almost all CML patients (a hallmark).  However, 5-10% 0f cases are Philadelphia negative, of them 40% can turn positive if studied with FISH/ or PCR techniques.  This small subset of patients who are found to be Philadelphia negative should be excluded for other disease like amyeloproliferative disorder MPD or myelodysplasia MDS. Other clonal markers like certain types of JAK kinase mutations analysis would be helpful.  Sea-blue histiocytes are seen in diseases in which there is bone marrow hyperplasia and increased turn over, like CML, MPD, MDS, etc.  I would advise you to follow up with your hematologists.

Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   Elevated Total leukocytic count can occur in different condition like: - Infections, bacterial, viral or fungal. -systemic disease like Rh. Arthritis, Psoriasis, inflamtory bowel diseases and vasculitis as well as physical stress. - Cancer especially hematologic malignancies.  Specific increase in one blood element is more indicative of certain medical conditions, e.g  - esiophilia in allergic people, and parasitic infection,  - monocytosis is commonly seen in bacterial infections,  - neutrophilia (like in your case) in most infections and tissue damage like inflammatory and metabolic diseases.  Other known causes include: Smoking is well documented to increase the white cell count. Hereditary neutrophilia is another cause.  Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000.  Other tests known to be elevated in tissue damage and inflammatory conditions are ESR, LDH and CRP.  So, having an idea about their level would be helpful.  When leukemia is suspected Bone marrow Aspirate and biopsy should be evaluated. Other symptoms like loss of weight, generalized weakness, fever, headache and bony pains, are warning although shared by both active inflammatory (tissue damage) and malignant causes.  Persistent elevation in the white blood cell count should be investigated properly to exclude both chronic systemic inflammatory conditions and malignancy.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First off, this would not be symptoms of leukemia in and of themselves but can be symptoms of many conditions.  The lump could be a swollen lymph node which your body uses to fight infection of any type.  You should talk to a doctor about the fatigue because that symptom alone is not enough to diagnose.  I assume you are doing that since you had blood work done.    Thyroid can fluctuate when the gland is not functioning properly and this can be a cause of the fatigue.  I don't know what is causing the swelling behind your knees - again you need to see a doctor to determine the cause.  Popping joints happen to everyone and some people do get this more frequently than others.  There is a vacuum that is created in the synovial joints when the fluid fluctuates.  It is nothing to worry about.    Achy muscles can be a sign of fibromyalgia (as well as other conditions).   Try moderate exercise.  But, it can also result from low potassium, which can also result in fatigue.  You might try adding potassium rich foods to your diet such as      * Bananas     * Bran     * Brussels sprouts     * Granola     * Kiwi     * Lima beans     * Milk     * Oranges     * Peaches     * Peanut butter     * Peas and beans     * Tomatoes  Best wishes\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ALL and high Ferritin Levels",
    "content": "Hello, It would be helpful if you can give us more information about the history of her disease. Information like how she responded to treatment, which disease status she is in right now (especially the results of last bone marrow and blood picture evaluation) , blood transfusion frequency and the condition of other body organs (i.e. liver function tests).  Most of the iron in our body is stored in the form of ferritin, a protein bound iron. Since ferritin is in the inside of cells, its level in the blood is small. Ferritin level may be high or low in association with certain diseases.   Ferritin test is usually performed together with the level of iron and other blood elements to confirm the type of anemia when levels are low. To the contrary, elevated blood levels are seen in cases of increased iron absorption (genetic disorders), following excess blood transfusion, blood hemolysis or damage in certain organs.   Organs that store ferritin (especially the liver, spleen, and bone marrow), when damaged cause elevation in ferritin levels although the total amount of iron in the body is normal. Thus liver diseases, blood diseases including leukemia, infections and inflammatory conditions like arthritis are associated also with high ferritin level mostly with normal level of iron.  Ferritin is also considered an acute-phase reactant that is elevated in the course of an inflammatory disease. In such cases another acute phase reactant: C-reactive protein is studied to examine if this elevated ferritin caused by acute phase reactions (elevated C-reactive protein as well) or not (normal C-reactive protein level).   Very high ferritin levels (greater than 1,000 ng/mL) signify an iron overload and can be seen in conditions like excess iron absorption (congenital hemochromatosis), excess blood transfusions (acquired hemochromatosis) or abnormal erythropoeisis (in bone marrow diseases like MDS).   Too much iron deposition in body organs, like the liver, endocrine organs, pancreas or heart, may negatively affect their function. So this condition needs proper management and follow up.  In your daughter\u2019s case, checking complete blood picture, bone marrow examination if not done recently and if the blood picture result is suggestive, Comb\u2019s test, liver function test, hepatitis markers and blood sugar may be helpful depending on her history.

I am going o ask my daughter's doctors to run all of the tests you have mentioned. She hasn't had a bone marrow in quite some time and I'm not exactly sure what a complete blood picture is. She has had many transfusions, but none in the last 7 months, would that still possibly be the cause of the high ferritin? Again, thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi amlquestion, It would be next to impossible for me to state regarding the likelihood or not of passing AML from a genetic standpoint. In most cases of AML, determination of the causative factor can not be identified. Genetic tendencies although may increase the risk of certain diseases such as cancer it does not necessarily mean that one is destined to develop cancer in their lifetime. Other factors play a role in development too, for example, lifestyle, diet, obesity, environmental factors, etc. Something for you and your partner to consider would be genetic counseling on inherited diseases. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Low WBC/High Lymphs +strange symptoms. Could it be Leukemia?",
    "content": "Hi, My son has a lot of problems.  Most recently it has been the inability swallow food.  He can swallow drinks, yogurt but not \"real\" food... even his favorites.  He can get food down (some types) for example... it took him 3 hours to eat a McDonald's Hash Brown this morning.  He takes a bite, chews it until it is liquid & then either swallows it or spits it out.  He has lost 4lbs since 6/5/08 (although he has gained 1-2lbs back since we have him drinking extra nutritional drinks & Ice cream shakes - we offer him \"real\" food prior to giving him the extra calorie drinks).  We have seen an ENT, Gastro & Primary... all studies are normal.  They don't think it is eosinophilic esophagitis.  He was on Prevacid 15mg 2x/day (although as of this morning, we decided to wean him off the Prevacid).  Miralax 1x/day (constipation), Vitamins.  He is lactose intolerant (takes Lactaid chewables).    He is 8 y/o 49lbs (5th percentile) 4'2\" (50th percentile).  His lymph nodes always look swollen to me (our Doctor always mentions them \"shoddy nodes\" but seems to think they are normal).  He has other random symptoms that prompted her to check for signs of leukemia (bone pain, night sweats).  He also has sleep apnea (undiagnosed... Doc says that if it is less than 15 seconds, we are not going to worry about it (it goes up to 12 seconds)).  He recently had a tooth chip off for no apparant reason.. he was eating yogurt out of a tube.  He gets a film on his teeth that I have to scrape off... he is a good brusher so I don't understand this.    Bloodwork done on 7/2/08 (Abnormal results have a \"*\", borderline have a \"-\") - when this bloodwork was done - he did not have any kind of illness (last cold was in March or April)  *Glucose 96 (50-90 - normal) *T.Bili 1.7 (1.1 on 11/07) (0.2-1.3 - normal) *WBC 3.5 (5.3 on 11/07) (4.5-13.5 - normal)    -RBC 5.02 (3.7-5.3 - normal)    Hemoglobin 12.9 (10.7-14.7 - normal)     Hematocrit 38.6 (31-43 - normal) *MCV 76.9 (77.0-95.0 - normal)    MCH 25.7 (23-33 - normal)    MCHC 33.4 (31-37 - normal)    -RDW-SD 37.2 (37-54 - normal)    RDW-CV 13.3 (11-16 - normal)    -Platelet 187 (150-400 - normal)    MPV 11.7 (8.2-12.2 - normal) *Lymphs 44 (0-38 - normal)    Monos 9 (2-14 normal)    Eos 1 (0-5 - normal)    -Basos 0 (0-2-normal)    -ABS Neut Count 1.6 (1.5-7 - normal) *U/A - clarity is Turbid (normal - clear)  LEUKEMIA symptoms & how they relate to my son (my comments in all caps). Fevers or night sweats: HE IS OFTEN VERY SWEATY (HAIR/FACE) AT NIGHT WHEN I CHECK ON HIM.  HE HAS NOT HAD ANY FEVERS  Frequent infections: NOT SO MUCH THIS... ONLY A FEW \"NORMAL\" CHILDHOOD INFECTIONS... NONE RECENTLY.  LAST EAR INFECTION IN JANUARY I THINK  Feeling weak or tired: SOMETIMES WEAK & TIRED (BUT THIS COULD BE FROM NOT EATING).  HE CAN STILL DO THINGS THAT ALL KIDS DO... RIDE BIKES, SWIM...  Headache: LATELY HE HAS COMPLAINED OF HEADACHES (AROUND 2 OR 3 IN THE PAST FEW WEEKS).  NONE PRIOR TO THESE 2 OR 3.  Bleeding and bruising easily (bleeding gums, purplish patches in the skin, or tiny red spots under the skin): HE HAS A FEW BRUISES (NOTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY) PROBABLY BECAUSE HE IS CLUMSY??? NONE OF THE OTHER SYMPTOMS  Pain in the bones or joints: YEAH... ALL THE TIME!  ANKLES LATELY (CLASSIC GROWING PAIN SYMPTOMS)... LEG/BONE PAIN PRETTY BAD A FEW MONTHS AGO (ONLY LEFT LEG & NOT SIMILAR TO GROWING PAINS)... NOW ONLY ONCE OR TWICE A WEEK  (THIS PAIN HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR YEARS SINCE AGE 5 OR 6 I THINK)  Swelling or discomfort in the abdomen (from an enlarged spleen) HE ALWAYS HAS TUMMY PAIN... BUT WHERE IT IS LOCATED, I DO NOT KNOW.  SHE DIDN'T MENTION ANY ENLARGED ORGANS AT OUR RECENT WELL VISIT.  TUMMY PAIN IS BEING TREATED BY A GASTROENTEROLOGIST.  HE STARTED MIRALAX RECENTLY & THAT SEEMS TO HAVE HELPED THE TUMMY PAIN QUITE A BIT!  Swollen lymph nodes, especially in the neck or armpit: HE HAS HAD SWOLLEN LYMPH NODES FOR YEARS... THAT HAS ALWAYS CONCERNED ME!  BUT EACH DOCTOR SEEMS TO THINK THAT THEY AREN'T TOO BAD & IT IS \"NORMAL\"... THEY LOOK AWFUL TO ME (THEY MAY ALSO STICK OUT MORE SINCE HE IS SO THIN?)  Weight loss:   HE LOST ALMOST 4LBS, BUT GAINED ONE OR TWO BACK, BUT AGAIN, PROBABLY DUE TO NOT SWALLOWING FOOD!    Our doctor wants to recheck his blood... but didn't mention when (I will call her once we are back from vacation on 7/30).  What is a reasonable length of time to wait before we recheck his bloodwork?  I just want to know if I am doing the right thing by waiting... we need to get this swallowing thing under control (counseling?) unless it truly is a medical reason causing it (and now that she put leukemia in my mind... I can't relax!).  I read that leukemia can show itself in other areas of the body... digestive tract being one of them.    Could you please put my mind at ease or tell me what my next step should be?  Thanks so much (& sorry for being so wordy!) :)\n\n",

We took him off prevacid and he seems to be handling that w/no problems.  He has not gained any weight back but also has not lost anymore.

    "content": "Hello Sam999,  I would be fairly concerned about this.  The white blood cell count being elevated, in itself, is not particularly concerning since some infections can do this.  However, the eosinophil count is dramatically elevated.  This is most definitely worth evaluating.  Eosinophilic leukemia is much less common than other forms of leukemia but it does exist.  Your symptoms are pretty non-specific and could be from any number of things.  Eosinophils can also become elevated in hyperallergic conditions and with infections with microbes such as parasites.  The bone marrow biopsy will allow evaluation for leukemias and other problems with eosinophil production.  If there is a condition such as eosinophilic leukemia, the earlier it can be detected the better.  Just based on this I would tend to agree that a bone marrow biopsy is in order.  However, I do not have access to your entire medical chart and cannot directly evaluate you so I cannot make a recommendation about this.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Suzan902,  This is a bit puzzling.  My one thought would be that your daughter may have a condition called Henoch-Schonlein Purpura.  It can cause a bruise-like rash (called purpura).  Typically, these spots develop in the legs/buttocks and spare the arms but in more severe cases they can also develop on the arms.  They often appear in gravity dependent areas so the legs get targeted most.  In this condition, all the blood tests are typically normal.  You may want to discuss this possibility with your daughter's doctor.  Beyond this I'm a bit stumped.  What you are describing doesn't sound classic for HSP but it sounds like it is possible.  Keep us updated if you don't mind.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a bit worried about my 14 month old son.  Here is his history.  Recurrent and very resistant ear infections since 8 weeks old. To the point he received 100 mg/kg/day of amoxil and the infection would come back 24-48 hours after 10 day course of treatment.  Tubes put in around 4 month of age. (At this point, he had 5 infections within 2 months)  Since then, 2 ear infections (one curred with drops and second one curred with drops + 2 course of high dose amoxil).  Pneumonias and bronchiolitis X 3.  Sinusitis X2   Seems in a constant state of \"cold\".    In June, started to have recurrent MOUTH bleeds without injury.    In July, started waking up in morning with bluish color arourd lips and blue hands.  Comes back to normal after a few hours.  In September, starting waking up at nigth just screaming and sweaty.  I actually had to bath him in the middle of the night. Also, I've noticed loss of appetite most of the time.  He his vary pale.  Blood work starting to show beginning of anemia.  Now, my problem is that I have had a couple of consultations with our doctor who says everything is fine (babies have weak immune system, chidren can get blue lips and hands if they cry to much, teething can cause a bit of bleeding, at some point there is a normal phase of appetite loss...) He doesn`t seem to realise that my son is NOT crying when bluish lips and the bleeding is NOT a BIT and my previous chilren did not have a \"normal phase of appetite loss\" until 18 months old - and none of them actually lost weight, like I suspect he did.  My son has gone for 3 CBC`s.  Monocytes and basophils elevated and young cells (myelocytes: 1%) in circulation.  Each count, they go higher and higher (Now monocytes: 1.3 and basophils: 0.2)  WBC is also going higher but they are still in the normal range. (Now at 17)  Am-I allowed to worry about him or am-I going nuts?  Sometimes, I wonder.  I know that there is a form of rare leukemia in children that is hard to diagnose.  Could it be JMML?  What tests do you suggest?  Could I received more info on it - symptoms...?   Thank-you so much for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Labtechmom,  Myelocytes and normoblasts are simply immature forms of normal cells in the blood.  If the bone marrow is rapidly producing cells (as in the case of a recent infection or inflammatory response, for example) it can sometimes push out a few of these less mature cells.  Small amounts such as your son has are generally not concerning.  Larger amounts may be indicative of a problem with maturation causing the cells to stop maturing (such as in lymphoma or leukemia).    I would recommend your son have a repeat CBC in the next few weeks to see if this has resolved.    Regarding the nose bleeds, common causes of nose bleeds in young children include trauma, and dry air/nasal passages.  You may want to try using a humidifier at night or using a nasal moisturizer several times a day for a while to see if this helps.  The most common organic cause of nose bleeds when looking for a blood problem will be Von Willebrand's disease that can be tested for by looking at the ristocetin cofactor level.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Also, he started to have nightsweats...to the point I have to bath and change him.  He went for another CBC.  Results are about the same with one difference. WBC count normal but monos and baso are slightly elevated and presence of many variant lymphs.  I actually looked at the smear and there is one cell I have never seen in 10 years experience.    It looks like a lymphocyte but the cytoplasm is scant and the nucleus have numerous lobules...looks like popcorn or brain-like.  Many of the`'variant lymphocyte' seen have a slit in the middle of the nucleus.  My gut-feeling:  lymphoma cell.  The thing is that I have not seen any before.    Even worse, the tech who read the slide did not comment on any of this so family doctor has NO clue that something might be wrong.  What do you suggest I do?  What are the symptoms of lymphoma and what tests should I ast for confirmation of diagnostic?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Msmiss,  The list of things that can cause an elevated leukocyte count is quite long.  Stress can cause an elevation as can a simple cold.  Leukemia is on the list as well.  The actual types of leukocytes are more helpful in determining the risk of leukemia.  If any \"blasts\" are seen this would be very suspicious for leukemia.  If the leukocyte types are all normal, leukemia is much less likely.  If you happen to have the cell type differential to post for me I'd be happy to take a look and let you know what I think.    Overall, I would not be too worried about a level of 12.6 being leukemia.  Most likely it is from the stress or a little infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sweetone,  Familial risk of developing cancer depends a lot on what type of cancer is in the family.  There are some cancer types where risk is inherited (such as some breast cancers) and others that are much less likely to be impacted by family history (such as cervical cancer).  Leukemias can present with anemia but other causes of anemia and fatigue are much more common.  Severe anemia, itself, can cause fatigue.  Iron deficiency is probably the most common cause of anemia.  If you are bruising easily as well it is a good idea to have your platelet count checked also.  If you have anemia and low platelets you may need to have a bone marrow biopsy done to make sure everything is OK.  If you are having difficulty determining why you are bruising easily or if you are unable to find the cause of your anemia I would recommend you see a hematologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 46 year old white female. 9 years ago on a routine visit, my doctor saw that I had low platelet count and sent me to an oncoland ogist. He ran tests (at the time I was also anemic) and decided that I had IPT and told me to take iron pills. 3 years ago my current doctor sent me back to another oncologist because my WBC was low and my  platelets were still low (around 80,000). The oncologist ran more tests which came back OK and took another CBC; at that point my WBC were 4.1 and platelets 115,000. The remaining test would have been a bone marrow biopsy which I opted not to do. I feel great, I excercise hard 6 days per week, my weight is fine, no fever at all this winter, but...last month I went to my doctor for my cholesterol checkup and he did a CBC again, and again my WBC were 2.4 and platelets 99,000 and here I went to the oncologist AGAIN. When she ran another CBC my WBC was 4.1 and platelets 118,000. I have finally agreed to have a bone marrow biopsy this coming monday. What do you think?\n\n",

    "title": "CBC Differenital",
    "content": "Hello.  I am a 24 yo female, currently diagnosed with \"inflammatory arthritis\" and obstructive sleep apnea.  I was diagnosed with arthritis 1 year ago after experiencing crippling joint pain & fever.    I have currently been experiencing an abnormal amount of fatigue, increasing joint pain & fever.  The fatigue is quite debilitating, I am unable to preform 10-20 minutes of any activity without having to lay down & rest & I could sleep all day every day despite how much sleep I received the previous night.    I have been concerned that there is more than just arthritis going on since the exacerbation of symptoms began & recent bloodwork has increased my concerns, especially when compared to a CBC that was done a year ago.  I have a family history of leukemia, but I am not sure what type.    My recent CBC differential results:   WBC - normal at 7.1  Platelets - normal at 295 Neutrophils = 30.0% (reference range of 37-75, test 1 year ago showing level of 62.3%) Lymphocytes - 56.1% (reference range of 12-50, test 1 year ago showing level of 26.2%) Monocytes - 10.3% (range of 0-10, 1 year ago 6.8%)  I agree with my doctors that there is some type of arthritis occurring, as I have some joint deformities to both hands.  My PMD, however, seems concerned that there is something more ocurring, but cannot decide what is going on.  I know arthritis can be debilitating, but what I am experiencing has been relentless for the past year, with no flare-remission periods, only ever-increasing symptoms.    I have never had a + rheumatoid factor, or + ANA, only a + HLA-B27 test, and a bone scan that shows abnormal activity in almost every joint.  I have been tested for HIV & hepatitis, both of which were negative. My ESR/CRP have been in the normal range, with only 2 execptions, at which point they were only mildly elevated.  My current medications: Humira injections 40mg every week Sulfasalazine 3gm/day Relafen 500 mg/bid Mobic 15mg/day Folic Acid 1 gm/day Ambien 10mg/day Prednisone bursts as needed, none taking around time of recent CBC  I am hesitant to voice my concerns to my physician as I don't want him to think I am overreacting, but the fatigue & pain has become very debilitating, and honestly,  I am beginning to feel a sense of impending doom. Is it possible my abnormal blood studies are simply due to medication? I know that are not significantly abnormal, I am just feeling SO awful.  I was not ill with any type of infection at the time the test was preformed.   I have knowledge of medical terminology, as I am an ER nurse, so any opinions/replies would be greatly appreciated.   Thank you.\n\n",

I suspect that you had some routine blood tests such as a complete blood count.  If a cancer were hiding in the bone marrow, one might see changes on the CBC.  Overall, a normal set of lab work is reassuring that nothing bad is going on but it cannot be a guarantee.    There are probably as many different causes of fatigue as there are types of cancer.  By statistical odds, you have one of the other causes.  Did your fatigue start after beginning the Lexapro?  Fatigue is a known side effect of this medication.  I would suggest following up with your doctor to discuss your symptoms.  You may need to consider changing to a different medication for your GAD that is not as fatiguing.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I really like that the lexapro works for my anxiety, so I can deal with the fatigue if that is what causes it.  I just wanted to know on the bloodwork.  The very last bloodwork, my doctor told me was \"perfect.\"  He said he rarely sees that, so I'm happy about that.  I guess you just can't develop cancer in one day can you?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear stumpedNSJ,  Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs) are lymphocytes with a size larger than that of the normal lymphocytes and contain azurophilic cytoplasmic granules. LGLs are classified phenotypically (cell membrane markers) into Natural killer NK cell or T-cell phenotype.   There are four lymphoproliferative disorders affecting LGLs:  reactive/transient LGL expansion,  chronic LGL lymphocytosis,  indolent LGL leukemia, and  aggressive LGL leukemia.  80% of LGL leukemia are due to clonal expansion of the T-cell phenotype. The T-cell variant of chronic lymphocytic leukemia CLL represents 25% of all CLL cases.   Different viruses have been implicated in the pathogenesis of LGL leukemia like: Human T-cell leukemia-lymphoma virus-I-II (HTLV I-II), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and Human Herpes virus type-8 (HHV8). However no direct relation between the infection with any of these viruses and the development of T-LGL leukemia.  Any case of unexplained cytopenias and high numbers of LGLs should be investigated for LGL leukemia.  Laboratory investigation: complete blood picture CBC and blood smear show any of the following: Neutropenia in almost 85% of cases (counts of 500/\u00b5l in 50% of patients).  Anemia in 50% of the cases. Moderate thrombocytopenia in 20% of them.   The peripheral blood smear: A normal lymphocytic count or a mild lymphocytosis ( 7,800/\u00b5l).  Increased number of the circulating granular lymphocytes up to 4,000/\u00b5l (N. 223 \u00b1 99/\u00b5l).   Criteria for diagnosis of LGL leukemia:  Abnormal monoclonal proliferation of CD8+ T cells in patients with cytopenia.  Clonality is measured by gene rearrangement studies using Southern blotting or by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) on the DNA extracted from the proliferating large lymphocytes. PCR is the most commonly used for its convenience. Flow cytometry analysis is another procedure that can be also used.   The classic immunophenotype of the malignant T cell in LGL leukemia is CD3+CD4\u2013CD8+CD16+CD27\u2013 CD45R0\u2013CD57+CD94+.   Atypical lymphocytosis occurs in many conditions that should be excluded before the diagnosis of LGL leukemia. The majority of these causes are viral infections.  In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection the atypical lymphocytes are not CD57+.  In Cytomegalovirus infection in spite the mild increase in CD3+, CD57+ LGL; there is no evidence for TCR gene rearrangement.  In Human immunodeficiency virus infection, the LGL are polyclonally expanded.  A common association between LGL leukemia and other systemic diseases is common and include: Autoimmune diseases, e.g. rheumatoid arthritis RA , Felty's syndrome Hematologic disorders including, autoimmune thrombocytopenia, autoimmune hemolytic anemia, and  Other malignancies such as myelodysplasia and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders.  Natural History, Prognosis, and Therapy of LGL Leukemia: LGL leukemia is an indolent chronic disorder. Some patients with mild cytopenias and/or lymphocytosis remain asymptomatic for a long period. Spontaneous remissions have been reported in some studies.  In symptomatic cases (majority) treatment should be initiated. Being a rare malignancy, treatment recommendations are based on data coming from case reports and retrospective studies. Recurrent neutropenia and infections are the main concern in treatment of this disease.  Treatments for symptomatic cases include: Growth factors: Both G-CSF and GM-CSF are effective in the treatment of severe infections with netropenia  Immunosuppressive agents are used in patients with both neutropenia and anemia, they include Methotrexate,  Cyclophosphamide, and  Cyclosporine  All of them have been used alone or in combination with prednisone.  Prednisone alone produced clinical improvement in neutropenia. Fludarabine and pentostatin have been shown to induce clinical and not cytogenetic remission.   I hope you find this information helpful  Best regards,\n\n",

The Doctors have said due to his age and his symptoms (breatlessness, fatigue and chest pain) chemotherapy and bone marrow transplantation are not options.  He has had 4 blood transfusions a week apart with 2-4 units on each occassion.  He felt terrific after the first (like a 21 year old again!) but no different after the others. The doctors are now only suggesting morphine for the pain and breathing.  Are there any other options which can be considered to extend his life or slow down the leukemia (he would really like to reach his golden wedding anniversary in 3 months)  ?  Any comments would be appreciated. Worried son.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chris,  I am sorry for the delay in responding to your message. I hope he has received the appropriate medical care.  Even old patients with AML are offered chemotherapy treatment. It is the only way to achieve remission for this disease. The prognosis and Remission rates in adult AML are inversely related to age, with an expected remission rate of >65% for those younger than 60 years.  Old patients above the age of 70 can be offered standard doses of chemotherapy for induction, if their general condition allows. However, only 1 or 2 cycles of induction therapy is given to reach CR. Consolidation doses are not recommended instead they are either kept on follow up or on low dose of cytarabine.  For those who suffer from high leukocyte count can receive cytoreductive drug (hydroxyurea and cytarabine) to control the leukocytosis related complication.  Supportive care will improve temporarily the general condition.   New trials are running to explore the role of new drugs in improving the outcome in Geriatric patients with acute leukemia.   Your doctor must have a very good reason not to give him the chemotherapy treatment, so I advise you to discuss with him these informations to understand well the reasons behind this decision.  Best of luck.\n\n",

Add  to that that the negative effect of the disease on the body immune system _(impaired B cell function)  During the period of neutropnia the body is very vulnerable to diverse form of infections and at a rate higher than in normal healthy individuals. It is advisable during this period to avoid being in environments where there is a major source of infection, especially in places where the type of organisms is very particular and more resistant like hospitals. Keep in mind that infections in neutropenic patients are very critical and require a very special medical care. Treatment of hairy cell leukemia results in long term disease remission.  I advise you to: If you insist to go back for work in between your cycles it is better to avoid the days of the expected nadirs,  to do a CBC before you go back to work and  to be very careful not to expose your self to any source of infection and to be to be on follow up with your doctor.

    "content": "Dear Emah,  Normal values for while blood cell and its  elements are:  4,500-10,000 white blood cells/mcl (cells per microliter) Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   Causes of neutropenia (decreased blood cell count) are classified by many docotrs as congenital or acquired.   Congenital causes are: -Congenital immune defects are usually severe to cause life threatening infections. -Cyclic neutropenia presents in the form of periodic neutropenia with mild infections  followed recovery. -Chronic benign neutropenia with less frequent infections. -Familial chronic benign neutropenia, an autosomal dominant form with mild infections. -Nonfamilial chronic benign neutropenias with very benign course. -Idiopathic chronic severe neutropenia, diagnosed by exclusion of other causes as it is associated with severe infection forms.  Acquired causes include: - Infections: the most common cause.  -vitamin B-12, folate,copper and other deficiency Nutritional deficiencies.  -drugs -Splenic sequestration  Your results show either a low normal or low count of the total WBCS and neutrophils, Early, the ymphoctic count was high normal then within normal.  This has been persistent for 3 month, so investigations should be done to find out the underlying cause.  Investigations include: - Lab tests: Complete blood count with manual differential is indicated. Serum vitamin B-12 and RBC folate levels.  -Imaging Studies:  CXR and abdominal US.  -Bone marrow aspiration BMA and biopsy:  If anemia and thrombocytopenia are also present. To examine for the functional state of the bone marrow, congenital neutropenia, fungal infection, and a vitamin B-12 or folate deficiency.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by complete history, physical examination and investigations, the correct diagnosis can be reached.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear car77,   Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e. g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent. The condition can be associated with enlarged cervical Lymph nodes.  Chronic or recurrent pharyngitis and sore throat are usually due to one of these causes:  Post nasal discharge and chronic sinusitis are associated with recurrent sore throat, cough and hoarseness of voice due to irritation and inflammation of the upper part of the respiratory tract (laryngitis).  If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.   Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems.   Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat.  Treatment of allergic cases is mainly by avoiding exposure to the allergen.   Complete history, physical examination and investigations are the only way to reach proper diagnosis and treatment. I advise you to be on follow up with your doctor and to inform him with any new symptoms.  Best regards,\n\n",

The main symptoms of leukemia are:  Anemia, results in shortness of breath and easy tiredness. Thrombocytopenia, (decrease blood platelets) lead to excess bruising.  Leukopenia results in fever and repeated infections. Severe bony pains are common due to infiltration of the bone marrow with malignant cells.  Although other systemic disease can give similar picture,  I advise you to contact your doctor and be checked as soon as possible for the underlying cause of your symptoms which are very considerable.

If this is the case, you might be losing blood in other forms and through other  routs. This results in a degree of anemia, being a female in the reproductive period, losing blood monthly in the days of your cycle will increase your symptoms. Anemia causes headache, easy fatigability and sleeping tendency. I recommend you as a start to do complete blood picture CBC and blood film.  Systemic causes of increased bleeding tendency include:  Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)  Vitamin K deficiency  Chemicals such as Aspirin  Leukemia  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura   Blood tests include CBC with blood film, Bleeding time , prothrombin time and prothrombin concentration are the commonly requested tests in such cases. Specific tests and images are requested accordingly.  I advise you to:  Avoid drugs that increase bleeding tendency like Aspirin. To be checked by your physician for proper medical care.

Laboratory tests that should be repeated include:  complete blood count,  erythrocyte sedimentation rate, C-reactive protein, and urine culture  FUO in 25 % of patients are due to causes other than infection. Exclusion of malignancies is of major importance.. Tumors that can present with FUO include:  lymphoma, lung, pancreatic or primary liver cancer. BMA and biopsy  is done if lymphoma is suspected , in addition to CT,  MRI,  isotopic scan can be done to search for the diagnosis.  Sometimes, symptoms improve spontaneously without identifying any cause.  I advise you to follow up with his doctor and update him with any new symptom.  Best regards,\n\n",

One day I went to the ER b/c I just couldn't even walk. They gave me a blood test and told me I was fine but I needed to see my doctor. They wouldn't let me go until they called him. They were acting weird.   I went into my doc a few days later and he said I that my WBC was normal, but that I had  myelocytes (4) in my blood and I had some abnormal rbc morphology along with a very high monocyte count and a high count of band cells. My platelet count is normally in the high 300's, but it was around 160 last time. I had some red spots under my skin on my bicep. My dr. did repeat blood work and found the same thing again, plus, my liver enzymes were elevated the last time. I don't know the specifics of which enzymes were elevated, but my doc said he hoped it wasn't leukemia.    I'm going in for more specific blood work, but am a little freaked out by him saying that.

Specific changes in the white blood cell count can indicate certain medical condition such as infection, inflammation, or blood malignancies.  Bacterial infections shows characteristics increase in the number of early formed neutrophils(staff) what we call shift to the left.  Certain viral infections produce changes in all blood elements and in the morphology of blood cells.  Morphological and numerical changes in other blood elements are indicative also of certain medical diseases..  Persistent changes and the presence of large immature cells named Blast cells are indicative of blood diseases including leukemia. In such cases bone marrow analysis is a mandatory test to reach the diagnosis.  Complete clinical examination and body imaging is of utmost importance to check for splenomegally hepatomegaly lymphadenopathy.  I advise you to repeat you blood tests and to follow up with your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Carolyn Montgomery,  Platelet production is controlled by a cytokine named thrombopoietin (TPO). Thrombopoietin serum levels are regulated by what is known as c-mpl receptor-mediated intracellular TPO (inside platelets and megakaryocytes) degradation. Different types of gene mutations were discovered familial thrombocytosis. One class involves TPO gene mutations in which there is increased TPO production. The other class involves c-mpl , a (TPO) receptor gene mutations in which there is continuous proliferation signaling for megakaryocytes.   The MPL (myeloproliferative leukemia virus oncogene) gene expression was detected in platelets and peripheral blood mononuclear cells from the majority of patients with Myelop proliferative diseases MPD including chronic myelocytic leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF).  Mutations in c-mpl in other studies showed an effect not only on megakaryocyte  but also on stem cells survival. Worth noting that increased level of c-mpl was found in some patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.  All what I want you to keep in mind is that , the possibility of having altered expression of this gene or any other gene in your family is there, Genetic counseling would be beneficial for sure, however to my knowledge till now No available study confirming the role of  the expression level of these  genes in the prediction or in the prevention of any expected disease.

From the beginning of the symptoms and until diagnose will not take long time, only days or weeks.  I have tendency to easily bleeding from my gum last 6 months. 1 time bleeding gum more than usual (maybe because I swallowed 2 analgesic tablets (aspirin) 3 days before) last May  and recently 1 time coughed small amount of blood (around half of tea spoon) because viral paryngitis.  The dental diagnosis was gingivitis and no more bleeding nor infection in the last 1 month. Also  I did not have purpura, epistaxis, or bleeding from another site.  I had took 7 CBC w/diff,blood clotting test, liver panel test, and renal function test in the last 3 months and all test results were normal and showed no abnormalities, no anemia, no low platelets, no blast cells, or leukemia cells.( I always insisted to ask for CBC test everytime I met doctor for any cold or sore throat)     One times my prothrombin time was increased to 15 seconds ( normal 10-13 sec), when the other values  such as FDP, D-Dimer,Platelets, APTP, and bleeding time were normal. However after the doctor ordered new test, at the next day, the prothrombin time was normal (12.7 sec) and the previous prothrombin time result considered as technical error/bias.   Although after dental treatment my gum now is not bleeding again and I had 7 normal CBC w/ diff test in the last 3 months, I still worry that what happen to me last few months only the beginning of something more serious will come, because I feel I become too easy to get bleeding or infection. Although my infection will go away only in 3-4 days without any medicine.   I under a lot of stress now and have anxiety about the previous symptoms but my health condition basically is good. Only sometimes common mild foot or shoulder pain that come and go. Also tinnitus that come and go, which usually is caused by an acne inside my ears.  I had met hematologist several times, he explained that my symptoms did not represent leukemia at all, he said I definitely healthy, my symptoms only common infection, and I should try to calm myself because if I still nervous I will make my body condition worse.  I only would like to ask everybody in this board, could my symptoms represent something more serious? I do know that Leukemia especially acute form is progressive disease and not \"come and go\" disease but my mind is full with anxiety.  Sometimes I feel my heart pulse is faster than usual, but...after I count, the pulse is always normal (around 72-74 beat/minutes) also the blood pressure is normal around 125/70. I also still can ride bycle  more than 5 kilometers a day, but like I said before, I always worry that something bigger will come.  Please give me some relief, thank you very much, I will really appreciate any opinion to relief my anxiety.  Sincerely\n\n",

These condition can be diagnosed by clinical examination and include : Poor dental hygiene  Gingivitis due to inadequate plaque removal  Periodontitis (advanced form of gingivitis)  Trauma from Toothbrush abrasion,Poorly fitting dentures Other dental problems.   Systemic causes including Leukemia do not present with only gum bleeding, the bleeding tendency is generalized and you will notice other sign for bleeding tendency like skin bruises and prolonged bleeding time. Tthese systemic causes include: Scurvy (Vitamin C deficiency)  Vitamin K deficiency  Chemical irritants such as aspirin  Leukemia   Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura   Blood tests include CBC with blood film, Bleeding time , prothrombin time and prothrombin concentration are the commonly requested tests in such cases.

My D-Dimer was high on one test but it has not been repeated.  I had an ultrasound of my legs and a chest CT but no clots were found.  I've also been told I do not have pernicious anemia.  I was referred to the Mayo Clinic and the only issue they could readily identify was the blood work , Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  My Lymphs have been elevated, taken over a 3 month period at different labs (53.5%, 50% and 50%.)  On the last test, my MPV was a little low 7.4 with a 7.8 low reference range, although the platelet count was 285.  We could not determine that my spleen was enlarged although I do have twinges of pain in that area after eating.  My ESR and CRP has been elevated in all blood tests over the last several years.    I'm experiencing a lot of pain in all joints and difficulty walking.  I understand this is not a likely symptom with CLL.  The pain has greatly impacted my day to day activities and I've had to use a cane for the last 3 months. This has cost me my job and more devastating, my insurance.   I have another couple of weeks before the blood test is repeated.  If the Abs Lymphs are still high, they will perform a bone marrow biopsy.  My question is.... does any of this seem to fit?  Could the hyperhomocysteine anemia account for the other changes I'm now seeing in my bloodwork?  I started taking Foltx again but I see no changes in the pain or improvement in my ability to move.  Waiting is just a terrible thing to endure when the symptoms I have are so debilitating.  Especially when I don't know if they are even connected.  I may be waiting for a diagnosis but not one that will aid in resolving the pain.    I would appreciate your insight.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi dmamacher, Elevations in ESR and CRP may be directly related to CLL as levels in these diagnostics may be elevated in malignancies, and of course certain other conditions as well. Bone and joint pain may also be directly related to CLL. Below is a weblink for you to view if you would care to do so. Click here! I certainly hope you are being followed by a Hematologist/Oncologist. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

He has otherwise led a very healthy life, & is just as sharp mentally as he was in his 20's.  He is currently taking 3 units of blood in transfusion every 3 to 4 weeks. His doctor has said he will keep treating him until my grandfather wants to stop. The thing is, I don't know what the average survival time is for this disease. I know it is terminal - & we believe he has had it for a t least 3 years... with no treatment.  We have a strong family history of cancer, but not in my grandather's ancestors. Apart from the transfusions, he is on no medication, & has never had surgery.  Does anyone know how long he may live, a silly wuestion i know....\n\n",

    "content": "hi there,  i posted in the haematology forum but no one replied and also i was wondering if maybe i could have leukaemia. i have pernicious anemia which was diagnosed this year by a haematologist and have been having my B12 injections. at diagnosis my hb was 11.9 and over the past few months 3 or so it has gone down and so have my white cells. my haem doc thinks that i have something else causing my low counts seperate to the pernicious anemia as that is being treated.  before my B12 injections i had macrocytosis and then they were more normocytic and now despite B12 and folic acid are slightly macrocytic. hb has gone from 10.5 to 8.1 in 2 weeks and white cells have gone down over 4 month period from 3.9 to 2.8 to 1.8 and last test showed 1.4 also am neutropenic with neutrophils at 0.55. my platelets are normal at 230. my liver tests are ok right now but the time before last showed an elevated protein and albumin. im am having another set of bloods next week to see how things are.   my haem doc said that he has topped up the ingredients (B12 and folic acid which was a little bit low, my iron is fine) and that if things are still low or lower then it is probably a problem with my manufacturing of my cells and so in my bone marrow and we will need to do a bone marrow biopsy. i know that from looking on the net that normally leukaemia presents with high white cells and low red and/or platelets but there are some that you can have low white cells. could i possibly have leukaemia? i have read that there are other bone marrow failure syndromes like aplastic anemia and myelodysplastic syndrome, could i have something like this?  my symptoms are really tired and totally exhasuted, cannot walk very far at all, sweating a lot, fevers on and off, nausea and vomiting on and off, i have another infection on my face and went to local doc today and says it is impetigo. im 21 by the way.   also the blood film/smear showed abnormal looking red blood cells and it said that poikilocytosis and elliptocytosis present. the doc has checked me for other autoimmune things like lupus and rhematoid arthritis and those tests were negative.  i feel a little bit scared but not so much but i really want to know what people think and if they have any views on what this could be? i know i see my doc but i wanted to see what an outsiders opinion on the situation might be. what could u expect to find in my bone marrow? thanks so much.  id be really grateful if anyone replied, thanks Kat xxxx\n\n",

    "content": "Hi adelaide, CLL is often discovered unintentionally when labwork is drawn for a regular evaluation. People may sometimes have this illness for quite sometime without even knowing it. Early in the disease symptoms may not be present. When symptoms do present themselves, these may include left sided pain or a feeling of fullness just beneathe the ribs, fever, night sweats, fatigue, weight loss, lymph node enlargement, etc. White blood cells typically become elevated and tend to be very high. There also may be abnormalities with the red blood cells and platelets as well. My questions for you are was he referred to an Oncologist? Were there any other diagnostic studies completed, for example,additional lab studies, bone marrow aspiration, etc.? If he has not been evaluated by a specialist I would strongly suggest that you inquire about an evaluation. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Opinion: The results of October 11, 2005 show neutrophil leukocytosis (abnormal increase of a type of white blood cell) with thrombocytosis (abnormal increase of platelets). This may indicate an infective focus. The skin sores could be a cause of neutrophil leukocytosis - has the aetiology of these sores been determined, such as by culture of skin swabs and biopsy?  The severe night sweats and weight loss - have you been investigated for Tuberculosis (pulmonary and extrapulmonary) and HIV? What is your ESR (Erythrocyte sedimentation rate)?  Have you had a Chest X-ray evaluation and what were the results? What areas were investigated by CT scan and MRI scan apart from the brain scan? We hope this has been somewhat helpful and will watch for an updated post.  My appreciation again to you medicare for your information and guidance, otherwise I would not have had the ability nor knowledge to make this post.  Sincerely,  Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Hairy Cell Leukemia",
    "content": "Several years ago I submitted to a bone marrow biopsy to determine low white cell and platelet counts. I also had a slight enlargement of the spleen. (confirmed by CT scan and ultrasound). No treatments were administered, other than monthly blood tests. Just recently my white cell and platelet counts dropped again, and I again had a bone marrow biopsy. This time a specialty treatment lab at Wake Forest was used, and the preliminiary diagnosis, after the ct-scan was Hairy Cell Leukemia. My spleen is at about 20cm at this time, and my oncologist recommended spleen removal as the first procedure. I did ask if there was any procedure that would/could reduce the spleen size and restore the spleen activity to near normal. The response was, that she was not aware of any. After researching many documents, I found an article in The Leukemia and Lymphoma Society publication on Hairy Cell Leukemia, that states that a successful application of Chemotherapy using Pentastatin and cladribine were very effective in killing hairy cells. This allows the marrow to recover and rebuild the levels of healthy cells, and may also reduce the size of the spleen or become normal. A disclaimer to the article specifies that spleen removal during early treatment is not recommended. The reason for removing my spleen was to biopsy the spleen for further analysis. From my own independent research, I would think that hairy cells could already be determined from the bone marrow analysis after biopsy. I would like to know your opinion on this matter. Thank you\n\n",

I put off having the bone marrow biopsy until several people told me that it would be the \"last piece of the puzzle\" of my low white blood count and neutropenia.  In examining me in preparation for the bone marrow, my hematologist found an enlarged axillary lymph node which she had noticed on a previous exam.

    "content": "Hi taldrich, Your elevated wbc's level may very well be related to your thyroid. For instance, thyroiditis, produces symptoms of aches, fever, fatigue, including an elevation of wbc's,  erythrocyte sedimentation rate, etc. The Endocrinologist will be able to identify if your symptoms are thyroid/endocrine related and if he/she suspects another causative factor, you will certainly be advised an evaluation by a hematologist. I hope you will consider posting a follow-up. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi   I have just a few questions about my bloodwork results that I got last month.  i went to the Dr. because I was having PVC's and I had an ekg and mild pvc's were noted.  However my doctor did some bloodwork just to make sure that I did not have an electrolyte problem or a thyroid problem.  Anyway so when my results came back I was a little shocked.  I had an appointment at 4:30 to see my doctor.  Not knowing that I would have to have bloodwork I was not fasted.  My husband and I ate at a Subshop before I went.  My doctor sent me to the ER to get an EKG that is where they are given in this area since my husband is in the military.  Anyway when I got ny results back there were a few elevations that I would to talk about:  My first elevation was in myprotein.  My protein level was 8.4 with the normal range that they gave on the bloodwork as 8.2.  The next elevation was my globulin.  My globulin level was 4.6 with the normal range that they gave on the bloodowrk as 4.0  My monocytes were elevated my were .6 and they said normal was .2-.3. All the other liver enzymes were within normal ranges.  Then a few things were low.  My SGOT was low..it was 14 and the normal they said was 15-34. My BUn/Creatitine ratio was low my was 11; they said normal was 12-20 something. My BASO was low mine was 0 and they said normal is 1-2 My T3 uptake was low mine was 27 and normal is 30-something  Just trying to figure out if everything is ok.  The rest of my bloodwork was picture perfect but my doctor started scaring my talking about liver cancer etc.  But then when I started crying he said it was probably just a transient reading.  However I have talked to some other people and they consider my bloodowrk normal.  Please help me find some comfort in all of this.  I am twenty five years old and I consider myself to be in perfect health.  I walk 4-5 miles a day and eat right and I am 5'7 and weight 130 pounds.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jeshumate,  Based on what you posted, I'm not sure why your doctor would have mentioned anything about \"liver cancer.\"  You said your \"liver enzymes\" were all elevated.  SGOT is one the liver enzymes (it's actually also found in heart muscle and in large muscles of the body)...if anything, yours was a touch low.......It's when it's elevated that you might want to be concerned...if it's a little low, it's not really of any significance.  Your protein was a touch elevated but certainly not substantially.  I would assume it was up a bit because your Globulin was a bit elevated (globulin is a protein).    When you wrote \"BASO\", I'm assuming you meant \"basophils\" (you'd see this reading in the section with neutrophils, monocytes, lymphocytes, eosinophils)...yours was 0, you say the normal range at your lab is 1-2.  Are you sure?  Most \"ranges\" I've seen (and of course they can vary a touch from lab to lab) show that the normal range starts @ 0...in other words, it's surely not \"abnormal\" to see NO basophils in your blood, not at all.    Globulin (the protein I mentioned above) can be elevated in someone who has chronic inflammation going on in the body....there's lots of non-life threatening conditions a person can have that will cause inflammation in the body.    Your slightly low BUN/Creatinine Ratio (these are both related to kidney function) could be low due to your diet not being very high in protein, being overhydrated.  Did you discuss your concerns about your results with your doctor? - it always  helps to put one's mind at ease if you can share your fears/concerns about test results with your doc...they can really explain things well.    Can I assume that because you're here posting in the Leukemia forum that you have leukemia? (sorry, don't want to assume).  So what were the results of your EKG?\n\n",

    "title": "Low WBC/Neutropenia questions, please help.",
    "content": "Hi,   I have some questions/concerns about recent bloodwork.  First off, let me start by saying I've been going to doctors for a 'stomach' problem since August of 2004.  I have diahhrea more often than I should, pressure in the middle of my chest (NOT stress related), and heartburn and gas alot.  I have lost a considerable amount of weight and am bordering on being underweight for my height.  More recently, I have been having arthritic symptoms.  All my joints (hands, feet, fingers, knees, elbows) have been killing me (not every single day, but at least 2-3 times a week).    I did have a G.I. doc in the fall, but he kept telling me I was stressed out and had I.B.S (without fully exploring to make sure).  I have recently found a good General Physician and she was concerned, so she did a CBC to start.  The only thing that showed abnormal on the results was a WBC of 3.0 and my absolute neutrophils were at 1.4.  She scheduled a follow up with me for another CBC and a couple more tests (RA Factor, IgA, AnA Direct, Sedimentation Rate, and C-Reactive Protein, and a CMP).  She was suspecting Celiac/Sprue at one point.   From those tests, the abnormal results were: WBC  2.9 Absolute Neutrophils 1.4  She referred me to a Hematologist for mild neutropenia. I have a appointment this Wednesday to find out more.    I also would like to mention that I had a CBC in September of 2004 and my WBC was 4.7 and \"absolute granulocytes\" were out of range at 2.1 (it was not labeled as neutrophils on that test).  I saw a new G.I. doc on Tuesday and he sent me for an Endomysial Antibody Titer test to completely rule out Celiac (he says my number on the IgA was suspect -- it was 12).    Even newer symptoms in the last 2-3 days are a 'blood spot' (very small- slightly smaller than a freckle) on my face (below my eye) and a 'canker' inside my cheek/gums.    Any ideas what kind of alien I might have hiding in my body?  Sorry for the very long post.  If you would like to know what the other results of my blood work were, I can tell you.  Anything I should know?  What should I expect from the Hemo doc?  Thanks in advance for your help!  Melisa\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Melisa, I think you are on the right track. The most important thing is to rule out celiac sprue. If the test is positive that will explain many things. I wouldn't expect too much from the hematologist, unless of course there are other abnormalities in your blood picture that you didn't mention. A low total leucocyte count alone can be a temporary thing, can be immune related. Leukemia usually presents with a much clearer picture. Certainly, if you had blood spots from leukemia I would expect a low platelet count as well. Let me know what Endomysial Antibody Titer results show. Best regards,\n\n",

Hi Melisa,  You mentioned that you've lost a lot of weight.....has that been unintentional?  How has your appetite been? (really good despite the weight loss?).  Have you ever had your thyroid checked out?  Someone who's hyperthyroid (overactive thyroid) CAN lose a significant amount of weight (often despite a very voracious appetite), have diarrhea/a definite increase in bowel movements, have joint discomfort.  I would imagine your doc checked this out but it doesn't hurt to ask if he/she did, just for your own peace of mind.\n\n",

The blood counts are abnormal and they would not in my opinion be related to the hypothyroidism or GERD. Have you had any symptoms of fatigue, weight loss, excessive bruising, fever etc.? Was there a particular reason that you were given for the liver sonogram and what were the results?  If you have not been referred to a hematologist to rule out any anomolies besides anemia related to deficiencies of folic acid or iron I would suggest one being done. My apologies for all of the questions but in order to have a clearer picture of what's going on I needed to ask.... Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

It should be noted that hypothyroidism can be associated with macrocytic anemia. This can be due to the association with pernicious anemia or due to folic acid deficiency (decreased absorption). Folate deficiency, when severe can lead to leukopenia and low platelet counts. When was the last time you had your thyroid functions done and what were the results?\n\n",

He kept referring to my family history of pernicious anemia, \"italian\" anemia and folic acid defiencies (my mom and ALL my aunts suffer from all of these).  I am just concerned.  We do not have medical insurance right now,and I truly cannot afford to begin a costly \"search\" for what this might be.  I did have a physical recently, as I believe I said, which showed low wbc/rbc/hgb but normal platelets/rdw/diff/monos/eos/lymphs/ etc etc.  She suggested I take iron tablets, and possibly folic acid and potassium??? and mentioned Vit B12 shots.  I do have hypothryoidism, my last thyroid test showed that my meds were too high (?) and my dose of synthroid was adjusted from .088 to .075mcg.\n\n",

It is broken down into five stages of which the latter stages are equivalents of leukemia. MDS has a rather notorius tendency to resist treatment especially in advanced age when bone marrow transplantation is not possible.   Write down the list of questions you wish to enquire about so you will be prepared for the doctors visit. You can start off with what forms of therapy are available and what benefits do they offer in terms of survival.  Please have a look at this new promising therapy (azacitidine) which was approved last year by the FDA for treatment of MDS.  Click here!\n\n",

    "title": "Concerned about Lymphocyte/WCB count",
    "content": "Hello all, I'm new here   I had some bloodwork done recently (cbc, lytes, kidney, liver, cholesterol, fasting bg, thyroid)....it came back showing I'm a little oversupplemented w/ my thyroid med (synthroid)...TSH too low, Free T4 a little elevated...doc's office called to inform me they'd call in Rx for lower dose Synthroid.  I was surprised because if anything, I've been feeling more tired lately, suspected maybe my dose needed to be upped!  I had clinic fax me my results so I could see for myself (I'm an RN).  What caught my attention was the differential.  My lymphocyte count is right at the high end of the normal range.  Mine is 3.3 (range here is 0.5 to 3.3).  WCB count, although it's normal, is close to the high end of the range, too: mine is 9.9 (range here is 4.0-11.0).    My RBC count great, platelets good too.  Neutrophils good @ 5.6 (normal range here is 2.0 to 9.0). Nothing else in CBC is concerning to me.  I did notice, too....my monocyte count is close to the high end of the normal range.  Mine is 0.8 (range here is 0.0-1.0)  I am concerned about my lymph count.  I have an appt this afternoon to discuss w/ my doc...I'm sure she'll say that as long as it's within the normal range that I have nothing to worry about.  I'm going to ask to see what it's been in the past, to compare..to see if it's slowly been increasing.  My concern is this:  is it on it's way up slowly?  If so, why?  I will ask to have it repeated in 3 months for sure.......but isn't this something we should be keeping an eye on?  I have NO infections of any kind (viral or bacterial).  I've received no live vaccines within the last year or more.  I have not travelled overseas.  I understand lymphocytes can be elevated when the body is trying to fight off a viral or bacterial infection.  No UTI, no bronchitis, no dental infection, no nothing.  I've read, also, that lymphocytes can be elevated w/ lymphocytic leukemia.  Now obviously I wouldn't be concerned about acute L.L......but I guess my concern is about Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia.  Now I understand the Staging for same.....it starts out @ Stage 0 - in which there's elevated lymphocytes but no other involvement/no enlarged lymph nodes..............but maybe I'm slowly on my way there, that is my concern.  I have autoimmune thyroiditis, and wonder if my near-elevated lymphs could somehow be related to that....can people w/ autoimmune diseases have any kind of elevation in lymphs?  I just feel that it wouldn't have taken much for me to be \"over\" the normal range........and because I'm at where I'm at, shouldn't this be closely monitored?    Is it true, too, that you can often see elevated lymphs if a tumor is present somewhere?  If that were the case, my first concern would be breast tumor or lung cancer (I've stupidly smoked for 17 yrs).  2 yrs ago I had 3 lumps biopsied (benign)..I have very lumpy breasts and I always worry that one day, in amongst the benign lumps, there might be something that isn't benign...and it will be overlooked.  I'm nearly 38.  Any thoughts?  My doc will do any testing I ask for...but I'm not even sure what to ask for today......just repeat CBC/diff in 3 months and see where we're at?  I think it would be a little extreme to request a bone marrow biopsy at this stage?  Should I at least ask for a CXR? sputum cytology? (my nagging fear/guilt about smoking for so many years - though I never get bronchitis or URIs).  I have felt more tired the past few months.....but I attributed it initially to my job which is very stressful.  Then I attributed it to maybe being hypothyroid and needing my Synthroid increased....but then when I learned my TSH was so low (0.09 - normal range here is 0.20 to 6.00) and Free T4 slightly elevated (mine: 23.7, normal range here: 8-22)..I figured maybe I was feeling slightly hyper, which can ALSo cause one to feel tired.  Thoughts?  Suggestions?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for taking the time to respond   I saw my doc today, shared my concerns.  I asked for another CBC/diff in 3 months, along with ESR and although she didn't think I needed to worry, she gladly obliged.  I asked her if it was possible that my lymph count was on the high end of normal due to the fact that i have autoimmune thyroiditis - which would seem possible to me, and she said she never thought of it but it did make sense.  She's sending me for a CXR, re: my concerns about having smoked for so many years.  I asked about sputum/cytology and she said that unless I was bothered by a frequent very productive cough, the bit of sputum I might be able to produce wouldn't likely show much (has to be from deeper down in the lungs).    As for the continued breast lumps, I asked for another Mammogram and she agreed.  It's difficult with so many lumps to know for certain that they're all benign.  I realize I'm young and a mammo might not show too much but it's better than nothing.  Thanks a lot for your response...I'll let you know what my ESR and lymph count is come August.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr Abdel-Hadi,  You see, I've gone down this \"lump\" road before.  Back in Sept 2002, I found my first lump...and then a couple more, in my LT breast.  My family doc did an exam and told me it was likely just fibrocystic disease.  I wasn't content with that, I asked for an Ultrasound - that was done...along with a Mammogram.  I was sent to a specialist.  He assured me I had nothing to worry about but I told him that unless he could prove to me completely \"what\" these lumps were, I couldn't just let it rest.  Several months later I got in for biopsies of these 3 lumps...all came back benign.  I guess I just have to accept the fact that I have lumpy breasts.  My only concern is.............with so many lumps, what if a non-benign lump develops.....and I assume it's just benign.  I also can't go running to doctor for every lump I have    I will ask about having an ultrasound done first, though.  Thanks.  I'll keep you posted.\n\n",

Fibrocystic disease is very common...and i guess you've already read tons of papers on it...and you know it's benign and all that stuff...so what we should do ....is forget about it BUT monitor it,ok? I don't want you living in continuous stress... ! just live normally... and put your every 6 months or yearly mammography/ultrasound in your calendar. That's the smartest way to deal with it... at least from my point of view     Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "I don't know if this person still comes here, but if so, I'd wonder if she should have her thyroid checked out.  She did mention originally that her TSH was low (@ 0.35 ..not sure what \"range\" her lab uses)..........a low TSH can mean hyperthyroid (overactive thyroid)....I'd be curious to know what her T3 and T4 were.........whether the doc examined her thyroid gland for any nodules, etc.  Sadly, so many women suffer with undiagnosed thyroid disease......and some of the symptoms she's described (generalized pain, fatigue, hair loss, etc) can be due to hypo OR hyperthyroid...and for those w/ autoimmune thyroiditis, sometimes the state of the thyroid can fluctuate.....from hypo to hyper.    The only proper way to diagnose Autoimmune thyroiditis is getting one's thyroid antibodies checked............because TSH and T4/T3 will not always show \"the big picture.\"  Having Autoimmune thyroiditis myself, and having belonged to a very highly recommended Thyroid Forum online.........I've learned so much about this.  In my case, I had classic textbook symptoms of HYPOthyroidism for 2 years.......but my TSH and T4 were \"normal\".....I did a lot of reading, finally begged/insisted my thyroid antibodies be checked....and sure enough, the ratios were extremely out of whack.......very high.....I was then referred to an endocrinologist, started on synthetic thyroid hormone (Synthroid)...and it's made a world of difference.  You have to SPECIFICALLY ASK to have your thyroid antibodies tested....it's not a \"routine test\" that's done.  What caught my attention in her post was the hair loss......particularly the outer part of her eyebrows.  I'm not trying to diagnose her, of course, but I do know that THAT is common amongst people w/ undiagnosed thyroid disorders.  Also, she did mention she has fibromyalgia (which is believed to be an autoimmune disorder)....from what I've read, people who have had one autoimmune disorder will often have more..........so she should definitely be checked for autoimmune thyroiditis (aka Hashimoto's Thyroiditis), by way of having thyroid antibodies checked, having doc palpate her thyroid gland for nodules, etc.  ALSO.she mentioned her eyelids are puffy..........often people w/ hyperthyroidism/Graves' Disease will have this.  Just my 2 cents.\n\n",

Elevations in globulin levels are seen in disorders such as chronic infections, rheumatoid arthritis, lupus etc., but the Albumin/Globulin ratio is an important indicator of disease states.

Im 29 year old female, my birthday was 2 days ago and It's been awful. I am now convinced that I have some sort of blood cancer like Leukemia. When I first started Prozac 3 years ago I develped all these bruises on my legs, then little pin prick blood dots all over my body, they are so tiny. I stoped prozac for a year and the bruises deminished yet the blood dots stayed. I started taking Prozac again about 3 months ago and again the bruises came. I went to my doctor and she said it was from all the Ibprofen I was taking, she did not order any blood tests. I cut out the Ibprofen and the bruises have calmed down but I always seem to have one somewhere on my legs or arm. Eleven days ago I started feeling this fluttering, twitching sensation under my left bottom rib intowards the stomach, this concerned me after the 5th day and it was still happening. So I pushed and prodded to see if I could feel some swelling and now Im a litte tender there. I made the mistake and read about Enlarged Spleen and it told me that I have Leukemia! Im so freaked out and I cant stop obsessing about this. I get nauseated about once a month and it will last for nearly a week. Doctor says it's nerves but I think its just another sign. I have joint pain in both shoulders have for about 2 years or so. Left shoulder is worse, feels like bone on bone and it always hurts. Doctor said rottery cuff wear but of course I doubt that. Please help me im so scared and I want to stop symptom surfing all of this. I read about Chronic Leukemia and that freaked me out more because the articals I read said you could have it for years without any symptoms so now Im a total mess! I start my new job this sunday and I cant be worried about this stuff. Im seconds away from calling in the ambulace!\n\n",

    "content": "angie23, There are alot of criteria which help diagnose leukemia. One of them is an increase in the total leucocyte count. However, as you mentioned that is not always the case and in some instances the total WBC count is even less than normal. Other criteria used in the initial evaluation of a blood film for leukemia include the type of cells (blast cells) and the pattern of increase in the differentials counts. Indeed some patterns are consistent with infection (as in your case). To ease your worries let me assure you that the diagnosis of leukemia is usually not a problem when attended to by experts in the field.\n\n",

    "content": "The BUN test is a somewhat routine test used primarily to evaluate renal (kidney) function. The test is often performed on patients with many different diseases. Normal Values  are  7 to 20 mg/dl. BUN levels increase with age and also with the amount of protein in your diet. High-protein diets may cause abnormally high BUN levels. Very low-protein diets can cause abnormally low BUN. Lower BUN levels are also seen in infants and small children.   Drugs that impair kidney function may increase BUN levels. Your BUN and creatinine may be monitored if you are on certain drugs.  Your trigl.and HDL have some connection with your life-style and as I can see,travelling can be stressfull and that can raise the values. You should also avoid mineral water if you have higher sodium level because there are all sorts of minerals in it. Sometimes antibiotics,if they are frequently used,can damagge kidney function.\n\n",

    "content": "Okay I'm really dirivng myself crazy. I've got a skin rash on my arm and these little red dots that are now popping up from the skin. The rash is itchy. Also, I donno if it is the dry air, by my nose bleeds easier now, now flowing out, just noticable when I blow it etc.  but my gums have stopped bleeding. Everytime I go to the doctor I am told it's nothing.  I'm feeling pretty okay, just the nose and rash thing is freaking me out. Hydrocortisone doesnt work. I don't have any weight loss or night sweats, but I had swollen, tender glands the other day. Still getting random pains in my left side.  What could this be besides leukemia?\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  I wouldn't jump to any conclusions that the rash is a manifestation of a leukemia.  Many things, most of which are unrelated to a leukemia, can cause a rash.  Usually a leukemia is suspected and/or identified by a review of lab tests and a look at a peripheral blood smear.  I would recommend talking with your doctor about the rash  If it continues to be present, then perhaps an evaluation by a Dermatologist would be helpful.  Sometimes a rash or a skin lesion is biopsied to see what it is, although a biopsy does not help in every case every time.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

I could be worrying over nothing but all my symptoms point to leukemia. I'm worried because I read that tinnitus could be due to anemia caused by leukemia. It seems everything has led me back to leukemia and its starting to scare me.  I've seen a ear, throat doctor for the tinnitus and dizziness, but he couldn't find a problem. The diziness and tinnitus as with the pain in my left come and go. I don't know what to think anymore and I'm tired of going to the doctor.  Also, I had blood drawn for a mono test two weeks ago, would the doctor have done a CBC likely? If so he would have told me if anything looked abnormal I'm guessing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kos85, A test for mono is called a monospot. The blood tests detects the presence of certain antibodies. A CBC isn't evaluated with this test. However, if you have had labwork completed besides the test for mono, then certain abnormalities would have been noted on these, if a blood disorder such as leukemia was a question. Keep in mind as I stated before that there are numerous reasons for petechiae other than leukemia. Vertigo can and does sometimes spontaneously disappear. Bleeding gums can be caused by gingivitis among other things. Although I certainly understand your concern, please don't automatically assume that you have a cancerous disorder before other explainations are provided. Check with your physician, discuss the labs or diagnostic studies that have been completed and ask him or her for an explaination at that time. If no other labs or diagnostic studies have been done then in my opinion the evaluation for any disorder is incomplete. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

She said they are little bleeds under the skin and has told me to have a blood test.  She didn't seem overly concerned and said the blood test isn't urgent and to get it done at my own convenience.  I don't have any other symptoms and the spots (there are only about 5 of them) have faded signficantly, even since yesterday.  I'm a real worrier and started to look things up on the internet - now I am really worried I have leukemia (chronic, since no other symptoms).  Please tell me, is this likely?  I am having the blood test done on Thursday.  Thanks for your help, Cat\n\n",

    "content": "Hi cmh26, Petechiae or ecchymotic areas can be caused from leukemia but keep in mind there are other causes as well. Chronic forms of leukemia, generally speaking, usually affect people during \"middle age\" There are other symptoms that may accompany the bruising, such as fever, fatigue, night sweats, etc. Upon a physical exam an enlarged spleen may also be noted.Other conditions that cause this type of bruising are certain medications, (aspirin, blood thinners), allergic reactions, autoimmune disorders (thyroid dysfunction, rhematoid arthritis, etc.) among other things. It is wise to have labwork done but considering that you have no additional symptoms my first impression probably would not be leukemia. I hope this was somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Besides the obvious side effects you must weigh out the benefits of each type of therapy. Let me start by telling you that CML like any other cancer requires tough therapy. However, unlike many other types of cancer it is curable, especially in young patients.  All the options you have mentioned have side effects. However, they all have varying success rates and some are more promising than others. Like most cancer therapy, treatment is still experimental and so many questions remain unanswered.  We really don't know which option would be best for your case. We do however, know some very useful facts. In terms of benefits:  First as outlined in the article, CML is caused by a gene translocation which leads to an abnormal protein production (tyrosine kinase) which leads to the manifestations of this disease. The gene translocation is called Philadelphia chromosome and can be detected easily by sampling blood or bone marrow.  The only consistently successful curative treatment of CML for more than half of eligible patients has been allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation. Long-term data beyond 10 years of therapy are available and most long-term survivors show no evidence of the BCR/ABL translocation by any available test. However, many patients are not eligible for this approach because of age, comorbid conditions, or lack of a suitable donor. In addition, there is substantial morbidity and mortality from allogeneic bone marrow or stem cell transplantation; a 15% to 30% treatment-related mortality can be expected, depending on whether the donor is related and on the presence of mismatched antigens.   Long-term data are also available for patients treated with interferon alfa (immunotherapy). Approximately 10% to 20% of these patients have a complete cytogenetic response with no evidence of BCR/ABL translocation by any available test and the majority of these patients are disease-free beyond 10 years. Maintenance of therapy with interferon is required, however, and some patients experience side effects that preclude continued treatment.   Gleevec (Imatinib mesylate), a specific inhibitor of the BCR/ABL tyrosine kinase, produces a complete cytogenetic response in more than 60% of previously untreated patients with very few side effects. No long-term data exist as yet in regards to the durability of this response, and there is no information about the efficacy of salvage strategies using interferon alfa or allogeneic stem cell transplantation after failure of Gleevec. In addition, almost all completely responding patients still show detectable evidence of the BCR/ABL translocation by some tests. The clinical implication of this finding is unknown.  As can be seen most therapeutic options are toxic but the good news is that there is hope for complete cure from this disease.\n\n",

As with all new drugs and especially ones like Vidaza which are given \"fast-track\" status by the FDA, experience with it is limited.   The safety and effectiveness of Vidaza, in the treatment of all subtypes of myelodysplastic syndrome, were established in studies involving a total of 268 patients. About 15% of patients in the three trials had complete or partial responses to Vidaza. Responses consisted of complete or partial normalization of blood in the bone marrow and normal levels of blood cells. In responders the need for blood transfusions was eliminated.   The most common side effects reported in clinical trials included nausea, anemia, low platelets in blood, diarrhea, fatigue, irritation at the injection site, and constipation.   More info can be found on our Vidaza page.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I recently was a a doctors visit for a check-up on new GERD medication.  When the doctor left the room I looked at my chart and saw that on my last blood test(April) I had elevated WBC, they were 11.8. Everything else was normal.  I left without asking any questions.  After about 3 days of researching on the net the only thing I found was infection or leukemia?  So I called the office and the nurse told me it was no big deal and not to worry about it.  She asked me if I had been sick before the bloodwork and I told her a week before I had the yearly stomach flu.  She said that was the cause and the doctor also told her there was no reason for the test to be re-done.  I still couldn;t accept this.  I have an appointment with him tuesday and plan to ask him more.  It seems like ever since I started reviewing leukemia on the boards I am talking myself into its symptoms.  My question is do I accpet this and not get another test done or get rechecked.  Also I'm in a health program at school, we checked our cbc's in march and mine was normal.  PS.  I'm a major hypochondriac  :)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jen,  i think your doctor is correct. A white count of 11.8 is usually no big thing. i am not sure about the normal range that the lab where you had your cbc checked but in most of the labs 11 is the cutoff and as you see 0.8 higher the normal is not really a big deal.  If you are a major hypochondriac, i don't think that you will take no for an answer and i know that you are going to keep thinking that there is something wrong untill you get an answer back. So, ask your doctor to repeat just your white cell count and no need for the whole cbc just to make sure that everything is ok. i am not sure why you had a cbc done in the first place if it was normal a month before this one was checked?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

However, there are treatments that can try to tackle it.  Is your CML Philadelphia chromosome or BCR/ABL positive.  If so, then one can consider using a chemotherapy pill called Gleevec (also called imatinib).  This is not curative, but can control the CML so other treatments can be applied.  One would also consider chemotherayp that is used for acute leukemias.  Also, depending upon your age and overall medical health, one can consider various bone marrow or blood stem cell transplantations.  My best to you!  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

Normally after any transplant operation immunosuppressive drugs are given to avoid graft versus host reaction (GVHR).After BMT there is evidence of GVHR towards skin,GIT and Lungs.              My question is \"Do we use immunosuppressive drugs to avoid these unwanted graft versus host reactions after BMT?\" and if we do then again we are imapairing patient's immunity by suppressing the formation of normal lymphocytes.Then whats the use of performing BMT?

    "content": "Sehar,  Thanks for posting your questions to The Doctor's Lounge.  Althouhg I am a Hematologist and Oncologist, I am not a bone marrow transplant specialist.  In the cases of lymphomas leukemias and multiple myeloma, the purpose of the bone marrow transplant is to replace the bone marrow after high doses of chemotherapy are given.  Without the transplant of bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, the bone marrow will be destroyed irreversibly by the high doses of chemotherapy.  In the cases of a transplant where the donor stem cells are from the patient (autologous) or from an identical twin, there is no graft versus host disease (GVHD) since the donated cells  recognize the patient's bodys as not being foreign.  That is not the case when the donated stem cells are from some one (allogeneic transplant).  In that case, therean be GVHD.  Immunosuppressive drugs are used to try to quiet down or minimize the GVHD, which can cause serious problems and can cause the death of a patient.  There is an impairment of the patient's immune system from the immunosuppressive drugs, but there are also impairments of the immune system due to the fact that the bone marrow system needs to reconstitute itself after the transplant.  The immunosuppressive drugs do not necessarily impair the bone marrow function.  Still, patients are at risk for various infections or lymphomas after the transplant due to impairments of the immune system.  This is how to view things in simple terms.  Of course, it is much more complicated than that.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your post to the Oncology Board here at The Doctor's Lounge.  Could you provide may details about the lab tests, medical condition of the patient, and leukemia testing?  If the patient can tolerate it, then I would offer all-trans retinoic acid with standard unduction chemotherapy (given the age <50 years, I would use idarubicin and cytarabine).  However, if the liver tests are too elevated, then be careful with the chemotherapy dosing.  On the othe rhand, if the liver tests are elevated due to the AML, then I would try to give the full standard doses so as to rapidly control the AML.  I would be careful for the development of retinoic acid syndrome and if it develops, aggressive treatment with steroids and supportive care works (a temporary hold on the ATRA is required until the syndrome clears).  DIC complicates the situation and increases the risks, especially since the patient is already at high risk for tumor lysis syndrome.  Aggressive fluid hydration (if the phosphorus is not too high, then I would add bicarbonate to the fluid since it decreases the urinary precipitation of uric acid, but it can also increase the precipitation of phosphorus if the phosphorus level is very high to start), furosemide diuresis, allopurinol (oral or intravenous), and careful monitoring of lab tests.  Aggressive support of the DIC is necessary.  Sometimes, heparin is neededin these cases.  I have at times begun with just ATRA and if the situation improves, then added in chemotherapy.  If the patient gets a response from the treatment, then consideration of bone marrow transplantation if there are high risk factors for relapse or offering of such transplantation at first relapse.  Does the patient have any siblings?\n\n",

Death due to treatment does occur and many times cannot be avoided.  AML M3 is commonly associated with DIC and DIC can cause terrible venous and arterial clotting problems if it does not cause terrible bleeding problems.  The leukemia may have damaged the liver causing the hepatopathy and the renal function may have been compromised as part of a hepatorenal syndrome (this has a high mortality).  The DIC may have caused hepatic clots or a Budd-Chiari syndrome which caused the hepatopathy.  Unfortunatley, the DIC put the patient at a high risk of death with or without treatment.  Chemotherapy and ATRA are the drugs of standard use.  I would not assign any blame.\n\n",

My GP sent me to Infectious Disease and they said nothing to worry about.  My immunoglobulins were also tested with slightly low IgM and slightly high IgD.

The differential count of the white blood cells has two ways of reporting: 1>0 percentages and 2.) absolute numbers.  The percentages are accuarate, but must be interpreted in relative terms to each other.  That is, there can be a decrease in the neutrophils and although the percentage will list a \"high\" number of lymphocytes, the absolute lymphocyte count can be O.K.  The lymphocytes look to be larger in their percentage of the overall white blood cell count due to a relative decrease in the neutrophils.  So, there is more to reading the lab tests of a blood count than just the numbers.  In your case, chances are good that no problem exists.,  However, I agree with SMahmoud that a consult by a Hematologist is indicated to review the situation and to review the peripheral blood smear (something a computer cannot do when it generates the lab results).\n\n",

I figured since its been five years i doubt it could be leukemia but I was wondering if I should even ask my doctor next time I go for a check up?\n\n",

    "content": "Andy,  An elevated white blood cell count can be present for many reasons, most of which are not due to a leukemia.  Although one thinks of various types of leukemias (usually an acute leukemia makes itself known in a very rapid peroid of time) in a differential diagnosis list of an elevtaed white blood cell count, these cells can be elevated due to other non-malignant processes.  These cells are \"designed\" to increase in number when something in the body occurs, not just an infection.  I would recommend that if your white blood cell count is still elevated, if your are still having symptoms, and if things are not improving on their own, then I would ask your doctor to run through a comprehensive evaluation.  This may include your seeing a Hematologist (blood specialist).\n\n",

I wish to ask you however, how is your patient doing as regards his aplastic anemia? is he cured? what are the latest counts? what therapy does he / she take for that condition at the moment? The reason i ask is you said you are subjecting him to invasive procedures normally not possible unless the patient is in remission with a normal count. Again if this is the condition this would make the link between aplastic anemia and anything he complains of now (low pain tolerance) even more remote. Remember that appreciation of pain is extremely variable and that psycholocal issues play an important role.\n\n",

The lack of input from the Patient's Physician is something that I know we should have addressed but we rely heavily on the patient updating their history with us under normal circumstances####so we are at fault some here....  My submission here was to get some input because I have suspicisions about the accuracy and truthfulness of the pain perceived by this patient, plus I did not want us to be overmedicating this patient with something that may exacerbate her condition...  I believe the patient may have become addicted to Vicodin with the quantity she has requested over the past 6 months or may be doing something illegal with the pills that she gets and this is one reason when I am on call or my Partner is not in the office that I refuse to prescribe it for her....  Her requests have pretty much coincided with Tx by my Partner so here in lies the problem of determining/deciphering the post-op complaints by the patient......We have been able to catch many patients that abuse this drug, but as many of you may know, they can be very deceiving and manipulating...  Again, I really do appreciate your feedback because before coming to this Forum, I researched my texts and did a 3 hour web search trying to find related info to my post here with no luck.....Again thanks....\n\n",

It is not unusuall for various treatments directed at any one of these blood disorders to not work or to work partially.  The goal is not to correct fully the blood counts, but to improve them enough so that significant problems do not arise.  What specific treatments have you undergone?  For any of these diseases, if various treatments are not working, then transfusions are given to support the blood cells, as well as growth factor medicines (erythropoietin and filgastrim are examples to support the red blood cells and the white blood cells, respectively).\n\n",

    "title": "Bone marrow hypoplasia",
    "content": "Dear Doctor:  I'm not sure I'm posting on the right board, but I'm seeking a second opinion.  Seven years ago I was diagnosed with moderate bone marrow hypoplasia at a time when I was dieting overzealously.  My WBC count was 3.0 at that time, and my platelet count was 106,000.  My red count was normal then.  Because the pathologist noted focal serous fat atrophy along with moderate marrow hypoplasia, it was suggested the cause was nutritional, and I was told to take a vitamin and put on a few pounds, which I did.  My white count returned to normal, but my platelet count remained around 125,000.   My B12 and folic acid levels were tested then and were normal.  I have not seen a hematologist since then, but my internist has been monitoring my counts now for seven years; the last CBC showed the following:  WBC 5.8, RBC 3.72, MCV 101, plt 130,000.  My counts have fluctuated a little.  Last year at one point, everything was normal.  This past year, however, is the first time the red count has been affected.  I was tested again for folic acid, RBC folate, and B12, and all were normal.  My reticulocyte count was 1.1%.  I've done some research over the years in an attempt to determine the cause.  I discovered that marrow hypoplasia is common in anorexia nervosa but corrects itself upon refeeding.  (Please note:  I was not diagnosed anorexic.  At 5'4\", I weighed 100 lbs and still had regular periods.  I currently weigh 120 lbs).  Can you share with me the possible causes for my situation?  No one has mentioned aplastic anemia to me, but is it possible I have a mild form of this disease?  Could the dieting have caused irreparable damage?  Do you recommend I see a hematologist again, or is it reasonable to just say that we don't know the cause and since my counts are not severely decreased, why worry?   Thank you for your time, Doctor.  Your response is truly appreciated!  Autumn\n\n",

    "content": "Autumn,  The blood numbers that you report are fortunately not rock bottom low.  However, I would recommend your being re-evaluated by a Hematologist.  I cannot say if another bone marrow biopsy will be performed, but consideration of such is reasonable.  I would expect a Hematologist to carefully review your prior and current blood numbers, perhaps do some detailed blood testing of the B12 and folate pathways in your body (i.e.- tests beyond just a simple serum B12 and folate), review a peripheral blood smear, detail any medications or health supplements that you may be taking to discern if they may be causing a problem, and, if another bone marrow biopsy is done, perform cytogenetic and flow cytometry analyses.  If consideration of aplastic anemia, then certain tests can be done. One can also check to make certain that the problem does not lie in your bone marrow, but rather elsewhere in the body.  That is, is your body destroying or hemolysing the blood.  Are there any antibodies being produced that are causing your blood cells to be low in the blood instead of in the bone marrow?  I am limited in recommending any specific tests to you since I am not privy to your medical history, test results, look at the prior bone marrow and blood smears, and an examination of you.  Nevertheless, it is always best to obtain a repeat Hematology evaluation.  Hopefully nothing of concern will be found.  My best to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Erratic counts",
    "content": "Dear Doctor:  It's me, Autumn, again. Thank you for your kind reply to my last post. I have since made an appointment with a hematologist, and I will be seeing him in a week. However, my internist also ran some additional tests, and I'm a bit confused about the results. I was hoping you might be able to reassure me.   My serum iron was 154 (slightly high by the lab's range), ferritin 28, TIBC 321, iron saturation 48%. WBC count was 3.8, RBC 4.17, hg 14.2, MCV 100, platelets 121,000. Reticulocyte count was 0.7%. Comparing these results to those I noted in my last post, the WBC went from 5.8 to 3.8, RBC from 3.72 to 4.17, and platelets from 130,000 to 121,000 in about 1-1/2 months' time. I'm puzzled, first of all, by the erratic results. My counts seem to be \"all over the place\" within a mildly decreased range. How might that be possible in light of a history of marrow hypoplasia? Also why would the serum iron be slightly high while the serum ferritin is on the low end? Does this suggest iron deficiency??? Could iron deficiency cause a drop in the white cell and platelet counts too? I (rather unfortunately) read a little on PNH, and I'm a little afraid that might be what's going on. With my limited medical knowledge, it seems that intermittent hemolysis might indeed cause an erratic picture, but how could the red cell count rise when the reticulocyte count wasn't elevated? Did we just miss it? The white count dropping now when it has always been normal is also a concern to me. I know I'm throwing a lot of questions out here and the data is insufficient to give any definitive answers, but can you give me your impression on the ups and downs and on the iron status and share your thoughts with me on the possibility of PNH?   Thanks, Dr. Gordon, for giving me a little of your time. You've been really helpful to me!   Autumn\n\n",

    "content": "Autumn,  First, it is O.K. to have the results of various lab tests return back with different numbers, as long as the numbers are within the defined reference or normal range.  The proteins, hormones, and blood cells in the body are not static, but rather produced continuously throughout the day at varying levels of production.  In addition, blood cells have a defined lifespan and are thus affected not just by the levels of production, but by the degree of their removal from the blood (and the body).  The change in the platelet count is minor and I do not put much significance into it.  Rather, I would look at the platelet count and the other blood cell counts in the view of their absolute number.  That is, are they low, high or in normal range.  Your iron numbers are not bad.  The ferritin at that level can be normal and does not in and of itself imply iron deficiency.  It is good that you will be seeing a Hematologist.  I am a Hematologist and my approach to your case would be as follows: 1.) look through all available lab tests, both prior and recent, to see what the trend in the numbers has been; 2.) look at the differential count of the various white blood cells to see if any clues are present as to what is going on; 3.) obtain a careful medical, family, medication, and alcohol history; 4.) check on the status of the bone marrow production of these cells (this is done via a bone marrow biopsy); 5.) consider issues that are affecting the blood not in the bone marrow, but elsewhere in the body (any immune-mediated processes or increased spleen function causing the early removal of the blood cells).  PNH (paroxysmal nocturnal hemoglobinuria) is one of several causes of bone marrow hypoplasia.  Bone marrow hypoplasia can only be diagnosed based upon the results of a bone marrow biopsy.  Other causes of such hypoplasia, include medication effects, nutritional problems, low iron, low vitamin B12, low folate, myelodysplasia, aplastic anemia, and the effects of various infectious agents (such as viruses).  This list is not fully inclusive, but touches upon some of the more commonly seen etiologies of bone marrow hyoplasia.  PNH can be tested via specific tests.  Before jumping to any conclusions, some blood numbers can fluctuate low or high, then after a period of time, \"normalize\", without the cause ever being identified and no apparent \"harm\" being seen.  Some people run slightly low or high blood numbers.  The \"normal\" range does not define 100% of the population, but usually is a bell-shaped curve that defines 95% of the population, with a small percentage of people being below or above the defined range.  However, if the test results are too low or too high, then an investigation is always warranted.  One last point: different ethnic backgrounds can have their own \"normal\" ranges.  For example, African-Americans can have white blood cell counts slightly lower than Caucasians, which is normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear chief, sorry for your wife. From your email I understood that she has refractory anaemia and I wonder why chemotherapy was recommended. Are there blast cells in her bone marrow or in the peripheral blood? First of all you have to know that the standard of care in myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is generally accepted to be supportive care.  Although, there is marked heterogeneity in MDS, an indolent course is generally seen in patients with RA (refractory anaemia) or RARS (refractory anaemia with ringed sideroblast). Basically they should be carefully observed if they develop significant cytopenias (including anemia, neutopenia, and thrombocytopenia)and complications (repeated infections, bleeding etc).  Patients with anemia may be transfused with packed red cells when symptoms (easy fatigability, dizziness, headache, blurring of vision etc) develop like I think the case with your wife. For those who started transfusion at young age iron chelating agents should be considered which is found also to decrease the transfusion frequency. If the frequency of transfusions increases (e.g., more than 1 to 2 per month), trials of high doses of vitamins e.g., B(6)) or androgens could benefit. Erythropoietin has improved anemia and reduced transfusion requirements in up to 25% of  patients.   Immunomodulatory therapy with corticosteroids, cyclosporin A, and ATG may benefit 30% to 50% of selected patients who has hypoplastic marrow (  immunosuppression is thought to be pathophysiology). Differentiating agents  including vitamin D, vitamin A, retinoids were associated with low response rate.  Cytarabine (chemotheraputic agent) in MDS showed response rates of 10% to 15% with no survival benefit. For stem cell transplantation (STC) most of the studies have shown that SCT may benefit high-risk MDS patients refractory anemia with eccess blasts and refracory anemia with eccess blasts in transformation) ( RAEB and RAEBT) which is not in our case as far as Iunderstood from your email.  Novel agents and strategies like monoclonal antibodies modulators for apoptosis etc are under investaigations and almost all are applied to high risk ppatients. Best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Glavanj, i am sorry for your father. These are general informations about MDS and this particular subtype (RAS) .  (MDS) are a group of disorders characterized by 1 or more peripheral blood cytopenias secondary to bone marrow dysfunction. It occurs predominantly in older patients (usually >60 years of age). The syndrome may arise de novo, or secondarily after treatment with chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy for other diseases. Secondary myelodysplasia usually has a poorer prognosis than does de novo myelodysplasia. Treatment consists largely of supportive care. Judicious use of platelet and blood transfusions may prevent or delay alloimmunization and iron overload. The MDS transform to acute myeloid leukemia (AML) in about 30% of patients after various intervals from diagnosis, and at variable rates.The acute leukemic transformation is much less responsive to chemotherapy than is de novo AML. Prognosis is directly related to the number of bone marrow blast cells and to the degree of peripheral blood cytopenias. The myelodysplastic syndromes have been classified into 5 types according to the French-American-British classification.The types have different degrees of disordered hematopoiesis, frequencies of transformation to acute leukemia, and prognoses. For  refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RAS) the bone marrow appear normal, but  megaloblastoid erythroid hyperplasia is present and at least 15% of marrow red cell precursors are ringed sideroblasts. Dysplasia is usually minimal so netropenia and thrombocytopenis are uncommon. Macrocytic anemia with reticulocytopenia is present in the blood. This group of patients represents 2 to 5% of MDS patients.The mainstay of treatment is supportive care , mainly regular blood transfusion for the anemia. The use of hormon therapy is of little benefit. However, danazol has been reported to be of some benefit in improving anemia and reducing transfusion requirements in some patients.Responses to erythropitin alone were unlikely in patients with RAS however, improved response with the addition of low doses of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (0.5-1.0 micrograms per kilogram per day) has been shown in a meta analysis in 205 patients with MDS from 17 studies.Response rates to the combination was 46% for patients with refractory anemia with ringed sideroblasts (RAS).Therapy with cytotoxic agents has occasionally been beneficial, however results are usually disappointing, and responses are often brief when achieved. Autologous bone marrow or peripheral blood progenitor cell transplantation is under clinical evaluation for subsets of patients who achieve remission following cytotoxic remission induction therapy. Transformation to acute leukemia is rare, and median survival varies from 2 to 5 years in most series.  With my best wishes.\n\n",
