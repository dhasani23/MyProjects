    "content": "I am a 32 year old healthy male. Let night my girlfriend and I were playing with our sex toys. During this time, I used a penis pump for the first time. I used it for about 2 five mintute sets, under light to moderate suction. I experianced no pain or discomfort while using the device, and experianced no problems till this morning. This morning I had sex with my girlfriend, but I could only get partialy erect. Afterwards I noticed, that my penis had shrunk very quickly to about half it's normal size & was somewhat hard. I was concerned at that point about not being able to maintain a full erection, so I tryed unsuccessfuly to do so. After a couple of hours, while I had some minor pain my penis visualy seemed to return to normal. This evening while kissing my girlfriend I did get my erection back, but afterwards it shrunk again to a very small size and is somewhat hard. This is where I am at right now, I am really confused, I made an appointmanet to see a local urologist but they can not see me till Tuesday (that is in 5 days).   Other than the symptoms above, I am experiancing some minor pain/ discomfort. I am worried about tissue damage & cirulation at this point and I am not sure what to do. Is this a medical emergency? Should I go to an emergency room or a hospital? I am begining to get a little scared, and am a little aprehencive about waiting 4 or five days to see a urologist.  Is this a normal or temporay side effect? Any Help would be greatly appreciated, Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The standard recommendation is to seek medical attention if an erection lasts more than four hours.  The reason for this is that excessive pressure on the tissues of the penis can damage these tissues and inhibit them from allowing full erection in the future.  I recommend you see your doctor for further evaluation if you are experiencing problems.  And I'll just repeat the addage again, if a man has an erection for more than four hours, this is considered an emergency and the man should seek immediate medical attention.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "prostate problems at 41",
    "content": "Apologies for the long mail.   41 year old male. Generally healthy. Blood pressure, lipid, sugar normal. Single. Heterosexual. However very limited sexual history, haven't had a partner for ages (wont go there, to keep this brief). No relative that I know of with prostate problems.   At 36 yrs (2005), started feeling that I was taking longer to urinate compared to other men in the urinal. Felt like there was still some urine left in the bladder. As part of full health checkup, did a ultra sound post-void residue test. 35 ml was left. Doctor said not a big deal. After 1 year (37 yrs), did the same ultra sound post void residue. This time residue was 70 ml. Doctor asked me to try alpha blocker Hytrin (Terasozin hydrochloride), I tried for a week and then just ignored it. Doctor also did a uroflowmetry and observed flow was poor. I did not bother much. These happened in a top hospital in India.   In 2007 Aug, I had my GP in the UK do a post void residue test and I had 50 ml residue. My GP said not to worry. Digital rectal exam revealed prostate was normal and not enlarged.   In 2008 Jan, during a visit to India I got sick with a bacterial infection which had nothing to do with this problem. But as part of other routine tests, I suggested they try post void residue test. This time I had 100 ml residue. This was a new urologist and he seemed very concerned. He did a uroflowmetry (poor single digit flow), urodynamic evaluation and concluded that bladder was healthy. He wanted to do a cystoscopy but later said that was not needed and the most likely reason is physiological, probably some sort of dent in the bladder neck that I was probably born with. The digital rectal exam he did also revealed prostate was fine. He said operation was only permanent cure but suggested I try alpha-1a blocker alfusozin hydrochloride. The medicine seemed to improve my flow and post void residue but killed my sex drive. Hard to describe, felt weird. I continued to take it until 2008 April.   In 2008 April, per my UK GP's recomendation, I went to see a private specialist in the UK. He did a post void residue and I had 85 ml left. Digital rectal exam revealed prostate was fine. He also came to the same conclusion (physiological, probably birth defect) and suggested wait and watch. He said I did not have to take the medicine if I did not want to. Myself, I was surprised that the medicine had not improved my post void residue (It did improve after a month of use, but by 3 months of use, it had gone back to old shape). I had not turned 40 yet.  Few months ago, my UK GP asked me to take post void residue test. This time I had 50 ml only. But the prostate had enlarged (42 cm ). He referred me to another specialist in tne UK and I met him couple of days ago. He examined me couple days ago, and I am alarmed with the finding. I had 125 ml residue left. He asked \"Do you have anyone in the family with prostate cancer ?\" I said \"I wasnt aware\". Honestly I don't think anyone of my relatives had, as far as I am aware. He then did the digital exam, and said there is a nodule in my prostate, he doesnt know what it is. My PSA at 0.7 is apparently normal. He also said my right kidney looked fine (he did what looked like ultra-sound in front of me) but in the left kidney there seems to be some stone or something. He has recommended some more tests.   I live alone and worried like hell about what it could be.   Since I had the flow problems and post void problem well before my prostate enlarged, I guess that is not related to the prostate enlargement ? In other words, I have 2 separate problems to deal with now in the same part of the body ? Isnt that too much of a coincidence ? Isnt 41 too early for prostate enlargement ?  I don't want to go thru the operation as it can lead to incontinence and also I wont be able to have children. I feel like I screwed up my whole life and I wish I had focussed my younger years on finding a lover rather than focussing a lot on a job, career etc.   I asked the doc if it had anything to do with my masturbatory habits and he just dismissed it. But I am not so sure. In my twenties and early thirties I masturbated a lot but later it reduced. Nowadays I orgasm hardly once a week, sometimes even once in 2 weeks. But I sort of masturbate almost every day without ejaculating. I heard this could be a problem as it can lead to congestion in the prostate area (blue balls) but the doc dismissed it. I still think I should change this habit. should probably try not to think about sex 5 to 6 days a week, and just have one ejaculation per week. Maybe that could work I don't know.   Would Kegel exercises help me at all ? I have been trying for last 2 months on and off (try to every alternate day, never every day). I try to hold it for 5 seconds and then release and do this 20 times. Thats it.   Diet wise, I have always had lots of strawberries and tomatoes (lycopene), brazil nuts, sunflower seeds etc for zinc, canned alaskan salmon etc. I have a balanced diet but often skip breakfast. Ate red meat very sparingly but totally skipped red meat since I turned 40. Max 10 to 14 units of alcohol per week.   I used to have 2 teaspoons of flax seed oil in 2007 almost daily. I read somewhere that this can cause prostate problems.   I could go on and on, if you are still reading, thanks for listening, but I will stop here and hear your thoughts. Thanks much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: prostate problems at 41",
    "content": "Hi, Post void residual is thee amount of urine left in the urinary bladder following voiding. This must be measured within 15-20 minutes of voiding (remember, that the urine is continuously filling the urinary bladder from the kidneys). Normal post void residual is < 50 ml. But the cut-off level at which one should call it abnormal is variable. Some would take it as 100 ml.   Generally a level more than 150-200 ml on two separate occasions will be considered abnormal by most clinicians.  In your case between 2005 and 2010, the post void residuals in chronological order had been 35,70,50,100,85,and 125 mls.  Although BPH presents around the age of 50 years, the pathological process is believed to start around the age of 30 years.Thereafter, increasing percentages of men become symptomatic.  It is not very clear what congenital anomaly was discovered in your case. Was it perhaps posterior urethral polyps?  Serum PSA values can not be relied upon to make a diagnosis of prostatic cancer. The levels can increase in non-cancerous conditions such as BPH or prostatitis. As yet, there is no well defined specific normal or abnormal PSA level.  It is likely that a prostatic biopsy may be advised and even if it is negative, as you are symptomatic, the abnormality at the bladder neck needs to be addressed. A prostatectomy may also be undertaken at the same sitting. Good luck!\n\n",

I'm 26 years old unmarried male and have been masturbating for last 12/13 years.. my desire for sex/masturbation  was quite moderate up until lately, when suddenly I started feeling very excited, quite regurlarly, to the extent that even if I'm walking down the street and see an attractive female.. I suddenly feel something is secreted from my penis. Earlier I thought I was mistaking Urine as Pre-Cum / Semen but later I confirmed it was something jelly.. best part is at times I don't have control over this sudden discharge.  Condition got worse when I started getting this jelly thing secreted from my penis everytime I pee.. and this generally happens for 2/3 days after I masturbate.  This thing is really taking toll on me and I'm suffering from OCD because of this... that I keep changing clothes, taking shower at odd hours, washing hands all the time.  Please help me, resolve this sudden secretion/discharge and Retrograde Ejaculation.  Please ask me whatever detail you require but help me resolve these issues.    Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, \"Pelvic pain syndromes\" include several conditions that cause pain throughout the pelvis and can also be associated with bowel, bladder and sexual function.  Classification and Definition of Prostatitis: The chronic prostatitis workshop held on December 7- 8, 1995;  National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, approved the following classifications as the NIDDK reference standard for research studies in prostatitis and related pain syndromes.  - Acute bacterial prostatitis is an acute infection of the prostate. - Chronic bacterial prostatitis is a recurrent infection of the prostate. - Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS), where there is no demonstrable infection. This is subdivided into:       a) Inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome, where white cells are found in the semen, expressed prostatic secretions (EPS), or voided bladder urine-3 (VB-3).       b) Non-inflammatory chronic pelvic pain syndrome, where white cells are NOT found in semen, EPS, and VB-3. - Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (AIP), where there are no subjective symptoms but white blood cells are found in prostate secretions or in prostate tissue during an evaluation for other disorders.  Chronic nonbacterial prostatitis/chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS)/pelvic myoneuropathy:  inflammation may or may not be asssociated. Manifests with symptoms such as pain or discomfort in the pelvic area (penis, scrotum, perineum, or thereabouts) lasting for at least 3 months. CPPS is also frequently associated with urinary symptoms, sexual difficulties, and pain while sitting.  Typically antibiotics are not helpful. Mechanism of this pain is not clear. Treatment includes physical and behavioral therapy.  It is possible that your pain may be related to chronic prostatitis, more specifically to CPPS. You need to consult a urologist soon and get investigated. Good luck!\n\n",

It had stopped working 2 days before I that surgery but as I recall it was working normally for a whole week up to my sugery. I haven't seen many doctors about this except for 1 emerncy room vist 1 month after the surgery because my testis were swollen and my scotum was bothering me. I had an ultrasound done on the testies and they cleared me and sent me home. I also saw another urologist because i was having a pinching feeling in my inguial region on the problem side 4 months after my surgery which he ordered and MRI which came back with no remarks. I actually spoke with the radiologist who interpreted my MRI results and he said that the MRI is not the best tool to study my problem and suggested an ultrasound. The urologist refused to order another ultrasound because I already had one report from 4 months so he sent me away I haven't seen another doctor since. I spoke with another retired urologist on the web who said that I could get an extended ultrasound one that's done into the pelvis that studies hernias. I was wondering If you have any Ideas and should go to an internerest or GP for this or should I find another urologist for the referal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is not very clear from your history as to which side the orchidopexy procedure was performed. I presume that it was a left orchidopexy. Firstly, i would urge you to look up the following two links which provide some information related to your query.  http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... ric+reflex http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... ric+reflex  During an orchidopexy also, the spermatic cord often needs to be 'skeletonized' to gain maximum possible length in order to make it possible to bring the testis to the bottom of the scrotum.This implies removal of the cremaster muscle (or,its remnants) and other coverings of the spermatic cord.Therefore, you need not be unduly worried about the absence of the cremasteric reflex. It is of little(if any) consequence. Good luck!\n\n",

When I went to wipe my penis I felt a pain on my right side of my penis. Furthermore I noticed a small amount of brownish blood on my tissue that I had wiped my penis with.  After 5-6 days the pain went away, each day decreasing. At no time did I have blood in my semen or urine. I was pretty worried and just want to know what is going on?

    "title": "Re: Pain After Masterbation, Slight Brown Blood After Wiping",
    "content": "Hi, In this context one must try to understand a couple of often  somewhat confusing terminologies. - isolated hemospermia(is blood in the seminal fluid) and - post ejaculation hematuria(also can be post-coital hematuria), which is bleeding per urethra following ejaculation. This may or may not be associated with hemospermia.  Isolated hemospermia is a more common clinical condition and is often due to infections and inflammations(originating from conditions in the urethra, prostate and seminal vesicles) though in up to 40% of cases, the cause may be indeterminate.  Some of the reported causes of post-ejaculation hematuria are, - Posterior urethral hemangiomas, - large varicosities located at the apex of the prostate, - varicosities in the posterior urethra, - benign prostatic utricular papilloma, - penile fracture with associated urethral injury, - Isolated urethral rupture(rare), - violent massage of the prostate is known to cause hematuria from the prostate and posterior urethra.  Thorough evaluation is necessary in cases of postcoital hematuria as treatable lesions can be identified. Cystourethroscopy following simulation of the circumstances of bleed (masturbation or coitus) may demonstrate the lesion. The other technique that has been used is cystoscopy during pharmacologically induced erection. Some of these causes may be dealt with eminently during cystoscopy (by electrofulguration, or laser coagulation).  After thorough investigations, if there is no identifiable cause, the patients could be reassured that the condition is benign and likely to be self-limiting.  As your symptom appears to be an isolated incident and obviously settling down on its own, all you need to do at present is is just consult your family doctor to exclude any local trauma or lesion. If the problem persists or recurs, then obviously you may need to consult a urologist to be investigated comprehensively. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 27 yo white male, fit, athletic, never had any serious medical issue. A few weeks ago I started noticing a intermittent dull aching in my testicles and the right side of my grion/hip area. While checking around, I found a small pea sized subcutaneous lump/cyst that is hard to the touch in the area where my scrotum meets my perineum. Now that I know it's there, I can feel it when I flex my kegal muscles/ejaculate. My testicular pain is very intermittent, but I'm concerned about this lump.   I know I should probably get it checked out but am unsure if I should go directly to a urologist or if I should see a primary care physician first? (unfortuanately I live in a small town where the only general physicians that are taking new patients are walk in clinics and am concerned about their diagnostic capabilities) What should I expect for diagnostics (biopsy? mri?) I have no insurance, so I'd like to have a general idea of what to ask about when inquiring about cost. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Testicular pain/ lump between scrotum and perineum",
    "content": "Hi, A painful, tender swelling roughly in the midline, located in the general area that you describe, could be a periurethral abscess.  Periurethral abscesses usually develop secondary to the following risk factors: - a past history of gonococcal urethritis, - urethral strictures (post-gonococcal, Post-chlamydial, post-traumatic, post-operative). - urethral calculi.  Primarily, these are due to infections arising in the periurethral glands and spreading outwards. They will be generally be accompanied by local pain, & fever. However, early antibiotic therapy may mask these signs. They commonly arise in the region of the bulbar or penile urethra.  Although, historically, this was associated with Neisseria gonorrhoea infections, later on, Chlamydia trachomatis also was implicated in the aetiology of periurethral abscess. The prevalence of HIV infection as well as other STDs in these patients has also been noted to be high.  Treatment of an early periurethral abscess is by aspiration of pus and antimicrobial therapy(covering both N gonorrhoeae and C trachomatis). Incision and drainage may become necessary in some cases.  The underlying cause (ex; urethral strictures) must be dealt with, once the abscess is cured, to prevent recurrences.  If it is closer to, or at the anal verge, it could be - a peri-anal hematoma (presumably organized) or - a per-anal suppuration (a variety of ano-rectal abscesses), just begining to evolve, or which has turned hard following antibiotic therapy(an antibioma).  An infected sebaceous cyst is also one of the differential diagnoses.  You should have yourself examined by your family doctor who will then be able to refer you to the appropriate specialty. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Excruciating Testicle and lower abdomen pain",
    "content": "I'll get into this and through it as quickly as I can: Today is Monday.  This past saturday night when I laid down to go to bed, my left testicle started hurting a little bit. Like someone had flicked it or maybe I accidentally pinched it or sat on it. But it wasn't a quick pain. It stayed for close to an hour until I was able to go to bed. It wasn't excruciating, maybe a 3 or 4 on a scale of 1-10.   Sunday, absolutely nothing happened. I was completely fine all day.  Today (monday) I get up and go to the bathroom. It's a lot darker than normal, but I think nothing of it. I get ready and go to work. I get there, and have to go to the bathroom again...which is not normal. So I go and barely anything comes out, plus it's a light brown/pink. So I think, bladder infection/UTI. I get some cranberry juice with breakfast for it.  Then I sit down, eat and do some work. After an hour, my left testicle starts hurting again. About as bad as it did on Saturday night, but I can't lay down or position myself in a way that would relieve the pain or not aggitate it. Over the next half hour the pain gets worse and worse and I start sweating badly.   I call my fiancee and the VA clinic to find out what I should do and where I should go. Danville VA clinic; 1.5 hour drive.  I barely make it home to my fiancee because the pain has become so unbearable. She drives and for the next 1.5 hours, I'm in the most excruciating pain I've ever felt in my life. I've done 5 years in the Marine Corps. POW training. Survived a Helicopter crash. Got a circumcision at 22. Got through 2 deployements in Iraq. AND THE SUM OF ALL THAT DOESN'T EVEN COME CLOSE TO WHAT PAIN I FELT. After about an hour of my testicle hurting this badly, my lower abdomen starts to hurt. Then the abdomen pain dwarfs the testicle pain. This goes on for the remainder of the ride.  WHen we're about 10 minutes away from the VA Hospitol, the pain dies down and goes away. I'm left sore and exhausted.  They test my urine and confirm a lot of blood. The doctor tells me he's going to treat it as an infection and gives me antibiotics. If I feel pain again, take some Motrin and make the 1.5 hour trip back to Danville.  I don't do manual labor. I sit at a desk for my job. I haven't done anything stressful lately. What could have caused the Bladder Infection? I've read that it may be a Kidney stone. Why the sudden 3 hour time period of horrendous pain? And then....poof, it's gone? And the biggest question I am dying to know....how do I make sure I don't ever get pain like that again?  Any and all second opinions are welcome. Thank you SO MUCH in advance for any replies.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Pain of a ureteric colic can be vere severe indeed. In fact, acute ureteric colic is one of the most severe and distressing pains experienced in clinical medicine. The pain is usually described as traveling from 'loin to the groin'. It may also be referred to the testicle.  You have not mentioned if an ultrasonography was performed and if any urinary stone had been identified. Was a scrotal ultrasonography performed?. At times, one may pass the offending stone and the colic will cease. In such cases, ultrasound examination may not reveal any stone.   If no stone is detected, one may have to consider other causes of severe scrotal pain such as a torsion of the testicle or torsion of the appendix of the testis (or hydatid of Morgagni ). Testicular torsion typically occurrs in neonates and postpubertal boys but can occur in adults. Sponteneous detorsion is known to occur and may lead to a missed or delayed diagnosis.

    "title": "Re: prostatitis",
    "content": "Hello,Prostatitis can increase the level of PSA to five to seven times normal for up to six weeks before returning to normal.Thus the transient elevations would be due to the infection.Return to normal value of less than 4ng/ml should indicate that it is related to the infection.Here one should remember that PSA levels alone do not determine whether a person has prostatic cancer or not. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the use of the PSA test along with a digital rectal exam (DRE) to help detect prostate cancer in men 50 years of age or older.Together these are important investigations.Age is the commonest risk factor.False-negative test results (also called false negatives) occur when the PSA level is in the normal range even though prostate cancer is actually present. It is highly unlikely that you have any other problem, but your physician after conducting the required physical tests,and other investigations  would be in a better position to advise you accordingly.

Prior to the urine issue, I did notice two differences in my routine functions. 1) I noticed that when I strain to push out stool, some urine would dribble out of my penis. This may be normal, but I never had that happen in 33 years. 2) I noticed a clear, sticky, liquid that would come out of the end of my penis prior to ejaculation. Again, maybe normal, but never noticed before. This only happened twice and I've masturbated several time since with no clear fluid present.   I do get the urge even when I really don't have much urine to void and I do get a short respite from the urge when I do go. I do get some lower back pain in the love handle area, but this may be do to my weightlifting regimen. Also, the urges appeared after a few weeks of consuming creatine powder to supplement my workouts. I also was consuming large quantities of water during that time.   My family practitioner said I may want to see a urologist whom may perform a cytoscapy. Not really thrilled to do that. Anyway, this isn't ruining my life, but I will greatly appreciate your opinion as I move forward. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The prostate gland is a sexual gland in front of the rectum and just below the bladder.This gland has two lobes which sandwich the upper urethra.During puberty the first physiological enlargement occurs,and then in early middle age.During ejaculation prostate contracts which makes up the seminal fluid, along with sperms from the testes. When we age the prostate can get enlarged and cause problems like urgency,hesitancy,dribbling,bladder dysfunction,and possible secondary infection.It would be advisable therefore for you to get a rectal examination as a routine check up and a cystoscopy.BPH ie Benign Prostatic Hypertrophy needs to be ruled out since it can lead to bladder obstruction. Also you need to get tested to rule out a nongonococcal urethritis and a trichomonas urthritis.Amoebic cystitis,tubercular infections,and parasites like schistosomiasis also are rarer causes.

    "content": "Hello;  My question is regarding my penis properties. My penis curves downwards when erect and slightly to the left. Starting at my body it takes an arch up and then slopes downwards. I experience no pain or discomfort during urinating, nor ejaculation.   Another concern is my girth. At the first 2 inches of my penis the girth is 1/3 the girth of my penis in their last 5 inches.  So it begins small and lumps a afterwords. I have no history of any penis problems, however i went to see a doctor but he only examined me at a flaccid state.   Im not sure if the curve is a \"safe\" curve and require professional advice. Moreover is it normal for the girth to be irregular through out the whole penis? What can i do do decrease arching of the penis? and how necessary is it?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Penis shape properties (Deformation)",
    "content": "Hi, It appears that you have a congenital curvature of the penis  without hypospadias.Congenital penile curvature (CPC) is usually due to disproportion of length of the tunica albuginea (fibrous envelope) of the corpora cavernosa. Patients with CPC usually begin to notice deviation of the erect penis when they reach adolescence. The condition is usually mild and causes no symptoms. However, severe penile degrees of deviation during erection can cause difficulties and discomfort during sexual intercourse and psychological trauma necessitating correction.  The curvature of the penis in CPC may be ventral, dorsal or lateral. If the curvature is severe and causing difficulties, then, a variety of surgical procedures are available for correction.  The shape of the penis that you are describing is also most probably congenital. Consult a urologist for a definitive diagnosis. However, kindly go through one of my replies to a somewhat similar query by clicking on the following URL. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 85&t=47805 Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Tenderness/Pain in Testicle",
    "content": "I was doing a self-examination regarding a cyst on my testicle. There was another lump around the cord that a urologist told me a couple years ago was not a problem. I searched for it and compared it to another cyst on the same testicle, finding that the other cyst was harder. After this exam, my testicle was very sore for the rest of the day, and somewhat less sore the following day (it hadn't been this way prior to the self-exam). I had an ultrasound done the next week and the cyst was not considered a problem. However, my testicle continued to be tender in the area around the cord. This Friday will be two weeks since that self-exam and I am still dealing with tenderness, though I will barely notice it for most of a day sometimes unless I touch the testicle a certain way. A couple days ago, I walked around for a good hour and did some very light running. At some point later that day, while I was walking, my testicle began to ache considerably. This subsided when I sat down, though the tenderness was more apparent the rest of the day. Could this be scar tissue from damage from the self-exam causing pain? Or fluid still remaining? Should I see a urologist or let it heal? Sometimes I feel the pain up into my abdomen, but generally it stays in the testicle. Again, there are days where I feel very little tenderness.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tenderness/Pain in Testicle",
    "content": "Hi, Examination of the scrotal contents is something of an art, perfected by clinicians over many years. It is performed in a purposeful, methodical, gentle and expert fashion such that it causes least pain but extracts the maximum information. Performed in an amateurish,  protracted, and clumsy fashion, it is more than likely to cause pain and tenderness.  It is possible that the swelling in the spermatic cord is an hydrocele of the spermatic cord, which usually does not cause any serious concern.The 'cyst' near the testis could be a Morgagni's cyst (The appendix of the testis)- developmentally, a remnant of the m\u00fcllerian duct.   The cause for the pain and tenderness in your case must be ideally assessed by your doctor. If you discontinue your 'self examinations', that in itself is very likely to speed up the recovery.

I believe it is caused by the fact that as a kid I wore underwear to bed, thus restraining my penis and making it point more upwards at the base... (I understand, I should probably confirm this with a doctor, but for now can we assume this is the cause)  I do not really wish to have surgery (unless as a very last resort), but I do wish to corret my curve so that it is at least a little bit straighter and more comfortable to have intercourse. Also the right side of my penis feels slightly harder than my left when erect (basically feels like there is more tension in the right side of my penis). Is there any course of action/exercises/stretching, or otherwise non-surgery related ways for me to straighten my penis. (could ultrasound stimulate tissue healing/regrowth?)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hydrocelectomy 3 months later",
    "content": "Hi, A certain amount of swelling following hydrocelectomy surgery is to be expected. The degree of swelling depends on many variables which include, - the original size of the hydrocele, - the type of surgery performed(eversion vs subtotal excision of the sac), - thickness of the sac, - cause of the hydrocele(filarial vs non-filarial), - size of the testis, - post operative complications(hematoma), etc.  In most instances, this swelling tends to subside over time (variable). It will help to wear a scrotal support and to keep the scrotum elevated while in bed. If your doctor prescribes anti-inflammatory medications (NSAIDs), they may be taken as well. It is always better to follow up with your surgeon in matters such as this. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: penile retraction when urge to urinate",
    "content": "Hi, Some degree of penile retraction or shrinkage during voiding is not unusual even in healthy individuals. Perhaps, the concentration becomes so focused on the act of voiding that a penis that were in an ever so minimally turgid condition, may shrink (attain a more flaccid state).  Both the anti-hypertensive medications that you are taking (metoprolol and amlodepine), are capable of causing erectile dysfunction as an adverse effect.   There is an interesting syndrome which is worth mentioning here in this context. Genital Retraction Syndrome, more commonly known as 'Koro', is a culture-specific syndrome. Koro is defined as the unique conviction that a protruding organ, such as the male genital(penis) or the female breast, is retracting into the body, with an intense anxiety that this might result in death and associated with behaviors aimed at preventing such retraction.   It has been seen to occur in two forms. - the epidemic form, and - the sporadic form.  East Asia is thought to be 'endemic' for this condition. Its roots would probably  be traced to China. Epidemic situations had occurred in the past almost exclusively in East Asia (Singapore, China, and also India). Usually afflicts young males. Lower literacy, younger age and single marital status have been reported to be risk factors. It is a social malady perpetuated and maintained by cultural beliefs that affect the whole community and not just those afflicted by it. Cheng, S. T. (1996) A critical review of Chineses Koro. Culture, Medicine & Psychiatry 20:1 , p. 67.   An increasing number of sporadic cases have been reported, more often in non-Asian cultures, in the context of a wide variety of systemic, neurologic, or psychiatric pathologies. These sporadic cases are referred to as 'Koro-like' and they have been described in patients with anxiety, panic attacks, psychosis, affective disorder, phobia, hypochondriasis,  medications, HIV, and substance abuse, prostatectomies, STDs, infertility, strokes and brain tumors.  Also, as you had fractured your cervical spine in the recent past (2008), You need consult a neurologist for an expert assessment.  Best wishes!\n\n",

Causative factors may be - trauma to the penile shaft or perenium, - intracavernosal injection of vasoactive drugs in the treatment of impotence, - low-flow priapism, - Diabetes mellitus(increases the risk), - following radical prostatectomy(even nerve sparing), - following external beam radiotherapy(ex; carcinoma of prostate),and - parenteral drug abuse (when drugs like cocaine or heroin are injected into the superficial dorsal vein of the penis)  Recently, a new syndrome has been described - the \"hypoactive  corpus cavernosum syndrome\".In this condition, histopathology has shown fragmentation of the collagen and elastic fibers within the corpora as well as degeneration of the smooth muscles. This condition often does not respond to intracavernosal injections and ultimately requires penile implants.  In recent years, there has been growing concern about the risk of penile fibrosis in sports such as equestrian, biking and cycle racing. There is a worry about 'microtrauma' to the corpora cavernosa due to repeated compressions against the pubic bone, resulting in fibrosis of the corpora cavernosa. Further studies are needed at this point to substantiate this connection.  Diffuse  corporeal fibrosis following priapism may make subsequent placement of a penile prosthesis, especially inflatable devices, difficult or even impossible.   The features that you have described are very similar to proximal corporeal fibrosis or circumscribed fibrosis of the septum penis. In this condition, the proximal(the part closer to the body) appears thinned out and firm even in the flaccid condition of the penis. During erections, this part appears thinner in girth compared to the normal distal part. Unlike peyronie's disease,there will be no penile curvature. You have not indicated whether you are a diabetic.  Only your doctor will be able to examine you and come to a definitive diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Pain after ejaculation",
    "content": "Hey. I'm 17 years old I have only ever had sex with my current girlfriend and have been tested for STD's as a result of this problem the tests came back negative.  Everytime I ejaculate whether this be via intercourse or masturbation I experience a sharp burning pain inside the shaft of my penis this pain is eased by me self medicating two ibroprofen tablets straight after ejaculation but that only slightly numbs the pain. Another relief I find is sitting on the toilet for sometimes hourse just urinating little bits and finally sitting still and doing nothing for hours occupying my mind as best I can. But all these have not abolished the pain with any real effectivness.   The pain started about a two years and a few months ago, I was a virgin at the time and had previously had no trouble when masturbating with regards to pain but all of the sudden it started and was horrible. Slowly I realised it was not a one off.  It is annoying to say the least espeically on my girlfriend who feels bad for causing the pain after we have sex and as you can imagine I'm pretty usless during the pain afterwards.   Due to the relief I feel with constant urination I have a feeling it is a problem with my ureatha, I did see my GP a few months back of which she made me an appointment at my local GUM clinic and I have the tests (negative) and when I saw GP again she said that she simply didn't know and that some people just get pains in that way.  I have also tried refraining from ejaculating for two and a half weeks in a hope that it might help which it didn't the pain was just as intense.   I just need to know what's wrong with me and if there is any hope of fixing it, it has turned something that a 17 year old should love into a painful and negative experience. And as you can imagine it would be impractical for me to simply not ejaculate. Thank You.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Renal Lesion/cyst",
    "content": "Hi,  It is indeed a genuine concern that you have expressed as to why a young man such as your son should nave unfortunately developed those 'cysts'.  However, there are certain possibilities that one must exclude in this situation.  One such condition is autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).   Hypertension is a fairly common feature of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD)(occurrs in 60- 70%  of cases. It is often an early presentation, before there are any signs of kidney failure.  There are two major variants of this condition. PKD1and PKD2 disease based on which chromosome is abnormal.PKD1 is more common(85% of  cases).The number of renal cysts may vary from just one or two to innumerable.  Liver cysts occur commonly in people with ADPKD. Seen in approximately 30-40% of people who are < 30 years of age and in 80-90% of people > 60y.   Although ADPKD can lead to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in early childhood, it most frequently occurs in middle age or later.  The other condition to consider is Neurofibromatosis Type1(NF1) which is an autosomal dominant disorder. Renal artery stenosis and  phaeochromocytoma (causing hypertension) may occur in this condition.Renal cysts also occasionally occur.  Renal cell carcinomas may occasionally present as cystic masses.  Ultrasound is fairly good for evaluation of renal cysts.  Currently the standard for further evaluation of renal cysts is abdominal CT with or without contrast. When a cyst is discovered on imaging, the crucial question that arises is whether it is a simple, benign cyst or is it a cancer?   Bosniak's Classification of Cystic Renal Masses into four classes, lends help in this regard.  Cysts of any Bosniak class, if symptomatic, will need a CT and should be seen by a urologist.  If asymptomatic, - Bosniak class 1 cysts(simple cysts): will need only to be observed and CT if symptoms occur. - Bosniak class 2 cysts(probably benign): preferably renal CT every 6-12 months. - Bosniak class 3 cysts(indeterminate): renal CT/MRI/possible surgery. - Bosniak class 4(presumed malignant cyst) : as for class 3.  Although the Bosniak classification is good at classifying category I and IV lesions, there is still a problem in confidently diagnosing the indeterminate cyst.  Thus, uncertainty continues to exist in the identification of the nature of the Bosniak class 3 cysts. Various methods including laparoscopy, CT-guided biopsy, positron emission tomography (PET) as well as others are being tried to solve this problem.  I hope that this information is of use to you.I think it may be worthwhile to exclude the possibility of ADPKD and NF1. This will greatly help in your son's present management and planning future strategies. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so very much for your prompt and very informative reply. Questions:   1)What is an \"intermediate\" cyst?  (not indeterminate) 2)How is the Bosniak tool initiated - must it be requested by the ordering physician or is it automatically used when interpreting the results? 3)Neurofribromatosis is interesting- my father's two brothers each have a child that has been diagnosed w/ it.  How would this best be ruled out? Is there a specialist? 4)A concern has been consistency of care. As a full time college student that was dropped from my health insurance when he turned 24, (just exactly when this all began),and without a job w/ health benefits, his option was to seek care at the community clinic.  It is a very good teaching facility but the wait is months between appointments and there is a different physician/resident each time.   I feel that I should help him by bringing him to another facility like Ochsner and paying out of pocket for another opinion. What would be the best service for re-evaluation? (urology? renal?)  You  have my sincerest appreciation & gratitude, NurseMom\n\n",

    "content": "Hi NurseMom,  \u201cIntermediate\u201d renal cyst is a term is used in two circumstances that I happen to know of\u2026. - as a spelling error (while in fact, referring to \"indeterminate\" cysts), - in relation to the size of a renal cyst (for example; \u201cintermediate renal cysts are suitable for aspiration\u201d and so on\u2026).  To explain what an \u201cindeterminate\u201d (not intermediate) lesion is, you should understand what a class II lesion is, as well  Class II A: benign cyst that might contain a few hairline thin septa. Fine calcifications might be present in the wall or septa. Uniformly high-attenuation lesions of < 3 cm that are sharply marginated and do not show enhancement.  Class IIF: These cysts might contain more hairline thin septa. Minimal enhancement of a hairline thin septum or wall can be seen and there might be minimal thickening of the septa or wall. The cyst might contain calcification that might be nodular and thick but without contrast enhancement. There are no enhancing soft-tissue elements. Totally intrarenal non-enhancing high-attenuation renal lesions of  3 cm are also included in this category. These lesions are generally well marginated.  Class III: These lesions are indeterminate cystic masses that have thickened irregular walls or septa in which enhancement can be seen.  As for the diagnosis of NF, The National Institute of Health (NIH) specific criteria for the diagnosis of NF-1 are generally used.  NF-1 can be diagnosed if any two suggested criteria are present.You may look up the widely available details.  As to what would be the best service for re-evaluation, it is difficult to answer as you have not provided details about your son\u2019s present clinical condition and renal function.

    "content": "First of all thanks for providing this space to ask questions that trouble us.  In  2002 I went to the doctor because of discomfort on my testicles I had veins all over my left testicle and a small half grain of rice sized cyst-like structure inside my scrotum on the right. The doctor said I had a varicocele and the cyst like thing was nothing to worry about.  Now I got another of those cysts. Ever since this started the old cyst has been painfull sometimes and it's always tender to the touch so im aware of it...this is how I found the other new cyst.  The new one is similar to the old one a little bit bigger maybe but very little, and it is also very hard like a rock under the scrotum skin. Now I've tried to find something the fits the description of this but couldn't.  It's not in the testicle itself, it's not on the cords that go to the testicles, its not on the back or on top it's more like where the scrotum begins and the leg ends but inside the scrotum...you have to press your finger into the scrotum to feel it with a circular motion. It feels kind of pointy.  Now I'm very short on cash now and have no insurance so im very worried, could this be a serious thing now that there is another cyst apprearing? What should I do?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lump/Cyst inside scrotum with uknown origin?",
    "content": "Hi, From your rather detailed description, one would tend to assume that the 'cysts'  - are not in the scrotal skin (calcified sebaceous cysts,idiopathic calcinosis cutis of the scortum (ICCS) etc), - are unlikely to be either in the testis or the epididymis & - are most likely to be related to the spermatic cord.  As you have a varicocele,one needs to explore the possibility of these being somehow related to the pampiniform plexus of veins.Thrombosis with or without calcification in varicoceles is frequently mentioned in veterinary medical literature but not so in humans.However, it may be worth investigating along these lines.   If the swellings keep appearing or increase in size or become symptomatic, an excision biopsy may be indicated.This could be done at the time of varicocelectomy (if it is being contemplated) or as a separate procedure.

One twin's penis bends nearly 90 degrees to the left, one nearly 90 degrees to the right. Decades before they developed Peyronie's Disease, our mother (long diseased) told each of the twins that immediately upon delivery the General Physician (also long-diseased) notched each penis, one on the left side, one on the right.

    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms are rather non-specific but, at least warrant investigating for prostatitis +/- seminal vesiculitis.  The National Institute of Health (NIH) classification of  Prostatitis is as follows.  Acute bacterial prostatitis (Category 1) - a potentially serious condition and should treated promptly. Chronic bacterial prostatitis (Category 2) - This is less severe than the acute form and its symptoms are slow to develop. Chronic non-bacterial prostatitis (Category 3) - Also known as chronic pelvic pain syndrome(CPPS)or prostatodynia. Asymptomatic inflammatory prostatitis (Category 4) \u2013 This is a very mild condition and may resolve itself without requiring any treatment.  Nonbacterial prostatitis and chronic pelvic pain syndrome are more common than bacterial prostatitis, and their etiologies are largely unknown. Treatment for nonbacterial forms is primarily symptomatic.  The common symptoms of CPPS include  - mild discomfort to intense pain commonly in the suprapubic area, perineum, and penis but can also occur in the groin, testes, or low back.  - pain or a burning sensation during/after ejaculation(most prominent and bothersome symptom in many patients), - obstructive and irritative voiding symptoms including poor interrupted flow, hesitancy, urgency, and frequency, and - Erectile dysfunction and sexual disturbances (impotence).  Intraprostatic ductal reflux: Reflux of urine and possibly bacteria into the prostatic ducts has been postulated as one of the most important etiologic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of chronic bacterial and nonbacterial prostatic inflammation.  Your practice of suppressing ejaculation to prolong the sexual activity might have led to intraprostatic ductal reflux and predisposed you to develop a CPPS.  Seminal vesiculitis is an important complication of prostatitis. Sometimes they may co-exist.  You must consult a urologist who would in all probability, is likely to investigate you to exclude these two conditions. The tests may include cultures and microscopic examination of the expressed prostatic secretion (EPS) and semen for pathogens. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: grossly hydronephrotic right kidney",
    "content": "Hi, You seem to imply that you have a unilateral severe hydronephrosis (and that the other kidney is mormal). Although in the young adults, urinary stone disease is the most common cause of hydronephrosis, congenital pelviureteric junction obstruction also may present in these individuals.  You indicate that your GFR is 57%. Is it possible that you actually mean  57mL/min/ m2? Or is the percentage based on radioisotope scanning (split renal function)?   Classification of severity of  chronic kidney disease based on the GFR is as follows.     Normal kidney function \u2013 GFR above 90mL/min/1.73m2 and no proteinuria     1) CKD1 \u2013 GFR above 90mL/min/1.73m2 with evidence of kidney damage     2) CKD2 (Mild) \u2013 GFR of 60 to 89 mL/min/1.73m2 with evidence of kidney damage     3) CKD3 (Moderate) \u2013 GFR of 30 to 59 mL/min/1.73m2     4) CKD4 (Severe) \u2013 GFR of 15 to 29 mL/min/1.73m2     5) CKD5 Kidney failure - GFR less than 15 mL/min/1.73m2 Some people add CKD5D  For most patients, a GFR over 60 mL/min/1.73m2 is considered adequate.  The degree of recovery of renal function of the obstructed kidney following  relief of obstruction depends on the severity and duration of obstruction and also the presence of any co-existing infection.  The most important information required for formulating definitive treatment plan in these cases are - the cause of the obstruction and  - the recovery potential of the obstructed kidney.  If the kidney is so badly damaged that no significant function (the commonly used cutoff point would be <10% of the total function) can be salvaged, the best management may be  a simple nephrectomy rather than any lengthy corrective procedure. Thus, in order to make the appropriate management plan, urologists need to know the recovery potential of obstructed kidneys  Many investigational techniques have been used to assess this potential. Commonly used ones include  - ultrasound measurement of renal cortical thickness, - ultrasound measurement of renal parenchymal volume(has limited repeatability and accuracy),  - radioisotope renography (split renal function study), - the use of non-contrast helical computerized tomography(for the measurement of renal parenchymal volume) has demonstrated in some studies, to have a reasonable correlation to the differential creatinine clearance),  - renal volume measurement on magnetic resonance (MR) images by using the voxel-count method, and  - quantitative Analysis of functional renal volume using Gadolinium-enhanced MR Angiography.  In your case, before deciding on removing your hydronephrotic kidney, some of these tests need to be done to find out the recovery potential. Best wishes!  .\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 11, has an underdeveloped brain stem a smaller than normal brain and a lipoma along L3-L7.  A year ago he had no bladder infections at all, went in to the urologist at first to figure out just why I couldn't potty train him, the NP ran some tests didn't tell me what the results were and told me I had to see a urologist.  I saw the pediatric urologist and he suggested to do the Mitrofanoff, he said that we need to empty his bladder on a regular basis (at this point I knew that his bladder was stretched up to his belly button so I already knew there was some kind of problem) anyways we did the surgery last July, went smooth, in the hospital for a few days got the catheters taken out 3 weeks later and was taught how to do the cathing.  Come October I notice a slight problem, all of his shirts are wet in the front, so when I see that they are wet I go and do a cath on him and nothing in there call the urology office and tell them whats going on, the doctor wants to do a revision something must not be connected correctly (the first time it was done robotically), procedure took a little longer than the urologist planned.  Started having problems again in March with it closing up on me at the skin level, went into the urologists office and they tried to open it up and they were unable to so procedure number 3 was scheduled.  Just 4 weeks ago we went in because I was unable to get it open, at first the nurse couldn't do it so she put on some kind of cream for 20 minutes and let the urologist on call try to open it up, they were able to get a size 10 foley in.  Woo hoo!!  That was on a Monday, that Friday night somehow the balloon deflated or my son pulled it out (he has very complex special needs).  Called up the urology nurses and told them what happened and that I couldn't get it in at all so they told me to come in and the original surgeon was in clinic that day.  He took one look at it and said we need to do another revision, I was like are you kidding me?  He said that the scar tissue around it just closed it up.  So he told me we could either completely redo it or do a special kind of suprapubic catheter (all I remember is that it has like a little hatch on it that you open up and stick in a special kind of catheter in there to drain him) downfall to it is it needs to be replaced every 3 months and with the design of the suprapubic and with how much I know my son that would mean he would need to be put under every 3 months.  Oh and in the past year Ryan has been on so many different medications for UTI's he never had them before the surgery and when we would get off of one we would have to go on another.  I'm going down to the University of Minnesota Amplatz Children's clinic tomorrow for a 2nd opinion, and possibly down to the Mayo for a 3rd.  I just want to know what kind of options that I have to treat this.  I know something needs to be done soon because it is effecting his energy levels, he doesn't want to eat all that much.  He already had kidney damage to the left kidney from the fluid built up (that was the test result they didn't tell me until after the surgery).  I just need to know what kind of options there are out there?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your detailed post and i empathize with you and certainly understand your predicament.I wish you had given a bit more detail about the nature of the previous surgeries and the results of the current urodynamic studies.   As you must be aware, the further decisions regarding the type of management will largely depend upon, - the status of the bladder neck, - the present anatomic status of the urinary bladder(original or augmented), - present functional status of the reservoir(urodynamic findings), - status of the pelvic floor, - status of the external anal sphincter,  - associated fecal incontinence(yes/no) and - the options that have been exhausted already.  The central objective in all these treatments is to prevent build up of high pressures within the urinary bladder.Apart from that, the other goals are, - to ensure an adequate reservoir capacity, - to ensure some form of convenient intermittent emptying, and - preventing incontinence of urine.  In patients who have undergone multiple failed procedures, the available surgical options may get exhausted and other types of management may need to be considered.  Recent innovations in this direction include  - Neuromodulation (\u201cconditional modulation\u201d) technique. Based on electrical stimulation of the sacral or peripheral nerve afferents. A good option for those with an overactive bladder (detrusor hyperreflexia). This has not yet been widely adopted clinically due to lack of a practical trigger signal. - intraurethral inserts, such as the \"In-Flow system\". In-Flow insert is suitable for women with areflexic bladders. Good dexterity, and ability to sit on a toilet are prerequisites. Complications include local discomfort and migration of the device into the bladder. - Button cystostomy: affords safe and effective bladder drainage and gives children a less restricted quality of life.This may be inserted by 'open' surgery or by a laparoscopic technique.  I hope that for your child, the surgeons are able to come up with the most suitable, individualized option soon. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "About a month and a half ago, I had unprotected sex with my girlfriend. I noticed that my foreskin had been pushed down over half of my erect penis after we finished (this had never happened before).  A few days later she noticed some itching, and said she might have a yeast infection.  A few days after that, I noticed some itching. I went to the doctor, pulled down my foreskin, and saw white discharge, so he assumed I had a yeast infection.  I was told to apply over-the-counter miconazole cream from the grocery store, and was given keflex pills for an apparent additional bacterial infection.  This didn\u2019t really work however, and I was then given diflucan. This also didn\u2019t work. I went to a urologist who simply recommended that I clean the area better and air it out with a hair drier. He also prescribed me lotrisone to apply twice daily.  The thing is, I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m getting far enough down to apply it. I can only pull my foreskin back about 1 or 2 cm past the head of my penis, as the frenulum restricts it. This confuses me, as I definitely saw my foreskin much much farther past my head on the day that I believe I contracted the yeast infection. What happened with my frenulum when that happened? How did my foreskin get so far back? I believe that the yeast infection is on the penis close to my pelvic bone, the part that I cannot reach. I\u2019m trying to figure out a way to cure this without getting circumcised. Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is quite possible that you had a relatively long \"frenulum preputii penis\"(frenulum) to begin with and perhaps it got injured(traction iniury) during sexual activity and then contracted during healing, to appear relatively short presently. This is the most plausible explanation that i can think of. It is possible that the frenulum was not actually severed(as you would have surely noticed fairly profuse bleeding).   A tiny blood vessel(the frenular artery) passes via the frenulum. This might have thrombosed as a result of the traction injury and caused the contraction in the course of healing. At this stage, it may not be advisable to stretch the frenulum any more as it may result in increasing fibrosis and worsening of the contraction.  I hope you have got a comprehensive STD testing done. The manoeuvre of retraction and application of the topical creme is better done in consultation with your regular doctor who will be able to guide you better.In the future, if the short frenulum should cause difficulties,it may be treated with local steroid applications or by surgery (frenuloplasty).

    "title": "Re: Risk of radiation exposure in diagnostic CT",
    "content": "Hi,  Non-contrast thin section helical CT is currently regarded as the most useful method to diagnose urinary tract calculi.   Ultrasound (US) has many inherent advantages, which include,  - lack of ionizing radiation,  - universal availability, - repeatability,  - non-invasive and  - relatively less expensive.  It is useful in the diagnosis of renal and ureteric calculi. Interpretations are highly \u201coperator dependent\u201d thus, it is prone to inter-observer variations.  The greatest challenge with regard to US is the identification of ureteral calculi, particularly particularly when they are in the middle third of the ureter. This limitation of US is due to its inability to scan retroperitoneum due to overlying air filled bowel loops, and proximity bony structures.Ultrasound also is known to miss very small stones (2-3mm). Ultrasound is reliable in pediatric urolithiasis as well than in adults due to increased amount of bowel gas and smaller stone sizes. Ultrasound also is inferior to CT in differentiating obstructing from non-obstructing stones.  The advantages of non-contrast helical CT include, - less operator-dependency,  - its rapid acquisition times,  - lack of need for iodinated contrast or patient preparation,  - its high sensitivity and specificity for renal, ureteric stones and for ureteral obstruction.  The prominent disadvantage is the radiation that is involved.  In one comparative study for example, following a direct comparison of non-contrast helical CT, ultrasound and intravenous urography (IVU) in the detection of ureteral stones, it was found that CT ranked as the most superior of the three modalities with a sensitivity and specificity of  94% and 97% respectively, with an accuracy of 95%, whereas IVP had a sensitivity and specificity of 52% and 94% respectively and an accuracy of only 66%. Ultrasound ranked third among the three modalities and had a sensitivity and specificity of 19% and 97%, and an accuracy of 45%.  Thus, although  non-contrast helical CT has advantages, gonadal  radiation has remained an inherent risk. Experts believe that further research is needed to optimize CT imaging parameters, while maintaining diagnostic accuracy and minimizing radiation doses.  Your question is if there is any other method of similar accuracy as the non-contrast helical CT.  Presently, generally speaking, CT appears to be more sensitive and specific especially for ureteric stones and in identifying ureteric obstruction.   However, the diagnostic accuracy of ultrasonography could be improved upon by addition of Duplex Doppler ultrasonography. It has been shown that by using duplex doppler, renal obstruction can be identified by  - evaluating the intrarenal hemodynamics for calculation of the \u201cresistive index\u201d, and - evaluation of  the \u201cureteric jet effect\u201d.  In normal kidneys, a  resistive index of 0.62+/-0.03 is considered normal. Resistive index > 0.7 is seen in obstructed kidneys. A low level jet that is asymmetric to the other ureter is considered as evidence of partial obstruction and absence of a jet is evidence for a complete obstruction. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Somewhat tight foreskin",
    "content": "Hi, Some individuals have a narrow prepuceal opening (phimosis).This can be congenital or acquired(pathological).  Among the aquired causes, posthitis(inflammation of the foreskin) with or without balanitis(inflammation of the glans penis) is a common cause and diabetes mellitus is a common risk factor.  The degree of narrowing may be variable. It could be tight enough to make it impossible to retract the foreskin at all and may even result in back pressure changes or precipitate an acute retention of urine. With very minimal degree of phimosis, it may become difficult to retract the foreskin only during penile erections(such as in your case). Forcible retraction may result in cracking of the skin at the prepucial opening. this will heal with circumferential fibrosis, and with repeated episodes, worsening the phimosis over time.   Another condition called as lichen sclerosus (balanitis xerotica obliterans) needs a special mention. This sporadically seen condition usually occurs in middle aged, uncircumcised individuals. Cause is unclear(autoimmunity, Human papilloma virus infection, chronic bacterial infection, atypical mycobacteria are some of the suggested etiological factors).   Begins as hypopigmented, minimally erythematous areas and later, reddish macules or papules apppear which coalese to form whitish or greyish firm plaques. The lichenification is progressive and It can involve the glans and prepuce extensively in severe cases. A fibrotic ring at the prepuceal opening is characteristic. This restricts retraction of the prepuce and may result in a paraphimosis in some cases. Stenosis of the external urethral meatus may occur causing voiding difficulties and back pressure changes. This lesion is a risk factor for squamous cell carcinoma.   In your case, the most likely scenario is one of a very minimal degree of congenital phimosis. However, it is better to consult your doctor to exclude other causes.Stretching \"carefully\" may not always work and may cause unintended trauma as well. Moreover, there is a potential risk of paraphimosis developing during masturbation or sexual intercourse.The permanent, reliable and safe solution is a circumcision. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I thank Dr.Jagesh for his valuable comment. I certainly agree with Dr.Jagesh in that, topical steroids are gaining acceptance as the primary modality of treatment for childhood phimosis. This is certainly true in the pediatric age group wherein most cases are congenital(non-pathologic). Most studies on use of steroid cremes in treatment of phimosis are in small children and older children. The cause of phimosis in adults is in most cases, is balanitis. There have been some studies in adults which have shown benefits as well of topical steroid therapy.Certainly one may try this as a first-line measure after excluding balanitis xerotica obliterans and treating the underlying cause of balanitis. Some 'older' surgeons(like me), still prefer circumcision in adults chiefly due to  - lack of sufficient personal experience with this alternative,and - relative paucity of evidence in the adults.  Certainly, i see no contraindication to trying topical steroid applications as an initial measure in adults if underlying causes are identified and corrected. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Trauma to the testis can be blunt,penetrative or avulsive types.Commonest are sports injuries leading to blunt injury.Absence of scrotal swelling and hematoma indicate generally a mild injury. Mild cases are generally managed conservatively with scrotal support and pain relieving medication. If the pain is out of proportion to the injury a scrotal sonogram is ordered to rule out testicular rupture.Doppler studies are done to study the status of blood vessels.Absence of vascularity could indicate testicular torsion,an emergency. While nothing serious might have happened,still it should be assessed by your physician. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Trauma can cause several complications related to the scrotal contents, including - testicular rupture, - intratesticular hematoma, - testicular infarction, - traumatic hematocele, and - lacerations of tunica albuginea(the outer fibrous envelope of the testes).  Of course,trauma can cause bilateral testicular injury. Bilateral testicular infarction can result in atrophy of the testes.Unilateral testicular atrophy is less of a problem,as the remaining testis(if healthy), can look after adequate spermatogesis as well as endocrine functions.  Testicular trauma, if minor, may only cause transient excruciating pain and nothing more.More severe forces may result in the aforesaid complications.  A scrotal ultrasound examination with color doppler(duplex ultrasonography) is the best way to exclude trauma to the scrotal contents.  To get over the anxiety and speculation, you must show your colleague to a urologist and get investigated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Testis has 2 main functions, - exocrine (spermatogenesis) and - endocrine (hormonal).  Although, it is well known that testicular trauma has the potential to cause testicular infarction and atrophy and thus affect the exocrine and endocrine functions of the testis adversely, the long-term effects of testicular trauma on reproductive function are surprisingly unknown.There is a paucity of studies on long term complications of testicular trauma.  One isolated study concludes thus; \"There was definite evidence of subfertility as assessed by abnormal semen analyses and atrophic testes following testicular trauma. However, the subfertility did not appear to be immune mediated nor did the patients present with infertility. We conclude that early repair can help preserve hormonal function as well as fertility\".

    "content": "Hi, The first condition that needs to be considered is a diabetic autonomic neuropathy affecting the urinary bladder resulting in a number of \"voiding dysfunctions\".  Diabetes mellitus(DM) is the most common cause of urinary dysfunction secondary to peripheral nervous system pathology. Symptoms of bladder dysfunction have been observed in about 3750% of patients, and urodynamic evidence for bladder malfunction has been observed in 4387% of insulindependent diabetics.  The most common abnormalities seen are, impaired detrusor contractility and \"detrusor areflexia\". Detrusor areflexia, results from impaired  sensation of bladder filling. This results in overdistention of the urinary bladder causing an ''overdistention injury\".This disorder is also called \"diabetic cystopathy\".  Patients with bladder hypomotility and high residual urine volumes are at greater risk for urinary tract infections.  On the other hand, some diabetic patients, particularly the elderly, may have uninhibited bladder contractions and \"detrusor hyperreflexia\".   Treatment:  Initial therapy of bladder hypomotility should emphasize on timing voiding schedules to coincide with bladder contractions, enhanced by a Valsalva maneuvers (forced expiration against a closed glottis) and Cred\u00e9 maneuver(where, a patient is taught to apply nonforceful, smooth, even pressure from the umbilicus toward the urinary bladder).   Clean intermittent self-catheterization, is the primary therapy for impaired or absent detrusor muscle activity. The interval between catheterizations should be tailored to maintain a residual volume of less than 100 cc to avoid incontinence. Bacteruria is fairly common and antibiotic therapy is only indicated if symptomatic urinary tract infections develop.   Patients who present with overflow incontinence and an overdistended bladder may regain bladder tone with the temporary use of an indwelling urinary catheter.  Your symptom needs a full urological work-up early in order to avoid worsening of your symptom. Also, your glycemic control needs to be reviewed and optimized. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Five months ago my 36 year old sister went into the emergency room with severe back and side pain.  She had already had both her gall bladder and appendix removed so the doctors ruled that out immediately.  They did several tests and found that her bladder was not emptying properly and was the side of her head.  She spent the night in the hospital and went home the next day with a catheter.  She had the catheter for 3 weeks because they told her that her bladder needed to rest in order to have further tests run to find the underlying issue.  After 3 weeks she went in and they tested to see if her bladder was functioning again- there was no bladder response.  For the next 2 weeks she was told to straight catheterize herself until she could get in for further tests.  Initially they thought it might have something to do with a nerve in her back.  They ruled that out.  Then she had a series of bladder test including a cystoscopy.  Everything came back completely normal.  They ruled out bladder cancer and MS.  Then in an open MRI they found a small canal in her cervical spine that had fluid in it.  They thought that this was the answer and sent her to a neurologist.  He dismissed this immediately saying that it was too small to cause the issue.  She just went back to the urologist today and he wants to try to surgically insert a nerve stimulator to force her bladder function to return.  This seems odd to me to try a treatment when there is no diagnosis of the issue.  At this point she is so frustrated and discouraged that the entire process is taking so long and she still has no answers.  Five months without bladder function and no answer in sight is too long for an otherwise healthy 36 year old woman.  We are looking for someone to help us navigate the health system and get some answers quickly.  Any advise you can provide is greatly appreciated.  We are desperate and need to find hope.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, One differential diagnosis for her condition could be an Acute transverse myelitis (ATM).  ATM is an inflammatory process(myelopathy) of the spinal cord, that can cause axonal demyelination.  The segment of the spinal cord at which the damage occurs determines which parts of the body are affected.Bladder and bowel sphincter control are disturbed in the majority of patients.  The severity of the motor involvement can range from complete paralysis below the level of the lesion to mild weakness which may even go unnoticed.Severe back pain and radicular pain are quite common.Sensory deficits also can be variable.Sensation is usually diminished below the level of spinal cord lesion in the majority of patients. Some experience tingling or numbness in the legs. Pain on pinprick testing and temperature sensation are diminished in the majority of patients.Vibration sense and joint position sense may also be blunted or spared.   In cases of suspected acute transverse myelopathy, acute compressive causes must be urgently excluded first. A magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan is invaluable in this regard. MRI in most cases can reveal the intrinsic spinal cord lesion. Once a compressive cause is excluded, a detailed history and an examination followed by focused investigations are necessary to diagnose the underlying cause.  The three main conditions in the differential diagnosis are idiopathic transverse myelitis, demyelination, including multiple sclerosis (MS), and neuromyelitis optica (NMO). Infections such as herpes simplex virus, herpes zoster and inflammatory disorders such as neurosarcoidosis and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) also need to be considered and excluded.  ATM is by far, a monophasic illness (one-time occurrence). However, in a small number of patients recurrences may ensue, especially in the setting of an underlying precipitating illness.  In your sister's case, there could be a remote possibility of ATM involving the sacral cord and the manifestation tending to be very atypical(the neurological symptoms could have been very minimal and fleeting). Her doctor will be certainly better placed to evaluate her and arrive at a diagnosis. I hope this information happens to be useful. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am not certain as to what you mean by a \"lymphocele\". However, i will provide you with some information on one condition which has been reported to involve the skin and subcutaneous tissue overlying the penile shaft, which is presumed to be a disorder of lymphatics.  'Lymphangiectasias' can be either  - primary (congenital)- called 'lymphangioma circumscriptum', or  - secondary (acquired through trauma or injury to the normal lymphatics).  Benign transient lymphangiectasis of the penis (BTLP): Also sometimes referred to as 'Nonvenereal sclerosing lymphangitisis' an aquired, benign condition presenting in the sexually active man between 20 and 40 years of age. These are localized (usually as linear, cord-like lesions near the coronal sulcus), self-limiting lesions which have been linked in an as yet undetermined way to prior circumcison, which is suspected to increase the risk. Some have postulated injury to the lymphatics during circumcision as one of the possible factors.The pathogenesis is not clear.Trauma(vigorous sexual activity) appears to play a significant part.    This condition usually does not need any specific therapy other than symptomatic measures. Various treatments such as aspiration, intralesional steroids, antibiotics etc have been tried but, their use is questionable. However, STD testing is advisable, as this condition also may be associated with underlying sexually transmitted diseases that necessitates specific therapy. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Right testicle is increasing double in size at night",
    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms are indeed extremely unusual. The common 'differential diagnoses' will probably include, - a right sided inguinal hernia(\"complete\" or \"inguinoscrotal\"), - a \"communicating\" hydrocele (one in which the cavity of the sac communicates with the general peritoneal cavity through a often tiny opening).  In the not so distant past, there used to be a prevalent belief that \"open\" appendicectomy(by causing unintended trauma to the ilioinguinal nerve) predixposes to the development of inguinal hernia on the right side.There is not much evidence for a  cause-and-effect relationship at present (although isolated reports of inguinal hernias appearing after appendicectomy have continued to be reported).Inguinal hernias generally tend to REDUCE in size on lying down.  Same goes for the communicating hydrocele as well. This also is expected to REDUCE in size on lying down. Groin injuries related to sports also do not fit in.  As the \"common\" differential diagnoses have failed to explain your symptoms, we are compelled to look for some rarer conditions and resort to some hypothetical explanations.  a) rare cases of giant urinary bladder diverticuli presenting as contents in a complete inguinal hernia have been reported. (let us assume that the giant diverticulum does not get filled adequately during the course of the day, due to emptying of the urinary bladder at regular intervals and at night times fills adequate enough to appear as a swelling). b) a \"communicating\" hydrocele, with a tiny communication, the opening of which(perhaps, due to the way it is oriented), gets preferentially filled by the peritoneal fluid while lying down. Some \"valve-like\" mechanism may be contributing as well. c) \"pathological\" splenic ruptures have been known to occur in relation to certain kinds of sports (especially while convalescing from infectious mononucleosis ('Mono'). Blood in cases of abdominal trauma (including from a ruptured spleen) has been known to fill a pre-existing patent processus vaginalis sac and present as an acute hydrocele. (Again, for explaining why it would fill only during the nights, we have to resort to the same hypothesis as with communicating hydroceles). Thank you for this very interesting post.I am frankly, at a loss to offer a plausible diagnosis for your symptom. Nonetheless, i hope it happens to be helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Acute Prostatitis 30 years old male",
    "content": "I am 30 years old male with no history of prostatitis or any UT infections. Over many years, my frequency to urinate was every hour or so . It could have been due to the fact that I drink lot of fluids everyday. I normally need go to urinate once at night may be few days a week. I have a history of eating lot of spicy food, moderate caffeine intake from coffee/tea twice a day and eating healthy. I exercise regularly and practice good hygiene. I am not sexually active but I used to masturbate everyday but now I have reduced it to just twice a week.  I was recently diagnosed with Acute Prostatitis. I was having difficulty urinating, burning and  extreme pain while urinating, urgency and very frequent urges to go urinate. The primary physician did the digital rectal exam and said my prostrate was enlarged and tender. He also gave me 1 GM injection of ceftriaxone and prescribed two weeks of ciprofloxacin 500 MG tablets. I took the medicine and it relieved the symptoms but towards the second week my stomach did not handle the medicine that well and I was feeling weak and light headedness. The doctor also did the urine culture test and said my urine had gram negative bacteria ( e.coli). I was negative on CT/GC PCR.  After few days of finishing the cipro, I started having mild lower front abdominal pain (just below the stomach) during the day. I went to see a urologist 6 days after I finished the cipro. He did digital rectal exam and said it was normal this time, but said noticed some blood in the urine sample that was taken just prior seeing him. He also prescribed septra for full four weeks saying that may be bacteria has not been fully gone around prostrate.  He also ordered renal ultrasound.  What could be the cause of lower front abdominal pain? Shall I start four weeks cycle of septra while I prefer not to take antibiotics if it is going to heal slowly? Please post your thoughts. Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Burning in Penis constant feeling of need to urinate",
    "content": "Hi, The incidence of true urinary tract infections (UTI) in adult males < 50 years of age is low, in the absence of anatomical abnormalities of the urinary tract. In this group, the symptoms such as dysuria or urinary frequency are usually due to sexually transmitted disease (STD)\u2013related infections involving the urethra, prostate or the seminal vesicles, as well as other infections.  The symptoms such as fullness in the rectum, pain around the anus or vague pain in the perineum may result from chronic prostatitis.  Chronic prostatitis often coexists with chronic seminal vesiculitis, urethritis or cystitis.  Chronic seminal vesiculitis:  is the most common complication of chronic prostatitis. In the chronic state, the two often coexist.Pain arising form the seminal vesicles may be referred to the tip of the penis.  Therefore, you need to consult your doctor and have yourself examined and tested at the earliest. Bestwishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From the history provided,it is difficult, if not impossible to guess the source of bleeding. Although there are some features of chronic bacterial prostatitis,that by itself does not explain the episodes of hematuria or the large clots that you are mentioning. Such bleeding may originate in any part of the urinary tract. The causes are numerous - tumors, calculi, vascular malformations, infections (UTIs, infections of prostate, seminal vesicles and urethra), trauma etc.  Masturbation by itself is capable causing hematuria in more ways than one.  - excessive masturbation can induce prostatic congestion and lead to hematuria. - violent penile manipulations also can result in hematuria. - introduction of foreign bodies, chemicals etc into the urethra also can precipitate hematuria.   The fact that you are passing large clots in the urine warrants a full urological  evaluation urgently. Best wishes!\n\n",

Post surgery, I left hospital with an indwelling catheter and after two failed trials without catheter, moved over to the intermittent self catheterising.   Although the situation is improving - today I managed 100 ml with 210 residual, I am concerned that I will not become completely  catheter free. Prior to this last surgery, I had mixed incontinence for a spell. I also had a spell where I used a catheter each evening to make sure my bladder was emptied completely. After the insertion of a ring pessary (before the anterior repair), I could urinate fully. Prior to the intussusception surgery, I had to use anal irrigation for several months. That became redundant after the rectopexy.  Interestingly, I still have some urinary incontinence, so am using continence products. I had complete hysterectomy five years ago, and have been using both oestrogen hrt and topical oestregon to help the weak pelvic floor.  Do you have any exprience of this scenario, and can you suggest any treatments? I see my uro-gynaecologist in August.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 21-year-old female, no medications, no past surgeries, diagnosed with interstitial cystitis (doctor no longer thinks I have it though) and pelvic floor dysfunction (doctor thinks I have this instead). Treated with physical therapy in the past year, no change in symptoms.  The issue I am writing about does not seem to be related to the above conditions, and my urologist and general physician have not really been able to answer this question. (Note that though I have been dxed with IC in the past, I urinate less than 8 times/day, do not have IC-like urgency, etc. Basically no IC symptoms. And, my pelvic floor symptoms are mostly pain w/sex and a strange pulling feeling sometimes after urination. This issue seems to be completely separate, please let me know if I should be posting elsewhere.)  I am a deep sleeper and do not often wake up in the middle of the night to urinate. When I wake up in the early morning with a seemingly full bladder/really needing to urinate, in addition to that \u201cfull bladder\u201d sort-of painful feeling of needing to go, I have strong pain throughout my entire midsection and stomach. Strong pain. When I describe it to others, I say it\u2019s the feeling as though something hot and painful has leaked into various parts of my stomach and abdomen, and no one can seem to relate with this feeling. It is usually at least partially relieved with urinating but usually the pain persists in a lesser degree for anywhere from 5 minutes to several hours (for example, as I write this, I\u2019ve had this feeling since 7 a.m. and it\u2019s now almost 10:30 a.m.).  Sometimes the pain is somewhat relieved with gas, but only to a small degree. It eventually goes away but due to the severity of the pain I do not want to just ignore it. I have found that setting an alarm or having my husband wake me up to urinate once in the middle of the night helps \u2013 as when I do not need to urinate very badly in the morning I don\u2019t have this problem. I can remember having this problem for more than a few years, but only now has the pain been this severe.  Please respond with any thoughts or questions. Any responses are much appreciated. Also, I doubt this is helpful, but I recently started taking calcium supplements because my stomach seems to be less tolerant of milk (pain didn\u2019t start or change upon starting the supplement), and also, I will also be posting a question about lupus, as two different doctors have suspected lupus, as my blood tests positive for it and I have some other indicators but not enough to diagnose me with it. And, I have also had a very low white blood cell count in the past, just thought I should note these things. Thank you very much for any comments you can provide!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear gesjad01   Hope you are feeling better .  Its not uncommon for patients with lupus to have bladder problems, or problems during urination. In fact  it is estimated that half patients with lupus have kidney related problems.  You said that your doctor thought it could be lupus. my question is : Did you have any testing done for antibodies to SR protein.  Basically, there is a test that detects antibodies to so-called SR proteins. Antibodies are compounds made to target a particular protein when the body launches an immune attack. And lupus is considered to be an immune disease.  Recent research data found that patients with lupus tend to produce what is called antibodies to SR proteins, which many patients with other diseases are less likely to produce. Some how this test made it easier for doctors to diagnose patients with lupus, since it can be confused with many other diseases..  the other possibility could be that in fact it is due to your IC condition (and painful bladder syndrome).  In recent years, researchers have isolated a substance found almost exclusively in the urine of people with interstitial cystitis. They have named the substance antiproliferative factor, or APF, because it appears to block the normal growth of the cells that line the inside wall of the bladder. Researchers anticipate that learning more about APF will lead to a greater understanding of the causes of IC and to possible treatments.  If that is the case, there are some pharmacological and non pharmacological treatments: these include:  DRUGS: like  Pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron), this drug was approved by the FDA in 1996, and it was the first oral drug developed for IC. During the clinical trials, the drug improved symptoms in 30 percent of patients treated. It is still unclear of how exactly this drug works, but one theory is that  it may repair defects that might have developed in the lining of the bladder.The FDA-recommended oral dosage of Elmiron is 100 mg, three times a day. And it may take few months to relieve the sympoms. Elmiron's side effects are limited primarily to minor gastrointestinal discomfort.  Other drugs used are advil, otc drug to help ease some of the pain.   Additional non pharmacological treatments include transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS). When it comes to special dieting, there is really  no scientific evidence linking diet to IC / PBS, but many doctors and patients find that alcohol, tomatoes, spices, chocolate, caffeinated and citrus beverages, and high-acid foods may contribute to bladder irritation and inflammation. Some patients also note that their symptoms worsen after eating or drinking products containing artificial sweeteners.   Patients may try eliminating various items from their diet and reintroducing them one at a time to determine which, if any, affect their symptoms. However, maintaining a varied, well balanced diet is important.  Finally, some stretching excercises and bladder training might be beneficial in many cases.  Thank you very much, and i wish you all the best. Please let me know how things go with you, and / or if you have additional questions.  take care\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your quick repsonse and for the helpful information. About the lupus testing, my doctor said I had a positive ANA, and that, combined with my various bone/joint/etc pains led to wondering if it might be lupus, but he said I didn't have enough other indicators for a diagnosis.  About the IC, I have so few IC symptoms that my urologist no longer thinks it is IC. He thinks it is just a pelvic floor muscle problem, so I'm concerned that if the symptom described above is not due to lupus (which I really hope that it is not), and not due to IC, then what else it could be. No one seems to be able to relate to this stomach/all throughout abdomen pain that I feel in the morning, not even others with IC that I communicate with on an IC message board. Please let me know if there are any other issues you think this symptom might point to, and whether you think that it is something I should be concerned about. Thanks again!\n\n",

    "title": "Extreme lasting pain after ejaculation",
    "content": "I am an 18 year old male not currently on medications. I have had two surgeries in my genital area, one when I was 8 to bring down an undecended testicle and one when I was 16 to fix a hydroseal hernia or however it's called. I do not know if that is relevant to the problem I am having.  Since December I have been medicated 3 times for pain while urinating and post-urination pain as well as sudden abdominal pain. The medications seemed to make the pain during urination go away(only after the third course) but it was still painful after urination and before when trying to start urinating. Ultrasound and CAT scan for severe abdominal pain revealed no blockages and my urologist was at a loss to explain the symptoms. My GP thought it was urethritis which some of it may have been as the antibiotics fixed certain problems as I just stated. Three or four urine samples came out clean as well. I should also add that I am sexually active and since November have been having unprotected sex with my girlfriend because she is on BC. We have both been tested for STD's and have both come out negative. I also try to urinate right after sex so as to prevent infections.  However within the past 1-2 weeks after ejaculation I have experienced severe pain which starts almost immediately after my orgasm subsides. The pain is a burning pain and occurs in the tip of my penis, along the space between my testicles and my anus(perinum or something I believe it's called?) and also in my rectal area which is what led me to believe maybe I have prostatitis? I looked up the symptoms online and they seem to be similar to mine. Prostatitis would also explain why it is painful to start urinating as the prostate controls urination correct? My first question is do you think I have prostatitis and if so why did my urologist not think to check for such an ailment? Secondly, do you know of any ways to fix my condition, I have read about massages as well as that antibiotics do not generally help? I have also tried taking anti-inflamatory drugs after ejaculation and they do not help with the pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Deeves, You complaints are consistent with symptoms of prostatitis.  If you did not express post ejaculatory pain to your Urologist at your last evaluation that would be one reason this condition may have not been first considered and others were instead. Anti-inflammatory medications work much more efficiently in reducing inflammation if taken on a more regular basis (with food) for a short amount of time. When taken directly after intercourse there isn't any immediate pain relief only some relief noticed later on. Treatment of Prostatitis depends on the causative factor involved. I will include a link in this post for you to view. I would suggest a re-evaluation by a Urologist. Click here! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The fact that you feel that the bleeding \"seems to \"backflow\" to my bladder\", suggests that the bleeding must be closer to the prostatic urethra than the distal urethra (near the tip). A number of causes for post-coital urethral bleeding in males have been reported in the medical literature. Some of them are... - minor coital trauma - vascular malformations of urethra - Benign prostatic hyperplasia - penile piecing, etc. In your case, it is better to begin by investigating for a bleeding source in your Prostate.Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Melon1991,  I wish to add a bit more details to what i already described in my reply to emtinoklahoma.  In this context one must try to understand a couple of often somewhat confusing terminologies. - isolated hemospermia(is blood in the seminal fluid) and - post ejaculation hematuria(also can be post-coital hematuria), which is bleeding per urethra following ejaculation. This may or may not be associated with hemospermia.  Isolated hemospermia is a more common clinical condition and is often due to infections and inflammations(originating from conditions in the urethra, prostate and seminal vesicles) though in up to 40% of cases, the cause may be indeterminate.  Some of the reported causes of post-ejaculation hematuria are, - Posterior urethral hemangiomas,  - large varicosities located at the apex of the prostate,  - varicosities in the posterior urethra, - benign prostatic utricular papilloma, - penile fracture with associated urethral injury, - Isolated urethral rupture(rare),  - violent massage of the prostate is known to cause hematuria from the prostate and posterior urethra.   Thorough evaluation is necessary in cases of postcoital hematuria as treatable lesions can be identified. Cystourethroscopy following simulation of the circumstances of bleed (masturbation or coitus) may demonstrate the lesion. The other technique that has been used is cystoscopy during pharmacologically induced erection. Some of these causes may be dealt with eminently during cystoscopy (by electrofulguration, or laser coagulation).   After thorough investigations, in cases without identifiable causes, the patients could be reassured that the condition is benign and likely to be self-limiting.  Obviously you need to consult a urologist to be investigated comprehensively. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Scrotum trauma -- symptoms (lump) after the fact",
    "content": "About 5 months ago, I was hit by a 90mph fastball. I was standing behind the catcher, the pitcher released the ball, it tookl on hop and then nailed in the scrotum from directly underneath -- I dropped like a rock.   That evening I was in some pain, but nothing more than \"some\" discomfort. The following day there was some slight bruising on the left-most bottom side of the scrotum. The discomfort lasted about three or four days lessening each day. The bruising was gone by the following week.   I've recently noticed a disfiguration on the top of the left testicle. I'm hesitent to describe it as a lump, but it could be classified as such. The testicle is normal in feeling/shape. However, when running along the edges toward the top where it begins to slope (like and egg or grape), the underlying tissue is softer than the rest of the testicle. It almost feels like the top of the testicle has been pinched -- creating a slight bulge at the top. But it could be a lump on top of that testicle. It's hard to tell by feeling.   Another observation, is that the testicle in question is about 20% large when compared to the right testicle.   History from date of incident to current symptoms: \t1) There was no blood in the urine or other discharges after the incident \t2) No notice in decline of sexual funtion -- everything is working as it has \t3) Neither testicle will move: \t\ta) As an example, when getting a physical and the doctor would have you \"turn your head and cough\" there is no movement in either testicle. \t\tb) When tightening the muscles, like stopping the flow of urine, there is on movement.  \t\tc) Prior to the incident, I could tighten those muscles and cause the penis to move when erect. That does not happen anymore.  \t\td) The testicle seem to sag more than previously \t\te) The scrotum does tighten during intercorse or periods of arrousal.   I plan to see my doctor, but I would rather wait a couple more months as I have some family and work obligations, that are extremely important right now. Getting the time off/away is difficult.  Also, I would like to know any possible diagnosis, or any other self-exams I could do to narrow the possible problem.   Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Scrotum trauma -- symptoms (lump) after the fact",
    "content": "Hi, In the not too distant past, the existence of the entity \"traumatic epididymitis or orchitis\" was not universally accepted.With the widespread use of scrotal ultrasound and color doppler studies, cases of traumatic epididymis and orchitis are being reported.     Trauma can cause several complications related to the scrotal contents, including testicular rupture, intratesticular hematoma, testicular infarction, traumatic hematocele, and lacerations of tunica albuginea.  Epididymitis following trauma has also been observed to occur as an isolated finding, particularly in less-severe scrotal injury. A point of note is that epididymitis after trauma can be associated with an underlying infection, with the trauma being an aggravating factor.  If you had got yourself examined by a urologist soon after the trauma, a diagnosis could have been fairly easily arrived at.  Although in your case there is a definite history of significant trauma, most clinicians would prefer to test such individuals for STDs and UTIs none the less. As explained earlier, trauma may just be an inciting event.  Rather than speculating, it may be a lot wiser and safer to consult a urologist and get thoroughly investigated. Best wishes!\n\n",

I am not in any pain or discomfort just worried that it may be something serious. please advise because i am going crazy thinking about it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mashpash, Thank you for the post. In approximately 50% of the cases of blood in the semen(hematospermia), the etiology is undetermined (idiopathic). Several disorders, for example, trauma, infections(bacterial, viral, parasitic), chroinc granulomatous disorders(tuberculosis), disorders of seminal vesicles, prostate, ejaculatory ducts as well as others can cause blood in the semen(hematospermia).  In younger men (<40 y), hematospermia is almost always benign. In older men also, it is mostly benign but can be rarely associated with malignancy(prostatic cancer).  Blood in the ejaculate that persists for more than 10 ejaculations generally warrants further evaluation.  If the symptom persists, you must consult a urologist for further work up. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Pain/Bleeding after stent removal",
    "content": "As background info I'm a 30 year old male of average physical condition, in otherwise good health.  Several days ago I had three stones the largest being 8 mm treated by shockwave, a stent was left in for three days. For three days of recovery before removal of the stent I experienced what I consider to be fairly substantial pain and blood in my urine (colour of cranberry juice). After removal of the stent I have continued to experience some relief temporarily follwed by a sudden and extreme pain that lasted several hours during which time I was unable to pee. I was told by my surgeon/urologist that the removal of the stent may cause mild pain that wouldn't last more than 24 hours.   My concern is that it is now been 3 days since the stent has been removed and I am once again seeing blood in my urine and an increase in pain. Is it common or to be expected that symptoms similar to those that originally brought me to the emergency room would be happening now that the stones have been removed?   I'm not sure how to proceed, or what I should be expecting over the short term relating to recovery, (how much blood and pain is normally expected after stent removal).   Thanks for taking the time to respond.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain/Bleeding after stent removal",
    "content": "Hi, How much blood and pain is normally expected after stent removal is variable. Stones in the urinary tract do not sit idle. They tend to produce local problems (such as local ulceration of the lining of the urinary tract by pressure or by their texture).These ulcers can bleed following stent removal (stent might have stopped the bleeding due to pressure- what we call 'tamponade' efect). Also, stones sometimes get stuck to the wall of the urinary tract.When they get literally torn away from the urothelium during lithotripsy, they may cause bleeding. Again, the stent itself can get stuck and cause bleeding on removal. I have tried to explain how bleeding can occur and how it can differ from patient to patient. Hopefully, your problem will get better in near future. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "First of all thank you Dr. Kameth for replying to my message, sorry it's been ages since I originally posted my question but I have finally come back to give some additional information about what was causing the pain, maybe some reader may find it helpful.   For two days after my initial post the pain continued and eventually escalated to the point of being unbearable, I decided to return to the emergency room. This time fortunately I met with a new doctor who was willing to help. He ran a few blood tests and discovered that the ciproflox wasn't working to prevent infection and that the infection itself was part of the reason the pain had continued, he prescribed macrobid, and kept me overnight for observation. The following day I gave a second urine sample and passed a stone and several blood clots right into the sample jar! Next the urologist had me take an ultrasound. The urologist was baffled becuase the ultrasound revealed a swollen but otherwise clear ureter, also there were no stones present in the kidney or the bladder. He felt that perhaps I had passed the stone just before the ultrasound and that as the stone was going through the ureter pressure had built up from hydro in my kidney that couldn't pass by the stone on the way to my bladder, this is why the ureter appeared swollen during the ultrasound. It also explains why there was so much pain the stone had completely restricted my urine flow, and my kidneys were full to the point of bursting.   Well I feel much better now that I've been through it, now I'll know what to expect next time. And just as an additional FYI the blood clots can actually be more painful than the stones for some people.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is unusual but it does happen. Normally the broken vessel will resolve on its own, assuming it is allowed time and not traumatized by further use. Sometimes this is caused by a genetic weakness in a given vessel or due to capilary fragility. Sometimes it's a matter of abnormally low levels of vitamin K -- but don't try fixing this on your own, especially if you don't know whether or not that's what caused it.  First order of business is to give it a week or two for healing and clearing up. If there is any swelling or any new symptom develops (especially swelling), you should bring it to the attention of your doctor at once. Otherwise, it sounds, so far, as though it's healing normally.   Also, if this should happen again in the same area, I'd definitely bring it to the attention of a doctor. Once is just one of those things. More than once and there may be a problem that needs addressing.  Best of luck to you. Stay in touch with us and let us know how this works out.\n\n",

    "content": "I have this exact same problem. Yesterday while having particularly rough sex i stubbed my penis, proceeded to finish to climax with no pain or discomfort. However when i pulled out and looked down there was a swollen bump on the top middle part of my penis under the foreskin, that looked to be filled with blood, apparently out of nowhere. I though somehow a testicle had made it's way up in there somehow, but after verifying both were in place, i discarded it thinking it would subside. It has stayed the same basic swollen size for a day, but now appears to be getting more purple as a bruise would. So my question is basically what is this? Is it a burst blood vessel as described above, maybe a vein got hit or bent causing it to bleed but since there was no cut the blood is trapped under foreskin, or is it just a bruise caused by blunt trauma? I don't know if I need to go to a doctor or just leave it to heal on it's own, there is no real pain or discomfort, it seems contained in a band on the top of my penis shaft, not spreading to the head, nor to the under side of the shaft. It feels pretty soft like a normal semi- erect penis , just with a dark red/purple colored bubble-esque resting atop. So how long should i give it to heal on it's own before becoming concrened?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Burst Blood Vessel in Penis",
    "content": "Hello --  This is a fairly common problem in the extremities, less so in the  penis, but the mechanism is still the same, and it is usually the result of often very mild blunt trauma. Usually a vein smaller than it would appear (closer to capilary size than a trunk vein) will break, and this is often attributable to a deficiency of vitamin K if it happens often. Apparently you were jammed in a way that just caused a weakened area in a small vein to break. The swelling and discoloration is essentially a bruise, although with more bleeding into the tissues than usual, which is now resolving based on your description. It should continue to disperse, with some progressive changes in color and possibly some dispersion into adjacent tissue so that as the swelling goes down the discoloration should spread and lighten til it eventually disappears. It's usually just an idiosyncratic injury, and you're really fortunate in not having had any marked pain with this, at least at the time it happened, as these can often hurt pretty bad, especially when it happens in an extremity, though not for a very long period of time.   The swelling should be gone in a matter of days. The discoloration could last a week or two, but slowly fading. If there is any other symptom that begins, such as new swelling, increased or new pain, or anything like that, you probably should bring it to the attention of a doctor. Otherwise this should resolve before too long.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

We finished and I felt no pain/discomfort of any sort, but this morning I looked at my penis and there is a tiny red/purple-ish dot on the head, next to the urethra and it wasn't there yesterday.  I am wondering if this could just be a burst blood vessel from the condom being so tight and pressure building up in the head of the penis, or if I should worry further and consult a doctor? It is not raised at all, seems like it is just under the skin and is a very small dot, like a pencil dot. I am going to give it a day or two and see if anything changes, but for now I am worrying nonetheless since I wore a condom and am hoping it didnt have any breaks in it from being too tight.    Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance ~\n\n",

About a year ago I had a swollen/broken blood vessel on the right side of my penis, when erect it was clearly a blood vessel or a vein or something, but when flaccid it appeared more like a sort of formless lump.

It has been recurring more frequently lately, after almost every instant of sexual activity. It is always a sort of formless lump now, seems to be larger, and is less identifiable as a blood vessel or whatever. It only goes away if I make sure to abstain from masturbation or sex for several days. I haven't been concerned because it isn't painful and it always goes away, but I'm more worried since it seems to have changed. What is happening and why? Should I be concerned?\n\n",

I am not aware of what particular medication you were taking at that time. A drug induced lesion can not be entirely ruled out.However, i feel that you should consult your doctor soon and get assessed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Transrectal ultrasound-guided prostatic biopsy has now become a relatively safe and widely available procedure.However, like any other invasive procedure, it has its own share of complications.The complications can be classified as  - immediate & - late.  Some of the immediate complications are - urethral bleeding, - rectal bleeding &  - vasovagal reactions etc.   Some of the late complications are - rectal bleeding, - fever, - perineal pain,  - hematuria, - hemospermia - epididymo-orchitis, - urinary retention & - septic shock.  Of these, septic shock is perhaps the most dangerous as it can result even in mortality.  Your symptoms certainly don't suggest emerging incontinence but more in favor of cystitis with some degree of bladder outlet obstruction - perhaps aggravated by the procedure. Consult your doctor & in all probability he/she may investigate you for a UTI. Hopefully, your symptoms should settle down fairly soon. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Decreased urination and fatigue",
    "content": "Hi, The first thing you should do (if you are not in a position to consult a urologist right away), is to measure your 24 hour urine output.  'Oliguria' is defined as a urine output of less than 1 mL/kg/h in infants, less than 0.5 mL/kg/h in children, and less than 400 mL/day in the adults. 'Anuria' is defoined as a urine output less than 50mL  per day.  As you have a past history of urinary stone disease, among other things, stones causing bilateral ureteric obstrution or stone in one ureter causing what is known as \"reflex anuria\" need to be urgently excluded if the measured urine output is less than the aforesaid levels.A super added urinary infection in an obstructed kidney can be devastating and therefore should be excluded urgently as well.  Both oliguria and anuria need a very urgent assessment. I urge you to consult a urologist without delay. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 yr old male, I had a cysto yesterday to investigate slow flow, start/stop issues. It turned up a cyst near where the urethra joins the bladder. I had the procedure under general anasthetic.  An hour after I was released I noticed I could not urinate, just a few drops. I went to my Urologist who catheterized me, it took 3 tries with different sizes before they could get it in - that was most unpleasant.  Its a day later and I have pus and bloody discharge coming from the tip of my penis, which is swollen and sore. I was told to keep the cath for 5 more days before taking it out.  Is catheterization normal after a cystoscopy? If so is 6 days the normal time frame? I don't like having it in (it constantly irritates the tip) but definitely would prefer not having to undergo that again, at least not so soon.  In regards to the soreness/swelling/discharge - has it become infected in the 24 hrs since I had this done, or is this something else?  I am a little freaked and in some discomfort.  Thanks, Andy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is rather unusual to develop such a florid urinary infection within a day of cystoscopy. You have not mentioned what the provisional diagnosis was prior to the procedure. You say \"It turned up a cyst near where the urethra joins the bladder\". Was there a suspicion of a prostatic abscess? Also, you have not mentioned if any additional procedure has been performed during the cystoscopy.  Certainly there are instances when a patient needs to be catheterized for acute urinary retention following cystoscopy. More so, in individuals who have had a past history of voiding difficulties.  You have not mentioned if you are on antibiotic therapy. Under these circumstances, you should consult your urologist again and get evaluated. A microscopic examination of the discharge and a urine culture will be usually carried out in these circumstances.The decision regarding catheter removal should be best left to the urologist. Best wishes!\n\n",

Blood work done for info about my liver, kydneys, etc as well as a PSA. I don't know the numbers but was told everything was normal. 3. I had a full abdominal CT scan which revealed no abnormalities of any kind. 4. I had a urine flow rate test ( full bladder scan )which revealed that I was not completely voiding my bladder and the flow rate was also considered slow.  My urologist then ordered the cysto because nothing else could be found wrong from the other tests except the slow flow and unable to completely void my bladder issues.  There were no suspicions of anything problematic involving my prostate that my urologist mentioned, he specifically wanted to check the urethra and bladder for obstructions.  I have only taken the antibiotics for 2 days, the bloody and white discharge started appearing within 3 hours of the catheterization being done.  Thank you Andy\n\n",

I checked last about one or two weeks ago on my testicles and found nothing. This morning my 80 lbs dog decided to wake me up by walking on me and he managed to step on my right testicle which was not very pleasant as you might know. It hurt for a little bit but I eventually forgot about the pain, the day went on and about 2 or three hours i noticed that it still hurt to the touch. than about 4-5 hours after the incident i felt around and came to find a very small bump on my right testicle, its about 75% the size of a bb and its located right near the head of epididymis, or near the top of the chords that go into my testicle maybe a half to one centimeter away.  Im not sure exactly what it was but it was not there a week or two ago. Any help would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "HI, There are two likely scenarios. - a new swelling has developed following the trauma or - a pre-existing swelling (which was not palpable) that had got aggravated by the trauma.  Possibilities for a such a swelling in that vicinity are - an hydrocele of the spermatic cord, - a lipoma of the spermatic cord, - a cyst of the epididymis, - a spermatocele, - cysts of Morgagni,  - an enlarged head of the epididymis, or  - a localized hematoma confined to the spermatic cord.  Hydrocele of the spermatic cord: fluid collection occuring in a small remnant of processus vaginalis within the spermatic cord  Lipomas of the spermatic cord: very common. Features are similar to lipomas elsewhere.  Cysts of the epididymis: are located within the capsule of the epididymis.Usually develop in adults around the age of 40. Contain clear fluid.  Spermatoceles:are retention cysts.Usually connected to the testis, and filled with fluid containing spermatozoa.  Hydatid of Morgagni: is a small cyst that is separate from the epididymis. Relatively more common in children and adolescents. Often has a pedicle (Risk of torsion). This arises from a small developmental remnant, which sits just anterior to the head of the epididymis, on top of the testis.  Only a physical examination followed by scrotal ultrasound will enable one to come to a definitive diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Sex is a very common cause of urinary tract infections in women. From what i understand it's not so much the frequency but the act in itself. The fact that you have sex often only increases your chances. The reason sex can cause infections is due to the fact that during penetration you're allowing bacteria to enter. The best way to help stop this problem occurring is to make sure you urinate as soon as possible after having sex.  Also make sure you don't \"hold on\" too long even if you haven't had sex. Holding on rather than urinating when you need to encourages bacteria growth. I'm not an expert on the matter so you may want to check with a professional although due to health problems with my daughter have done quite a bit of research. I hope this has been of help to you and i wish you all the best. Kazzy\n\n",

So in this case you are saying that UTI's come from the act of penetration and how this can cause bacteria to accumulate and enter the urinary tract? Would you know where the bacteria comes from?  I will indeed take on your advice to urinate right after sex and try not to hold it too long in general. I already have a weak Urethra from all the times i have had UTIS! Last year I had 4! and one of the times it was so bad I even started bleeding from my urethra. Ouch! not good.

    "title": "FREQUENT URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS AFTER SEX",
    "content": "It is necessary to explain the anatomical and medical reasons why you experience frequent urinary tract infections after sex.     Comparatively, females are more prone to urinary tract infections (UTI) due to the anatomy of the female genitourinary tract. The female urethra is short (4cm in length) and opens very near and just anterior to the opening of the vagina. The short urethra facilitates the ascent of infective organisms from the vaginal opening into the bladder. Due to the inward and outward movements during a sexual act, a copious amount of secretions and organisms present in the vagina is made available at the vaginal opening for ascent into the bladder.  There are female-specific factors that cause some women recurrent UTI.  Women with recurrent UTI  (a)  have more binding sites for infective organisms on the linings of the vagina and urethra. (b) lack an enzyme in the secretions of the linings of the vagina and urethra, which normally masks these binding sites, making these binding sites more available for infective organisms.  Therefore, it is not the frequency of sex that causes recurrent UTI, but in  all women, the proximity of the short urethra to the vagina; and in  some women the abundance of binding sites for infective pathogens and the lack of an enzyme blocker.  In general, women who have recurrent episodes of UTI must be evaluated to determine if they have an uncomplicated or a complicated UTI. This is mandatory in your case and the first line of action.  In uncomplicated UTI, the urinary tract has no structural abnormality, the renal function is normal and there is no associated disease which impairs defence mechanisms. In complicated UTI, the urinary tract is abnormal due to obstruction or kidney disorders, or there is an associated disease that predisposes to it, such as diabetes mellitus.   It is important to establish the presence of UTI at the onset of symptoms before commencing antibiotic use. This is done by subjecting a fresh, middle stream specimen of urine to microbiological and sensitivity tests.  Taking antibiotics without identification of the causative bacteria and their sensitivity may not eradicate the infection, and this usually results in bacterial resistance.  The following are recommended preventive measures to be adopted by women with recurrent UTI,  irrespective of the cause.  This regimen should be started after a curative course of treatment, based on results of microbiological tests.  *Fluid intake of at least 2 litres per day *Regular emptying of bladder :  3-hourly intervals by day and before bedtime *Complete emptying of the bladder at each micturition *Double micturition before retiring for the night: empty the bladder and then attempt to empty the bladder a second time 15 minutes later. *Empty bladder before and after intercourse  I hope this information is helpful.

    "content": "Dear Dr Anthony Solomon,  Thank you for your very, very informative reply post. Would you know how a doctor would check for complicated UTI? Would it be done by simply having a Urine test? Or Would the doctor need to examine my urinary tract and kidneys? In the past when I have had UTI, i happened unfortunately to get them while on holiday in a foreign country, so I would end up taking pain killers to forget about the pain as I wouldnt not be able to see a doctor right away -there were two such incidences where i got UTIs abroad and waited 4-5 days in agony until i got back to my own country to get some antibiotics. I am afraid that having left it for so many days - both times, that the infections may have damaged any interior organs?   Camara [/b]\n\n",

    "content": "I've had the same problem as yours.  As a matter of fact, it's 5:48 a.m. my time now and I am on my laptop writing this post...and right at this moment, I am suffering from pain from UTI.  Like you, I always get UTI after my husband and I would have sex.  The pain usually starts about a day after we have sex.  I do urinate before and after sex...and wash before and after sex but I still get it.  Eversince I first had it (when I was 12 weeks pregnant), I've had it so frequently that my doctor would always give me Macrobid to treat it.    I've been evaluated for it last year.  I saw a urologist and did a VCUG (Voided Cystourethrogram) where they've injected a dye in my bladder and while I was going, they were taking pictures of my bladder and urethra to see if there was some kind of reflux going on, but everything was perfectly normal.  I've done the Cranberry Juice treatment a lot of times, even took cranberry fruit pills everyday and would still get it.  Like you, I have been scared now to have sex because I'm afraid that the next day, I would feel the pain when urinating.  I couldn't count how many times I've had UTI this year alone.  I've had one just two months ago and here I go having another UTI again.  The urologist has even put me on Macrobid 100mg that I took once a day for the entire 3 months.  I haven't had infections while in the medication, but a couple of months after that, I would get it again and is always triggered by sex.  My primary care doctor has also asked me to have a CT scan of my kidneys to make sure that my kidneys are not the primary reason why I'm getting the frequent UTIs, but my results all came back normal.    I am very frustrated...I have done everything possible but I still couldn't prevent it.  It has become a part of my life now.  I will have to call my doctor's office first thing in the morning to see what they can do for me.  The past couple times, I would always get it on a weekend and I could just call my doctor and he would call my pharmacy for Macrobid.  I started feeling the symptoms last night and it has escalated already...the pain is really sharp even after taking AZO which I always have with me at home.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Urinary trackt infections after sex",
    "content": "I understand everyone's pain here. I've had re-current UTIs since I was 3 years old and more recently found out that I have IC as well. Unlike some people who  are asymptomatic when having a UTI, I have full blown burning, stabbing pain when urinating; lose control of my bladder to the point that I cannot leave the bathroom for urinating in drops every few minutes which in turn send spasms through my body with each drop. This like someone mentioned before is always within 12 to 18 hours of sex, regardless of urinating before and after sex. After cystoscopes, x-rays, ultrasounds, stretching of my urethra, etc. nothing works completely. I've seen many specialist and not specialist over the years. To add injury to insult, I almost died at age 10 from taking sulfa drugs for the infections when my doctor didn't recognize the symptoms of my body having an allergic reaction to the drug. In my research I found that the bacteria that grows in the intestines is usually the number 1 culprit of UTIs. Thus the sex act helps the bacteria from that area move and be pushed up into the urethra. As the Dr. said in his earlier post, the many causes are the length of the urethra and the binding of these bacteria to the walls of the urethra. There are many drug trials going on and research being done to try and come up with something to help the percent of the population that have the problem of lacking the enzyme to protect the walls of the urethra. Soooo....what works? Well, Macrobid 100mg daily is a starter course until your body gets use to the anti-biotic. Now, Macrobid is used because it isn't a broad spectrum antibiotic (meaning it is not affective for multiple types of infections) Macrobid or Macrodantin are work specifically on the kidneys, bladder, and urinary tract. This is why it is the first preventive drug prescribed by physicians. Ultimately, when these stop working the doctor will have to move to a different antibiotic which unfortunately will have to be a broad spectrum one, as there are only so many antibiotics out there. This causes many problems as you can guess because eventually there will be no antibiotics left to use on you for any infection. Now for the pain, Pyridium 200 mg is the usual drug of choice by physicians. I've found that Pyridium Plus works significantly better for all of the pain and symptoms I have but it has been discontinued. I've also heard rumblings that Pyridium as well is no longer being produced which will be a nightmare for thousands and thousands. Over the counter you can buy Azo-Standard, which is the same drug that is in Pyridium at much lower doses. There is also Cystex which includes an antibacterial that can help to slow the progression of the infection until you can get to the doctors office. It will not however get rid of the infection. Cranberry juice is only helpful before you get the infection.If you already have the infection the lining of your urethra will be so inflamed that the acidity of the juice will increase your painWater water water is a necessity as the more dilute the urine if you have an infection the lesser the pain. Additionally, by keeping your bladder full you force lots of bacteria out of your bladder every time you urinate. Sitting in a tub of warm to hot water (NO SOAP) will help relieve pain until you can get to the Dr or while you are waiting on the antibiotics to do their job. . I've found that the size of your partner can increase infections as well as the positions used during intercourse. Take showers not baths. Drink 48 or more oz of water daily. Wear cotton underwear. Sleep without underwear. Wipe from front to back. Limit or cut out caffeine intake.  Reduce milk intake. Wear loose clothing. Use unscented toilet paper. Urinate often. Empty your bladder. Limit alcohol intake. Keep pyridium or something similar on hand. If you are getting infections 50% or more of the time after sex, see a physician for a preventive prescription of Macrobid or Macrodantin. Try taking after sex or if you have trouble remembering to have the antibiotic with you because you're being spontaneous, take Macrobid daily. Urinate before and after sex. Make sure your partner is clean and you are clean before sex. Never switch from anal sex to vaginal sex as this will ensure the bad bacteria is brought in contact with your urethra.  I wish I had better news but all we can do is continue to research the subject and keep aware of new discoveries. Just know you're not alone!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there  Im 21 and have had this problem ongoing since i was about 18. I was getting urine infections every 1-2 weeks, from any little thing (sex, holding on to my urine etc), and was constantly on meds. No one ever really checked out why it was happening, just giving me meds to get rid of it.   They were so bad it would cause the burning and bleeding every time. I tried everything from cranberry juice/tablets to the peeing before and after sex, the proper 'wiping' after going to toilet.  It was only a few months back that a doctor I visited decided it was not on, and ordered scans of my kidneys (this was after the infection this time reached my kidneys - its horrible, you cannot sleep or lay down or walk!)   After having scans done, it was found I had a cyst bigger than a tennis ball that had grown on my ovary. As it was so big, it was pushing on my urethra causing blockages and therefore infections every week.   Since having this removed (along with my ovary), i thought all was well as it had been just about 2 months since my last infection.   Now that i have got back in to having sex, the infections are back! its not just sex though. I can be BUSTING to go to toilet when i wake up from a nights sleep and BANG, infection.  Completely stumped now. May head back to docs. But for the women out there that get them constantly, perhaps get those scans done and check you don't have any issue internally.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 41 year old male, healthy and active other than my urological problems.  Over the past 7 years I have been dealing with weak stream, hesitancy, dribbling, starting and stopping, etc.  My general practitioner and a Urologist I visited at the beginning of all this both diagonised me with prostatitis. After several rounds of Cipro and Bactrim it did seem to clear up somewhat as far as the frequent urges go, but the hesitancy and weak stream have remained.  Last October I experienced a significant flare-up in symptoms and started visiting a different Urologist in the same practice (my original one had retired). In addition to the usual symptoms I can now add nighttime incontinence to the list.    Tryed the usual round of antibiotics but didn't see any significant relief.  He then had me try Uroxatral (loved the benefits, hated the side effects) and I did see a marked ability to start flow and empty better.  As I said though, the side effects were intolerable and I quit taking it.    This past Friday I went for a followup and he decided to check my PVR after urinating.  After straining to get as much out as I could, my PVR ended up being around 1000 cc.  He has me on a Foley catheter for at least a week, said he wants to give the bladder a chance to settle down, and then pursue Urodynamic testing and a Cystoscopy, but is thinking ultimately I will need a TURP.  The nurse did have some resistance in getting the catheter past the prostate, which is making me think a TURP could correct all this ???  One other thing I've noticed, which Im not sure is significant or not, is that after having an orgasm I am able to start urinating a lot easier and feel like I empty my bladder more than if I haven't had one.  Could the prostate be putting enough pressure on the urethra to cause this much retention?  Sorry for the long post, but all of this has me quite concerned about what the outcome will be as he mentioned I may have to learn to catherterize myself in the future.\n\n",

    "title": "General anaesthesia during cystoscopy?",
    "content": "Dear Sir/Madam, let me first congratulate you for providing this oppurtunity for common people to ask questions! I'm a relatively healthy male of 38 years old. I have nocturia (combined with heavy nightly sweating) for as long as I can remember. Now since a few days I'm sure I have some form of prostatitis: mild pain in testicles and penis as well as perineal area, mild pain and burning sensation in lower abdomen area, very frequent urination (not painful) etc. The GP took a urine dipstick test and that was completely negative (except for miniscule amount of blood). Even a 24-hours lab test proved negative. That's why I'm considering a abacterial chronic prostatitis (possibly related to/combined with pelvic floor tension myalgia).   The main issue is now, I have a HUGE fear of doctors, needles, examinations, related pain etc. etc You have no idea how bad that is. If I needed to go to a urologist and they would suggest a cystoscopy, I would refuse (even if they tell me the cream would numb my genital area). Even if the situation would be life-threatening! However, if they provide general anaesthesia, I would consider it, maybe. Is this common or is this something rare but accepted?  Thank you so much for your time!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: General anaesthesia during cystoscopy?",
    "content": "Hi, Most urologists would discuss with the patient regarding the type of anesthesia and explain the pros and cons of each one of them.Decision is taken only aftr such a discussion.   The anesthetic technique may involve - local anesthetic (topical) alone, - local anesthetic (topical) + sedation, or - a general anesthetic.  In 'local anesthetic (topical) alone' situation, a local anesthetic gel (lignocaine) is squeezed(rather than 'injected')  into the urethra & massaged in to facilitate even spread.This is then allowed to act for about 15-30 minutes.Procedure may then begin.  Similar procedure along with an anxiolytic/sedative occurs in the case of local anesthetic (topical) + sedation.To comprehend, this needs some explaining.  American Society of Anesthesiologists' definition of levels of sedation is as follows.  Level 1- Minimal sedation (anxiolysis): a drug-induced state during which a patient responds normally to verbal commands.  Level 2- Moderate sedation/analgesia (conscious sedation): a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which a patient responds purposefully to verbal commands, either alone or with light tactile stimulation.  Level 3- Deep sedation/analgesia: a drug-induced depression of consciousness during which a patient can't be easily aroused, but responds purposefully following repeated or painful stimuli.  Level 4- Anesthesia: includes general anesthesia and spinal or major regional anesthesia but not local anesthesia. General anesthesia is a drug-induced loss of consciousness during which patients are not arousable, even while painful stimuli are applied.  If the procedure is done in an out-patient setting, the anesthesiologist may prefer to use levels 1 or 2. If the procedure is performed in the operating room, the preferred levels may be  3 or 4.  Thus, the ultimate decision on the choice of sedation rests with the anesthesiologist. Best wishes!\n\n",

The problem... about 2 weeks ago, I developed a pain near the opening at the tip of my penis. I also experienced a mild burning pain while urinating. I have noticed a slight increase in the frequency of urination or the feeling of needing to urinate. After a few days, it subsided or lessened in intensity. However, in the past week it has resurfaced. I have not experienced blood in urine or any other milky or discolored discharges. My urine looks normal- yellow to clear. I have not noticed any sores on or around my penis. At times it has been a little red around the head, but this is following sexual activity or masturbation.  I have had some lower back pain, but I am also overweight and recently took a long international flight, so I thought that was probably stiffness or muscle pain.  I would like to figure out if this is a UTI, yeast infection or an STD. Can you diagnose or give some suggestions?  Thanks.\n\n",

I can tighten my abdominal muscles and the right testicle moves accordingly, but the testicle on the left side doesn't even seem to respond to the cremaster reflex.

It's just a permanent ache.  I've had this ache that is very uncomfortable and is interrupting my activities for 3 weeks now. It's not getting better.   There is no discharge from the penis and no pain urinating. It does take a while to start urinating sometimes, but there is not pain and everything appears normal once I start.  I had an inguinal hernia operation also on the left side almost 8 months ago.  Two weeks ago, I was at the hospital and they checked. They did an echosonogram and reported that all was normal. They only found that a lymph node in my groin on the left side was inflamed: 10x3.5mm. I took a low dose of antibiotic for 5 days and they said to rest a bit.  I can get aroused and have sex. It's not painful. I just feel a dull ache that extends alongside the left base of my penis down to the top of the testicle.

    "title": "Re: 3 week pain on chords holding low hanging left testicle",
    "content": "Hi, You indicate that you underwent an inguinal hernia repair about 8 months ago.   The cremaster muscle on the side of an hernia gets frequently thinned out in some large hernias and in hernias of long duration and becomes so thinned out that it can not be identified at surgery as a separate layer of muscle(only the cremasteric fascia remains identifiable).Thus, it may get removed with the hernial sac. Also, surgeons often remove the cremaster muscle deliberately (a well known and accepted procedure-it is part of \"skeletonizing the elements of the inguinal canal\"), which makes repair simpler and better. Resection of the cremaster muscle is considered an essential part of Shouldice's hernia repair.  Therefore,lack of or a weak cremasteric reflex on the side of the hernia repair is not in any way to be considered abnormal in this situation.  Chronic groin pain is a significant problem following open inguinal hernia repair, with a incidence ranging from 19% to 62.9%.The ilioinguinal nerve is a sensory nerve that innervates the skin over the groin region, the medial aspect of the thigh, the upper part of the scrotum and the penile root.This nerve gets caught up in the fibrous tissue following repair(during the healing phase). This may result in a \"entrapment neuropathy\", causing pain in the distribution of the nerve. (There are two other nerves-the iliohypogastric nerve and the genital branch of genitofemoral nerve, that also may be involved similarly). The symptoms usually occur in the early post operative period but, may be delayed by several months or even years.In a fair number of cases that present early, the pain tends to disappear sponteneously.    This possibility also needs to be considered in your case.  In these cases, the initial management is a conservative(non-operative). Only if symptoms persist despite this and are debilitating, surgical option would be considered.  I hope that your symptoms(which could well be due to a minor infection) will subside in due course with on-going management. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen, non-painful lump around penis.",
    "content": "I have noticed a swollen ring ring around my penis. It appeared about two days ago. The last time I had sex was four days ago, and I did masturbate the day before that and have masturbated twice since the ring appeared..  The ring is not very large, it is probably about 1/2\" in width and about 1/8\" thick (protruding away from penis). When it first appeared it was directly below the head of my penis and has since moved about halfway down the shaft. On first look it appeared to wrap almost entirely around my penis but becoming very thin near the bottom. Today it appears to be entirely contained on the top and the sides and is more of a lump on the left side. It is visible when flaccid or erect.   It feels soft, almost as if there were tissue or something directly beneath the skin. Everything seems to be working fine, there is no pain or discomfort. I have noticed a little problem getting an erection but that's because there is less sensitivity with the lump/ring in the way. I have noticed that when fully erect there appears to be a slightly brown line near the lumpy part of the ring.  I haven't been able to find much info on this issue. Any help or advice you can give me would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30yo healthy male.  I had unprotected oral sex and a brief period where I had unprotected vaginal sex with a female a month ago. Couple days after, I noticed a burning sensation while peeing. I went to the doctor and chose not to have any STD exams. I was given a shot for gonorrhea and zithromax (week dose) for chlamydia. Again, I was not tested for STDs.  After the course of zithromax, the pain while urinating had gone away, but a new pain (in prostate) developed. I also had a swollen lymph node in my groin area on the right side of my leg, on the crease where my leg meets the abdomen.  My current symptoms are as described in the title. I have some pain for several hours in my prostate after I ejaculate. I also noticed that the tip of my urethra becomes inflamed/irritated and almost looks like a pair of lips on the opening of my penis.  My sexual incident occurred 4 weeks ago. I have not had sexual intercourse since then. The girl has been tested for STDs and her results were all negative for STDs (she claims). She is the only one I have been sexually active with, within the past six months.  I also seem to be somewhat fatigued and depressed. I have had several cases of diarrhea the past 3 weeks. I am not sure if these symptoms are related.  Thank you for your input.\n\n",

    "title": "penile Mondor's disease or urethritis?",
    "content": "Dear doctor,  Thank you for taking my questions. I will try to be as thorough as possible.  I am 30 years old and uncircumcised. At the end of April while masturbating I felt pain for a moment along the shaft of my penis. There was no loss of erection and I finished with no problems. Five days after the pain I noticed a lump in the shaft. This is like a two centimetre cord or worm underneath the skin. It begins roughly where I felt the pain, which corresponds to a vein on the right side of the shaft, roughly half-way between groin and glans. The lump begins from this vein, which now coils around it, and continues cross-wise almost until the dorsal vein on top of the penis. The area around the vein gave me faint pain/discomfort/burning; the lump was asymptomatic.  After a few more days I noticed that more urine than normal remained in my penis after urinating (instead of a couple of drops, five or six). I had no dysuria. I then went to A&E as I wasn\u2019t registered with a family doctor at the time. The doctor couldn\u2019t see anything. In fact the lump is sometimes not visible, it deflates or disappears if I lie down, take a shower, or if my penis becomes very small (as was the case at the A&E, given the doctor was a woman and I was embarrassed).  Three weeks after the initial pain (at the start of May) I visited an expert andrological surgeon privately. He examined me manually and felt the testes. Again the lump wasn\u2019t visible. The urologist said it could be early Peyronie\u2019s or Mondor\u2019s. The problem with the latter is that the vein should be visible when flaccid. He suggested a Doppler scan, but as this would be very expensive privately, he told me to register with the NHS and get a referral to him. I have done so, but unfortunately my appointment is on August 12th. I then took one week Ibuprofen max dosage (3x400mg daily).  With this treatment I felt better, but after walking a lot for three consecutive days, I felt again distinctively sorer, and had more problems urinating. Approximately 5 weeks into the problem, I had a lot of problems urinating and my bladder was very uncomfortable. I felt a mixture of burning, and tension as if I needed to go even though I had just done so. This gradually subsided after a few days. I started Ibuprofen again, this time for two weeks, after which I had to stop because it gave me rebound headaches. The burning in the penis did not stop. (I also started applying Hirudoid, an heparinoid, with no success.)  In June I began having occasional pain where my right testicle attaches to the groin, a very similar sensation to the one in the penis: tight and burning. Around the same period, the end of the vein in question also started to burn. This is where the vein separates in two at the tip of my foreskin, going around both sides of it (above and below). The length of this vein between the original lump and the tip has become more coiled, while before it was a smooth arch. Also, another very faint swelling has appeared, similar to the first lump but less pronounced, I believe because there is more skin in the area. To my eyes, this new swelling is connected to the new area of pain. The dribbling urine has continued throughout (there is no \u2018pressure\u2019 at the end).  I had no sex since this problem began (and know for sure that it cannot be related to an STD). However, I did masturbate very occasionally (with pauses of ten days, two weeks, and even 24 days). I now regret this, as I understand it must have worsened my condition. (I am right-handed, so I grab with my palm the area of the foreskin where the new pain/swelling has occurred.)  I wouldn\u2019t be writing to you if a couple of days ago I hadn\u2019t had a bad case of hematuria. Urinating had become increasingly difficult, until frank red urine came out. I went to the A&E, where they diagnosed me with a bad urinary trait infection. The doctor (not a urologist) looked at my penis and said the vein was normal and the pain must be related to the infection. I am on antibiotics, which stopped immediately the hematuria, but the burning on the right tip of the foreskin is unchanged. I obviously don\u2019t deny the UTI, but what of the rest? Could the UTI cause the burning vein? Or could Mondor\u2019s disease have caused the infection?  Assuming I do have Mondor\u2019s (and sclerosing lymphangitis), this seems not to be resolving itself, partly because of my stupidity. I still have to wait a month to see a urologist. Can the inflammation damage the vein? From what I have read, the processes involved in Mondor\u2019s seem similar to those of varicose veins. I have noticed than in the mornings, after being horizontal through the night, I am often asymptomatic. Everything in the penis (lump, swelling, vein) is less visible or invisible if I lie down, or simply lift the penis so that gravity helps circulation. Could blood be pooling at the tip of the foreskin and the vein becoming varicose (hence the coiling)? (I\u2019ve stopped wearing underwear because of the burning, so the penis is always vertical, like a leg.) Or is the penis too short a structure for this process to kick in? Very close to where the vein in question goes into my groin, so above the original lump, there are numerous spider veins. I have had these for a long time, but I am sure they have been reaching down the shaft (one in particular almost reaches the tip of the foreskin). If valves in the vein were damaged, wouldn\u2019t my capacity to maintain an erection also be damaged?   I understand you will not be able to diagnose me through an email, but maybe you could speculate on the issue? (And tell me if I need to see a urologist immediately\u2026)  Yours sincerely,  J.Jones\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, A very unusual clinical presentation indeed! If it were Mondor disease, it should not disappear on lying down or periodically. As it has happened, Mondors can be confidently excluded. Also, in Mondor's, the thrombosed and inflammed vein(veins) will remain palpable (to an expert clinician) even when the penis is flaccid(although to a lesser extent).  A more plausible explanation for this scenario is one wherein vigorous manipulation of the penis during masturbation perhaps resulted in - the rupture of one of the superficial veins, resulting in a lax hematoma and - perhaps a minor urethral trauma.  Very violent manipulations of the penis are capable of causing fractures of the penis as well( very rarely causing corporal herniation).  In conclusion, i can only comment that the symptomatology (as provided) in your case is highly unusual and difficult to assign confidently to a particular diagnosis.You must consult a urologist soon and have it sorted out.

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 21 year old male, with no known history of any disorders that might pretain to this.  For the last 3 days my urine has been very dark. It is still yellow, but definitely darker than normal. It is about the same color as pine-sol, if that helps any. The first day that I noticed that it was dark yellow, I also had bad abdominal pain, and began to dry-heave, so I figured it was dehydration (I also had a 6-pack of beer the night before, and didn't drink anything else with it). I consumed a lot of water and sports drinks, and got some rest. I did not pass stool at all that day.  The next day, I drank a lot of water and sports drinks all day, and still had the abdominal pain (not nearly as bad as the first day). I counted my liquid intake and I drink 1/2 gallon of Gatorade, and 1 gallon of water, for a total of 1.5 gallons of fluid. I made the mistake of eating pizza that night, and had terrible abdominal pain/nasuea. I still had dark colored urine, and did not pass stool that day.  The next day I didn't have much pain at all (maybe a little bit), and I also made sure to drink plenty of liquid. I was urinating frequently like I normally would, but it was still dark, despite the fact I was keeping so well hydrated. I passed one small stool, but it was pale colored (lighter than normal, maybe closer to gray than brown) and had a vein of bright red blood running down it. It was not painful to pass. I generally pass stool every day atleast once, but I figured that my lack of bowel movements could be due to the fact that I was consuming less solid food because of my symptoms.  At this point, I am not sure what it could be. I figured it was not dehydration like I originally figured, since I am urinating frequently, and drinking lots of fluid. I have been rather stressed out lately, so that might have lead to an ulcer.  Any ideas? Thanks in advance for any input.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dark Urine: Not dehydrated. Peptic Ulcer?",
    "content": "Hi, Dr.Jagesh has clearly pointed out a very probable cause. However, i would like to take this opportunity offered by this particular query to add some general details concerning urine color as well as some of the often overlooked causes of \"dark\" colored urine.   The normal color of urine is due to certain pigments, chiefly urobilin as well as certain other pigments such as uroerythrin, as well as others, which may be present in very small amounts.  The color of urine may vary due to a host of factors.  Vitamins: High level of B complex vitamins, which are water soluble, can impart a dark yellow color. Ascorbic acid decreases urochrome excretion. In scurvy or subclinical vitamin c deficiency, urochrome excretion has been noted to increase.  Medications: some of the medications that can cause yellow-brown colored urine include sulfamethoxazole, quinine derivatives and nitrofurantoin.   Diseases such as hemolytic anemia, which is caused by the abnormal breakdown of red blood cells can cause a dark yellow to brown color in the urine. In the same way, hematuria and hemoglobinuria can give a red or dark yellow tinge to urine.   Dietary factors: asparagus is said to impart a dark yellow color to urine. One early research study had shown that -  A low protein diet had been found to reduce the daily urochrome excretion markedly. A high protein diet was found to increase the excretion perceptibly. Gelatin or carrots when taken in the diet had no effect on the output. - A new body, protochrome, the chemical reactions of which are identical with those of urochrome, can be produced from some of the proteins. http://www.jbc.org/content/43/1/237.full.pdf  Some other studies had noted that diets containing the green parts carrots(containing green pigment) caused an increased excretion of urobilin (formerly urochrome) but the yellow parts(containing yellow pigment carotene) did not. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/article ... 35/?page=1  In practice, how then one may investigate an individual(such as you) who complains of voiding \"dark\" urine?  One sample protocol for testing for cause of a dark urine is as follows...  - First, a sample of urine should be centrifuged. After centrifugation, if the sediment is red or brown, and the supernatant is clear, it is hematuria. - If the supernatant is red to brown, next step is to test with orthotolidine dye for presence of heme. If positive, it is either hemoglobinuria or myoglobinuria. - These two may be differentiated by centrifuging a blood sample and looking at the plasma. if plasma is red, then it is hemoglobinuria and if clear, it is myoglobinuria. - If orthotolidine test is negative, then one should investigate for porphyria or phenazopyridine( a bladder analgesic) ingestion or beeturia(due to excessive ingestion of beets).  I suggest that you should watch your diet very carefully and check your medical history(including herbal) and have your urine tested.  There is one other thing which i sort of remembered because you said that you \"had a 6-pack of beer\".  There are quite a few reports of individuals who developed acute renal insufficiency due to rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria in the context of a binge and heavy alcohol drinking. This is known as \"acute alcoholic myopathy\".  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Moving Lump in Penis",
    "content": "Hi, Although not comprehensive, your history does suggest a few possibilities. It does so, because of one distinctive feature - ie, the indication that a swelling is mainly seen during an erection.  The possibilities are, - penile hemangiomas (very rare, small lesions. Therapies include electrofulguration, cryotherapy, sclerotherapy  and surgical excision. - an A-V malformation (congenital or post-traumatic), - corporeal herniation.  Among these three, corporeal herniation seems most likely.These herniations occur via defects in the tunica albugenia which surrounds the corpora cavernosa.  Causes may be, - idiopathic(or spontaneous corporal herniation.Isolated case reports in medical literature), - post- traumatic (surgical or accidental trauma).  Corporal herniation has been reported following some surgical procedures:  - Nesbit plication as part of surgical treatment of Peyronie's disease, - in relation to corporotomy incisions of penile implant procedures.  Weakening  of the tunica albuginea of the corpora cavernosa  thus appears to be the underlying  predisposing factor for  corporal herniation. Therefore, patients with a weakened albuginea could presumably develop defects at lower pressures  usually necessary to cause rupture in patients with healthy albuginea.  You indicate in your profile that you were severely mauled by a dog at age 2.  I wonder if an injury to the tunica albuginea occurred at that time and perhaps went unnoticed.  You should consult a urologist and get investigated. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I empathize with you for the suffering you are going through.I guess, your doctor (rightly so) probably prescribed to you 2%  linocaine gel for topical analgesia.  Lidocaine 3.5% and 5% have been studied (and being studied) for their efficacy in neuropathic pains and for post operative analgesia.  As the % of lignocaine increases, potential for local and systemic toxicity increases proportionately.Topical local anaesthetics may be absorbed through mucosal surfaces and the rate of absorption is unpredictable.Therefore serious systemic side-effects can occur. Potential for mortality from respiratory arrest exists as the % is hiked up.  So far,there has not been widespread inclination or need to put 10% lidocaine through clinical trials. 5% lidocaine appears to be satisfactory enough for most purposes.  I see from your profile that you are on alprazolam and citalopram hydrobromide.  In this situation, your doctor is rightly cautious about which topical analgesia to prescribe. I suggest that you should first discuss this predicament with your psychiatrist and then discuss the possibility of your psychiatrist and family doctor jointly deciding on the most ideal way forward in planning safe and effective analgesia for you. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How long hematuria normal following TUIP?",
    "content": "Hi, Minimal hematuria following transurethral incision of the prostate(TUIP) is quite usual. One may expect the bleeding to last approximately for about 6 weeks following surgery. The bleeding is usually intermittent and not massive.The 'raw area' created by the incision within the urinary bladder takes a while to heal, as it is continuously in contact with the urine.  If heavy bleeding, or clots are noted, one should be reported to the urologist.This hematuria generally abates spontaneously.   As your husband has Von Willebrand's disease (Type I), it is wise lean on the side of caution and consult your urologist to decide if any additional measures(haemostatic preparations such as: factor concentrate, fresh plasma, tranexamic acid or desmopressin) may be indicated. In the meanwhile, give him plenty of water to drink to aid in healing of the incision and control of the hematuria. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Urge to urinate when lying down",
    "content": "Hi,   I have an ongoing problem (around five years). I'm a 28 year old healthy male, don't smoke, and drink occasionally. Healthy diet, with not much caffeine. I drink mostly water.   When I lay down either during the day (for a nap or to watch tv), or at night (to sleep), I am disturbed by the need to urinate very often. At night, I average three visits to the toilet. My record was around 10. Most times, not much really comes out but I feel better afterwards. I also had difficulty starting but I am convinced that this is entirely psychological as I have shy bladder in public places and cannot urinate unless I am in a cubicle. I would also add that the problem seems worse if I am in a more lucid or light sleep (such as a daytime nap or a morning lay-in). The problem only ever occurs when I am in a lying-down position.   The sensation that leads me to the toilet on these special occasions is different to the usual \"urge to urinate\" sensation - it is an uncomfortable, restless, almost nauseous feeling (I hesitate to say painful) that reminds me almost of restless legs syndrome in its ability to defy description. The feeling goes away instantly when I urinate. The feeling is enough to wake me at night and has the unfortunate side effect of making me grind my teeth in my sleep because of the discomfort. I cannot control it by controlling my fluid intake (or caffeine intake) - it simply alters the amount of urine I void - not the number of occurrences.   I have had a bladder distention test done with ultrasound and the nurse told me that there was nothing unusual in shape and my bladder had voided correctly. I have had numerous diabetes tests, and had a full urine & blood screening. I've had every useful diagnostic test except a cystoscopy, as far as I can see it.   My GP recently decided to treat me with duloxetine after I confirmed that I'm generally a fairly stressed person, guessing that the drug might calm the muscle in my bladder down a little. I had horrible side effects on this drug and had to come off after 7 days - I could do nothing but nap all day, had no appetite, could not concentrate on any task, had no sex drive, and had a depressive episode on one of the days. After reading about the drug, I feel as if he shouldn't have prescribed it to me in the first place. He was annoyed that I had quit, even though I told him I couldn't do any work all week. I would be willing to try the drug again if I could get some second opinions, but I feel really scared about the long-term side effects of this drug.   I guess then I have two questions:  1) Given that the drug used is banned in the US for this purpose (according to a source I have read), what would be your opinion of using it again and simply \"waiting out\" the initial side effects to see if they improve?  2) Do my symptoms sound familiar or suggestive of any particular conditions such as interstitial cystitis?   Obviously, this undiagnosed issue is a problem for me as it interrupts my REM sleep. I'm tired a lot of the time during the day. I have had one full-night's sleep in the past five years that I remember.   Many many thanks for any insight you can share - I am very grateful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There is one particular characteristic feature in your description of your symptom that does not favor a diagnosis of interstitial cystitis. You said- \"The problem only ever occurs when I am in a lying-down position\".  There is only one condition(that i can recall) that is known to give rise to such a symptom- \"trigonitis\". Believed to be more common in women and estrogenic influence is suspected to be a factor in the etiology. This condition can occur in males as well.  Can be  - idiopathic, - due to indwelling catherters or other indwelling devices, - urinary bladder calculi,or - in endemic places, due to Schistosoma haematobium infection.  In the supine position, the trigone lies inferiorly and gets irritated and therefore, the affected person complains of urge to void in this position only.  Although it is called \"trigonitis\", suggesting an inflammation, it is not. It is a squamous metaplasia of the trigone. Therfore,a more appropriate name has been proposed - \"trigonal nonkeratinizing squamous metaplasia\".  Diagnosis is based on cystoscopic findings and biopsy of the trigone.  Duloxetine has numerous very distressing and serious side effects. I do not think you would be benefited by using this drug. Rather you should consult a urologist and discuss the possibility of trigonitis and get fully investigated.  If you happen to be from an endemic area for Schistosoma haematobium infection, this must be excluded. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The most important thing to be excluded in your case is a urinary tract infection (UTI). I am not certain whether the candida that had shown up in your urine is a true candidial infection or just a contamination or colonization.  Candidial UTIs occur generally in the presence of certain risk factors such as, - indwelling urinary catheters,nephrostomy tubes, other permanent indwelling devices, and stents. - immunocompromised individuals (diabetes mellitus, malignancies, AIDS, chemotherapy, immunosuppressants, or organ transplants), - antibiotic therapy, - patients on parenteral nutrition, - urinary tract obstructions, - etc.  Candidial urethritis also may cause similar complaints. This is secondary to candidial vulvovaginitis.  Therefore, what you first need is perhaps a repeat culture of a clean catch mid-stream sample of your urine. Discuss with your family doctor who will be better placed to examine you, to look for the risk factors and then decide appropriately. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnant and positive urine test for alcohol but not drinkin",
    "content": "Hi, A small proportion individuals from time to time, since long have continued to voice their misgivings about the urinary alcohol testing, alleging that the postitivity in their cases was an error(false positives)- the so-called \"innocent positives\".  The standard law enforcement practice is to take two samples, at 30-minute intervals, the latter sample preferably after emptying the urinary bladder.  Three  laboratory methods have been in common use:   - chemical tests;  - biochemical tests; and   - gas chromatography.   Gas chromatography is perhaps the most widely used because it can distinguish alcohol from substances such as ketones and aldehydes (a problem that exists with diabetics, starvation, anorexia, and a host of other situations)   EtG (ethyl glucuronide) test was introduced around 2004 Etg may be detected in urine up to 80 hours(about 4 times longer than alcohol). This seemingly wider window of detection made EtG an instant favourite for urinary alcohol testing. Concerns about this test also surfaced soon thereafter.  Some of the factors that may affect the accuracy of this test are, - Exposure of the urine samples to air: not only contributes to putrefaction of alcohol samples but generates oxidizable organic substances that may cause false positivity. - yeast or other bacterial infections: Yeast and bacteria produce ethanol as a biproduct while acting on sugars, which may result in false positivities. - laboratary- related factors: such as the quality and shelf life of the reagents,method of sterilization of the related instruments etc).  I hope this information is helpful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

After urinating, I remove the tampon and it is soaked 3/4 of the way from the top all the way down.  This happens every time I urinate.  There is no leakage from the urethra after urinating.  In the past, I have always had a weak bladder, meaning I can't hold my urine very long or I will leak.  This I have had all my life.  I went to a urologist, I had a CT scan, voiding cystogarm and a blue dye test including a cystoscopy.  The doctor saw nothing unusal.  He told me I have incontinence and he will be placing me on medicine to control it.  If I have incontinence, how is urine getting into my vagina while urinating?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it called incontinence if urine comes out of vagina?",
    "content": "Hi, Your history strongly suggests a fistulation between the genital and urinary tracts.It is possible that you may have a vesicovaginal or even more so, a urethrovaginal fistula. Symptomatology in this condition depends upon location.  A vesicovaginal fistula certainly causes incontinence of urine.   Urthrovaginal fistulae  close to the bladder neck are often associated with incontinence. Inspection will usually identify a large fistula, whereas urethroscopy, cystoscopy and vaginoscopy may be needed to detect a smaller one. It is important to rule out an associated an vesicovaginal fistula in these cases.  A detailed pelvic examination usually reveals clear fluid pooling at the apex of the vagina. On close inspection, a pinpoint opening at the vaginal apex is often seen in mature fistulas. In immature fistulae, an inflamed erythematous vaginal mucosa is often visible, with pinkish granulation tissue surrounding the fistulous tract. The fistulous opening is often difficult to identify in immature fistulas. In certain situations, pelvic examination under general anesthesia may be indicated.  Like any investigatory modality in medicine, false positives and false negatives do continue to occur from time to time. It is possible that in your case, a false negative situation might have occurred.  So, a detailed gynecological examination apart from a review by the urologist is probably indicated under the circumstances. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning, I\u2019ll try and be as detailed as I can on this mystery. I would go to the doctors about it but I recently had an ER visit, CT scans, colonoscopy (To do with Acute Diverticulitis and I\u2019m just out or patience and money.)  I will break down into; what\u2019s going on, and how / when it happened.  Every morning I wake up feeling fine but as the day wears on, I often feel a dull ache in the pelvic floor area (between the wind and the rain). This ache can become painful and if I\u2019m on my feet long enough, it hurts to stand still. Eventually by the evening, it can hurt to cough, sneeze, laugh, or even pass gas. The pain spreads from the pelvic floor area into the area that joins to my thighs, around the inner hip bones where the thigh meets the pelvic floor and rectum. A hot bath rewinds the clock so it\u2019s a lot less painful (I can cough again). After a nights sleep, everything is reset again.  I first noticed this problem a few weeks back and maybe double whammed myself. I occasionally indulge in some personally activities (ahem) and I think I gave myself a real bad case of blue balls. It felt like cramp in the whole area and took a few seconds to pass. The following day I played 45 minutes of soccer in bare feet on a pot holed filled field. I haven\u2019t played soccer like that in 20 years (I\u2019m 40). So I feel I may have a groin strain / blue ball cramp combo. Groin strain is really common in soccer and hockey apparently.    I noticed last night last I appear to have 2 tender spots that are on the inside thigh, on the bones. The bones themselves don\u2019t hurt but when I push on them, the muscle between my fingers and the bones are painful. I checked again this morning after everything had returned to normal and they still hurt a little. That might be because I pushed on them for an hour last night and probably made them worse.  I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a hernia because I can\u2019t feel any obvious lumps, especially when I cough. If I get an erection, the whole shaft has a dull ache, from my rectum area, especially the pelvic floor and even my penis. The pain I feel is worse the day following some self activity(ahem). Two weeks again I had a colonoscopy so I\u2019m sure they checked out my prostrate while they were in there so I doubt its that either. Other than that. It doesn\u2019t hurt when I pushed on the pelvic floor, my testicles don\u2019t hurt at all, I do feel some tenderness in the soft spot right next to my anus when things are at the worst oh and my blood work from 6 weeks ago came back perfectly normal.  Any ideas what it could be? Thanks for reading my life story.\n\n",

    "content": "How can someone tell if they have a pelvic floor dyfunction rather than interstitial cystitis? I recently had two UTI's (I'm a female) and before the first I realized that I was leaking urine all over. I had to lean to one side on the toilet to get it all out. I'm 20 years old and I found that very odd to have incontinence. So I realized how to get it all out so there would not be as much leakage after I urinated. I went to the doctor, it turned out I had a bladder infection. I got antibiotics, afterwards I thought that I lost the feeling of having to urinate as in I did not feel any urges. Later, I developed a mild pain all around my pubic bone. I later went and had another infection. I realized I had been wiping the wrong way despite hearing it over and over again the correct way to wipe. Got antibiotics and never felt like I got better at all. Still urges and some pressure. I do not have any infections right now. But I still have light leakage which happens if I lay on my side, sometimes when I am just sitting in the car. This is everyday. The last couple of days I have had a pretty much constant urge that stays after I have just gone to the restroom. I'm thinking it must be PFD. I read somewhere this might be the problem. I think it stems from going to public restrooms and always squating over the toilet to urinate. Sometimes I feel a slight burning where my bladder is. Never any blood in urine or when urinating. Some pain near pubic bone and down below, vulva area. I also noticed I cannot get a really strong stream and I always seem to urinate the same amount. I have the urge to urinate all day and night. I feel as if I have more urine that needs to come out. What do you think it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  There are a number of conditions that cause urinary frequency. I will try and give you some details of some of them so that it may help you to discriminate.   a) Urinary tract infections: Dipstick test is the generally accepted screening test for UTI. But, Mycoplasma and ureaplasma are not always picked up on standard dip test screens.  Although, UTIs are generally diagnosed by urinary cultures,sometimes it is probable that the organism that is causing the infection may be grown in smaller numbers (Low-count bacteriuria) and thus dismissed as a contaminant!  As you are a young woman, it may be worth remembering that Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young and middle-aged women(next only to E.Coli).Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus associated primarily with community-acquired lower urinary tract infection (UTI).  b) One may also need to keep in mind the possibility of the Traumatic cystitis(due to sexual intercourse).  c) 'Overactive bladder' is not uncommon in women. The cause is unknown. It causes bladder contractions that occur on their own without the stimulation of an actually full bladder. Most of the time one has urgency symptoms but not too much of pain. Nocturnal frequency is common but the frequency is less compared to interstitial cystitis. Urinary cultures are usually negative.  d) Bowel spasticity or Ovarian cysts are known to cause a feeling of bladder fullness and urgency.  e) Urethral syndrome can cause a urethral urgency ,but, the sensation of full bladder may be notably lacking.  In your case, 'Overactive bladder' appears to be the more likely diagnosis, perhaps made worse by anxiousness or a UTI. Consult a urologist, discuss the various possibilities and get fully investigated.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend went to the ER early May complaining of discomfort in his left back area, and the discomfort was accompanied by nausea, and vomiting.  Upon a CT scan, they found a solid mass on the upper pole of his left kidney about 4.1\" by 2.3\" His blood pressure was very high as well between 160-170 over 90-105  They sent him home and told him to follow up with a urologist. Being that he is on unemployment, his insurance had ran out, and we do not have money to see one.  Scared, we went to another hospital who admitted him. Upon doing a contrast enhanced CT scan they saw the mass was hemorrhaging so they couldn't say whether it had a neoplastic component to it or not. They stabilized his blood pressure, pumped him full of antibiotics and fluids, and released him with blood pressure medicine.  In the last month and a half, the discomfort has not returned nor the nausea/vomiting, but he has had headaches here and there. Also, no blood in the urine that he can see. He says he feels fine, but we are still scared obviously and want to know best/worst case scenario until we can afford to see a urologist.   Any advice/suggestions would be extremely helpful, and much appreciated.  Quick history: He was diagnosed with a bundle branch block in 2004, other than that he has no health problems. He is a african american 31 year old male, weighs about 270 pounds and stand about 6'1 in height.  No family history of cancer/heart disease/diabetes anything like that to his knowledge.  Thanks so much, and I look forward to your replies.  A concerned girlfriend\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hemorrhaging solid mass on upper pole of left kidney",
    "content": "Hi, Your boyfriend, a young African-American male, apparently has a recently discovered upper pole left renal mass and a chance discovery of hypertension. He apparently was asymptomatic prior to this episode.His electro-cardiogram in 2004 (at the age of approximately 25 yrs) allegedly had shown features of right bundle branch block(RBBB). Why the ECG was performed is unclear.  Hypertension, is a common condition. It is more common among African Americans than among other ethnic groups in the United States.Your boyfriend has what could be termed as \"secondary\" hypertension.There are a number of causes for this including fibromuscular dysplasia and other stenotic lesions or the renal arteries, pheochromocytomas etc. Bundle branch blocks(right and left) can occur in patients with pheochromocytomas.  Pheochromocytomas occur in people of all races, less frequently in  African-Americans.The hypertension in pheochromocytomas may at times be episodic. Mean age at diagnosis is about 40 years. Mean age at diagnosis is approximately 15 years lower in patients with inherited syndromes compared with those with sporadic tumors.Slightly more common in the right adrenal gland.  Renal masses are usually do not of prominently figure in the investigation of hypertension. There is no common correlation between renal masses and hypertension.Very rarely a Pheochromocytoma can be mistaken for an upper pole renal mass. But, this happening is extremely rare nowadays, with the advent of spiral CT & MRI.  If the lesion in your boyfriend's kidney is indeed a renal mass (after excluding the more common causes of secondary hypertension), one should consider the rare renal masses that can cause hypertension.   One such is a juxtaglomerular cell tumor (JCT), a rare, renin-secreting tumor of the kidney which can cause hypertension. JCT is histopathologically benign, and resection of the tumor is curative for hypertension. As in majority of cases, a final accurate diagnosis of this is only possible following surgery, this tumor should be considered & treated as a malignant solid renal mass. Treatment includes radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy, depending on the size and location of the tumor.  I hope this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

He has always been healthy and had no health problems except for the RBBB which doesn't cause him any problems.    Question: Are you saying that the ONLY way to discover what this mass truly is, is to either remove it or would another contrast enhanced CT scan be able to show if it is cancerous or not?  Also, lately he's fatigued more, and having headaches. He also has stated that upon walking for more than a few minutes, he can actually feel something pushing on his left side of the back. Like a pressure. It's never been a pain, more like a discomfort, and only recently saying he can feel something back there.  Thanks again for the quick reply, and I look forward to your response.

    "title": "Re: Enlargened Kidneys",
    "content": "Hi,  Renal \"enlargement\" is a rather vague term. It may imply just an increase in the size due to any reason (increase in the renal parenchyma, dilatation of the pelvi-calyceal system or both). Or, it may mean, as it generally does, renal hypertrophy (commonly 'compensatory' hypertrophy).   Renal enlargement (almost always renal hypertrophy) can be - focal (when a part of a kidney hypertrophies to compensate for disease in the rest of the kidney), or - uniform.  It can also be  - unilateral or - bilateral.  It can also be  - microscopic (mostly noted in experimental situations) or - macroscopic.  When the work load presented of an organ increases, the normal physiological response is to increase its function. To compensate for increases in work load, some organs respond  by an increase in the number of their functioning units. For example, in the case of the breast during lactation, new acini develop, and in a like fashion, chronic hypoxia induces an increase in the number of erythrocytes.   In some organs, there is a predetermined limit to the total number of functioning units. For example, in the kidneys and lungs, the number of nephrons and alveoli is set early in life, and the number of functional units can't increase (irrespective of the demands). Similarly situation is seen in the heart and skeletal muscles. The inability to initiate functional unit regeneration \u201cforces\u201d these organs to hypertrophy (to increase the physical size of their units to increase their work capacity).   What exactly is the signal for initiation of hypertrophy is not clear. In the heart it is thought to be a \"pressure-overload\" hypertrophy.In the kidneys, a similar situation may exist- increased glomerular hydrostatic pressures (Glomerular hyperfiltration). Compensatory renal hypertrophy primarily involves the proximal tubules.  In the clinical situation, renal hypertrophy that is frequently encountered is \"compensatory renal hypertrophy\", which is usually unilateral (congenital absence of a kidney, removal of a kidney or diffuse disease affecting one kidney) resulting in compensatory  hypertrophy in the remaining kidney.  Some of the oher causes mentioned in the literature are - hyperglycemic-dependent renal hypertrophy in diabetics (bilateral), - renal hypertrophy induced by hyperthyroidism, & - potassium deficiency causing renal hypertrophy in experimental animals.

    "content": "hi, Im 24 year old male. About a year back or so the frequency of urination was increased alot. The color of urine remained white. I didnt checked this problem with any doctor cause i thought that too much intake of liquids is causing it. I usually take about 10 to 12 glasses of water a day. For the past 5 months the frequency of my urine suddenly decreased alot even thought i was drinking same amount of water and there was pain in the kidneys. I checked with the doctor and my kidneys were performing good, bladder and blood reports were ok too. Doctor put me on ZALAIM medicine for about 2 months. After that my urine was back to normal but i am again facing this lack of urine output problem now a  days. Docotor checked with CATHERAL to see any blockage but there was none, now i am taking TAMSOLIN medicine for about a month and still there is no improvment. My bladder is getting full but i am unable to urinate except for few drops. Sometime at night it gets better. Also i have pain in kidneys due to back pressure. Any suggestions what can be the possible cause for it??  Thanks in advance\n\n",

Your symptoms certainly need a thorough evaluation by a urologist as well as a neurologist.  One of the rare causes one may need to consider in your case is a \"tethered cord syndrome\", a  condition in which the tip of the sacral part of the spinal cord is stuck in the region of the sacrum and is unable to stretch with growth.This can result in urinary bladder dysfunction.  One of the reported, lesser known side effects of Tamsulosin is increased frequency of urination. Best wishes!\n\n",

The doctor had/has prescribed antiobitotics couple of times and now they don't want to give her any medicine anymore.  She is waiting to get the Urologist appt but its taking time here in Canada.  Kindly, tell me what is wrong with her, she doesnt feel any burining when she pee, but she has gotten weaker because blood is still coming and her family physician doesn't know what to do.  I will wait for your reply.  Thanks for reading.  Zara\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There can be numerous conditions that cause hematuria. The overriding concern in her age group is a urothelial malignancy.  Hematuria can be - microscopic or  - macroscopic(gross).  Microscopic hematuria generally is from upper urinary tract & macroscopic hematuria from the lower urinary tract (but, not always).  - Women are more affected than men because, urinary tract infections (UTIs) are more common in them. - In the older adults, especially men, hematuria occurs more often than younger men as they are more likely to take medications that can harm the urinary tract (heparin, aspirin, cyclophosphamide etc) , have prostatic enlargement or cancer. - The most common causes in people < 40 years of age are kidney stones or urinary tract infections. - Although these may also cause hematuria in the older people (> 40 years of age), cancers of the kidney, urinary bladder, & prostate cause more concern.  Your grand mother needs an urgent consultation with a urologist. She also may need a gynecological examination. I am sure you can discuss the options with your family doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 52 year old man. Yesterday morning I had a shower, dried myself off and then went over to the washbasin to clean my teeth. When I looked in the bathroom mirror I saw blood pouring down my legs. After I mopped myself off I saw that it was coming from my left testicle sack, but I couldn't see a cut or understand how I could have cut myself there anyway. The bleeding continued for about 15 minutes, but I eventually managed to get it to stop and covered up the area where it seemed to be coming from with a plaster. It didn't hurt or anything, just lots of blood. I haven't had any pain in my testicles but sometimes the skin on my perineum gets a bit sore after my exercise routine (45 minute walks). I was a bit nervous in the shower this morning, but it didn't happen again.  Is this something to worry about? I've made an appointment for tomorrow evening with my doctor, but am I panicking over nothing?\n\n",

'Sponteneous', profuse and at times life-threatening  bleeding from superficial varicose veins occasionally occurs in cases of varicose veins in the lower limbs.Similar situation is in theory possible but, case reports are lacking.  However, Arteriovenous malformation (AVM) of the scrotum have been reported.To my knowledge, they been reported about 10 times in the medical literature so far.These can bleed profusely. May be easily missed easily especially if located at the back of the scrotum.  Other possibilities to be considered are, -  a pyogenic granulomas which can arise at sites of minor skin trauma. These can bleed as well. - vascular nevi & - malignant skin tumors(melanomas and others).  You must consult a dermatologist to have this sorted out. Best wishes!\n\n",

I was referred to a urologist, and had urodynamics and a CT so far (cystoscopy/consultation to follow in a week).  The tech who did the urodynamics said I had about 8 oz of urine that I didn't empty...  How come the ultrasound showed I was able to and the urodynamics showed something else?    I also have traces of protein in urine, slightly elevated white blood cell count, and occasional pain in my pelvic area as well.  I also have recently been treated for a urinary infection.  I have had kidney/bladder problems since birth, and a few years ago I had kidney or bladder stones, but was nauseous and very sick then, with no problems controlling urine.  I'm wondering if it is the same thing this time, and is incontinence related to it, or is it a separate issue?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hematuria, Hydronephrosis, and incontinence",
    "content": "HI, There are 2 methods for estimating post-void residual (PVR) urine volume:  - urethral In-and-out catheterization after asking the patient to void and  - bladder ultrasound.   Urinary bladder scanning using portable ultrasound scanners is routinely used to assess urinary retention and incontinence because, it is noninvasive and there is no risk of injury or discomfort to the patient. Bladder emptying is assessed by measuring the presence of residual urine in the bladder immediately after voiding (post-void residual is the amount of urine left in the bladder within 10-15 minutes after voiding).  A PVR volume of less than 50 mL is considered adequate bladder emptying. In the elderly males, between 50 and 100 mL is considered normal. In general, a PVR volume >200 mL is considered abnormal and could be due to incomplete bladder emptying or bladder outlet obstruction.  One study came to the following concusion: \"When using a portable ultrasound bladder scanner to assess the PVR urine volume, health care professionals should be aware of the possibility of a falsely elevated PVR. Any difference or discrepancy between the results of the bladder scanner and the in-and-out catheter should alert the health care professional to look for cystic and pelvic pathology, which can present as falsely high PVR volumes\". ( http://www.cfp.ca/cgi/content/full/55/2/163 ).  Therefore one must be aware of the possibility of falsely elevated postvoid residual volumes during ultrasonographic evaluation.  Studies in pediatric cases have shown that the time lag between the ultrasound measurement and the actual urine volume measurement following catheterization is one of the major sources of error in evaluation of the bladder urine volumes, especially for small volumes. If the interval is long,falsely raised PVR volumes will inevitably result. (http://www.nature.com/ki/journal/v55/n/ ... 0762a.html)  I hope this answers some of the points you have raised.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "penis pain- recurring now sharper",
    "content": "Hi,    I'm a 59 year old man, who has been monogamous for 9 years with the same woman.   About 8 years ago, I had a sharp pain while having sex (mission position, nothing abnormal).  I saw a urologist who recommended not having sex for 2 weeks, and taking 800 mg of vitamin E.  It mostly cleared up, but ever since then, anytime we have a lot of sex, or anything vigorous the pain returns.  One thing that will usually always cause it to occur is trying to have sex while not fully erect.  It usually takes a couple weeks to recover.  I've also noted that my penis now curves right instead of being straight when erect.  It has been harder to maintain an erection because it hits a painful spot  and goes away.  My PCP suggested I might have Peyronie's disease.  After having sex a couple times last weekend, I became sore again.  My penis was sore on the right side (usual spot), near the tip, and a little under the base.  The pain could be described as dull, aching, and occasionally sharp.  This morning I woke up with an erection, and very sharp pain at the bottom and sides of the base of my penis.  Dipstick U/A was normal, no signs of lumps or discoloration.  I called my urologist for an appointment, and he had no openings for a month.  My questions would be: 1.  Any suggestions on what might be going on?  and 2.  Would you suggest I try to get in to see a urologist sooner, or exercise watchful waiting for a month.  Thanks for any help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: penis pain- recurring now sharper",
    "content": "Hi, Your history indeed suggests Peyronie's disease as a strong possibility.  Peyronie's disease is believed to be a connective tissue disorder of the penis mostly associated with penile curvature and, in some cases, pain.   It primarily affects men between 45 and 60 years of age.Penile curvature may not be seen in some cases.Some present with just localized depressed areas over the shaft of the penis. About 30-50% of cases have other stigmata of connective tissue disorders such as Ledderhose's disease (fibrosis of the plantar fascia) or Dupuytren's contracture (fibrosis of the palmar fascia). Trauma is believed to play a some role in the genesis of this condition.  Management: non-surgical & surgical. Non-surgical means has been found to be useful in some patients with early disease(in the first 6-12 months of diagnosis while the plaque is still immature).   After this period, surgical option assumes the main role as the plaque becomes mature As your problem started about 8 years back (if indeed the diagnosis is certain),one month of waiting should not cause too much worry. On the other hand, if the diagnosis was not firm, then you should see a urologist earlier. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "A few months ago I was treated for a UTI. I awoke up one morning & went to the toilet while urinating I sneezed while in full flow, straight after this i received a sharp pain on the tip of my penis and then started to bleed ,not much just a few drops each time & when i finished urinating for approx 4 times after this. I went & seen my doctor, he treated me for a UTI it cleared up after approx 1 week. Just the other night while I was out socialising I was in the toilet urinating I coughed & again I received a pain on the tip of my penis then started to bleed. I went to my doctors the next day with a urine sample he dipped/tested the sample it was clear no blood or protein. What was confusing as only a few hours before i went to see him I had visual blood in my urine not much but a drop after I urinated. This is making me think that it may not be a UTI. I find when I drink a lot of water I have no pain while urinating but when my urine is a dark yellow colour I have pain. The pain is on the entrance to my urethra (top of penis) What do you think this could be?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain at entrance to urethra!",
    "content": "Hi, Pain at the tip of the penis(at the external urethral meatus) can be due to - a local pathology (ex; urethral caruncle), or - referred pain (esp from a pathology of the seminal vesicles).  Some of the possibilities are - neoplasms of the urinary tract - A-V malformations of the urinary tract, - pelvic  A-V malformations, - urethral caruncles( only few reported cases in males), - fibro-epithelial urethral polyps (mostly in males during the first decade of life) etc.   A-V malformations of the urinary tract can be aquired(more common) & congenital(rare). Congenital renal AVMs can result in significant bleeding.Congenital renal AVMs  usually present in the 3rd or 4th decade of life.Women are affected more often as men(3:1).    Pelvic  A-V malformations involving seminal vesicles have been reported.These also can present with severe urethral bleeding.  Urethral caruncles can present with pain in the distal urethra, prolapse of mucosa or occasionally bleeding.Very few cases have been reported in males.  In your case, it is better to exclude these possibilities - especially, the A-V malformations. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Unfortunately, there are no randomized double blind trials in the literature to address this issue. During the commonly performed various 'mesh' based repairs of inguinal hernias,surgeons take great care to 'fix' the mesh in its place to prevent migration of the mesh (arguments for and against fixing the mesh exist).   Following the procedure, the fibroblasts and vascular endothelial cells grow through the pores in the mesh, lay down collagen and fibrous tissue - thereby incorporating the mesh in the body.  Various standard instructions regarding avoidance of straining etc, are meant to  - avoid needless pain, - avoid excessive stresses due to contraction of the muscles of the abdominal wall where the mesh rests,& - to avoid increases in the intra-abdominal pressure that tend to push the mesh forward.  These were more relevent in the by-gone era when \"tension\" repairs were in use. Now most surgeons use \"tension-free\" mesh repairs.  Till such time that some concrete evidence emerges regarding this matter, it is better to follow the advise of your surgeon. Best wishes!\n\n",

He said it caused no problems or complications but after reading up I'm not sure about that. I have constant occuring pain and cannot hold my urine and if I have to I cry in pain, I cannot get any answers out of any of my doctors and am unsure what I should  do to stop the pain stones infections and complications ?

    "title": "Re: Complications with horseshoe kidney?",
    "content": "Hi, Increased risk for certain problems is associated with horse shoe kidneys: - Obstruction.  - Urinary tract Infections (associated with vesico-ureteric reflux)  - Renal Stones  - Renal malignant tumors: increased risk of carcinoid tumors, transitional cell carcinomas, Wilms' tumor & sarcomas.  Ureteropelvic junction (UPJ) obstruction is perhaps the most usual associated finding in horseshoe kidney. A majority of the symptoms in individuals with horseshoe kidneys is caused by this.  UPJ obstruction is usually caused by certain anatomical factors such as  - the high insertion of the ureter into the renal pelvis,or - the crossing of the ureter over the isthmus to gain attachment to the renal pelvis.  20-60%. of cases may develop stone disease. UPJ obstruction , the resultant urinary stasis & super-added UTI predispose to the development of stones. The abnormal orientation of the calyces also affects urinary drainage, thus contributing to the increased risk of stone formation.Dilated or abnormal pelvi-calyceal system is usually seen on imaging studies, but not all of them indicate obstruction. Nonobstructive dilatation must be distinguished from obstructive dilatation using diuresis radioisotope renal scans.  Stones, urinary stasis, vesicoureteral reflux - all of these contribute to urinary tract infections.  As general & metabolic factors also play a part in stone formation just as in individuals without horseshoe kidneys, folowing general guidelines should be followed. - must drink plenty of liquids (enough to put out over 2000 ml of urine/day - for adults) - metabolic factors should be excluded(Metabolic evaluation) & - any suspicion of UTI should lead to prompt investigation and treatment.  Horseshoe kidney poses special chalanges to the urologists for open/laparoscopic/or endoscopic management of stones, because of the shape and skewed orientation of the pelvi-calyceal system and high location of the pelvi-ureteric junction.  Considering your symptoms, one needs to exclude any pathology in the lower urinary tract as well.A urine culture is also indicated.You may follow up with your urologist who will be able to assess you better. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 46 year old male new to this website and am looking for more advice.  I saw my Urologist today for a follow-up from last week when I went in due to the epidydimus on my right testicle being inflamed.  He didn't think it was inflamed much and didn't find anything on my testicle during his exam.  As a precaution, he went ahead and sent me for an ultrasound.  The imaging report indicated that there appeared to be a bb-sized mass inside the testicle.  He doesn't want me to do anything but a self examination once a month for the next three months and then go back for another ultrasound.  Is this sound advice?  If this is a cancer, isn't there some other way to find out sooner rather than wait around for it to grow or possibly spread?  Thanks for your help.  I am very worried.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ultrasound Shows BB-Sized Mass In Testicle",
    "content": "Hi, High orchidectomy (radical orchidectomy) has remained the preferred treatment option for testicular masses.  With the increasing use of high-frequency scrotal ultrasonography in assessment of male infertility, non-palpable, small, incidentally discovered testicular lesions is on the increase.What is the best way of dealing with them has remained controversial.  There have been studies in which  small incidental non-palpable testicular masses were safely followed with serial ultrasound and did not show significant increase in growth warranting surgery.  Especially, non-palpable testicular masses less than 1 cm on ultrasound seemed to be amenable to ultrasound surveillance supplemented by clinical monitoring. Surgery is advised if the patient cannot continue surveillance, or if the lesion  shows rapid growth consistent with a malignancy, or if tumor markers are positive.  This method is not widely practiced but, is an option that is undergoing trials & surveillance seems to show initial promise as a viable option.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Squeeze penis hard while urinating",
    "content": "Hi, If the squeeze pressure was high enough, it may be assumed that it could have caused localized trauma to the penile urethra. Also, if you had continued to void (and strained - perhaps yelled due to pain) at that point, excessive pressures could have built up inside the urethra and caused a minor tear of the urethral lining. The other possibility to be considered is that it may not be actually related to this incident (coincidental).  As it is not clear from the history provided as to when this incident took place & if the problem is persisting or otherwise, i feel that you should consult a urologist who, after examining you, may in all probability, advise certain tests (urinalysis, urinary cultures,STD screen) to begin with. Urethroscopy and cystoscopy may also be required. Best wishes!\n\n",

A couple of days later,after returning home from a busy workweek,I noticed a swollen band or ridge just below the head,on the top/right side. It does not cause pain at any time. It looks slightly puffy while flacid,and becomes a firm ridge while erect.Slightly bumpy under the skin. Similar in texture to gristle on steak. About an inch long x 1/4\" wide.  No discoloration. I am circumsized. Erection and other sexual functions are unaffected. Though it feels very abnormal to the hand. It has been about two weeks without change,now.

The other differential diagnosis would be peyronie's which can again cause a rigid structure during erection.It is chronic and causes penile deviation.It is painful too during erection. The best course of action would be to get an ultrasound test to make sure. It is likely that it would settle in a few weeks and you should be fine.Do consult your doctor. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Weaker erections - damaged Corpus Spongiosum",
    "content": "I have been doing penis exercises since October 2007. I got my exercises from \"www.penishealth.com\". Since I started the exercises, I never had erections so hard ever in my life. My purpose for starting was solely to improve myself for my partner, I wanted to straighten my penis, because I have a natural downward curve and I also wanted to add some size to my penis. I got great erections, I gained 1-1.4cm in length, 0.5cm in girth, my veins became more prominent (popping out), because of the improved blood flow.  I did the exercises on and off since I started. I went from my beginner routine to the intermediate routine. The exercises involved me in warming up with a hot wrap to increase blood flow, then light stretches for 10sec in each direction, then applying lubrication on a semi-erect penis(70%), and stroking from base to glans(head) with \"ok\" sign(most famous exercise called \"Jelq\") and some other similar exercises, like flexing the pc muscle and combining some exercises together. One of the exercises need you to stroke from base to head with \"ok\" sign and firm grip and stop at the head while applying pressure at head, and flexing pc muscle to pump blood in. I applied a little more pressure than usual on that day despite I had a 2-3 month break and needed to start again very lightly. For the first few weeks I had very MINOR occasional pain (pins and needles in the head area), and some times while urinating.  I stopped exercising immediately, and took a break, the pain was long gone 2 weeks later or so, but I noticed a difference in my erections, they were weaker than before. The corpora spongiosum(bottom muscle/spongy tissue) of my penis stayed soft during erections and my corpora cavernosum stayed hard during erections. Basically my erections got weaker than before, my corpusa spongiosum stays very soft during erections and this has an effect on my corpora cavernosa(side muscles) they are softer than before. I get hard erections when I sit down, because the blood flow/circulation is better while sitting than other positions. If I stand my erection is softer, and cant last long, where as if I sit it is hard. My penis-head doesn't get inflated much, unless I'm close to ejaculation/climax. The spongy tissue/corpus spongiosum gets pumped with blood, but if I touch it its very soft. I also noticed that if I do my penis exercises, my erection gets very hard, but that gives me a temporary 'erection boost', and the real problem is not healed - Soft corpus spongiosum. I have given myself a lot of time to heal, 4 months and 2 weeks, but no changes have been made. I still have a soft corpus spongiosum, and I still get hard erections only while sitting. My erection during sex is good, but still weaker than before...my partner doesn't notice but I notice it, because I ejaculate faster, weaker erections due to corpus spongiosum. I also regenerate my sexual 'power' longer, up to 24 hours, where as before I was capable of having sex more than once a day. My penis in flaccid state is softer than before also. My condition is not psychological at all and I know it, but it does depress me because I have waited over 4 months, and no improvement. I assume I have a 'venous leak' inside my corpus spongiosum, is my assumption correct? Is this treatable naturally? I'm really disappointed, and stressed, I really want it to heal, and I am hoping for the best. I think I provided all details..  Oh, I'm 19 and I also have a natural downward curve, it is not a Peyronies disease, because I had my natural curve since birth. I can't really say precisely how severe the curve is, but if a straight line is 180 degrees, then my penis would be curved half way down the shaft downwards at about 15-25 degrees.)\n\n",

    "content": "I have the same condition, soft glans and corpus spongiosum, and significantly reduced occurrence of spontaneous erections. From very similar exercise as max018.   I have been to a urologist specialist in Hamburg, Germany. I believe he is one of the foremost experts in the world with regards to sexual medicine, and impotence. What he said was that there is no surgery that is highly probable to fix this condition. He also said that it is still not known exactly how the blood flow out of the corpus spongiosum is restricted. He believed that the condition is an issue with the locking mechanism (which is not known) that keeps the blood in the corpus spongiosum, while the flow into it is likely normal. What he proposed was some type of \"vein litigation\" on returning veins. This will reduce the outflow of blood. He said the operation had only a 30% success rate, as for most patients the veins would grow back, within 2-3 years. However the operation he considered very easy and with minimal risks.   I'm sorry not to bring better news, but that's the best I have found out. It would be interesting if you could discuss this with your urologist and report back on the response. But I do advice to contact the very very best on impotence, as this condition is not a very normal one, or easy to fix.  For me, I will request for this procedure very soon. Hopefully at least it will last for some years, and that it's possible to repeat it. But this can get costly..  It's really a hard decision to tell someone to cut your penis, but I guess just to litigate some veins is some of the simplest things they ever do on this part.\n\n",

When one does things not in line with nature (ex: laxative abuse resulting in what is known as a 'cathartic colon' - laxative dependence), one may more often than not, end up with troubles. Try giving rest to your mind & the organ under discussion for sometime. Concentrate your mind on some other activities, and hopefully you would notice improvement.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have this same exact problems, best wishes to you all, seeing how this thread is pretty old I hope that you all got the proper help for your problem. I however am suffering from this same situation. I suffered it during sex though, while having sex I bent my penis severely, there was no pain there or nothing, but I noticed a day or so after that my corpus spongious concaved inward, the top neck of it. Nothing was there like it disappeared, then I gave it a while and it seems like it kind of came back. After it being numb for weeks I started to get feeling back to it. But lately and every since this happened it's been hard to get erect, and theres no feeling when I masturbate, very little. Now my corpus spongiosum is very weak and when i do get erect it's a very weak one, I don't know if that was what was stopping me from getting any sensation from masturbation because of the blood flow or what. But now my corpus spongiosum is all messed up, at the top it feels like I can almost move it around like it's not attached to the rest of it, and it still isn't fully back.  So now I get no sexual pleasure, in fact I get very disatisfied after sex or after I masturbate. I get very annoyed and frustrated and I find it hard to get motivation to do anything after. My stress level is through the roof, and I'm very scared that I'm going to have to drag on for the rest of my life not being able to get this problem fixed. Now I have no active dopamines or serotonin in my brain because this is the only thing that released them for me. I also find things very hard to do now, and it feels like life is very hard and it feels like I can't make it through the day sometimes. Please help me with some information doc, I've been to 2 urologists and they just mock me saying that it's impossible for the corpus spongiosum to get weak and to take my mind off of it, anything for them not to deal with it. It's horrible and I have restless legs, I can't find any peace of mind or well-being, I can't enjoy anything now and it's hard for me to stay in one place, it's even hard for me to sleep. Not a day goes by that I don't contemplate killing myself over this. And it sounds so sad an embarassing at the same time but it's true. I need help, and I know you can't do much but provide me with information, but I need some type of diagnosis on what's going on, I can tell you that it happened by me bending it, hands down, I bent it right at the end of the corpus spongiosum, and im not embarassed to say that I would do it on purpose while having sex every time I would exit and enter and kind of bend it going in cause my gf liked it and it felt good to me too. So yes it is upsetting that I knowingly did this to myself but I had no clue that I was going to get a numb penis and ED disorder, not in a million years. And the urologist says the penis cannot be bent, but mine did all the time right at the end of the corpus spongiosum, and one day I kept doing it and that's what messed it up. I can tell you that its the corpus spongiosum and nothing else, its in very poor condition, and even when I do maintain an erection, litterally like 30 seconds later it's gone, its very wierd and scary.  Like I said doc, it's at the very top and the bottom where it seems very weak, almost like it's pinched at the bottom, at times it's also very hard for me to pee, and I get these wierd nerve feelings in my penis too when it's not erect like a tingle in a vein or something, I just messed it up doc, very bad, even if my ED was diagnosed I still fear that it will never help me get feeling back. Also when I pee I feel nothing, nothing in my urethra when I pee like it's completely numb, I can feel my bladder peeing it out but i don't feel anything theres no tingle there when peeing or nothing. I know the not getting erection problem is in my corpus, it's not like heart problems or anything, it's been like this every since I pinched it. So now I know to never abuse my penis again, but i just learned my lesson and I can't go back, it's so horrible. I have no enthusiasm or anything of the sort in me, I also get very agitated and stressed, and I can't concentrate or do anything of the sort. like i feel empty almost, I need this back into my life, what's a man supposed to do without masturbation. Please doc I'm sorry for writing so much, but please help me with some sort of information on what could have possibly happened to my penis and if it's surgically curable. Thankyou for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Im new here so im sorry if this is in the wrong spot.  ive had a herina/hydracycle for many many many years, theres a long story as to why but thats not apart of my question haha.. anywho..   Before surgery i did go get an ultra sound and they sead there were No tumers,   about 4 months ago i went in for herina/hydracycle repair, they made an inceason along my Lower adomanal area,  from what the doc told me after i woke up, My herina was the size of what a 60 year old man would have had, Im only  22....  i also had a hydracycle due to the size of the herina.  so when i went home, Out of crazyness i felt around down there gently and felt a wierd large lump on the tube thing thats on the testical that connects to the other tube that leads up into the body.. i was abit worryed But being i was just out of surgery did not think much of it so when the time came for my check up the doc felt around, and sead everything was lookin great just the inside had to heal more and that it could take up to 4 months for it to fully heal and swelling would go down..   well Now its been 4 or so months and that large ball has gotten smaller, Now its a smaller ball b ut its hard.. there is feeling to it if you give it a sl ight squeez..   I get no real pain from it, it does not really bug me.. most of the time i don't notice it unless im feeling down there..   i don't think its a tumer or anything i mean i underwent ultra sound a few days before my surgery and i was okay.. and it only appered after my surgery.. wassent there before.   there is no blood in the semon.. however i must conves a week and a half later of the surgery i kinda masterbated.. it hurt but i stopped after that, guess its a bad idea to have your girl friend do a tease to -help- you feel better >.> bad joke.. anyways that ball thing could not be from that could it?    i mean i feel alright and Once in a great while there is a dull pain when i masterbate B ut its not offen..  i always assumed its couse of the mesh inside couse of the herina repair..   ive been debating if i should see the doc at the end of the  month..  I tend to over worry so i figured id post on this..  sorry for spelling errors by the way. anyways am i over worrying? is this nothing major?  thank you for reading!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description, one would tend to infer that you perhaps had a fairly large indirect inguinal hernia which was repaired by an 'open' technique.  In the case of large sacs, they invariably extend into the scrotum(even upto the bottom of the scrotum).During repair, most surgeons would dissect the sac from the rest of the cord structures, devide the sac in the inguinal canal, and leave behind the distal part of the sac that goes into the scrotum. This is done to prevent excessive dissection and post- operative scrotal hematoma formation.  At times, fluid collects in the distal sac(which was left behind).This might have happened in your case, which you felt as a 'ball'.These usually regress with time. Sometimes they may persist as an hydrocele & may be dealt with at a later date. Best wishes!\n\n",

The thing is that there was no pain at all, it felt just like it normally does when I urinate.  Second I drank a ton of water in order to see if it would happen again and everytime I urinated after that it was clear and normal except for a red spect in the urine following the first problem.

    "title": "Can ultrasound detect small stones?",
    "content": "Hi,  I'm 28 years old male. About 6 weeks back, I had a mild fever and there was blood in the urine (it was visible- reddish brown in color). I went to a doctor and after doing a urine test, he gave me antibiotics for 10 days. The 'visible' blood in urine was there for only one day. 3 days later i felt a pain in my right flank. The pain remained for about 2 hours and vanished. But from that day onwards I felt a discomfort (kinda very mild pain) in my right flank when I do some physical work.  After 10 days i again felt a heavy pain in my right flank. This time too it remained for about 2 hours and vanished. But the discomfort in my right side continued. I tried to fix a appointment with a urologist and I got the appointment only after 1 week. I started drinking lot of water (6 to 7 litres of water daily) in the meantime and the discomfort in my right side gradually reduced and by the time I met the urologist I had no discomfort.   The urologist did a ultrasound test and told me that everything is fine. He also told me that the stone might have passed. But he asked me to do a CT scan for further examination which I could not do because the cost of the scan was unaffordable for me at that time and also because I felt that my problem was over.   last week (which is 2 weeks after I met the urologist) I again felt a mild pain in the right flank and the next day again there was that reddish brown urine. This time I also felt a constant urge to urinate and a mild burning sensation while urinating. I again started drinking lot of water and now its gone.   My questions are  -I read somewhere that ultrasound cannot detect small stones. is it true? if it is true, then is there a possibility that on the day the ultrasound was performed the stone may be small and now it might have got enlarged (in 15 days time) and creating problem ???  -is it something other than kidney stones to worry about?  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can ultrasound detect small stones?",
    "content": "Hi, There are some conditions that can cause pain similar to 'renal colic'(typically attributed to urinary stones). - blood clots(clot colic) - urinary sediment(crystalluria).  Although an ultrasound may miss very small stones, CT scans(helical CT) are capable of picking up stones of even 1mm size.  The history of your illness appears to suggest a fixed renal pain than a classical renal colic. As it had been constantly associated with hematuia and stone disease had not been demonstrated, one needs to entertain other differential diagnoses as well.  Your urologist may be the right person to plan the diagnostic appproach in your case.However, it is probable that you may need - a microscopic examination of the urinary sediment, - urinary culture/sensitivity testing & - an Helical CT to look for urolithiasis/tumors of the urothelium.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: UA's keep coming back diluted",
    "content": "Hi, As you are on parole, you are obliged to folow the instructions of the parole official. They have their own protocols which they have arrived at by trial and error.You don't seemingly have much of a choice in this.  There are many protocols for urine sample collection.One such, for example: \"The person to be tested will be given up to eight ounces of water, and will remain under staff supervision until the specimen is provided\" (you may confirm from the parole office directly as to their protocol).  A dilute specimen, by definition, is a urine specimen that has a creatinine value of less than 20 g/dl and a specific gravity of 1.003 or less. These 2 tests are routinely performed on every urine sample that is tested at the Lab. If the specimen satisfies these 2 criteria, it is reported as a \"Dilute specimen\". When a urine specimen is \"dilute\", it is possible that drugs in their system may not be detected.  If one specimen turns out to be 'dilute', another specimen may be collected as soon as possible with minimum advance notice, this will help prevent false negative results.  You need not be too concerned about becoming dehydrated if - you refrain from mountain climbing for a day or two prior to testing & - follow the local protocol. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Premature Ejaculation-Sensitivity on one side of the penis",
    "content": "I've read everything about PE and I'm sure you've heard everything about it. But I think my case is somewhat distinct and puzzling. Hope an expert can crack it or give some insight into its causes.   I am a sexually-active male in my early twenties who has been diagnosed with primary premature ejaculation. It has ended relationships, contributed to depression, and I think I have somewhat of a complex about it.   A urologist diagnosed me with primary premature ejaculation a few years ago and gave me SSRIs, which increased my latency time from 30 seconds to a minute. I stopped taking them because I didn't think the side-effects were worth the extra 30 seconds.   In fact, the best medication for my PE has been consuming excessive amounts of alcohol. With it, I can last about three minutes without ejaculating or having to pull out. Maybe. Rum is especially effective. For what it's worth, I find this panacea much more desirable than taking those bloody pills for my life. It makes me last longer, to boot. But, as you might guess, the amount of alcohol I'd have to consume to effectively combat my PE and at the same time keep up with the amount of good sex I'd like to have would be, in generous terms, a boon for whichever municipality is the beneficiary of the taxes from my liquor purchases and inevitable bonds and fines that would follow. I hear you can't have sex in jail. This all sounds normal for someone with primary PE, I suppose.  But I think my case is distinct because only the left side of my penis is sensitive. Primarily, my corpus cavernosum on my left side (the side of my left hand, to be specific) is acutely sensitive and stimulation of it leads to fast ejaculation. Meanwhile, the same spongy tissue on the right side doesn't receive the orgasmic pleasure of the left. It's actually somewhat dull and in only a few cases have I felt the same amount of pleasure there. My orgasms, as a result, are only felt on the left side of my penis and the glans. The excessive stimulation is primarily, but not only, near the glans, and there is a small bump where my frenulum would be that is especially sensitive. In fact, I think if the left side of my penis responded the same way as the right side, I would not be having this problem (and life in general would be markedly better; I'd be sober a lot more, too).  I have a few theories about the causes. Something could have gone wrong during the circumcision-which I had when I was a newborn and I have not consulted my parents about it. I am leaning towards this because I remember once I started masturbating, which was before I could produce ejaculate, I would focus on the corpus cavernosum on the left side near the glans because it felt especially pleasurable there. Perhaps an improper circumcision exposed a nerve? Or a set of nerves? Or maybe that part was just a little sensitive and I conditioned myself to orgasm from pleasuring it, thus causing PE...?  Theory two: after I started masturbating, when I was about 13 and still sexually developing, my penis got caught in my zipper right where that bump is. There was a small amount of blood and it hurt for a few days but I recovered. The only reason I have not ruled this mishap out as a cause of my PE is because that is where the most sensitive part of my penis is-where the zipper snagged it.  I should note that the urologist I visited thought that I might be \"wired differently down there,\" and that I would have to deal with my PE for life. I agree with him in part because, like my penis that is only sensitive on its left side, I think my central nervous system is also \"wired differently.\" I have had a propensity to overheat and vomit easily since I was a child, I am terribly ticklish, I have a propensity towards addiction, and I am easily distracted.   Anyway, I was just wondering whether any urologist on this board has heard of similar cases and might be able to point me in the right direction. Come hell or high water I'm getting this fixed.   As a postscript, I'd like to give a little barb at the urological research community (and you can edit out this, or other disagreeable aspects of my post, if you wish. I just want sound advice):  How about doing researching PE in the way of actually making connections about the causes of PE and mens' bodies and lifestyle? (Do men with a history of depression, ADD, or addiction, for instance, suffer from PE more than the general population? What about something as odd as being especially ticklish? Or having central nervous system problems? Or what about cut versus uncut men?). Men don't have PE because their parent's whipped them with a bible when they caught them jacking off as children. And, please, get out of the pockets of Big Pharma, and do some research that doesn't look for the solution to PE in a pill whose side-effect profile looks like a wish list whipped up by satin. Listen to men with PE. And get them to talk. The problem of PE is much more dynamic and complex than the research the urological community has been pushing--at least the research I can find.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,You are right in saying that more needs to be done for Premature ejaculation than it is today.While sidenafil has been a breakthrough in Erectile Dysfunction we are nowhere near such a drug here. While some studies are done to find out whether the problem of PE is peripheral or central, much needs to be done.You are indicating that external injury could have precipitated this problem.Research as of today indicates it is more central ie the brain centre chemisrty. Many a times you are normal but expectations are abnormal ie the partner takes longer time for satisfaction.Hypersensitivity of penile skin and performance anxiety seem the two factors. Serotonin is a chemical said to be involved in this process and antiserotonin agents seem to be effective. Relaxation techniques,meditation,stress management and pubococcygeal muscle training help a long way in recovery apart from the traditional Master and Johnson Squeeze technique. Best wishes.\n\n",

I've had one idea: I think I've trained myself to come early when I started to masturbate. Is there anyway I can condition my penis to be less sensitive and responsive to stimulation? I mean, I know about the Master's and Johnson technique, and I've tried it with myself on and off as well as with my partners. Not much has happened. I was almost thinking about depriving myself of orgasms for a while but still stimulate myself. I mean, not completely deprive, but maybe ejaculate once or twice per month while in the meantime stimulating my penis and training it to not respond as it does to stimulation. Do you think that would be an effective method?   And can you go into more what you were saying about premature ejaculation being a problem in brian chemistry? I know the whole explanation about serotonin. But is there anything else involved? Moreover, do you think the University of Cincinnati study concluding there is an ejaculatory mechanism in the spine (of rats, I believe) will be promising in the way of solving PE?  Thanks for your reply. Hope to hear back with some good information so that I, and I'm sure many others on this board, may try to constructively solve, or at the least deal with, this problem--one which has to be treated much more seriously than it is because it has negative impacts on the quality of health of those who have it (I know it's caused me to be suicidal). Besides, who doesn't want to please their partner like they want and deserve to be pleased?\n\n",

There about the size of the tip of the ultra fine tip sharpie markers, which is like a milimeter or 2 or maybe 3. But there not painful. Im just scared that something wrong. I used some types of body lotion a few times when I masterbated if that has anything to do with it. And my father dosen't have any thing wrong with his genitals as far as I know. And thats pretty much everything I can think of that has anything to do with the bumps appearing.  ohh I realized that the where there around 7 months ago and it seems like there more since then. They first started to appear on the back under rim of the head. and now there almost all the way around. There in groups of 5-8 and there sorta in lines but more like scattered lines. and the ones that are in the back of the head are in groups of 3 and 4 and there almost double the size of the other ones.   I don't know what to do about it. so if you know anything please tell me.   thank you. =]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, In the adults,  inability to maintain voiding control is virtually always considered to be pathological, in children with urinary incontinence, evaluation must include the  context of his or her developmental age.  Fine tuning of the voiding reflex and its voluntary control is heavily influenced by cultural, social, & environmental factors.  Etiologically,Childhood urinary incontinence can be classified as  - organic or  - functional.  Organic incontinence may further be classified as - structural or - neurogenic.  Functional incontinence: those in which no structural or neurologic abnormality can be demonstrated.  Any child/adolescent with urinary incontinence needs to be assessed by a full medical history & physical examination. Certain non-invasive or invasive studies may be indicated.  Urge incontinence(urge syndrome) is a type of functional incontinence which may be predominantly seen in girls and is frequently associated with other medical conditions, such as recurrent urinary tract infections, vesicoureteral reflux and constipation.  Your history is suggestive of a UTI(urinary tract infection), which may be causing or aggravating your problem. I feel that you should consult a urologist and get fully assessed. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can Cystoscopy w Bladder distention cause a miscarriage?",
    "content": "Hi, It was highly improper & risky to withhold information such as this from your doctor.  Risk of miscarriage following any procedure under anesthesia exists but exact Percentages of risk following bladder distension for IC is not available.You have not mentioned what kind of anesthesia was used.  One of the main concerns when operating on a pregnant woman is preterm labor. For this reason, pregnant women are generally advised to postpone any surgery(non-emergent) until the second or third trimester, preferably the third trimester. Neonatal mortality is about 90% at 25 weeks' gestation and reduces to less than 15% by week 30.  First trimester anesthesia exposure increases the risk of spontaneous abortion and lower birth weight. There is a view that this is more likely due to surgical manipulation and the condition that necessitates surgery than to the exposure to anesthetic agents.  Pentosan polysulfate sodium (Elmiron)- (class B-Fetal risk-U.S. Food and Drug Administration category:  not confirmed in human studies but has been shown in some animal studies). Because Elmiron has not been tested sufficiently in pregnant women, the manufacturer recommends that it is not to be used during pregnancy, except in the most severe cases.  Amitriptyline (Elavil)-- (class D-Fetal risk has been shown in humans); Recommended for use only if benefits outweigh risk to the fetus. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Theoretically the risk is both for yourself and others as well.  To you( or any person with an indewelling suprapubic catheter), because there is a chance that the water in the pool may enter your urinary bladder around the catheter and may cause a urinary tract infection.  For others using the pool, as a result of your urine contaminating the water in the pool.  Generally, one should wait for the first few weeks following surgery for the wound to heal fully (your surgeon will be the best person to decide about this).  Thereafter, one may swim in a public pool with certain precautions in place... - avoid drinking water immediately prior to the visit to the pool. - Drain all urine immediately prior to the visit to the pool, disconnect & securely block the tube. - some kind of a plug around the tube exit site would be useful (seek opinion from your doctor or specialist nurse).  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: PC muscle or pubococcygeus muscle",
    "content": "Hi, I don't clearly understand what you mean by 'flexing' the 'pubococcygeus' muscle.Is it that you try to voluntarily contract the pelvic floor(levator ani) muscles?  The muscle which primarily comes into play while stopping urination is really the 'Constrictor urethrae' muscle (a sphincter made of skeletal muscle) which is situated between the two layers of the 'urogenital diaphragm'. Ofcourse, the pubococcygeus muscle also may contract and partly contribute towards this. Pain felt at the tip of the penis is frequently due to inflammation of the seminal vesicles.This needs to be excluded in your case.If your problem persists, you should consult a urologist who would be able to assess you fully and arrive at a proper diagnosis. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 25 year old male. When I was born, I had a variety of complications, including only one kidney. I suffered greatly from repeated kidney infections, and so when I was two the decision was made to extend my urethra. My fiancee and I have now been trying for a baby for nearly two years, with no success, and retrograde ejaculation has been mentioned, due to my small amount of ejaculate. Could the surgery I had have caused this? If so, would it have caused nerve damage which could be treated with Sudafed etc, or actual bladder neck damage which can't be rectified? We want to know the likelihood of conceiving naturally without the need of ART. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It appears from your description that you had perhaps undergone 'urethral extension' as part of surgery for 'Hypospadias'  (congenitally displaced external urethral meatus).  Some of the common specific complications following this type of surgery include    - urethral stenosis,     - persistent chordee(curvature of the penile shaft),    - Fistulation: urinary leakage from the area around the urethral repair, &        - Bladder spasms.  Retrograde ejaculation is perhaps not a common complication but is a theoretical possibility.  You need a full urological assessment before specific answers could be offered. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hydrochlorothiazide for kidney stones",
    "content": "Hi, Hydrochlorothiazide is certainly one of the Photosensitizing medications.  Photosensitivity reactions may be broadly classified as ... - Phototoxic reactions,  - Photoallergic Reactions, & - UV recall reactions.  Hydrochlorothiazide primarily causes a Phototoxic reaction. It is known to precipitate  'Subacute Cutaneous Lupus Erythematosus'.  Generally Phototoxic reactions are more common than Photoallergic Reactions. Also, Phototoxic reactions usually need more of the offending drug to cause the reaction and tend to occur early (minutes to hours) following the exposure to the drug.  Not all people exposed to the drug develop the reaction.But,statistically, the chances are higher than that of Photoallergic Reactions.  While on any offending drug, one should take the necessary precautions against excessive exposure to sunlight. Photopatch testing is useful mainly in Photoallergic Reactions. Good luck!\n\n",

Do the veins die out after they have been ligated? If so, could this be what is causing me the pain? My doctor says to give it some time, but in 3 months everything should be ok. I have read many articles, where it is suggested that after 1 month everything should be normal. Could  just take longer to heal or is there probably something else wrong? I should add that the dialated veins are not there anymore and there are no other visual signs of the varicocele.  Thanks for the help and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Some degree of pain in the scrotum following varicocele surgery is quite usual.This usually subsides in due course.Cessation of pain or discomfort may take a while but it is impossible to predict exactly the duration.  The blood flow in the ligated veins is interrupted by ligation and the blood in them clots.The veins may eventually attenuate or even fibrose.Occasionally, re canalization may occur.  As you do not feel the veins after surgery, it is obvious that the surgery was successful and hopefully, the pain should go away.It may help to wear a scrotal support. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 40 year old male. Have been having urinary retention problem for the last 4 or 5 years.  About 6 weeks ago all of a sudden I couldn't urinate. I went to the emergency room. They did: prostate exam, bedside ultrasound, and urine test. They found UTI. Gave me antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) and after a while I could urinate (although difficultly) again. The ER doctor recommended that i saw an urologist.  About a week later have burning sensation in my urethra. Went to see my PCP. He decided it was UTI and gave me a different antiobiotics (clarithromycin). The burning sensation went away after a few days.  I recently saw a urologist. He performed a prostate exam and ruled out enlarged prostate. Urine test showed no UTI. The urologist then talked to another (likely more senior) urologist. The 2nd urologist came into the room and pressed on my prostate *really really* hard with his finger. Some semen oozed out.  He told me that was old semen accumulated in my prostate and it caused my urinary retention. He said there's nothing he could do. The only way to get better is to make sure I ejaculate every time I get excited.  I have never heard of old semen causing urinary retention. I tried to look up more info but came up empty.  Do you think this is a correct diagnosis? Can you point me to the right place where I can find more information about this? What is the medical term for this?  Should I get a second opinion?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old male with no history of erectile dysfunction until recently. About a month ago I started seeing a girl who has been a friend of mine for a long time. She is a beautiful girl and I am very sexually attracted to her only now I am having issues getting hard/staying hard. I believe it's psychological but could also be a testosterone deficiency.    I have been sexually active for 6 or 7 years and have never once had this issue before. I was recently in a two year relationship where we were having sex and I was always able to get and stay hard. The problem now is that the girl I am dating is a virgin and although I would like to have sex with her, I know she wants to wait and I know it would destroy our relationship.   I believe this caused an intense amount of anxiety during times of intimacy because she is a very sexual person and I read that can lead to damage in the penis. It's not performance anxiety because I know I am good in bed, but it's anxiety all the same.   Now when I get aroused my penis usually does not become fully erect and I often have the urge to ejaculate before I even get hard. There's often a discomfort in the tip of my penis and I have nowhere near the same sex drive I used to have. I was masturbating 5 times a week and now I'm down to once or twice, and usually I have to psych myself up for it. I also used to have frequent spontaneous erections and now that only happens during sleep. I also have a lot of pre-cum now and usually have excess leakage a while after ejaculating.   What can I do?\n\n",

Just because you have a lesser volume does not mean infertility.You can get a semen analysis done to be sure all is fine.Sperm count,motility,morphology of the sperm,volume,fructose levels,liquifaction all have a role in taking a decision to rule out problems relating to sperms.

    "title": "Burn Like blister on foreskin of penis",
    "content": "Hello  I was worried about little white bumps on the very upper part of my foreskin (not on the head at all) which were like little white clusters. I looked up the issue and most sites said that it was normal so not to worry about it. I, on the other hand didn't like them because unlike the hair follicle bumps on the lower region of my foreskin, these ones were actually white colored and kinda gross looking and easier to spot. So I looked up a way to get rid of them. I came across a few people that mentioned putting toothpaste on them overnight and by the morning they should go away. Not just any toothpaste but, Sensodyne. So, in my stupidity I decided to try it out. Well boy did it ever burn like hell but I decided to man up and go through with it cause I assumed it was working. So as the night went by the burning subsided and when I woke up I rushed to check if all was well. For the most part the bumps were more faint and looked much better, the issue was on the right hand side of the upper foreskin where now a white painful patch (small) had appeared. I tried examining it and it looks like one of two things. It looks kind of like a white blister (but not a bulge it is more flat) but it also looks as if I had burned right through the first layer of skin because it looks as if the white skin is underneath the surrounding regular pink skin.  I'm quite worried as to what may have happened. I know for a fact it isnt an STD, cause I didnt nor have I ever had sex of any kind. I have tried using Aloe Vera but no effect..I am currently trying to use Polysporin to get rid of it..only been using it for a day or two..but it doesnt seem to do much..I would really rather not go to the clinic, but if i must, i must..  Any help would be greatly appreciated..if any pictures are required please just let me know and I will gladly provide them in order for you to get a better understanding of what im talking about.   Thank you very much and hope to hear back from you soon\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Fordycee spots are common and represent aberrant sebaceous glands.No treatment is necessary.Some people find it cosmetically unacceptable. In your case it is obvious that you have had an irritant or a burn response to sensodyne. The outer skin has acted as a occlusion and so the delicate mucus membrane has got subjected to the chemicals. Since the treatment at home is not effective you may need a course of antibiotics to prevent secondary infection. It would be best to show your doctor and get treated. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 40 year old male. Have been having urinary retention problem for the last 4 or 5 years.  About 6 weeks ago all of a sudden I couldn't urinate. I went to the emergency room. They did: prostate exam, bedside ultrasound, and urine test. They found UTI. Gave me antibiotics (ciprofloxacin) and after a while I could urinate (although difficultly) again. The ER doctor recommended that i saw an urologist.  About a week later have burning sensation in my urethra. Went to see my PCP. He decided it was UTI and gave me a different antiobiotics (clarithromycin). The burning sensation went away after a few days.  I recently saw a urologist. He performed a prostate exam and ruled out enlarged prostate. Urine test showed no UTI. The urologist then talked to another (likely more senior) urologist. The 2nd urologist came into the room and pressed on my prostate *really really* hard with his finger. Some semen oozed out.  He told me that was old semen accumulated in my prostate and it caused my urinary retention. He said there's nothing he could do. The only way to get better is to make sure I ejaculate every time I get excited.  I have never heard of old semen causing urinary retention. I tried to look up more info but came up empty.  Do you think this is a correct diagnosis? Can you point me to the right place where I can find more information about this? What is the medical term for this?  Should I get a second opinion?\n\n",

Critical factors generally are... - technically 'successful' reversal (complete patency restored?), - age of the female partner and - fertility of the female partner.  Not much else may be done to help in increasing the chances of a pregnancy. As you underwent the reversal surgery fairly recently(in November, 2009), 'hopeful waiting' may be the best policy at the present time.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Skin Bridge on Uncircumcised Penis",
    "content": "Hi,  During development of the prepuce, the inner surface of the prepuce is initially fused to the underlying glans.Separation occurs later in fetal life and continues after birth, thus gradually forming the 'prepuceal cavity' (the space between the prepuce and the glans).Once the prepuce is totally free, it becomes fully retractable.  In some cases,(such as yours), the process may be incomplete and thus a bridge may remain.Surgery for this is not mandatory, unless... - there is pain - there is a channel underneath the bridge where,dirt collects and causes symptoms, or - for cosmetic reasons. Again, circumcision (in my opinion) is not mandatory, but greatly assists in quick healing and helps in avoiding recurrences. Best wishes!\n\n",

I supose it was a classic open surgery though I have 4 centimeter long cut and I was told to do not lift heavy for next 3 weeks. I had varicocele and testis atrophy. My surgeon told me that I was lucky because I didn't have one other problem who is common with varicocele and that my testis will recover in full size (it was new for me though I learnd before that testis can't recover in normal size again). After surgery I still have varicocele vein as I had before surgery, in its full size but my surgeon told me it needs 6 months for both  varicocele vein and testis to recover. One month after surgery I told my surgeon that I still have the same vein and he repeat again that its need 6 months.  Please, I will like to know if you agree with it though it doesent make sense for me?  Also, I was told I can  go back to normal activities 3 weeks after surgery but I still surf from pain (45 days after), I can't run and do an exercises of course but I hope it will just took more time to heal!  All the best! Vladimir\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vladimir, After a varicocele surgery,it certainly takes some time for the spermatogenesis to recover(as your doctor had suggested). Testicular size is another matter altogether. You need not entertain too high hopes regarding the testis recovering to its 'normal' size.  An 'atrophic' testis is usually small and soft. A small, but firm testis may not be atrophic.With passage of time the atrophic testis may turn firmer.  The ligated veins of the dilated 'pampiniform plexus' may feel dilated for some time and usually regress with time.  I guess you need to give it a bit more time to heal. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 25 male who underwent a bulbar diverticulum (Cowper's syringocele) excision by open surgery 1 year ago. After the excision, logically, a urethral reconstruction (urethroplasty) was carried out. I've 2 questions and will be very pleased if someone can answer them:  1) Before and after the surgery, I didn't suffer of Erectile Dysfunction (E.D.). In fact, after the surgery, I've had perfect erections, as always. But since some weeks, I'm feeling weaker in this respect and I've started to dwell on if it has to do with the 1year-ago surgery...It can happen that E.D. appear a year after the surgery if just after it there weren't any problems? I suppose that it doesn't make sense but I'd like to know your opinion. In case yes, how could it be explained?  2) One year after the surgery, I still suffer one minor complication: a sort of scotal pain, not throughout the scrotum but in the skin \"linking\" the testicles \"bag\" and the penis. This pain is not constant, but happening only when touching. The strange fact is that all this thing is accompanied by a sort of scrotal numbness, not in all the scrotum but from the scar (an inverted U) and above, extending somehow through the \"non-view\" side of the penis. My question is if this kind of long-term pain+numbness tends to dissapear or will be with me forever. And anyway, what can I do to improve in this respect...  I'm worried since I'm young and want to have no problems related to sex for a still a long time...Thanks a lot and kindest regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is very unlikely that one year following the surgery that one would develop erectile dysfunction directly as a result of the surgery.Other causes of erectile dysfunction also need to be investigated.  As far as the numbness is concerned, it is usually due to the unavoidable trauma to the tiny cutaneous nerves that supply the area in question.This kind of deficits involving small areas of the skin generally get better with time as the neighboring dermatomes tend to overlap these areas.How much recovery may occur or what the time-frame may be are highly unpredictable.

    "content": "Hi, If dietary or pharmacological factors are ruled out, then the most plausible cause of orange coloured urine is urinary tract infections(UTIs).  Most organisms that cause UTIs do not impart any specific or charecteristic colour to the urine by which they can be identified or suspected.  Citrobacter Sedlakii(Gram-negative), belongs to the Enterobacteriaceae family.It produces indole.These organisms are uncommon and at times difficult to identify by routine methods.Some of them are non-pathogenic as well.They have been reported mostly in the immunocompromised individuals.  Citrobacter Sedlakii infections have been reported to cause orange discolouration of the urine. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Post orchiopexy problem",
    "content": "Hi, about a month in a half ago i went to a urologist because i was having problems with my testies rotating while i was sleeping. The doctor examed me and said that it's not an emergency but when can schedule an a sugery to fix this. I also showed him some warts on my penis and he told me that he would remove them during the surgery. Before the surgery I told him i was having problems with my testie twisting and i didn't know if they where still twisted asumming he was going to take them out and untwist if necessary. After the surgery my scrotum had a half inch incsion with stiches and my warts were gone.  I went back to see him after 2 weeks because of swelling which he told me was fine and said i wouln't see the final results for in the comming weeks. It's now over five weeks since the surgery, i'm seeing the final results and I'm still having problems with my left testie. I have come to the conclusion that the doctor stiched my left testie in place  while there was still a 360 degree torison along the spermatic cord. I think this for a number of reasons. When i stand for a long period of time my testie feels numb and goes purple and feels spungy to the touch. Also i have almost no cremasteric reflex on that side. And when you feel the spermatic cord it feels different then the right. Also given the fact that there is such a small incision suggests that he never took the testies out of the scrotum to check if they where rotated. And theres the fact that when i try to turn it the the left I start to feel releaf  and the color starts to come back but i can't turn all the way because of the sutures.  I actually had an ultrasound done and urine test done and everything came back clear. What confused me was the fact if there was still torion why didn't the ultrasound pick it up. I think because my testies where resting on my leg that there was not enough pressure on my spermatic cord to cut of the blood like when i stand. I wen't back to my urologist yesterday and told him my symptoms but i never sugessted that i thought my left one was still twisted. He noted the spongy texture and color and said not to worry it's probly just inflamation form it trying to heal from surgery. He left saying come back in 6 months to a year and we would go from there. I don't know what to do now because i feel like it's twisted and my doc doesn't seem to want to do anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is highly unlikely that a surgeon would have fixed a testis in the twisted position. - the incision over the scrotum usually appears small(scrotum is highly elastic and contractile). Even coconut-sized hydroceles are delivered through surprisingly 'small' incisions!. -if the spermatic cord is still twisted, it would have been noted during the ultrasonography. - it is true that an absent cremasteric reflex is often seen in cases of torsion, but it is also true that some normal testes do not show a brisk cremasteric reflex.Scrotal surgery may also interfere with cremasteric reflex temporarily.  Your symptoms are very likely to subside with time.  If you are still concerned,you may opt for a second opinion. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Varicocele repair surgery",
    "content": "Hi, Whether the improvements in semen parameters, often seen (in about 80% of men) post-varicocelectomy, actually translate into improved pregnancy  rates has been a matter of ongoing controversy.   One view is that correcting a varicocele often does not improve the semen quality enough to change the therapy that will be required to result in pregnancy for the couple.   Several other studies have shown that varicocele surgery can improve sperm counts, morphology or motility but randomized and controlled trials do not consistently show improved pregnancy rates.   Some recent studies employing non-operated control groups appear to indicate that varicocelectomy does improve pregnancy rates [sponteneous as well as following IVF(in vitro fertilization)/ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection)].  These often contradicting & confusing conclusions stem from a number of factors such as... - the variability of the type of surgical procedures(artery-sparing vs non artery-sparing)  - bilateral vs unilateral procedures - age groups - small number of cases in some studies(which do not reach statistical significance)  - absence of control groups in some studies for meaningful comparisons - the grades(severity) of the varicoceles Etc.    As far as infertility is concerned, male related factors (male factor infertility) account for roughly 40% & female related factors contribute 40% as well.  Differences in fertility potential exist among men, even though all may exceed the accepted criteria for normal semen quality.  As 7 months have passed since surgery, and you say that the counts are good (you have not mentioned the percentages of motile forms & abnormal spermatozoa),you may have to keep trying. Another crucial factor is that one should address any female realated factors as well.  Generally if pregnancy is not achieved  within 6-9 months after the surgery, the other treatment options such as IVF and ICSI may need to be considered.As mentioned earlier, chances of successful IVF/ICSI also have been shown to improve following varicocelectomy.

    "content": "Hi,  I experience painful urination, increased frequency, and pain near the tip of the penis as the bladder becomes filled.  The pain is relieved by urination, however, there is usually a mild stinging most of the time. There is usually a delayed start of the urine flow lasting few seconds (10 to 15) as well.  The pain is usually enough to wake me up every couple of hours at night. This happens especially after sex and may last for as long as a week.  Spicy foods may also cause the same symptoms generally only for a couple of days.  I have seen a couple of urologists about this issue and have had a cystoscopy last year but still no answers. I was wondering if anyone might have a suggestion of a new direction to investigate this issue as it has been a problem since my mid 30\u2019s. I am now 61 and take FlowMax once a day.    Gary\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Painful urination after sex",
    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms have certain features which seem to suggest a chronic seminal vesiculitis. Pain of seminal vesiculitis is frequently referred to the tip of the penis and may be worsened by sexual activity.  Gonococcal infection was the most common cause of acute and chronic seminal vesiculitis in the past, but organisms such as chlamydia trachomatis are frequently the offending pathogens now-a days(especially in patients <40 years). Recurrent epididymitis may be frequently associated with this condition. In some parts of the world,high incidence of chronic seminal vesiculitis is attributed to underlying bilharziasis.   On transrectal ultrasonography, dilatation of the seminal vesicle on the side ipsilateral to epididymitis may be seen. Seminal vesicular fluid from the affected side usually shows inflammatory findings in almost all patients. Cullture of the first voided sample may grow the microorganism.  Treatment usually consists of  - antibiotic therapy(tetracyclins/macrolides/quinolones) and - symptomatic management.  In patients who don't respond to these measures,transperineal seminal vesicle puncture under ultrasound guidance and continuous transcatheter antibiotic drugs instillation may be considered.

    "title": "Re: 17 Year Old Retractile Testicle",
    "content": "Hi, Conventional teaching has so far been that the retractile testes are an otherwise normal, physiological variants that mostly descend spontaneously by puberty and require no active treatment.   In the recent past, studies have cast doubts that this complacent view may not be right.   Considerable overlap seems to exist between the three seemingly distinct entities of the - late descending,  - the ascending and  - the retractile testes.   There is increasing evidence that seems to suggest that retractile testes that spend most of the time in an extrascrotal position may experience identical adverse effects of higher temperatures as 'true' undescended testes.What matters is where they are located most of the time. The evidence also suggests that over time,such retractile testes suffer quite similar pathological changes as the true undescended testes, if allowed to await spontaneous descent.   Based on these observations,some workers tend to advocate a radical, novel proposal that the retractile testes are a variant of a spectrum of pathological maldescended testes and thus require active treatment (orchidopexy).  In your instance, it appears(from your description) that the retraction occurs occasionally.A weak urinary stream certainly needs to be investigated.So, it is advisable that you should consult a urologist get this sorted out.Good luck!\n\n",

My problem started about a week ago last thursday. Me and my girlfriend have sex pretty frequently   3-4 times a week (sometimes more or less)  for the past few months now. I've always been able to get hard and ejaculate 5+ times a day i typically last about 15-20 minutes. In this last week however (8-10 days) i have generally lost alot of interest in sex, when i do get hard my erections are alot weaker (60-70% of their max give or take) i also am getting hard alot less or not all during the day unless im with my girlfriend ALSO, while having sex i feel i ejaculate alot quicker then previously before (5-10 minutes now). I feel no pain when ejaculating,  a normal amount of semen comes out when i do. I feel as if sometimes  mentally i want to have sex but physically my erections are no where near as frequent or strong as they once were (as little as a week ago). Last week prior to my problem i did experience some slight testicular ache in my right testicle and a dull ache in my pubic region but both of those have since gone away. im verry worried at this young age that i wont recover or be able to perform to my fullest anymore.    also i lift weights pretty frequently (3 times a week) and the only other important info i can think of is  i get alot of good sleep (8-10 hours a night) i take a multivitamin and im trying to drink more water.  and sometimes when i pee its in a split stream but theres no pain or discomfort.   i have not been abnormally stressed recently and i am not on any medications\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ChevyCar5Door, In varicocelectomy, nothing is done to the testicles, or the vas deferens (and the rest of the pathway for the spermatozoa).  But, the reasons sited for the time to resumption of sexual activity are to do with - post operative pain(which may aggravate) - integrity of the sutures(sutures may slip while straining).  The protocols may vary widely between institutions and surgeons.Surgical technique also plays a role(ligatures vs clips).  Thus, it all depends on the confidence on the part of the surgeon(based on his/her prior experience) as to when it will be safe to permit sexual activity. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor.  I am experiencing ED from what I suspect are physical factors. I am just wandering at what duration a prolonged erection starts to cause physical damage.   I've read that it is variously 4, 6 and 12 hours?   For the life of me, I have never recalled a 6 hour erection. I also never recalled pain. However, I can't explain my ED other than that I must have had a priapism when I was under the influence of drugs.   Also, suppose that there is penile tissue damage, what tests can be used conclusively to detect it? I've done a doppler US which came back normal, but woried that it might not be detecing microscopic damage?  Does the fact that I respond to PGE-1 mean that the tissues are still 100% intact? (because I can get an erection) or do even men with severely damage tissue respond to PGE-1?  Regards,   Rich\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Richc,  Generally it is recommended that you seek medical attention if you have an erection that is lasting longer than 4 hours.    Erectile dysfunction has many causes.  Priapism is actually a somewhat less common cause.  Responding to PGE1 does not necessarily mean there is no tissue damage; however, it makes severe tissue damage less likely.  I would recommend you see a urologist to discuss your symptoms and possible treatments.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr Lowe,   Thanks for your reply. Just wandering if you could help me out wiht some very strange symptoms I've been having in the last 5 weeks. I've spent 1000s of dollars getting this test and that, and with urologists who seem to be saying its all in my head.  Basically 1. I've had worsening ED, with erection quality 20% softer. Also, erections seem to vanish within seconds when standing up. Have you heard of this or can you explain this?  2. I've been getting uncomfortable painful nocturnal erections regular (also disappear when standing up). When I get up, my penis is slightly painful for the day.  3. My penis seems to be more distended, or  in states of slight engorgement a lot more regularly. The shaft feels somewhat turgid, except the urologist has said it felt normal.   I am worried about stuttering priapism, that might be with the nocturnal erections and funny behaviour of my penis. Can you please shed some light?  Regards,   Richard\n\n",

In 2010 im having the problem everyday \"painfull\" but im a sickle cell patient, im so tired i dnt knw what to do ...but recently i met with this doctor a urology specialist he told me to use VIAGRA at first i thought he was joking, how can i use viagra that causes erection when im lookin at how mine would go down, he then explain that viagra make the blood flow in the penis to make an erection and that priapism is a  nonflow of blood in the penis tht makes it hard and painful. i have started taking viagra for the pass four days now and i have noticed a hug change, i still get an errection in the middle of the night but with very little pain and if i get up from bed it goes down normally and pain stop immediatly. but doctors out there if there is a solution or cure pls help me..i cry as i write this, i never tell my problem to anyone except my parent inn Nigeria\n\n",

    "content": "Hey guys  really strange situation here, got me worried...  last sunday (dec 7) my urine started get darker like dark tea texture.. then next thing i know i was pissing blood.. as in it was RED, probably not pure blood since it's not sticky or thick like blood, but other than that it's all blood like.. then it would turn brownish again, and then bloody hell again (same day)...  then i noticed why it would go on and off..   if i had lots to drink it would seem brownish, and if i had a few to drink it'd be blood like.. i think im bleeding and it's just getting diluted w/ my water intake..  then it got worst even with a lot to \"pee\" i'd still pee blood... ;(   ran to the doctor and this was the info he gathered from me:  Im Urinating blood. I have no feeling of any pain and discomfort I feel good, energetic, not sickly (though i had a slight fever the day before but nothing that i needed to take notice of).. NO SYMPTOMS really, except im just peeing blood   So he then asked me to do tests... ULTRA SOUND and URINALYSIS  ULTRA SOUND REPORT  http://img393.imageshack.us/img393/7862 ... ortix5.gif  ULTRA SOUND IMAGES http://img266.imageshack.us/img266/7966 ... kedto6.jpg  URINALYSYS The document had lots of factors left blanked, here are the ones w/ their exact values: COLOR: Reddish Transparency: Cloudy Specific Gravity: 1.030 Red Blood Cells: packed Albumin: ++++ Sugar: Negative pH: 5.0 Micral Test (up to 20 mg/l)   I was told that the 3 main causes of blood in urine was UTI, Stones, and Cancer  Based on what the doctors told me,  Urinalysis proves no UTI BASED ON THE ULTRASOUND I have clean healthy Urinary system, except for a very small stone in my left kidney.. but definitely NO CANCER (Thank you lord!)  Here's the weird part..   The doctor who did the ultra sound said the small stone found is very unlikely to cause such massive bleeding that im practically peeing blood already.. unless it was scraping the walls of my kidney bad, to which i should've felt pain...   I saw another doctor, a urology specialist  (Thursday Dec 11) and he said it was possible that that small stone can cause such massive bleeding, and that I would feel pain if i had blood clot, but since im urinating blood, apparently there's no blood clot  He then asked me if i wanted to do a CT Scan w/ CONTRAST so that he can evaluate the stone better.. but since it was expensive i opted not to for now and ask to be treated.. i asked what could be seen in a CT Scan that is not yet already seen in ULTRA SOUND, he simply answered:   \"all i can say is it helps\"  So i prescribed me potassium citrate 3x/day for 1 month, but told me that if i'm still bleeding a week after I really have to do that expensive CT Scan.   Earlier, The first doctor prescribed 500mg of TRANEXAMIC ACID every 6 hours to stop the bleeding.. it became on and off, and yesterday (Dec 12) I had clear urine whole day).. i stopped taking it today (Dec 13).. However I started peeing blood again today (Dec 14, starting at night already) - could it be because i stopped the TRANEXAMIC ACID meds? or is it just my stones getting pulvorized by potassium citrate im taking?  Also I have been slightly feeling feverish nightly since Friday (Dec 19). but nothing i can't shake off by putting my mind on other things..  So my question really is: - What's going on with me?  - Is that expensive CT Scan really important? Can it find tumors ultra sound couldnt? (im getting scared again, i thought i was safe) - is this normal to be peeing blood on and off w/ stones? in my case a single stone? - the day before the symptom i did a back flip (i used to do it a lot).. could that have caused my massive bleeding? - yesterday, i ran really fast a few times on rough terrain.. would that have caused the reoccurance of blood today?   I'm supposed to see the urologist again after a week, but I'm really looking forward for answers here on our forum as well.. i cant help but feeling the doctor wasnt paying much attention to me, im bleeding inside and his consultation didnt last more than 5 minutes.. he didnt even tell me what to do or not to do, just told me to take the potassium citrate 3x/day.. he didnt even telll me if it's ok to take it on an empty stomack.. my friends, former kidney stone patients, even had more to say than him. advised me to drink a lot of apple cider or cran berry juice  :( -\n\n",

    "content": "Hi thePatient, Went through your history and the attachments. Surgeon's usually are very concerned about gross hematuria (esp. painless).There are many causes for this - some common, and others rare. Ultrasonography has its limitations. It very good for stone disease but some small renal parenchymal lesions may be missed.As your ultrasound did not show any significant finding except the small stone, your doctor rightly has requested a CT scan. This is better at detecting some of the othe causes of gross hematuria such as (small angiomyolipomas, Arterio-venous malformations etc).  As your case is atypical,common as well as the not so common diagnoses need to be searched for.I suggest that you should follow your urologist's advice and act accordingly. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "HI Doctor Kamath  Thank you very much for your reply..   While your reply is about a year late haha it's greatly appreciated to hear your thoughts on these.. I'm also glad to update everyone the following progress:   Quick Summary 1) IM STILL ALIVE HEALTHY AND KICKING! 2) IM STILL BLEEDING BUT LESS now and even LESS frequent (about once in 2 months, for about a day or 2 .. less bloody though..  3) What was wrong w/ me? STILL A MYSTERY :(   I'll try to enumerate significant stuffs during my case, and ill try to be as accurate w/ the dates/month info:  Feb 2009  - saw another specialist, recommended the same thing - went for a full on CT scan w/ dye and all that (Spent $$$) , i could upload the images if u would like to see - CT Scan results shows nothing but a bit of a fatty liver and same stones found in ultra sound - CT Scan did find more tiny stones i tink.. - Doctor said it looks like it's just those stones..  - I argued, why don't i feel anything, and if a kidney patient bleeds when passing stones, then i must have and continue to pass stones a lot coz im always bleeding,   -- doctor said there cud be constant very small stones crystalizing all the time  - I argued and that why isnt there any stones found in my many urinalisys results  -- doctor said it could be because i passed them stones already (prior to the tests) though i continue to bleed because of blood clots bruising my urethra and stuff - I argued, what about the absence of pain?  -- doctor said i could have high tolerance for it  - DOCTOR recommended double dosage of  potassium citrate 6x/day for 1 month and another series of tests if im still bleeding..   - sometime this same month I started to feel pain in my lower back where the kidneys are at, so it most definitely seem like it's kidney stones given those pain symptoms..  - continued medication   MARCH 2009 - I continued to bleed on and off even after the double dosage  - this time i started to feel pain everytime i bleed (slight pain and sometimes really bad) - Didnt see the doctor anymore, started taking SAMBONG medication as prescribe by other kidney patients,   APRIL 2009 - still bleeding but less blood now and less frequent (now just around twice / month and for a few days only) - it could be the Sambong medication , or could be coincidence - still bad pain ...   MAY 2009 - it seems that i've completely stopped bleeding..  - continued sambong for a few more weeks.then stopped medications  June 2009 - around late june, just when i thought i was done w/ the problem, i started feeling discomfort in my left testicle  - it got worst over night - bled heavy the next morning.. oh crap. - felt feverish..  - pain was severe.. took some pain meds.. took sambong again.. - pain went away after 2 days, slight bloody color in urine for the rest of the week - gone after that week  July 2009 - same symptoms in June 2009 - did the same thing...  Aug 2009 - no more signs of problem. no blood in urine no pain..   Sept 2009 - it's almost 2 months since i bled.. seems to be gone for good.  late Sept 2009  - i started feeling some discomfort in my lower back (same area) and kinda channeling towards my left testicle.. - urine is \"tea\" like color (evidence of some blood mixed in it) but not as bad as before - went on for about 4 days..  - then gone..   NOW OCT 19 2009  - havent bled yet .. hope it's forever gone..    What do you think sir?    @Darce hi.. we could be having the same symptons. i suggest go for ultra sound and urinalisys first and have doctor take a look at it.. if doctor sees stones right away then it most probably is stones.. if you react to treatment .. then it's definitely stones.. that's how the 2 specialist do the process as i noticed..   as for my case.. my medication (and doubled after first treatment) didnt really help me much. but i did take sambong (known to be good for kidney stones) and started seeng atleast some progress in my case. again it could be coincidence.. Good luck w/ your case. don't worry too much.\n\n",

It's a similar pain to when contact is made to the ball but without the abdominal pain that is associated with the latter case. This happens generally only when there is contact on the left testicle but it can be the slightest touch and the same does not happen with the right testicle. I think this pain has always caused me to have painful ejaculations and I normally have to disrupt or change an orgasm and in fact the pain that I know will happen has caused me to issues over the yrs.   I have read on this site and others about testicle pain that I assume is a constant pain, this is not what I have. Any information would be much appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

I have talked to 2 different nurses and they had no idea what would cause it. I am currently being treated for a bladder infection and I am on Cipro, but the discoloration started before I received my prescription.  Is it something that will go away or do I need to see a specialist?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 29 years old. About 6 months ago, I had an erection and I almost felt as if I injured or even \"tore\" my penis. I lost my erection. I'm still not sure if this was in my head, which is what caused me to lose my erection, but to play it safe, I was cautious for the next few days. A few days later, things seemed to be fine. I had another erection, however, I noticed what looked like a small bit of scar tissue, or the skin near the base of the left side of my penis looked almost like it bubbled, like there was air there.  It now does this almost everyt ime I have an erection. I'm still able to get an erection, but I wonder if this could be an issue in the future, and what it is exactly. For the most part, there is no pain. I almost feel a faint pain sometime...but it's so minimal, I wonder if it's in my head.  A detail that may, or may not, help: I was working out and lifting weights a lot during this time. Not to be vulgar, but I wonder if I was \"too strong for my own good\" at the point during masturbation. Is it possible I ripped my penis? Or would that be followed by extreme pain?  Also, probably 6 months before this happened, I took some Enzyte. I no longer take it, and haven't taken it since, but I wonder if that could have contributed...  I hope this makes sense. I can provide additional details if there are any specific questions. I am able to function normally, but I want to make sure I haven't caused structural damage that will lead to future problems...  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "The normal penis is suspended from the pubic bone(part of the pelvis) by two ligaments (suspensory ligament and fundiform ligament).They suspend the penis in such a way that the normal penis hangs from the pubic bone with an upward convexity in the relaxed state(this convexity disappears during an erection).These ligaments can become weak or can undergo tears (violent masturbation, other trauma - acute or chronic). This may result in the loss of normal curve of the penis and a palpable gap just above the root of the penis where it attaches to the pubic bone.You can refer Dr.M.Aroon kamath answer relating to a similar problem, but with sequlae due to severe trauma. In your case it might have been a minor trauma and since you have recovered the chances of having residual problems are slim.Do consult a urologist and get this out of your mind and to make sure.Best wishes.\n\n",

There is no study (as far as my knowledge goes) that proves that losing sperm causes loss of weight (tiredness- yes,may be). What you probably need is a little change in attitude.If you feel that you lose sperm everytime you void, a simple urine microscopy(of a centrifuged specimen of urine) may sort it out. Do you, by any chance, masturbate/have sex too excessively? Please let me know, so that i may be able to offer a more specific reply. Thank you for your post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi iletyouwin, Thank you! Normally (even if one does suffer from retrograde ejaculation), semen can come into the urine only if ejaculation occurs ( i mean either by masturbation or by way of orgasm by some means).Other way of saying it would  be ... \"semen\"( not spermatozoa) can come into the urethra almost always during 'orgasm'.  You have confided that you were indeed masturbating(Thank you for sincerely answering me). But you have by now stopped that practice .... very commendable.  But, I am really spooked!   \"semen\"( not spermatozoa) can come into the urethra almost always only during 'orgasms'. Without an orgasm, the seminal vesicles and the prostate can not normally rhythmically pump and empty their secretions (which form the major portion of \"semen\") into the urethra.  Let me think....Will get back to you as soon as can think of some alternative explanation. Hope you will get well soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Janurary 26th 2009 I was in a car accident that resulted in internal bleeding from my Spleen and Kidneys. It may've been from other sources as well, but the doctors didn't specify anything further. I had blood detected in my Urine a few days after the initial car accident because the first doctor wasn't thorough enough. They said that it was amazing that my spleen hadn't ruptured, but that it was severely bruised along with my kidneys according to the MRI that was performed. I had only one external bruise, and that was on my hip bone, no where near the internal sources of bleeding. The final verdict from the hospital visit was Severe Bruising to the Spleen, Kidneys, and whole left side of torso but the primary bleeding was the two organs primarily mentioned. There were the Medical names, but I honestly can't remember what they were.  It's been nearly eleven months since then. The past two months I've been having the exact pain that I did from the wreck in the same places (beneathe the ribs and lower left back) that I had initially. I haven't done anything to reinjure those organs since.  Is it possible to have a \"ghost\" injury? Where the pain is identical to the initial pain with certain weather situations? I wrecked in the Ice Storm that hit Arkansas and Oklahoma, and now that it's really getting cold again, it's the first time I've been feeling the same pain.  Please explain how this happens. I'm a firm believer in mind over matter- if there isn't physically an injury that it's all in my head- but even when I really do look at it logically, the physical pain still overpowers that thinking.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,You must know that the ejaculate is not only sperms but mixture of different fluids.The testis would produce,the epidydymis store,and during ejaculation it would pick up fructose rich fluid from the tube vas deferens,and as it reaches up prostate would add prostatic fluid,the seminal vesicle and cowpers gland adding enzyme rich secretions.No wonder that the ejaculate would be watery.There would variations sometimes lumpy and sometimes watery depending on the secretions on the way.This has no bearing on fertility.You can try sitz baths ie sitting in a tub with private parts immersed for the aching pain,for a period of 10 minutes.With best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: horseshoe kidney stones inside and outside the kidney",
    "content": "Hi, I wonder if you misundersood what your doctor had said. Perhaps what you doctor meant was that there are stones in an 'Extra-renal' pelvis.  The anatomical position of the renal pelvis can be highly variable. - intra-renal or  - extra-renal or a combination thereof (ex; wholly intrarenal, mostly intra-renal, mostly extra-renal etc).  It is likely that your doctor meant that you have stones in intra-renal as well as extra-renal parts of the renal pelvis.  In the management of the renal stones, the position of the renal pelvis has a significant bearing on the approach/technique.    Percuteneous nephrolithotomy (PCNL) has been shown to be the ideal method for stone clearance in horseshoe kidneys. However, it can pose unique problems, particularly if there are large stag horn calculi (especially the staghorn types of stones that may be partly intra-renal and partly extra-renal). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 yr old female and for the last 5 months I have had a constant urge to urinate.  I have had no other pain.  I went to a urologist who said that a yeast infection I had got into my bladder, but the medication he gave me did not help.  He the did a scope and said everything looked normal and dismissed my problem.  I went to a gynecologist who diagnosed me with bacterial vaginitis and gave me a Metro gel for my vagina.  This did not help either.  I am very stressed in my life right now.  Could this have something to do with it? I have no other pain really, except a small sharp twinge every once in a while from my urethra I think.  The urge to urinate fluctuates day to day, but is usually always noticeable and often very bad at night, interrupting my sleep several times.  Sexual activity can make the urge to urinate worse the next day, and a hard bowel movement can make it worse too.  Since I know that my urine is normal, there is no UTI, I really can't figure out what is wrong! Please help me!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant urge to urinate- no other pain!",
    "content": "Hi There can be a number of conditions that cause urinary frequency.  a) Urinary tract infections: Dipstick test is the generally accepted screening test for UTI. But, Mycoplasma and ureaplasma are not always picked up on standard dip test screens.  Although, UTIs are usually diagnosed by urinary cultures,sometimes it is probable that the organism that is causing the infection may be grown in smaller numbers (Low-count bacteriuria) and thus dismissed as a contaminant!  As you are a young woman, it may be worth remembering that Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young and middle-aged women(next only to E.Coli).Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus associated primarily with community-acquired lower urinary tract infection (UTI).  b) One may also need to keep in mind the possibility of the Traumatic cystitis(due to sexual intercourse).  c) 'Overactive bladder' is not uncommon in women. The cause is unknown. It causes bladder contractions that occur on their own without the stimulation of an actually full bladder. Most of the time one has urgency symptoms but not too much of pain. Nocturnal frequency is common but the frequency is less compared to interstitial cystitis. Urinary cultures are usually negative.  d) Bowel spasticity  or Ovarian cysts are known to cause a feeling of bladder fullness and urgency.  e) Urethral syndrome can cause a urethral urgency ,but, the sensation of full bladder may be notably lacking.  In your case, 'Overactive bladder' appears to be the more likely diagnosis, perhaps made worse by mental stress.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you for this service!  I'm a 29 year old white male.  I recently noticed a small bump or swollen area on the left side of my urethra.  The area that I'm referring to I believe is called the meatus.  The size and color of the abnormality changes frequently.  Yesterday afternoon it was a dark purple-red almost like a bruise, and this morning it is almost completely flesh colored with a slight hint of purple.  The degree of swelling (or the size of the bump/lesion) also varies greatly but never gets any bigger than about 3mm and never completely goes away.  It almost looks like I have a lip on one side of my urethra when in it's natural position.      I don't know if I'm imagining pain or not but I can feel it in my pants when I move; however, if I touch it directly it does not hurt.  The pain comes and goes and it's just a slight stinging sensation.  I recently had a pretty high risk sexual encounter and I am extremely stressed about it so I'm sure some of my symptoms are self-induced.  I am including pictures with this post to assist in your diagnosis.  Thank you again for your time!     http://yfrog.com/0simg00082200911291947j\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thanks for your post and the photos. I think one should first think of this lesion being a \"bowenoid papulosis\" (BP). Bowenoid papulosis can  be genital or extra-genital. Genital bowenoid papulosis occurs in both sexes in sexually active people.   Bowenoid papulosis usually manifests as 'papules' that are induced by human papillomavirus (HPV), particularly sub-type HPV 16 and have a distinctive histopathology (bowenoid dysplasia). Most papules may appear pink,reddish or flesh coloured. It can also have the appearence of a wart or a plaque-like lesion.A biopsy is usually diagnostic.   Most of these are benign, but malignant transformation is reported in <3% of cases.  Other possibilities are - a genital wart - rare tumors of urethra. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am an 18 year old male. I was born very prematurely, I cannot recall the exact number of weeks premature but I weighed 1lb 6 ounces at birth if that helps. I had hypospadias repair done a few months after my birth once I was taken out of the incubator. I also had a hernia in my testicle repaired at the same time. I am rather small for my age and my growth plates are fused so I will not grow any taller than my 5ft. I took human growth hormone in these shot things for about a year on the advice of a doctor but I only grew maybe half an inch. I went through puberty fairly normally. My voice dropped to a low bass, I developed pubic hair and lots of body hair, facial hair, more muscle etc. I appear very masculine physically apart from my small penis/testes. All the usual secondary sexual characteristics so I do not think it is a lack of testosterone that is my problem. I have a very small penis and testes. The testicle where my hernia was is rather shrunken. My penis when flaccid is on average 2 inches long sometimes a little more or a little less. It is about 1in to 1in 1/2 wide when flaccid. When erect it is 4 in to 4 in 1/2  long and 1 and 1/2 in width approx. My testicles are rather small and the one is shrunken. I went to see a urologist and he took one look and said \"you have micropenis\" \"so sorry for your bad luck\" \"absolutely nothing that can be done\" \"there's the door\". I looked up this micropenis but it seems that my erect penis is much larger than anyone's with micropenis though I do not know for certain. I do not understand why I am like this. I thought testosterone was the factor in determining penis/testes size, I have plenty of it but it just never grew properly. Is it because of my hypostadias and hernia when I was born? Because I was born very prematurely? I want to go see another urologist because I do not think I have micropenis. Since I am 18 is there any hope it will grow more? Since the human growth hormone did not help my height does that mean my penis is fused in size just like my bones? Any answer or explanation more than \"you have micropenis\" would be appreciated. I need something more than that to go to a urologist in person with.   Thank you very much for your time. I hope I provided enough information to get some kind of answer.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Premature Birth, Hypospadias, Hernia Affect Penis/Testicle?",
    "content": "HI, Micropenis(microphallus) is a small but otherwise normally formed penis with a stretched length of less than 2.5 standard deviations (SD) below the mean.Traditionally, the term 'micropenis' has been used to mean a penis that is otherwise normally formed, and the term 'microphallus' refers to micropenis + an associated hypospadias.  The penis is measured on the dorsal aspect, while stretching the penis, from the pubic symphysis to the tip of the glans.  One may get confused by the various penile measurements such as - mean flaccid penile length, - mean erect penile length (used in adolescents and adults), - mean stretched penile length(usually used for penile measurements in the newborn) etc.  Moreover, the length & girth of the phallus differs among populations.It has been found to correlate well with anthrapometric measurements such as weight and height. Also, there are suggestions that many measurements should be carried out and a mean lenghth calculated.   Besides an idiopathic micropenis, two major causes of abnormal hormonal stimulation have been identified:  - Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (decreased production of gonadotrophin-releasing hormone [GnRH])  - Hypergonadotropic hypogonadism (due to failure of the testes to produce testosterone).  The signs & symptoms of androgen deficiency depend upon  - time of onset & - the degree of gonadotropin deficiency.  Androgen deficiency occuring in early fetal life-- wolffian structures fail to develop, leading to ambiguous external genitalia, hypospadias, microphallus, or a combination of these.  In patients with isolated hypogonadotropism, placental hCG(human chorionic gonadotropin) stimulates the fetal testis to produce sufficient androgens in early fetal life and so, in most patients, the ext genitalia do develop normally  During the second half of fetal life however, the developing gonad is under the influence of both LH and FSH. Deficiency of  LH and FSH at this stage, may delay testicular descent and result in micropenis.  If gonadotropin deficiency occurs after birth but, before puberty, then - delayed puberty/ arrested sexual development - delayed epiphyseal fusion(eunachoid body habitus) - retention of high pitched voice - failure of temporal recession of hair-line.  Androgen deficiency occuring after completed puberty may present with - regression of secondary sex cahresters, - decreased libido & sexual dysfunction, - infertility - loss of fat mass, - loss of muscle mass &  - infertility.  The initial evaluation is done to define whether the cause of the micropenis is central (hypothalamic/pituitary) or testicular. A full endocrinological work-up has to be carried out immediately. Karyotyping is also mandatory in all patients with a microphallus.  Testicular endocrine function must be assessed next (baseline and stimulated testosterone, luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) serum levels). Stimulated hormone levels also may give an indication of the growth potential of the penis.   In patients with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism where, the testes are non-palpable, laparoscopy should be utilized to confirm 'vanishing testes syndrome' or intra-abdominal undescended hypoplastic testes. This investigation may be delayed until the age of 1 year.  Apart from chromosomal abnormalities, certain non-chromosomal abnormalities may also result in microphallus.One such,are mutations in a family of genes known as \" homeobox genes\" (HOX).  HOX genes are believed to play a fundamental role in the development of the vertebrate central nervous system, axial skeleton, limbs, gut, urogenital tract and external genitalia.  In your case, it is quite obvious from your account that there is no ambiguity about your external genitalia. Elucidation of the cause of your problem is more important than whether the penis is 'actually' micropenis or otherwise.  In borderline cases one may be right or wrong by a few millimeters.

    "content": "I have been diagnosed with interstitial cystitis and chronic pelvic floor pain and have been on every avaialble drug treatment as well as DMSO cocktails, hydrodistention, bladder wall scraping, . Last night, I slept one hour, then up to urinate; then 30 minutes; then up to urinate; then every 15-20 minutes thereafter to urinate throughout the night. Amount of urine varies from 2 to 4 ounces with tolerable urethral/rectal pain. I can usually urinate in 1-2 minutes and return to bed and get back to sleep only to be awakened 15-20 minutes later. Occasionally, I have severe, nearly intolerable painful spasms that can last up to 30 minutes before I can relax enough to urinate. I have noticed that my buttocks are always clenched when I awake. I can tell when a major spasm is coming by the amount of clenching.  At 6:30 this morning, I had a very painful spasm that lasted about 10 minutes. The pain feels like it is being bounced back and forth from my urethra to my rectum. Additionally, in between this pain, I have a nearly unbearable sharp pain between my testicles and rectum that lasts 3-5 seconds and, literally, takes my breath. At some point, I can relax enough to start urination. These major spasms are always based on the amount of urine to be voided. The most painful spasms usually result in a 10-16 ounce amount of urine even if I had previously urinated 2-4 ounces 15-20 minutes previously.  My urologists have been of no help and have generally told me that I have some sort of nerve damage and that I will need to seek treatment from a neurologist.   Any suggestions for treatment are most appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, \"Pelvic floor dysfunction\" is known to be associated with  - vulvar vestibulitis syndrome, - essential vulvodynia and  - dyspareunia (in females),& - interstitial cystitis.  There are a number of aggravating factors which are believed to play a role.Some of which are... - sacro-iliac joint dysfunction, - lumbo-pelvic dysfunction(many cases known to be associated with low back pain) - Recent evidence indicates presence of \"Myofascial trigger points\" in the pelvic floor, stimulation of which results in reproduction of the symptoms of Pelvic floor dysfunction.  These trigger points can be located on pelvic examination and can be used in the management (by 'deactivating' the trigger points).  Some of your symptoms point to what is known as \"Pudendal Neuralgia \".  Very severe,shifting pain in the genitals or the anal-rectal area and the immense discomfort is usually worse when sitting and during sexual intercourse, is charecteristic of this condition.Most patients with this condition also have Pelvic floor dysfunction.  It is possible that your doctor mentioned about referral to a neurologist based on this suspicion.  Transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation (TENS),Biofeedback,Interferential therapy,cold laser therapy and ultrasound therapy are some of the modalities available for management of Pelvic floor dysfunction.  If neurological testing unearths a diagnosis of Pudendal Neuralgia, then the management will perhaps be - management of pelvic floor dysfunction as outlined above, - Pudendal nerve block, - Pudendal nerve blocks using using a long-acting analgesic and a steroid  - Botox, & if all else fails, then - pudendal nerve decompression surgery.

    "title": "Re: post ejac. pain at left testicle and left lower abdomen",
    "content": "Hi, your description of your symptoms suggests an 'epididymitis' or 'orchitis'. This could be due to a variety of causes. commonly it is due to retrograde spread of infection from the urinary bladder via the vas deference.  A urinary culture is perhaps indicated.  'Open' Varicocelectomy involves division of the veins in the spermatic cord (pampiniform plexus). During surgery(although surgeons always try to be as gentle as one can possibly be), a certain amount of 'handling' of the spermatic cord and testicle becomes necessary to perform the procedure.This may at times has the potential to cause pain in the testicle(depending on many factors-including the patient's threshold for pain).One may not feel the pain much in the immediate post operative period thanks to the post-operative analgesic use and may present once the drugs are withdrawn.This should hopefully settle down in due course.In your case this seems unlikely as your surgery took place over 2 months ago.  You need to consult your doctor for full assessment if your pain persists, to exclude other causes.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Issues Urinating, constant dribbling, slow flow. What is it?",
    "content": "Hello,  I have stumbled upon this forum and am hoping to help get this solved, but first I think a little bit of my medical history may help.  I am a 20 year old male, 6ft 2\" 185 pounds  I am anaphylactic to Nuts, Peanuts, peach, bamboo shoots, as well as Cravit (medication)  I am also allergic to hirudoid cream for eczema as well as any fish or shellfish (anything from the ocean), egg, nitrates, wheat, rice, soy, fruits such as kiwi, banana, apple, and the list goes on.  I have asthma.  Starting in the summer of 2008 I started having urinary issues.  This was soon after being diagnosed with herpes.  It was very minor and pee just felt \"weird\".  So I ignored it until last week.  I had been diagnosed by dermatologists twice for herpes but found a third opinion stating I had HPV warts, which made much more sense as they never went away.  About a month ago urinating became HELL.  I just couldn't stop dribbling afterwords, I had pain in right in the pelvic area.  And pee would just not come out with any control.  I visited a Urologist on Monday and did a urine test for the 13th time since the issue started and nothing came up, no signs of infection.  The urologist is very well known in this country and has appeared on television etc  The doctor continued on with pressure tests but no pain, the pain comes randomly for me and the area has a inflated feeling.  The Urologist continued with an ultrasound and that showed no real trouble.  The doctor was at a loss of what is wrong with me.  My prostate was slightly swollen and my bladder has white stuff inside the wall (in a picture from the ultrasound) and I believe he said I had a week bladder.  Which he said could contribute but still had too rapid of a transition.  He gave up diagnosing and gave me medication for my prostate.  I have been taking it and flow became better but dribbling is the same and pain is worse.  My main question here is \"What is wrong with me?  What could be wrong with me?\" any insight would be great but I found it odd a urologist was unable to identify the issue.  I am pretty fluent in the language of where I am right now and understand most medical terms but I will be going to an English speaking country in the next week and am worried about the flight and will try and see a GP there.  Thank you VERY VERY MUCH!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It is possible that your problem could be due to genito-urinary schistosomiasis.This is generally considered in the differential diagnosis of symptoms such as yours (especially in countries where this condition is endemic).  The cornerstone of diagnosis of this disease is the detection of schistosome eggs in feces or urine.   But atypical cases are known to occur wherein the diagnosis may not be obvious or may be misssed.  Shedding of schistosome eggs fluctuates,therfore,up to three specimens may be required for diagnosis. These eggs are usually observed in isotonic saline solution. In  patients who are likely to have a smaller parasitic burden, such as returning travelers, formalin-based techniques have been shown to improve the yield.    In China, an an alternative technique for S. japonicum which involves the placement of concentrated fecal ova in distilled water has been used. Finding of hatching miracidia is said to be diagnostic.  Genital symptoms in residents of tropical countries and among returned travellers can arise from bacterial, protozoal, and helminthic infections which are not usually sexually transmitted.   The symptoms may mimic classic sexually transmitted infections(STIs) by producing wart-like lesions (schistosomiasis),lesions of the genital tract (epididymo-orchitis caused by tuberculosis, leprosy, and brucellosis; salpingitis as a result of tuberculosis or amoebiasis) & ulceration (for example, schistosomiasis, amoebiasis and leishmaniasis).  Schistosomiasis is known to involve the seminal vesicles and the prostate gland (as often as the bladder). Eggs are frequently found in semen in S. haematobium-infected men. However, seminal egg excretion also showes marked day-to-day variation(like in the urine). Seminal eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) level also is raised frequently.  Male genital schistosomiasis (MGS),in this context been hypothesized to be a be risk factor for transmission of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) because of egg-induced inflammation in the seminal fluid\u2013producing organs and an associated potentially increased viral shedding in ejaculate.    The HIV prevalence rate in areas highly endemic for this parasite is 1.2-1.7 times higher in women than in men. STDs increase the probability for HIV transmission, presumably through lesions in the genital mucosa. Female genital schistosomiasis, a special form of urinary schistosomiasis, is being increasingly considered to be another risk factor for HIV transmission.  Your doctor must have tested your urine for the schistosomal eggs but, it is likely that the eggs were not found(due to the varying rates of egg passage or due to very low parasitic burden). In case you are from a non-endemic area, then one has to consider possibility of this being a 'non-gonococcal' urethritis.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Okay, I have had what other doctors thought to be prostatitis, but it is seeming more and more likely that it is an enlargement of the prostate and not prostatitis. I am 22 years old and have had this enlargement for close to a year now. Last night I ended up in the emergency room because I had waited to long to urinate and could not. So at the ER they put in a Foley to drain the bladder. Today I have been urinating on my own, but not without pain and air coming out. I would like to know if after having a cath, is it normal to pass some air and have urethral pain, and for how long it should persist? I have passed air with the urine (usually after the urine is gone) it feels like shooting a large stream  of air out. He did prescribe me some Flomax for the enlargement so I am hopeful that will help.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pneumaturia, Pneumatuia is known to occur in cases of fistulous communication between the urinary tract and the intestinal tract (usually rectum or some part of the colon).  The usual causes are - colorectal cancers, - diverticulosis coli, & - Crohn's disease.  Rarer cause quoted in the literature are - emphysematous cystitis  - iatrogenic: Recent laparoscopic surgery (collateral damage),   diagnostic or surgical instrumentation,Renoalimentary fistulae    due to radiofrequency ablation or cryoablation). - Foreign bodies in the bowel (eg,swallowed toothpicks,chicken      bones or other sharp objects). - rectally or urethrally introduced objects (homosexuals & others) - irradiation - Congenital (isolated reports of a patient with an ectopic       vas deferens opening into the bladder), - emphysematous pyelonephritis,  - emphysematous pyelitis, and  - gas-forming renal abcesses.  The disease is often associated with female sex, diabetes mellitus,immunocompromised state, previous recurrent urinary tract infections, neurogenic bladder, urinary stasis and in transplant recipients.  The initial presentation in men may mimic prostatitis, especially if fever is present.  Pneumaturia's Pneumaturia certainly needs to be investigated in depth for the aforesaid possibilities. Thank you pneumaturia for this very interesting post. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doctor,  My Dad was recently diagnosed with a stone on his left kidney which has been causing him a lot of pain. While performing a regular XRAY, the radialogist found that that there was a slight swelling on his left kidney and recommended for a Utra Sound and a CT scan. The results of the CT scan was a below;  Report:  \"Exophytic Heterogeneous Enhancement: Well defined rounded mass in the lower pole of the left kidney measuring 2.4 * 2.6 cm. No focal NODULE seen to suggest METASTASIS\"  \"Left HYDRO METHROSIS due to a stone in the left upper ureter, no evidence of METASTASIS\"  The local doctor is going to be performing a scope to remove the stone but we are more worried about the solid mass which was found on his lower part of the kidney. What are the chances of this growth being cancerous, the local doctor is suggesting partial kidney removal to save the kidney or a full kidney removal if there is any traces of spreading. My father turned 56 last august and he's most recent medical checked out perfectly fine including his blood test as he is a diabetic.  We are all very worried about my Father as the doctor is suggesting that it could be a cancer but it's good that we have detected it quite early. My readings over the internet is suggesting otherwise as it can be a belign and until a biopsy is done, it is quite difficult to come to any conclusion.  I would really like to hear your advice on this and how do you think we should proceed. My mother has scheduled an appointment with another doctor from a different hospital to get a second opinion as well.  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  There are a number of possibilities for the CT appearence that you have provided. But, all of these conditions have to be differentiated from a renal cell carcinoma.   The other way of saying this would be that \"any renal lesion showing these CT features should be presumed to be renal cell carcinoms (RCC) unless proved otherwise\". Although many conditions(many of which are quite rare) potentially can cause these CT features, i will discuss one important condition which merits special mention - renal 'angiomyolipomas' (AMLs).  There are many varieties of this tumor. From purely intra-renal to predominantly extra-renal with a small intra-renal component. Also, their architecture varies. It could range from purely fatty tumors to ones with undetectable fat content on CT imaging.Their vascular pattern also varies. They can be asociated with intra or extra renal hematomas.   Depending on these variations, their CT appearence also varies from those with 'homogenous' or 'heterogenous' enhancement.  It is quite likely that your father may be ultimately diagnosed as having an angiomyolipoma.But, that will be done only after thorough investigations to exclude a RCC.  Best wishes!\n\n",

You know when you drop ink in water, its like that but in my urine. I generally comes a few seconds after my stream is started.   I'm not sure if this is related but it may be. About once a month directly after pieing(Sometimes the white in the urine sometimes not) I get an intense burn in the tip of my penis. I feel like I have to pee more but when I do it hurts. If I leave it alone it lasts about an hour and goes away. Its EXTREMELY uncomfortable, like a 7/10 on a pain scale  Those may be linked, I'm just trying to give as much info.  Its not an std. I've been with on girl and she gets tested frequently during her visits to the gynecologist.  Other then that, that is the only symptoms I have.  I'm not sure weather I should be worried or not.  I'm not peing more frequently, I don't get the burn sensation any more often then once a month.  If you have any info or advise so I can figure this out it would be greatly appreciated\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Brachytherapy or Prostate Removal",
    "content": "Hi, Generally 3-6 core biopsies may be obtained from each side of the prostate gland.In your case, one of them had turned out to be positive for prostate cancer. What is perhaps most important from management point of view is whether the cancer is \"Organ confined\" or has spread beyond the prostate's confines. Which option is best depends on the stage of the disease, the Gleason score, and the PSA level.   \"Organ confined\" tumors may be offered - radical prostatectomy   ('open' or robotic assisted laparoscopic)  or  - prostatic brachytherapy.   The two main methods of prostate brachytherapy are - permanent seed implantation and  - high dose rate (HDR) temporary brachytherapy.   Permanent seed implants involve injecting approximately 100 radioactive seeds into the prostate gland under image guidance.They irradiate at a low dose rate over several weeks or months, and then the seeds remain in-situ permanently. Modern technology has ensured, less adverse effects on neighbouring structures such as the urethra,seminal vesicles, urinary blader etc).  HDR temporary brachytherapy involves placement of  very tiny plastic catheters into the prostate gland, and then a computer-guided machine pushes a single highly radioactive iridium seed into each catheter in sequence. Because the computer is pre-programed to control how long these seeds remain in their respective catheters, one can control the radiation dose in different regions of the prostate, thus concentrating the radiation dose to the tumor. HDR may be combined with external beam radiotherapy.   It is typical to have symptoms of urethral, bladder, and rectal irritation for a few months following the HDR and external beam therapy. Serious long term rectal injury is not common.   The chance of incapacitating urinary incontinence needing urinary pads is  approximately 2.5% (5% or more for standard prostatectomy ).  The risk of impotency is approximately 35 - 40% for those patients treated with HDR + external beam. This is similar to other forms of radiation or brachytherapy, but better than the risk associated with prostatectomy.   Prostatectomy may cause erectile dysfunction in two ways. - damage to the neurovascular bundles(unilateral or bilateral) - by compromising the blood flow to the penis.  Of late more evidence is emerging which casts a suspicion that the incidence of erectile dysfunction is perhaps much higher than previously thought.  One study found that 60% were impotent 18 months after the surgery, 8% experienced total urinary incontinence, and 40% had occasional genitourinary problems (JAMA 2000;283:354-60).  Orgasms post- prostatectomy are likely to be dry orgasms, which is the absence of ejaculatory fluid. As the prostatectomy removes the seminal vesicles and prostate gland which are responsible for producing much of the ejaculate.  Open nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy has continued its evolution into the highly refined techniques that we see today.  Limitations in visualization and dissection of the neuro- vascular bundle have continued to pose a challenge to even the most experienced prostatic surgeon. The introduction of robotically assisted techniques to modern laparoscopic surgery has provided many an advantage, the two most significant being  wristed instrumentation & improved three-dimensional (magnified) vision.These are expected to result in more neuro-vascular bundles being spared. Best wishes!\n\n",

This has been like this since I started masturbate when I was around 15. It was not a problem back than because I could avoid it with not touching the tip during ejaculation but now since I am married I can't avoid contact during intercourse (when ejaculating).   That sharp pain starts right when the semen leaves the penis. It is gone if I don't move or ejaculation ends. It feels normal and good until I feel that pain. But when it starts, it takes everything away.   No pain at other places or at other times and I am sure I don't have any STDs. Your help is greatly appreciated on diagnosis of my problem.   Thank you,  Matt\n\n",

It is probable that you could be having a 'Mixed incontinence'.This is perhaps,the most common type of incontinence in women. The pathophysiology of mixed urinary incontinence is as yet unclear & still being investigated.  Mixed urinary incontinence is characterized by involuntary passage of urine associated with urgency as well as exertion, (sneeze,cough,or any other act that increases intra-abdominal pressure).  You need a urological consultation so that tests may be performed to categorize and then treatment may be formulated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm 22 years old and I just had a varicocele embolization done for my left testicle four days ago. I had previously underwent varicocele surgery a couple of months before, but the surgeon was not able to ligate all of the varicose veins in my testicle. Therefore, I also had a follow-up embolization done. On the day of the procedure, I had rested extremely well and was feeling completely fine. A couple days after, I had stupidly decided that I was fit enough to play soccer, since I was confident that I would be fine. However, for a couple of days now I have been experiencing sharp lower abdominal pains on my left side, and this occurs whenever I put stress on my abdomen (e.g. bowel movement) or on my groin ( raising my knee or flexing my abs. The pain is extremely irritating, and it hasn't been getting better at all. I have not experienced any testicular pain, only pain in the groin/lower abdomen area, and I am worried that I have caused internal damage due to physical activity. My walking is normal and there's no pain if I engage in sexual activity/masturbation either. Is this pain normal after embolization, or is this a cause of engaging in physical activity (soccer) and what should I do to get rid of this pain? I'm really concerned and would appreciate a response as soon as anybody is available.  Thank you very much,  John\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Percutaneous embolization of varicocele needs selective catheterization of the internal spermatic vein(s) followed by their occlusion with either a sclerosant or solid embolic devices.   Although many agents/devices have been described for this purpose, current techniques use predominantly coils (stainless steel or platinum) as the solid embolic agents, sodium tetradecyl sulfate as the sclerosant or a combination of these two.  You have not mentioned what kind of access was employed for the embolization(jugular or the femoral route).Also not mentioned are details such as what kind of material was used for embolizing.  Without these details, it is difficult to answer your query.  However,i can venture to say that complications of percutaneous therapy are infrequent and typically mild.Thrombophlebitis of the pampiniform plexus has been reported in some cases.

    "title": "Re: BPH - time of day to take alpha blockers (rapaflo or flomax)",
    "content": "Hi,  All of the -blockers evaluated have demonstrated comparable effectiveness, and in the evolution of -blocker therapy for BPH the focus was primarily on improving convenience and tolerability. Although almost all of the long-acting 1-blockers are well tolerated, only tamsulosin and alfuzosin SR are administered without the need for dose titration.   Tamulosin  can cause adverse  effects that may impair  thinking or reactions. Therfore one should be careful iwhile driving or doing anything that requires that one is awake and alert. One may feel dizzy when getting up from a sitting or lying position. One should avoid standing up too quickly to keep from falling. Drinking alcohol can make worsen the dizziness.  Tamulosin is usually taken once a day, approximately 30 minutes after a meal. It is advisable to take this medication at the same time each day(approximately 30 minutes after the same meal).  Recent studies indicate that those taking Flomax every other day have the same level of relief and often fewer side effects.  Some studies have shown that nocturia may not improve much with alpha blockers.  Therefore, if your concern is the side effects, it may be OK to take the dose at bed time.But, if the concern is symptom relief (especially nocturia), it may not be of much help. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cramping in Perineum",
    "content": "Hi, From your description of your symptoms, this could be  - Coccygodynia or - the piriformis syndrome.  Coccygodynia which is pain in the region of the coccyx (tail bone), typically is triggered by sitting. The pain may aggravate by arising from a seated position.  Coccygodynia is five times more prevalent in women than men.  Diagnosis is best done by dynamic radiography.This may show abnormal mobility of the coccyx or subluxation.Advanced imaging techniques(Bone scans and MRI) may show inflammation and edema, but neither technique is said to be as accurate as dynamic radiography.   Treatment for patients with severe pain generally begins with injection of local anesthetic and corticosteroid into the painful segment (relief of pain is diagnostic as well!). Coccygeal massage and stretching of the levator ani muscle can help. Coccygectomy is considered only when nonsurgical treatment fails. Coccygectomy is said to be  successful in carefully selected patients, with the best results in those with abnormal radiography.  Dysfunction of the piriformis muscle can cause a somewhat similar pain but generally produces signs and symptoms of pain in the sciatic nerve distribution.This is also more common in women(M:F, 6.5:1). Electromyography of the pyriformis muscle may clinch the diagnosis.   Bursitis or weaver's bottom (ie, ischiogluteal bursitis) is another cause of pain in the perineum.  In your case, coccygodynia (although very much less common in males),seems most probable.It is advisable for you to consult an orthopedic surgeon and get this sorted out. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Treatment options for Detrusor Sphinctor Dyssynergia",
    "content": "I've been diagnosed with severe Detrusor External Sphinctor Dyssynergia last year, and have been receiving botox injections into the sphinctor.  It was confirmed with video urodynamics, and the bladder pressures were extremely high (over 200 cm).  I also have a stricture near the tip of my penis which is extremely sensitive, so much so that I cannot self-cath, and have to go under general anesthesia for any cystoscopies or other procedures.  I also have frequent pain in the kidneys, probably from the high bladder pressures, and I'll be getting an ultrasound soon to look for damage.  Finally I also have an overactive bladder (also trabeculated), causing frequent urge incontinence, as well as frequent dribbling.  I do not have any known spinal injuries, or MS, and my symptoms began in 2001 from being beaten severely in a fight.    My concern is that I do not want to continue the botox treatments forever, because they do not last very long, and eventually my body will develop antibodies to it, and I want a second opinion on other possible treatments.  My urologist insists that I get an interstim installed, and if that fails, get a tube sticking out of my belly to drain urine.  Neither of these options are acceptable for me, because the interstim is not MRI compatible, and my work in clinical research requires me to be near FMRI frequently, and I just cannot stand the idea of having a tube coming out of my stomach.    I've asked my doctor about getting a urolume stent installed since they are MRI safe, or even a sphinctorectomy, because honestly I would prefer incontinence to a tube sticking out of me.  However, my doctor tells me that stents are only for spinal injuries, yet did not seem to be well informed about them.  Also, while I have found information linking interstim to bladder problems, I have not found any information that it relieves sphincter dyssynergia.  Ultimately I believe that my sphincter is causing the bladder problems, so treating the bladder without treating the sphincter seems like a disaster.  A second opinion would be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Treatment options for Detrusor Sphinctor Dyssynergia",
    "content": "Hi, Damage to the nervous system (between the brain-stem and the sacral segments of the spinal cord) can create a lack of coordination between the bladder and the external sphincter muscle, which is the muscle that controls the emptying of the urinary bladder.  As a result, the urinary bladder isn't able to empty completely, which creates a buildup of abnormally high urinary pressures. Detrusor-External Sphincter Dyssynergia (DESD) is a combination of these two factors and thus can lead to serious urinary tract damage and at times, life-threatening consequences.  I hope that 'pseudodyssynergia' has been confidentally ruled out (although it is more common in women).This can only be confidentally diagnosed by concomitant recording of intra-abdominal pressures during study of bladder pressures.  The other complicating factor in your case is the severe meatal stricture.This will undoubtedly continue to increase the bladder pressures even if the DESD is successfully treated.    The mainstay of treatment in is the use of antimuscarinic medication and catheterization (this is obviously not feasible in your case).  Sacral nerve stimulation has been tried (but is ruled out in your case by you).    Botulinum toxin injection (has been tried in your case and obviously, you don't want to continue with it).  Thus, the two major remaining choices for you are...  a) Stents:  migration, urethral erosion, erectile dysfunction or encrustatios are known complications.Also, introduction of the stent itself may not be straightforward in your case.  b) External sphincterotomy, however, is associated with significant risks which include erectile dysfunction, hemorrhage, and the need for repeat procedures.  Therefore you have to make a serious choice in consultation with your urologist as to which modality is best suited for you. Best wishes!\n\n",

Typically this would give pain with urination but should be look for anyway.  Also, a prostatitis (inflammation of the prostate gland) can produce a discharge and pain.  Have you had a urinalysis performed?  This would be helpful in evaluating for inflammatory conditions as well as a urinary tract infection (less likely given no burning with urination).

My problem is that i am having pain in the perineum part from last 3 months now... it hurts as soon as i get the erection, it doesn't hurt anymore when i take the stool but after sometimes it starts hurting not like how it used to hurt but there is a constant irritation for hours and then it goes back to normal. It all depends on my bowel moment if the bowel is hard it gets irritated and it starts hurting. I have talked to many doctors and all they do is give me pain killers and tell me to not think about it but it get so irritated that i can't sit properly, walk properly. It's not chronic as how it used to be before the surgery thou. I sometimes feel pain in my portrait area too... and doctors just call it inflammatory pain or something. I don't know what to do anymore. i get an urge that stool is coming but when i go sit in the toilet it doesn't come and that place gets irritated again.   Please help...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 17 year old male and i have developed a great worry recently. About 2 weeks ago after a game of squash I came home and found my left tescticle was aching rather badly. Since then, i have never really felt this pain through the day, only on evenings. Also the pain has moved from my left to my right and then back again, constantly switching but never both at the same time. Sometimes this ache develops into a shooting pain that hurts rather a lot.   After doing a check with my fingers around the area of my testicles, i found nothing other than the little ball at the back of my testicles where i believe the sperm chord attaches to the testicle. However, when i apply a little pressure to this area, it hurts quite a bit, is this normal?  I am worried about both the area of my testicle that hurts when pressure is applied and also the pain that is almost constantly existent on an evening. I am currently sexually active with my first partner having not been with anyone else. I have always used protection during sex but alternative sexual activity has taken place without protection. Could this perhaps be the reason? what is wrong with me? help is much appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  This kind of pain in either testicle can be due to a number of factors, some of which are... - acute epididymitis(or epididymo-orchitis), - blunt trauma. or - testicular torsion.  In acute epididymitis, the infection is usually retrograde from the urinary bladder via the vas deferens.Could be unilateral or bilateral.Symptoms of UTI are generally associated.Systemic manifestations such as fever may be present.  But, in all cases of acute testicular pain (the 'acute scrotum'), one diagnosis must be excluded---- torsion of the testicle. This may occur sponteneously, or may occur during some vigorous physical activity (although this association is unclear).Sponteneous detortion of the testicle can also occur in about 5-7% of cases.These are the cases which are liable to be missed.   It is very important that you must consult your doctor at the earliest who, in all probability would request an ultrasonography of the scrotum to exclude testicular torsion. Best wishes!\n\n",

Intermittent self catheterisation is perhaps the ideal management under the circumstances and one should hope that this will recover in course of time.  How much it may or may not recover is not easy to predict at this point.  If there is no tendency towards recovery, then one may need to investigate further using certain urodynamic measurements.

    "title": "Re: Penis numb for a week after using c-ring",
    "content": "Hi, Looks like the tight band had caused a tempory lack of blood supply to the nerves to the penis via the 'vasa nervora', arteries which accompany the nerves and supply them.This could have produced a 'neurapraxia'.This is usually self-limiting and should recover fully in course of time.  I have no idea how tight the elastic band was. Higher degree of tightness could cause what is known as 'axonotmesis' (where the axon cylinders are broken within their myelin sheaths); This is more serious than  'neurapraxia' and will take longer to recover.  I do not think the blood supply could have been affected, as severe pain would have almost certainly forced you to release the band.  It will be better to consult a doctor urgently and if it proves to be a neurapraxia,you can quit worrying. At worst, it could be 'axonotmesis', in which case, you may have to wait a little longer for recovery, extent of which may be somewhat unpredictable. 'Rest' to the part is strongly recommended. Best of luck!\n\n",

Touching the mentioned zone doesn't hurt, although it feels sore after touching it more vigorously.  Also, there aren't any visible lumps or swelling and I have no pain while using the bathroom.

    "title": "Re: Hard zone between testicles and anus",
    "content": "Hi, You say \"(because that zone gets harder while having an erection)\", it appears that it is closely related to the urethra.  One of the diagnoses to be considered first is a chronic peri-urethral abscess secondary to a urethral stricture.  An acute peri-urethral abscess is usually very painful, but, a chronic abscess (following antibiotic therapy) may become hard and remain so.  It is also possible that a stricture itself may be quite thick and be palpable.  Other rarer differential diagnosis would include  - a Cowper's duct cyst: Cowper's glands, also known as bulbourethral glands, are about pea sized and are located beneath the prostate gland.Cysts can arise from these glands and may be felt in the general area you have described.

    "content": "Hello there, I'm a 20 year old healthy male with a bit of urinary problem.  About three weeks ago (while masturbating, I'm embarrassed to say) I think I held back urination for a little too long and got this pretty annoying back and scrotal pain. I didn't actually notice anything wrong with my urination except for it's weaker and I'm going more frequently.  A week later, I developed a bit of anterior abdominal/flank/back pain pain. I'd say it's a little \"spasmic\". Not excruciating. About a 3-4. The doctor did a deep palpation of the abdomen and found pain on the RHS.  All Urinalysis, CT, ultrasound returned completely normal. No stones or any sign of obstruction. No  haemoturia or bacteria, epithelial, casts, leukocytosis whatever. Bladder size and prostate normal.   Now the pain has come and gone (and come, again) and I've developed a pretty annoying symptoms of waking up early in the morning (4 o'clock) with an uncomfortable bladder. if I ignore the bladder and try to sleep, I'll get the pain again, when I get up.  The doctor says it's because the urine some times flows backwards and causes spasm of the ureter and that's the cause of the pain. He says it's nothing to worry about.  Now I've learnt my lesson well...so I'll do my best not to do anything stupid...but I've got a few questions I'd like you to enlighten me on.   1. I've learnt a bit about bladder anatomy. I know that as the bladder expands the ureteral sphincter becomes more constricted. Is it possible that the backflow only occurs with moderate or minimal amount of fluid and ONLY when I'm lying down?   2. If 1 was the case, then wouldn't the pyelogram miss it because it contrast is injected to fill the bladder to the full and the X ray is taken when I'm standing up?  3. If 2 was the case, should I mention my concern to the urologist?   4. What do you think of the diagnosis? Thanks very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You say that this started following masturbation(may be important for a doctor to know what kind of masturbation it was, any oils,gels,cremes etc were used,the duration,self or otherwise etc etc).I have had one patient who developed severe burning sensation in the urethra following masturbation - who later came out with the revelation that he masturbated with his hand immediatly following a meal of hot, spicy curry (without of course washing his hands thoroughly with soap!). Well, i am only trying to point out the importance of the history!  Although i am not personally convinced about vesico- ureteric reflux as the cause of your complaints, i will try to answer some of your doubts... - reflux can occur whether the urinary bladder is completely full or not. - internal sphincter normally remains tightly closed.Otherwise all of us will be incontinent. - reflux can occur in any body position (vertical position may help in the urine coming back to the urinary bladder - akin to what happens in swallowing - you can swallow even while upside down!) - pyelogram may or may not show it. - radionuclide studies may better reveal a reflux as well as quantify it. As for the diagnosis, it needs investigations. Strong contenders are cystitis & prostatitis Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "but for prostatitis, don't you have to have perineal pain before it gets referred to the back/abdomen? Can you get prostatitis and only have pain on one side? Btw, ultrasound showed that my prostate is only 15cc, my bladder is of normal size when full/empty. I have no pain on urination, non what so ever never had any.   I think I forgot to mention a particularly important bit of history. The pain has been improving. Just recently I developed nocturia. Sometimes I wake up and feel that I SHOULD go. The urge, isn't actually strong. Usually because the volume is only about 100ml-200mls, the bladder doesn't feel uncomfortable. Sometimes I try to go back to sleep by holding it in and ignoring my urge, and that, I find, worsens the RHS abdomen/flank pain.  Btw I've been on 500mg keflex for a week I'm not sure if that did anything.    The reason I'm concerned about the testing is because  1. non of this occurs at day. EVEN if I hold in urine at day it doesn't worsen the pain. That's why I think it may have to do with me lying supine.   2. I've had to go to the toilet before, but this is different. This actually wakes me up COMPLETELY as opposed to semi completely so I'm afraid it might have something to to with my neurologic state.  That's why I'm afraid the test may not be successful at picking things up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thanks for giving me a bit more info... That prostatitis causes pain referred to the perineum etc are text book descriptions of 'typical' cases of prostatitis.In clinical reality,any clinician will vouch for the fact that atypical presentations often occur! Also, prostatic size and risk of prostatitis are not linearly related. Urgency in the supine position is a fairly well known in relation to other conditions such as BPH and at times urinary bladder calculi.It is believed that the 'trigone' of the urinary bladder is in the dependent position while supine and this very sensitive region gets irritated causing this symptom.

    "content": "seen a urologist, formally diagnosed me with prostatitis. He says it's most likely the same bacteria that causes acnes giving me the symptoms. Thank you.  After doing some research, I still have a few questions I hope you can answer. I did a urine flow test he said it was not perfect but normal. My bladder capacity was 600ml. I kept a urinary diary and he said he was seeing normal volumes. (anywhere between 200ml to 500 ml).  Not having done a cystoscopy, how do one distinguish between interstitial cystitis and prostatitis on these findings alone? Because my prostate still feels fine to me. How is it possible you get referred pain without primary pain?  From what I've researched, urologists seem a little \"prostatitis happy\" to me and classify all these symptoms as prostatitis without effective testing. What are the current efforts to reclassify and identify new diseases?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Normal urine is amber colored due to the presence of urochrome, an amorphous pigment. The colour of urine may change due to its pH as well as endogenous and exogenous substances. Green or blue urine may be due to the effect of artificial color in food or drug. Medications including amitriptyline,indomethacin,doxorubicin.cimetidine, promethazine,B-complex vitamins or phenyl butazone and dyes such as methylene blue may cause a greenish colour.Excessive asparagus consumption can turn urine greenish.  Intravenously administered hypnotic agent Propofol also is excreted as a greenish substance. Two soluble pigments produced by a bacterium(psudomonas) - P. aeruginosa, namely pyocyanin and pyoverdin can stain the urine green.  It appeares that you are on a weight reduction regimen. you are on phentermine. phentermine is not known to produce greenish discoloration of the urine.  Therefore in your case, some food coloring agent probably is the prime suspect. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 26 year old unmarried male. Recently I've been diagnosed with urethral stricture as I was infected with UTI and doctor suggested me to undergo tests like uroflowmetery and then RGU/MCU, in which mild elongated stricture was found in anterior urethra(in Meatus part), its around 1.5 inches long. I was dialated after this diagnose and after 1.5 months I am still going good. But my doctor said that stricture can reoccur at any time and I'll have to again go for dilatation or other treatment at that time. Now I am getting married in few months and this disease is upsetting me a lot. I don't know if I should tell this to my fiancee or not, don't know what will be her reaction, most probably it will be canceling of marriage. I actually want to know as what all issues and complications this disease can cause in married life ? Will it affect my partner life also ? I don't want to ruin her life and if I find that my problem is going to affect her life also then I am definitely going to tell her about my disease. I am in a fix now as what should I do and what not. I am even thinking of not marrying at all as why should someone else suffer because of me. This whole marriage thing is also causing psychological disturbance in me. Please guide me as what should I do with my disease ?  Is there any permanent treatment available which is not involved with later complications ? I am more concern about my disease affecting my married/future life.  thanks, Gautam\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Strictures of the urethra frequently occur following gonococcal urethritis.Not all UTIs have the potential to produce strictures in their aftermath.Urethral trauma[blunt, sharp & urethral instrumentation(surgical or otherwise)] are also capable of causing strictures.Have STDs been excluded?.If STDs have been excluded or fully treated, then it should not adversely affect your partner.    You seem to have a stricture involving the anterior urethra.Does it involve the external urethral meatus as well?   I do not know the cause of your stricture. There used to be a popular saying.... \" once a stricture, always a stricture.\"  This was perhaps true when urethral dilatations were the only available option.This is not to say that every stricture in modern times would recur.It only stresses the fact that strictures of urethra can be very fastidious.  I see no reason for being frank with your fianc\u00e9e about this. Regular assessment by a urologist would help in preventing back-pressure changes.It should not interfere with your sexual/reproductive life as long as it is not allowed to worsen.

    "content": "Hi,     Thanks Doctor for you reply. The exact cause of stricture is still unknown. Some 2.5 years back, I passed some blood during urination and there was burning/itching sensation in urinary track at that time. Doctor suggested ultrasound of bladder and kidney and X-ray of lower abdomen. Ultrasound and X-ray were all clear. There was Microscopic pyuria detected in urine test at that time. Doctor prescribed me Pyridium and Amoxicillin for 7 days and I was fine after that.      But recently I was diagnosed with UTI caused by E.Coli, Further tests diagnosed that I've urethral stricture. Now doctor is assuming that I probably passed stone during last time. So he said that stricture was formed due to passing of stone 2.5 years back. The scarring left by stone has now formed into stricture(this was told by my doctor). The stricture affects the meatus part only, doctor didn't told me whether it was external urethral meatus or internal, but he did mentioned that its 1.5 inches long.      STD or any other kind of sexually transmitted infection is out of question as I am not yet involved into any sexual activity. What is back-pressure changes ?      Is there any permanent treatment available which is not involved with later complications and recurrence ?      Is there any side effects of dilatation ? I hope its not going to worse the situation as mine is a mild stricture as diagnosed in RGU/MCU test.  Dr. Kamath: \"If STDs have been excluded or fully treated, then it should not adversely affect your partner.\"     If not adversely, then what and how its going to affect my partner ? What should we do(precautions ? or ?) so that it does not affect her in any way ?    thanks, Gautam\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. My son is currently 4 months old and still has an undescended left testicle. I was referred to a pediatric urologist. No doctor has been able to feel the testicle anywhere in the abdomen, so the urologist wants to do surgery. He doesn't want to put my son under anesthesia until he is 6 months old, so the surgery will be in January. He plans to do a laparoscopic examination to find the testicle. If it is there, he will bring it down. If it has formed incorrectly, he will take it out. If it isn't there, then he will be done with the surgery and my son will only have one.  I am very nervous and uncomfortable with the idea of my son being under anesthesia. I spoke with the urologist a few times about my concerns. He is a wonderful doctor and I think I feel as comfortable as possible with him. He said that I would be uncomfortable no matter how old my son is and that my concern is completely normal. He also said that he would like to fix this issue before my son is a year old.  What I would like to know is, does it put my son at any disadvantage if I postpone the surgery until he is older? What kinds of problems can an undescended testicle cause a male? I do not want to harm him by waiting. If you have done this type of surgery on a baby before, how often have you encountered complications from the procedure itself and from the anesthesia?   Thank you for taking the time to address my concerns.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: What kinds of problems can an undescended testicle cause?",
    "content": "Hi, Please allow me to explain a few important aspects about testicular maldescent.The undescended testis poses certain problems, notably... - the risk of testicular cancer - Risk of torsion of the testicle - risk of reduction in spermatogenesis and - risk posed by an associated inguinal hernia.  For undescended testicle discoverd at birth, there is not much controversy about the management.These are treated by orchidopexy between 12-18 months of age (some prefer at 9-12 months of age).The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends surgical correction at one year of age.  In any case, surgery before 6 months of age is not preferred due to the following reasons... - The blood vessels of the testis are of very thin caliber and thus prone to damage. - some of the undescended testes(rather low lying) may descend spontaeneously upto 6 months of age.  From the age of 2 years, changes occur in the testis which can be found on light microscopy as well as electron microscopy. Bringing the testis down into the scrotum before this age can improve semen quality and fertility later in life.  Men born with bilateral undescended testes usually have very poor sperm quality, even if corrected by surgery.  Unilateral cryptorchidism has a reported infertility rate of about 10%, compared with about 6% reported for the general population of adult men.The fertility reduction following orchiopexy for bilateral cryptorchidism is more marked, about 38%, or 6 times that of the general population.  As for the anesthetic risk, risk between 6 months of age and 2 years is far less compared to the risks in adults (more the age, more the risk, generally).  I trust this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description,it appears that you may have an orchitis.The cause of he orchitis may or may not be related to masturbation.  Masturbation may presumebly result in orchitis in a number of ways, perhaps depending on masturbation techniques. For example, - lubricants used could cause an ascending infection reaching the testis retrogradely via the vas deferens. - violent movements can directly cause blunt trauma to the testis.  As your problem seems to be persisting, you need to consult a doctor who, after examining you would be in a position to arrive at the correct diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bladder Problems caused by Bulging Disc",
    "content": "Hi, Central disc prolapse causing cauda equina syndrome is rare (only present in about 2% of all cases of herniated lumbar discs and in only 0.04% of all patients with low back pain).Usually, a massive, central disc prolapse (L4/L5) is involved in this situation.  Because the reflex arc for micturition reflex is inturrupted, an 'areflexic' urinary bladder develops.  Clinically, a history of unilateral or bilateral leg pain and finding of numbness in the perineum, leg or both and 'saddle anaesthesia' as well as decreased sphincter tone on rectal examination should make one to suspect central disc prolapse (L4/L5) with involvement of the 'cauda equina'. I do not know if you have any of these signs.  'Areflexic bladder' may be managed by the early institution of intermittent self-catheterisation.  Prior to the era of intermittent self catheterization, prognosis for this condition was regarded as dismal.  Intermittent self-catheterization permits the patient to obtain a balanced bladder condition in most cases, and upper urinary tract condition remains good. Close follow-up is mandatory however.

    "title": "Re: Cyst and tumor in Kidney",
    "content": "Hi, Currently the standard for further evaluation of renal cysts is abdominal CT with or without contrast. Bosniak has proposed a classification of renal cystic lesions based on abdominal CT findings.Based on this system, they are classified as  Bosniak I\u2014  IV. This roughly means...   Bosnaik 1- it's a benign cyst. 2- We're still pretty certain it's a cyst. 3- We don't know what it is. 4- It's probably a tumor.  Renal cell carcinomas may occassionally present as cystic masses. Perhaps that is what happened in your mother's case(Bosniak IV).  Usually following a nephrectomy, the remaining kidney(if normally functioning) is adequate enough. In renal cell carcinoma,if 'paraneoplastic syndromes' (esp, hypercalcemia,amyloidosis and hypertension) do not develop and the patient (if obese) reduces weight/stops smoking, the remaining kidney has a fair chance of lasting the lifetime of the patient.

I read of one Doctor who apparently does adult circumcisions while the patient has an induced erection. Apparently the rationale behind this is to ensure the skin is perfectly tight while erect, and not overly tight, as is my concern.   I asked my urologist if he could perform my circumcision in this way. He paused for a few minutes, thought it over, and said, \"Sure, I can do that.\" I then questioned his hesitation as to whether he would be comfortable with performing it this way, to which he replied, \"it's, no problem.\"   Should I just take the risk and get it done normally? I just care about what my penis looks and feels like 'erect' more than 'flaccid.'  Thank you,  Jamie\n\n",

Generally,for army recruitment (in the USA), a 'painful'  left varicocele or any right varicocele is a medical disqualification.  This may vary from country to country.This may not amount to a permanent disqualification.Following succcessful  embolization or surgery, a person may be eligible for recruitment(again may vary from country to country).

Having done that, you should consult a specialist(urology), who would in all probability, request a culture of your urine to see if indeed you have a UTI and treat it. STD's would need to be excluded as well.  Continued sexual activity at this stage may be counter-productive.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: horseshoe kidney and recurrent calculi stones",
    "content": "Hi, I sincerely hope that you are on the said medications under medical supervision. Also,i trust that your doctor is aware of the past history of heroin addiction.  Tramadol, a mild opioid agonist and norepinephrine and serotonin re-uptake inhibitor, is recommended by current guidelines for the treatment of moderate to moderately severe pain in patients who have not responded to previous oral therapy with  NSAIDs or in patients who have contraindications to COX-2 inhibitors and non-selective NSAIDs.  Although, tramadol's risk of substance abuse is low, evidence of  tramadol abuse in the US comes primarily from federally operated programs dealing with adverse drug event (ADE) data.The Drug Abuse Warning Network (DAWN) (from 1995 to 2002), had reported  drug-related emergency department visits attributable to tramadol in more than 12,000 cases ( and codeine drug combinations (CSA Classes III & V) in about 50,000 cases).  Also, there is a real possibility of quite severe withdrawal symptoms after prolonged use.     Tolerance to codeine preparations can develop if they are used regularly, rendering them ineffective. For chronic pain, codeine preparations should be saved for days where pain is at its worst. Severe respiratory depression can occur in individuals with compromised renal function.  However, there are some ways of mitigating the adverse effects of tramadol.   a) An extended-release (ER) formulation of tramadol may be useful,which in contrast with immediate-release (IR) tramadol, allows once-daily dosing, providing around-the-clock analgesia. In clinical studies,tramadol ER has been demonstrated to have a lower incidence of adverse events than for  tramadol IR.  b) There may be some therapeutic advantage to tramadol if it is used in combination with a peripherally acting non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug, rather than coedine.  There may be no point in jumping over to diazepam. Pain management is a complex and individualised process. It is best left to your doctor. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  First of all, thank you in advance to anyone reading this post in an attempt to advise me.  7 weeks ago I had protected sex using a condom.  This was the only time I've had sex in the last several years.  Two days later I felt a minor pain in my groin area and discovered that it was coming from what looked to be a tiny black mound (small raised dot, like a black/purplish pimple but smaller) that had formed at the base of a pubic hair (which was at the base of my penis shaft).  I should note that there was most likely skin on skin contact during the sex, and now I fear that I hadn't rolled the condom far enough down (the location where the black dot appeared wasn't covered by the condom).  From that day onward, every so often I've been feeling a dull stinging pain in my penis and testicles.  It also seems that my groin is more sensitive to heat, if I sit with a laptop above my groin (fully clothed) I soon feel minor pain in my testicles and groin.  I also notice minor pain if I have a very full bladder.  My testicles seem to be far more sensitive, if I sit with them squished or pressured, I seem to notice and feel pain far quicker and more acutely than I had prior to the sexual encounter.  Several days after discovering the black dot I noticed a minor discoloration on the tip of my penis in two different spots.  In the following two weeks I underwent a comprehensive STD test (though I believe that herpes wasn't tested for) and the results were negative.  My sexual partner also claims to have had a negative STD test approximately a month prior to our encounter and hasn't been with anyone since.  I asked the doctor what she thought the small black mound at the root of a pubic hair was and she said she believed it to be something like an irritated hair follicle, or something along those lines, and said it was nothing to worry about.  Approximately two weeks after discovering the black spot it has faded, shrunk, is no longer raised, and is barely noticeable.  But now it has been seven weeks and I've continued to experience pain and would very much appreciate any advice I can get.  The minor discoloration on the tip of my penis also remains.  I'm pretty certain that this is related to the sexual encounter, seeing as I noticed the spot and started feeling differently almost directly afterwards.  The fact that I tested negative for STDs was nice, but I feel that something had definitely happened to me as a result of the sex.  Is it possible that I got a bacterial infection? Please let me know if there is anymore information that I can provide and thanks again for reading.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply doctor.  From a reply that you'd written to another post, I learned of the inflammation urethritis and believe that this may be what I have.  The pain I have in my testicles and groin has continued and my symptoms seem to be in line with urethritis (minor pain with a full bladder and when urinating, frequent urination, a tingling/burning sensation in my groin and testicles).  Although minor, this pain is very apparent and definitely began immediately following my sexual encounter.  I haven't had any discharge from the opening at the tip of my penis but at one point recently have had a small amount of thick white liquid that I squeezed out of a cone of skin on the shaft of my penis (similar to popping a pimple/whitehead).  This small cone of skin sticks out right around the ring where my foreskin was circumcised, which I've had for as long as I can remember, and believe to be a result of my circumcision.  In your opinion, does this seem in line with urethritis?  I plan on going to an urgent care center early next week to have my symptoms looked at, and to be tested again.  Thanks again for your reply.  Best, Anonymous\n\n",

I have had prostatitis before diagnosed and treated.  I also have had about 4 years ago an ejeaculation that was almost straight blood that really hurt.  I know that it is most likely sperm that is concentrated but why is it hurting and how do i make it not be concentrated, what do i need to drink or eat to do it.  I have always had lower back pain the past few years also, which some relate to prostatitis.  I am wanting to know an opinion on this. I am tired of it hurting when i ejaculate, it shouldnt be like that.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Jelly and pain with semen in ejaculations",
    "content": "Hi, Normal seminal fluid is an admixture of spermatozoa suspended in secretions from the testis and epididymis which get mixed at ejaculation with secretions from the prostate, seminal vesicles, and bulbourethral glands. The final composition  comprises the ejaculate(semen).So, the final consistency of the semen will depend on the relative proportions of its constituents.  In humans,the fluid from the seminal vesicles is viscous and yellowish(70% of total volume). The fluid from the prostate is a whitish (sometimes clear), thin fluid. Bulbourethral glands generally secrete a clear secretion.  Human semen normally 'gels' following ejaculation.It also may contain cell debris, gel-like 'particles' or 'mucus streaks'.These are quite normal.  Your semen perhaps contains quite a bit of these  gel-like 'particles'.This may be related to the prostatitis. The normal urethra is quite compliant(ie, the ability to distend).Therefore even if the semen is very thick, it should not caus pain or difficulty while exiting through the urethra.If you are feeling pain in the process, there is a liklihood that there is some narrowing of the urethra which needs to be investigated.  Finding of blood in semen is always unusual and should be fully investigated.As for changing the consistency of the semen, (to the best of my knowledge), i know of no way of doing that!.  Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 36 years old and had a question. Today after intercourse I went to the bath room and took some tolit paper and squeezed out semen before urinating. I noticed in the semen there was a very tiny, about the size of a pen point yellowish/brownish smooth clear thing, kinda hard as well. I figured it was a kidney stone or something. I have had no blood in my urine or semen. and I have not had any trouble with flow of urine or ejaculation. I also do not remember ever passing a kidney stone in the past. I don't have any pain either. I have urinated more then usual today but I have been on a low carb diet for a few months and have been drinking a little bit more water than usual this week. Thanks in advance for any help you can give.\n\n",

    "title": "Permanent penis pump damage",
    "content": "Hello, I started using a penis pump about four years ago, to help with erectile dysfunction and for the most part was careful with the exercises. Over the years I started developing dark patches on the penis head and upper shaft, most likely from some overpumping. I took breaks to allow healing, but it would never quite heal all the way. I once took four months off and still nothing. The red patches I would assume are burst capillaries. I have had them for almost two years and have only pumped a few times in the last year. They don't bother me terribly because there is no pain, but the problems came when I developed blisters. First on the side of my shaft then another in the upper middle below the head. I took three months off from pumping but they still come back when I masturbate.  I can't have sex because of the psychological effect and I do not know what to do. My question is, how can I get rid of the red patches and the blisters. Time has not healed them. Is it possible they are permanent? Can I use creams/pills to help the healing. Would ultrasound therapy help, like with bones, to stimulate the cells? I really don't want to have to explain this to every partner I have. It is very unsightly. Thanks.\n\n",

And they havent even started on my left half of my kidney yet! the pain is so much and its made my bladder weak so i find it very hard to find work at the moment its really affecting my life, i have tried over 20 different herbal remedies of all cultures and they didnt work for me so my advice is save your money and find a private doctor who will take time to care and listen to you its what im trying to do as the NHS (as great as they are and the herbal stuff don't seem to be doing much good).  Guys hospital London an amazing hospital real caring doctors.    Good luck and hope you do better than i have.  kind regards  Hayz\n\n",

    "content": "Hi spoiledfree, There is only one type of urinary stone that is known to dissolve by just altering the urinary pH....ie, the uric acid stones.these form in a acid urine and are known to dissolve by just making the urine alkaline!.  There are claims that certain medications, herbal products etc dissolve urinary stones.To date, there is appears to be no undisputable evidence available to support these claims.  So, at this stage, the best recourse for you may be to follow the advice of your urologist, undergo the ESWL to its completion, follow the dietary precautions(if any) and then drink enough water to produce about 2000 mls of urine a day.This will go a long way in preventing recurrences.

    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned when the circumcision had been done. If it looks like 'lint'. it could be a suture remnant.  Although absorbable sutures are commonly used, at times they do not get absorbed as they are supposed to and the body may atart to extrude it, just as it usually does to a foreign body.This may happen when the suture(or knot) may get walled off by fibrous tissue and thus escape from being digested by the body's fluids.  You need to consult a surgeon who after assessing you will be in a better position to advise you regarding this. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There is this thing known as the Horrible Coincidence Phenomenon, in which something totally unrelated to a prior event would seem, by chronology at least, to probably have connection to the prior event. However, there is nothing I can think of that could, via cause-and-effect, relate the lithotripsy with the leg pain ,and it does, indeed, sound like a low back problem, probably sciatica, based on your description of the pain and its pathway. There's also another corrolary in medicine, regarding patients who say they've never had a given problem before: \"You do now!\" It's not intended to minimize your suffering nor your concern about the relationship between the procedure and the subsequent new problem, only that there is never a rule in play that you can't have more than one thing go wrong at the same time -- or even in the same week.   You can reasonably expect your urologist to be on the money with this one. Sciatica could, of course, have been caused by some physical maneuver that was tangentially related to position of your body for the lithotripsy, but this couldn't be considered in any way related to the actual procedure, and it would still be a pretty amazing coincidence. However you got this second problem, it certainly will require attention, as it can be extremely painful and sometimes temporaritly disabling. At the very least an orthopedic consult would be in  order if it doesn't resolve on its own within a week.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I would appreciate your medical opnion on my situation which is as follows:  I am a 29 year old male married for 3.5 years and undergoing fertility investigation. In my US they found a unilateral undescended testes at the distal inguinal canal with normal echogenicity measured at 4-5ml. Now i have been given the option to choose between orchidopexy and orchidectomy. I really don't want to lose tissue that may be possibly producing sperm. I would like to maximise my chances of conceiving. Is it possible that because the testes is prescrotal it may be producing sperm and if so is there a way to determine this? would you recommend a biopsy or some other kind of scan which may show activity of that testes? lastly theUS report also said that the technician could not visualise a epididymis on the same side. Is it possible to have only agenesis of the epididymis on one side or do you think he just could localise it?  Thank you very much for your time and attention. Your advice will be much appreciated\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Deciding between orchidopexy and orchidectomy?",
    "content": "Hi, The undescended testis poses certain problems, notably... - the risk of testicular cancer - Risk of torsion of the testicle - risk of reduction in spermatogenesis. For undescended testicle discoverd at birth, there is not much controversy about the management.These are treated by orchidopexy between 12-18 months of age. (some prefer 9-12 months of age).  The following discussion is about undescended testicle presenting late(in adults).  Generally, there are 3 options in the management of the undescended testicle -- - orcidopexy - orchidectomy and - monitoring of the testis(close observation).  Firstly, the risk of testicular cancer is significantly higher in an undescended testicle than in a descended one(the risk of testicular cancer is 20-40 times higher in undescended testes compared to normally descended testes).  Most cancers of the testis occur in the 15-40 year age group.  The overall risk of testicular cancer even in men with descended testis is relatively small (3 per 1,000 in the USA). This excess risk appears to remain following orchidopexy.There appears to be a higher risk for  testicular cancer in the other(normaly descended) testis as well! Therefore, it is debatable whether prophylactic removal of the undescended testicle is indicated. Moreover, any benifit has to be weighed against the inherant risks of surgery and anesthesia in the adults.  Risk of torsion is increased. In malignant intra-abdominal testicles,the risk is higher.  Placing the testicle in he scrotum, however, allows for easy periodic examination so that if a tumor does develop, it can be detected early.         As far as sprem production is concerned, most undescended testes in adult men produce little or no mature sperm.  Pain, impalpability of the testicle, and  torsion are indications for orchidectomy.  Following unilateral orchiectomy, it is unclear whether there is need for close observation of the remaining testicle.  Agenesis of the epididymis,blind- ending vas deference and other congenital abnormalities are known to occur in some cases of undescended testicles.It is not always possible to identify these anomalies on imaging. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Nowadays, testicular maldescent is generally spotted soon after birth than in the decades gone by.  Still, late presentations continue to be seen.The rates for late presentations vary from country to country but even in the developed world,this is still a reality.  There is a debate whether these late presentations are truely 'missed' cases or a relatively recently talked about entity named 'late ascent' of a descended testicle.  Most surgeons recommend surgery(orchidopexy) for an undescended testicle within 18 months after birth because the spermatogenesis steadily declines in these testes. Also there is an increased risk of malignancy(which is thought to remain even after successful surgery).  For your son,an exploration for the testis and orchidopexy (if feasible) would be in order at the earliest. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi doctor I am 19 and i never used to have a problem with P.E, however over the past couple of years i have smoked marijuana and used cocain occasionally and i think this may have something to do with the problem. As my penis starts to become erect i can feel that it is more sensitive than ussuall and I get the feeling that i need to ejaculate right away. I never do ejaculate right away but this feeling does not go away and i have not been lasting more that a couple of min on the last few occasions. Also after ejaculation my testicles sometimes ache and they also seem to ache after long car journeys. The reason i stopped smoking marijuana was because the last few times when i was high i felt discomfort (it is hard to pinpoint exactly where but the feeling was at the bottom of my shaft and under my testicles). However i only felt this when i was high which i found strange. It felt like the musle that stops your flow of urine was being flexed and i couldn't relax it. I have only stopped smoking marijuana for 2 weeks. Also sometimes the tip of my penis is cold to the touch and i don't know if maybe blood circulation is a problem. I have also been in contact with a website called herbal love and they seem to think that my problem is exsesive masturbation and that my sexual organs need to heal. They told me to stop masturbating for a few weeks and allow myself to heal.  I only ever masturbate once every couple of days if that so i do not no what to take from this message. Are recreational drugs the cause of my problem. Should i stop masturbating? What should i do to go about fixing my problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Research shows that regular marijuana use compromises the ability to learn and to remember information by impairing the ability to sustain,focus,and shift attention.  Marijuana amplifies one's pre-existing personality traits such as  aggressiveness,anxiety, paranoia, fearfulness, gregariousness,etc (is it possible that you have anxiety as a trait?)   In men, this can cause decreased sperm counts and ....very heavy users can experience erectile dysfunction.  Marijuana 'distorts the sense of time', so there may be an illusion of prolonged arousal and orgasm (as it 'distorts the sense of time' it may be expected to similarly cause the  feeling that you 'need to ejaculate right away').  It is probable that the symptoms you have been experiencing may be as a result of Marijuana or cocaine use.  It may be worth consulting a psychiatrist for more details. Best wishes!\n\n",

Be conscientious in doing this and take the record with you to see both a psychiatrist and a urologist.  Your symptoms may be psychological in origin, but there is also the possibility that there could be a urological reason.  Keeping a conscientious record will give you both control of the information, and help reduce your anxiety about your symptoms.  Fortunately, there are medictions and behavioral treatments available for either cause.  If you use marijuana or cocaine during this time, be honest and record it along with symptoms you experience.  Your doctor(s) will be helped in making the correct diagnosis by the record of your symptoms.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

Here is what I have do far:              Symptoms before 10 day course of Doxycycline 100MG (prior to Nov 7th/09) *Urine leakage when I bend over *Slight burning sensation when urinating (may just be paranoia) *Frequent urination *Discomfort in testicles/under lower shaft of penis, and prostate\u00a0 -more so after sex or long car journeys *Uncomfortable feeling of being on the brink of ejaculation during sex & Masturbation Been tested for Chlamydia and gonorrhea since last unprotected sex Also used cocaine very occasionally before symptoms and smoked marijuana frequently before symptoms  To start with I only noticed the feeling of aching in my prostate (my guess it is the prostate) and testicles when i was high, and then it would become unnoticable. I deemed this feeling to be paranoia since i was high however once my symptoms worsened I stopped smoking marijuana as of Nov 1st/09  \u00a0Went to Walk in Clinic and was prescribed a 10 day course of Doxycycline for possible Epididymitis. Urine sample was tested for UTI (urinary tract infection) and was clear. (Nov 7th/09)  After reaserch on the internet i decided prostatitis was a possibility and although it is\u00a0a problem\u00a0that older men ussually suffer from, my symptoms matched that of prostatitis. (let me know your opinion on this)  \u00a0-Nov 9th/09 Symptoms of frequent urination and leakage seem to have subsided a little.\u00a0While masturbating\u00a0I could still feel something not exactly right (pressure around prostate possibly) it was not nearly as bad and I lasted alot longer. Right testicle ached a little after ejaculation but then subsided.  Masturbated recently and my performance improved even more. It feels as though there is a muscle that is ussually tensed during masturbation/sex, however i have been able to relax it more recently, therfore bring able to control ejaculation.  I havnt done any drugs and I have Also been taking antibiotics, I am still not sure what my problem is but I am convinced that it is not likely to be anxiety. I am alot happier to know that I am doing better right now. Just though I would update thanks again for everyones advice so far.\n\n",

As the % increases, potential for local and systemic toxicity increases proportionately. So far,there has not been widespread inclination or need to put 10% lidocaine through trials. 5% lidocaine appears to be satisfactory enough for most purposes.  If one is trying to use topical lidocaine for delaying ejaculation i would strongly advise against it and would like to warn that even potential for mortality from respiratory arrest exists as the % is hiked up.

    "title": "Re: urine retention",
    "content": "Hi, From your profile, i gather that you had undergone 'right and left knee tibial tubercle transfers' in the past (exactly when and for what indication is not clear).The indication for urinary retention is also unclear.  The prime indications for tibial tubercle transfer are said to be  -  2 or more complete patellar dislocations with trivial trauma or  - recurrent subluxations with or without pain causing \"giving way.\" of the knee joint.  Was your urinary retention in any way related to a fall? The reason why i am raising these questions is to try and determine which type bladder dysfunction you may be suffering from(The 'autonomous' bladder or the 'automatic' / Reflex bladder).  Assuming that you probably have an 'autonomous' neurogenic bladder, the following protocol may help you to understand the basis behind intermittent catheterizations...    The bladder is usually drained on a regular basis, either based on a timed interval (ex, on awakening, then every 3-6 hours during the day, and before retiring to bed) or based on bladder volume.  One should remember that the average adult urinary bladder holds approximately 400-500 mls of urine. Ideally, the amount drained each time should not exceed 400-500 mL.   This drainage limit may be titrated by decreasing the fluid intake or by increasing the frequency of catheterizations. For example,if catheterization is performed every 6 hours and the amount drained is 800 mls, then one should increase the frequency of catheterization to, perhaps, every 4 hours to maintain the volume drained at 400-500 mL.  Intermittent catheterization is designed to simulate normal voiding and to prevent over-distension of the urinary bladder. Usually, an average adult empties the bladder 4-5 times a day. Thus, catheterization should occur 4-5 times a day; however, individual catheterization schedules may vary, depending on the amount of fluid taken in during the day.  I hope this information may help to clarify some of your doubts. Best wishes!\n\n",

After that everything started to go down hil. My erections are never as hard as they used to be, and it takes a while for me to get an erection compared to how long it used to take. Even if I do get an erection it literally subsides within seconds, as it shrinks right before my eyes.

    "content": "I'm not a doctor but I have something similar, although not as bad and its getting better slowly.  It sounds dumb but my bruising was caused by the toilet seat. You have to analyze everything you do every day. I found that allowing your body to heal is the only cure. Avoid any kind of temperature change hot or cold when you take a shower. Avoid wearing clothes whenever possible. Avoid any kind of erection. You'll have to take up some hobbies to keep your mind off of it!! It takes many months to heal but it does and very very slowly. Its tough, you can't live without walking around. If the large blood vessels are broken witch hazel from the band aid section in the store helps. You can't use it more then once a day though cause the 15% alcohol can irritate the skin.  The bottom line is you have to leave it alone which very difficult when the healing is so slow. You can't see it change from day to day BUT it will absolutely change for the better from month to month. Avoid any kind of movement or \"cure\" and just try to leave it alone.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your profile indicates that regarding your medical history you have entered \"Got AdHd, thats it I think\". So, you perhaps believe that you are basically suffering from ADHD(Attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder)--characterized by the co-existence of hyperactivity & attentional problems.  This disorder (a controversial one at that!), has a constellation of symptoms.ADHD may also accompany disorders such as anxiety or depression.  Going by some of the symptoms,[For example,some symptoms of ADHD such as \"being easily distracted, missing details, forgetting things\" ], it is not surprising that you might have led yourself to believe that your problem fits into the picture.  But, here are some symptoms of ADHD which may not support that diagnosis: -  They have 'difficulty waiting for things they want' or waiting    their turns in games (you would not wait to go to the toilet) - Being 'constantly in motion' (again,may hurry you to the toilet).  ADHD is a very ambiguous & complex disorder which can't be perhaps made in a hurry.  Bed wetting of new onset in young adults and teenagers can be due to...  diabetes mellitus,stress and anxiety, excessive coffee intake,alcohol,diuretics,certain medications such as sleeping tablets,sleep apnea and UTI's(urinary tract infections).  To confirm a diagnosis of ADHD or otherwise, would certainly need the expertise of an experienced psychiatrist.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Certain amount of swelling of the testicle is usual after a hernia repair especially if the hernia was large or in cases of recurrent hernias.  This is proportional to the extent of dissection involved(depends on the individual case).  This usually resolves over a few weeks following surgery.  About the resumption of sexual activity, views of individual surgeons may vary.  It may not be ethical for me to advise regarding that. Your surgeon is the best person to advise you because, he will be no doubt in a better situation to know the details of the surgical procedure performed on you. I hope you will understand.

    "title": "Re: Bad Circumcision? Hair on entire shaft...",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you very much for the update. I do note that certain of my queries are unanswerd. Let be begin by giving you a short explanation of what is meant by Hypertrichosis (excessive hairs on the body).   This can be... - generalised or  - localized. The localized forms may be either  - Congenital Localized Hypertrichosis or  - Acquired Localized Hypertrichosis.  I will list some of the known forms of congenital Localized Hypertrichosis... - Congenital lumbosacral Hypertrichosis - Congenital cubital Hypertrichosis - congenital hairy ear - congenital anterior cervical Hypertrichosis  Of note however, is that Congenital penile Hypertrichosis hardly finds a mention in the medical literature(to the best of my knowledge).  Localized acquired hypertrichosis is often secondary to irritation or trauma. Circumscribed hypertrichosis has been noted following repeated friction as on the shoulders of sack bearers or sites of habitual biting in patients with mental retardation. Also,it has been noted that increased hair growth can occur underneath casts(used for immobilizing fractures)-underlining the importance of friction.  In your case, i am not certain what could be the cause of hairs on the shaft of the penis.A technical fault in the circumcision procedure could presumably cause this....equally so, repeated shaving of the penile shaft. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "3 month old has had 3 uti's and two bouts of septicemia - Pl",
    "content": "Hi there,  I am actually writing this from the hospital right now. I am at a loss of how to deal with all of this.. The last 3 months have been incredibly stressful and we have almost lost our infant son on 3 different occassions.  He has had 3 confirmed UTI's. 2 of which led to a kidney infection and ecoli sepsis. We have the pediatrician in our area doing all kinds of tests, but they just recently (since being admitted this time for sepsis) have started taking it seriously. He is referring us to a specialist out of town a pediatric urologist.  Basically my questions are :  1. I have been reading a lot about septicemia, and it's potentially life threatening especially in babies. The pediatrician after the first incident told me that he doubted that it would happen again because my son would be older and should be able to fight it off. Do you think that he should have taken this more seriously and atleast did some follow up urine tests?  2. What are complications that could develop from having 2 different episodes of sepsis? My son is only 3 months old and has had it twice now.  3. He has been placed on prophylactic antibiotics until they can get to the bottom of this. My worries are that the bacteria will become resistant to these and we could end up in more problems than we are now.  4. I'm very frustrated with the care that he has received thus far. Since the first incident, after being discharged when he was only 7 weeks old I had taken him back into emerg about 3-4 different times suspecting another UTI. One of those times he did have another confirmed UTI and was placed on oral antibiotics and sent home. The pediatrician (same one as now) almost made me feel as though I was crying wolf and made me feel very silly for continuing to bring him back. I know now that I was right and that I had every reason to worry.... What do you think about this behaviour of this pediatrician? Every day that we have been in this hospital he comes in the morning to see us and he brings about 2 med students with him and asks them a bunch of questions about everything, they are left stunned and don't know the answers and I feel as though I have gotten none of my questions answered!! I don't want my son to be used as a training device, this is serious stuff!!  I would just appreciate some advice as I am having a real hard time coming to terms with going home now. I am afraid that we wont be so lucky if it happens again.  I also wanted to mention that he has had a VCUG done w/ the first incident and it came back negative. He has also had two ultrasounds done on his kidney and bladder.... They are repeating these tests.  Its' now Day 7 of him being on IV antibiotics and they are releasing us from the hospital and to be put on oral antibiotics.. Do you think this is sufficient considering the circumstances?   It could me a month or more before we get in to see the specialist because this pediatrician wants to have all of the results back first from all of the blood tests, vcug, etc.  I don't know if I can wait that long!!  Please help..\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 3 month old has had 3 uti's and two bouts of septicemia - Pl",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly i empathize with you regarding the problems you are enduring. It is rather unfortunate when something goes sour in a \"doctor-patient\" relationship.  It appears that the pediatrician  regularly visited your child (\"Every day that we have been in this hospital he comes in the morning to see us\"), is interested in teaching (\"Every day that we have been in this hospital he comes in the morning to see us and he brings about 2 med students with him and asks them a bunch of questions about everything\"), and from your description,probably has thought about your son's problem along the same lines as most doctors would have tended to.....  UTI's in children(especially in newborns and infants) are at times difficult to diagnose - to put it mildly.The problem is in collecting the right sample of urine for a culture test or microscopy.One of the best urine samples for a urinary culture in children is urine that has been aspirated via a suprapubic puncture.Clinical manifestations of UTI in this age group is also unlike in adults.  The other concern in that age group is that if clinical suspicion of UTI is very strong, one may need to treat, pending culture reports. In other instances, antibiotics may need to be given even if labs are negative but clinical suspicion is too strong.  You say \"Since the first incident, after being discharged when he was only 7 weeks old I had taken him back into emerg about 3-4 different times suspecting another UTI\". Would you mind clarifying what symptoms made you to suspect UTI?  As the reports of the tests are awaited,it may be better to wait and then consult the specialist with all the reports on hand- otherwise it may cause further delay and aggravate your worries. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I gather you had been involved in a fairly serious accident.   I do not know whether there was an injury to your testicles at that time (which could have caused testicular rupture as well as hematoceles).  Chronic hematoceles can be notoriously difficult to differentiate from testicular tumors.  Secondary hydroceles can also occur following scrotal trauma.These are fairly innocuous (rarely can cause testicular atrophy due to pressure, especially if large and tense).  If your doctor happens to suspect chronic hematoceles, he/she may advise removal because of the dilemma the surgeon may face at surgery.  Best wishes!  Wishing you the best of luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: penis popped and bent during sex now it is ribbed?",
    "content": "Hi, Your description fits in more with a penile fracture rather than a problem to do with the veins. Penile fracture, occurs frequently during the erect state of the penis (during sexual intercourse or masturbation). It is due to rupture of the \"tunica albuginea'- a fibrous envelope sorrounding the corpora cavernosa of the penis.The corpora also may fracture along with this depending upon the forces involved.  As the injury appears to be fairly recent, there is likely to be a hematoma at that site and thus likely to be soft or 'boggy' to touch.  Please consult your doctor for confirmation.

    "content": "Uncircumsised, I have had a longstanding problem with rash, inchiness, small blisters etc. on my foreskin and prepuce - especially after sex. I have dealt with it by washing after sex, careful drying, and the use of creams such as Canastan - on my Dr.'s advice.  A year ago this evelved into a shiny reddish sore patch at the line where foreskin is attached to the penis. It leasted a long time.  Where this patch has healed is unusual looking - my doctor thought it might be scarring. It looks to me like the foreskin has adhered to the glans there - on one side - about 2mm of skin. During sex it will pull back a little causing soreness for some time.  I want to ask my doctor to refer me to someone. Should it be a urologist or a dermatologist?

    "content": "To understand why long-ago, one-side-only epididymectomy has been causing chronic pain (which is low level aching and a somewhat painful operated on testis and is not life disrupting pain for years and then, for some unknown reason, changes becoming constant, often ghastly physical pain for months-- anti-inflammatories can't be taken due to a stomach easily damaged by them), is it possible to do endoscopy to examine the inside of the half of the scrotum where the epididymectomy was done long ago? I hope a urologist can spot the problem area and then, if need be, cut open the scrotum to repair whatever is causing the dreadful, constant physical pain.  This same pain problem occurred in the past, post-epididymectomy, and then ended, restoring the half of the scrotum to the low-level pain and the somewhat painful testis.  A recent scrotal, color doppler ultrasound scan showed that blood flow to both testes is fine and OK. The scan also was negative for masses and tumors.  Aside from the ultrasound scan, what other kind of scan is useful to understand what might be wrong in the side of the scrotum where the epididymectomy was done?  [The surgeon who did the epididymectomy is long dead so another one will have to be consulted on this matter.]   Thanks\n\n",

The pain goes through phases and is either of these two: 1) a constant, intense stinging-burning pain (which was common in the early weeks of this 2 month long bad pain spell which began on 26 August 09, and seems to be uncommon now), and 2) a constant, somewhat sickening-nauseating, deep, heavy aching which varies in intensity over the hours or days.  The simplest of body movements can make the pain suddenly worse, and ejaculation either makes the pain skyrocket instantly (less common) or causes the pain to increase within an hour after ejaculating and the pain then remains very high and constant for several days before moderating. At times it has felt as if something were being tugged or pulled internally by the right flank of the right side of the scrotum. This effect has been noted during some - but not all - sexual sessions.   Thanks\n\n",

Advanced endoscopic systems are now available and they have made many organs accessible by endoscopy.  Whether endoscopy will be routinely used for accessing a certain organ or not depends on certain factors.... - ease with which the said organ can be accessed by 'open' surgery. - length of the scar needed for the 'open' surgery. - post-operative pain profile - some other specific technical advantages.

    "title": "Post Circumcision Penis Pain - Please Help!",
    "content": "Hello,  This is my first post and I was hoping someone on the forum would be able to help me out.  First, I'll go ahead and explain a bit about my history.  I was born out of the states and was not circumcised at birth.  At the age of 22, I was circumcised for the first time.  About two weeks into the circumcision, the sensitivity and pain around and on the head of the penis area did not go away.  I kept going back to the surgeon who performed the operation but he didn't seem to have any answer for me.  He told me to just keep waiting it out.  So I did and waited over a year or two with no luck.  The hyper sensitivity and the pain on the head of the penis still remained and didn't get any better.  So I had a second circumcision done which I hoped would remove the pain but that also did not help.  The same pain that I felt after the first operation hasn't gone away in over 3-4 years.  The head of the penis and the tip of the penis head (I believe it is called the meatus) are the most sensitive.  When I say sensitive and painful, I mean any form of direct contact causes a stinging sensation.  Pouring running water over my penis is okay but when I put on boxers or any sort of touch is made to the penis head area, it stings quite a bit.  The color is also the same redness in some areas of the head that has not gone away either.  It looks very irritated.    I've tried everything possible to try and relieve the pain over the years including trying different kinds of creams and visited other doctors.  All of them said that they couldn't figure out what it was.  One doctor suggested that the nerves in the penis head were overly excited or possibly damaged which was causing the hyper sensitivity but didn't have a solution to how to fix the nerves.  My question is if it anyone knows of any solution to the problem or if there is a cream or option out there that I can do to relieve the pain?  I'm particularly worried because I'll be getting married in less than a year now.  I have never had sex before and my future wife to be will be my first.  With this painful area though, I'm quite scared of the pain and will be quite sad especially since I have waited to have sex up to this point.  If anyone can help, that'd be great.  Thank you so much in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for your post.I will be very thankful if you could clarify a few things... - What was the indication for your first circumcision? - did you have similar pain 'before' the first circumcision? - How did you come to the conclusion that a re-circumcision will get rid of that pain? - under what kind of anesthesia these circumcisions were performed? - before surgery, had you been worried about the possibility of excessive sensitivity of the 'to-be exposed' exposed glans? If yes, for how long?  As i don't have answers to the above questions, let me tell you few things about the nerve supply to the penis.the main nerves are - the dorsal nerves of the penis and - the perineal nerves. Most of the glans is supplied by the dorsal nerves and a small area adjacent to the frenulum is supplied by the perineal nerves. There are some more nerves which are usually overlooked -they are the autonomic nerves(sympathetic and parasympathetic).  Pain may be arising and conducted via the sensory nerves(mostly) or at times the autonomic nerves. I will name a few conditions which can cause pain in the glans... -  a neuroma of one of these nerves - a condition called 'causalgia' which also can follow any trauma (but here the pain is usually 'unprovoked'. If you share with us some more info about the questions of mine, we may be in a better position to offer a better opinion.Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Post Circumcision Penis Pain - Please Help!",
    "content": "Hi,  Thank you so much for the reply and willingness to help.  Here the answers to your questions that I hope will give you better insight into my situation.  1)  I was originally circumcised because I was told that it was both healthier and better for my sex life in the future.  Looking back now, I'm not sure if either was true but those were my original intentions.  2)  Before the first circumcision, the pain was extremely sensitive because growing up uncircumcised, I never really pulled my foreskin back and because of that, anytime any sort of contact was made to the penis head, it was extremely painful and sensitive.  A couple weeks before the first procedure, I was told by my surgeon that it was good to start exposing the head to the outside world to bring about the desensitization process.  I tried to do this as much as I could but it definitely was extremely painful each time I did so.  3)  I came to the conclusion that a re-circumcision would relieve the pain because there was a special urologist surgeon who gave me a slight possibility/hope that if he performed the operation, there was a chance it might remove the pain.  He wasn't giving any sort of guarantee and he basically said it was a risk and a chance.  Because I was so desperate and was willing to take even a chance to remove all the pain, I went ahead and did so.  4)  I honestly can't remember which anesthesia's I was under when I got the operation done.  I believe it was general anesthesia though in both instances.  5)  Before the surgery, I never really worried about the possibility of excessive sensitivity of the \"to-be exposed\" glans because everyone told me that even though the first couple days/weeks are painful after a circumcision, eventually the penis head develops a tissue around it and it gets desensitized to touch and returns to normal.  Aside from this, I've looked in other forums and right now, I'm about to try three different medications at once.  Some people said that they might possibly worked as it did work for some others who were experiencing pains in their penis.  1)  Cranberry extract pills 2)  Prostate wellness pills 3)  MSM liquid/lotion  Also, another person in a forum recommended EMLA cream.  Do you suggest I take either of these in combination or no?  Thanks so much again for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you so much for providing some details. Still i fail to understant certain things... You say \"A couple weeks before the first procedure, I was told by my surgeon that it was good to start exposing the head to the outside world to bring about the desensitization process. I tried to do this as much as I could but it definitely was extremely painful each time I did so\". Were you told to keep retracting the prepuce periodically?  Obviously you did not get 'desensitised'.Then why did you take the risk of    undergoing the first circumcision? Understandably, you may not be remembering the nature of the anesthetic 4 years later. And why would you undergo a second circumcision?? You say \"Aside from this, I've looked in other forums and right now\"... it is always good to have different points of view. I only sincerely wish that you had done this prior to your first circumcision. I have no personal experience(in my practice) with the three different medications you have mentioned. Sorry i can't help you there!\n\n",

I went to see an urologist and he did DRE and concluded that I have prostatitis and put me on prescription medicine for 6 weeks.   I did not have any pain before I went to the doctor. However few hours after my visit I started feeling little pain in my pelvic area. I have never had such a pain before. However the pain is not very heavy. If I touch the area from outside I do not feel the pain. It seems the pain is internal.  It does not stop me from doing any work. I still do my workout the normal way I used to do. However even after 5 days I still have a feeling in my pelvis area. The pain is very light and does not prevent me from doing anything. However it just worries me since I thought it would probably be because of DRE and would probably go away after a few days. It has been better but it hasn't gone away completely. Please advice.\n\n",

At the beginning of the urine flow, something inside my abdomen feels like it is shifting and then settling back into place.  Almost as if my bladder becoming full caused my intestines to move slightly, only to have them move back in where are supposed to go when my bladder is emptied.  I know that this sounds really weird, but this NEVER happened before June of this year.  Does this sound like something I should see a doctor about?

(One study from the Netherlands has concluded that Micturition and phase III of the migrating motor complex of the intestines are associated in time). Well, i mentioned this because of the very interesting question you have raised.  In your case, i suggest that you should get examined to exclude an incisional hernia(if your hysterectomy was abdominal) or an occult inguinal or femoral hernia which could cause such a problem.Thank you for this very thought- provoking post.\n\n",

There are 2 kinds of renal pelvis which are important for a surgeon, especially if open surgery is contemplated. One is an intra-renal pelvis (the pelvis is almost completely within the kidney)and the other is an extra-renal pelvis (the pelvis is almost completely outside the kidney). The intra-renal pelvis can make 'open' stone removal (nephrolithotomy/pyelolithotomy) technically demanding and time-consuming. I hope this information is of use to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I have been diagnosed as having bacterial prostatitis by a first urologist, and have been taking levaqiun, 500 mg per day, for more than a month, and continuing. Note that I have never had a UTI diagnosed and urinanalysis has never found problems. Apparently the infection is only in the prostate itself. The first urologist diagnosed bacterial prostatitis with prostatic fluid having a high white blood cell count, from rectal exam, etc., with no bacteria isolated. After the levaquin the symptoms are somewhat better but still very bothersome. This is the second levaquin round. A second opinion by another, well regarded, urologist noticed high post void amount of urine being retained, which was tested for twice, and recommended green light laser surgery with a cytoscopy included as part of the surgery to check for problems I guess. The first urologist said no surgery now because I might still be infected, and surgery when infected could have side effects like sepsis from the infection, even though today the first urologist examined me thought the infection was generally not detectable, except from the symptoms I complain about. The second urologist said I don't need the levaquin, stop taking it. I am confused! Could I have prostatitis and BPH at the same time? Is the green light surgery safe at this point, with another two weeks of levaquin before the surgery? I have asked the two urologists to consult with each other. I am leaning towards the surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! About me: I am a 24 years old, uncircumcised male and for the past 12 months I have a constant girlfriend and I am faithful to her. She regularly checks her health in a gynecologist. We have protected vaginal sex, but unprotected oral and anal sex.  Situation: My problem appeared this month; sometimes, I notice a rather colorless fluid discharge from my penis. That discharge smells extremely bad and it can leave stinky stains in my underwear. I do not experience any pain in my genital's area, though. Any ideas?  Thank you very much for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It looks as tough you may have some kind of 'urethritis' (very likely to be due to one or some of the anerobic microbes or E.coli(gram negative).I am at a loss to understand why a seemingly careful guy such as you should have 'protected' vaginal sex but NOT 'protected' anal sex. I suggest that you should see a doctor, get the discharge examined by microscopy/culture as well as get your urine cultured. I am very glad that you are faithful to your girl friend, but have also the faith that 'protected' anal sex is safe for BOTH of you. Right now unprotected oral sex is not advisable, at least till such time this problem is sorted out.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Im a 24yr male.  Few months ago i went to the doc with pain in my left testicle and swelling. He told me that i had a cyst and to take antiboitic for 10 days.  Which i did, the terrible pain went away which was replaced with a dull ache and a kind of warm sensation, sometimes i have a feeling down the inside of my left leg too.  There is pain now and again on the left handside below my belly inside.  The swelling did not go away. There is one maybe two lumps along the vein/cord along with what i presume is varicocele (bag of warms is how ive seen it described in a number of places).  I have not had sex since this discovery and have not masterbated in two weeks.  Primarily because each time i do it swells slightly and become uncomfortable. Is ejeculation harming me? makking it worse? Im not sure what to do, im so uncomfotable going to the doctors, it was such a big thing for me to go the last time. Especially with this sensitive area and in this cold environment, my sac seems to tighten up and is very hard to examine, this is most probly the reason why the varicocele was not even noticed last time.  It doesnt help that i am quite small down there as well, which is a whole different story of embarrassment.  Any help would be really appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Possible causes of scrotal swelling include inguinal hernia, , hydrocele, and varicocele. Other causes that are  less common in adults include lymphedema, and a spermatocele.  - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, the pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum 15-20% of the normal fertile males may have Varicoceles . Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different  anatomic factors.  Important consideration regarding varicoceles in adolescents are: - the varicocele is a progressive lesion - early repair of the varicocele prevents the development of infertility.  Surgery is the primary form of treatment for varicoceles.However, not all varicoceles need surgical correction.   Direct clinical examination is essential to determine the proper management approach. I advise you to follow with your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Leaking urine I think",
    "content": "Hi,  I have oufnd that I seem to be leaking what smells like urine, during the day. I work in an office and it seems to be worst when at work sitting down. My underwear and even trousers seems to get progressively wetter although I can't detect or feel any actually leaking of fluid form my penis or anywhere else. My testicles and surroudning area gets very damp, sometimes it seems like it's my testicles that are leaking.   I do have social anxiety issues and issues with needing to pee quite frequently especially when drinking a lot of coffee etc which I do at work (I know all this sounds obvious!)  I have issues going in public toilets, and ones at work - I have to use cubicles as I simply can't go if anyone can see me at all, this is probably related to bullying at school (I am now 31). I think there is a bit of a viscious circle where I worry that people will notice I'm going to to the toilet  a lot and then not go, and so as I am holding it in it leaks which just makes it worse. I don;t go otu very often becuase of worrying abotu whether there will be toilets and if there will be cubicles available.  I can go all night without needing to go, and usually during the day it's about every hour or so. Trips to the cinema can be tricky though.  I do have a piercing as well, a prince albert with a ring in it, I guess that might contribuet by giving the urine something to run down???  It doesn;t happen so much at home but I'm more relaxed and go when I need to at home.  Would dearly love to find an answer as to what is causing this and if there is any solution.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Leaking urine I think",
    "content": "Hi, The more i read your history, the less i tend to think of an organic problem as a diagnosis. You say \"I can go all night without needing to go, and usually during the day it's about every hour or so\". In many conditions, the opposite happens. This suggests that you tend to drink a lot of liquids during the day. There are a few conditions where a person tends to drink lots of water(inappropriate to fluid needs). These are also known as 'psychogenic polydipsia' or 'potomania' ('beer potomania' is a related entity).This occurs in a number of conditions (more often in middle aged women)... - obscessive compulsive disorders and  - certain other psychiatric disorders. I think you should be thoroughly investigated for what looks like an overflow incontinence perhaps due to excessive water intake.But organic causes need to be excluded first. Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Mike,       You may want to do a web search on this Balanitis xerotica obliterans, sounds similar to your problem. At any rate try to make it to the doctors office, if anything it will put your worries to rest.  Balanitis xerotica obliterans is a common problem that affects the penis in childhood or old age; its cause is not fully understood. The glans or foreskin develops a characteristic white appearance and the skin seems thickened and stiff. This may cause narrowing of the urethral opening (meatus \u00ad the hole at the tip of the penis) and can interfere with passing water. Circumcision is usually performed to prevent fibrosis, scarring of the foreskin, and phimosis (see phimosis). Occasionally, the urethral opening needs surgical widening. It is important to have this differentiated from leukoplakia, a pre-malignant condition (see below).   Gloria\n\n",

Lets us look at this problem from the point of view of the 2 streams of urine that you have mentioned (forked urinary stream). This can be caused by chronic trauma to the meatus. the cause can be Congenital (with a web deviding the meatus into two parts), any balanitis (including balanitis xerotica obliterans),and more recently, one has to keep in mind the penile ornaments. I hope this information is useful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello:)  I am a 45 year old female and have had that I can recall 2 UTI's and 1 bladder infection over the years.  I do smoke and have a family history of melanoma, breast cancer, high blood pressure, diabetes, stroke and heart disease.  I also have a herniated L5/S1 with bilateral sciatica. I had a stage 4 pap when I was 28 followed by surgery and a negative pap and now get a pap once a year.  I have hypothyroidism.  I had a vaginal hysterectomy 7/04 due to menstruating all but approx. 5 days a month and severe pain that seemed to be coming from my right ovary.  The ovary did have a couple cysts so it was removed.  I still have my left ovary along with the pain on the right side.  Current medications are synthroid and topamax along with Tylenol as needed.  I have been having difficulty with leaking, frequent urination, urgency to urinate with the only results being a dribble if anything and associated pain with and without urination.  I get up during the night because of severe pain mostly on the right side which runs along my hip bone and I have to pee.  While urinating I have to keep trying to stop as the pain is more severe when I'm actually going.  I go through the same thing in the morning and the severe pain lingers, sometimes throbbing for an hour or two.  If I laugh, cough, sneeze, get startled or even stand up I leak a little.  I can immediately go to the bathroom and I don't actually pee anymore.  This has been going on for a few years now.  I have been told various things by different doctors.  My primary physician felt it was due to my back injuries.  My gynecologist felt it was 'getting older' and the hysterectomy and my new Dr (because I have moved to a new state) isn't sure what to make of it except that he did say cancer isn't painful so I shouldn't worry and it could just be lesions from the surgery.  But!  The pain was there before the surgery. *confused*  I have been tested and I have no UTI but there is blood in my urine which explains the blood like stains on my underwear.  He asked me to come back in 3 weeks for another urine test to see if there is still a presence of blood.  I did and there is.  Now he wants me to come back again in 2 weeks (the 17th) to see if there is still blood there.  May be unrelated but I also recently seemed to have developed a rather irritable bowel problem.  Frankly, I'm getting spooked.  Something isn't adding up here and this has been going on for a long time and getting worse.  Not sure if I should wait it out with this new Dr I have or I should seek out a Urologist.  Any suggestions/comments would be greatly appreciated.  I'm at a loss as to what to do at this point.  Thank you for your time. :~)\n\n",

    "content": "I`m sure there are several conditions that could give you the same symptoms, so my own condition is just a possibility. Intersticial cystitus is a chronic inflammation of the bladder lining, often without  bacteria being present in urine samples, the cause of it is unknown, but can follow surgery, or spontaneous, mainly women, some men, all age groups, the main symptom being frequency, as often as every l5min for some, passing small amounts ,often with severe pain, stinging and soreness, some with it get severe lower back pain, pelvic pain, or pain in the region of the urethra, ureter, bladder, others have little pain, many with this condition have ibs, skin probs, and other related conditions.  l also had to have a hysterectomy for heavy loss and flooding, which started following a c-section-sterilisation, which in turn was the start of the bladder problems for me. Its often difficult to diagnose, requiring a urologist who can do a cystascope and biopsy, if all other tests fail to show a cause and the problem continues, it took me, and many others years to get a diagnosis, due to it being fairly rare and little known of by most people, including some gps, hope;fully most are now aware as it is a truly painful and miserable condition to deal with, there is no real cure, but quite a lot of different treatments for the symptoms. Its worth a look in on the intersticial cystitus web sites for a more detailed understanding of the symptoms, which may help confirm or reject it as the cause of your symtoms, but also give you advice on things that might ease your discomfort. Hope you can get to see a urologist asap for a diagnosis, l wouldnt wish the years of pain and misery on anyone before l saw a urologist and got a diagnosis and treatment. Whatever the cause l hope you have improvement asap. good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tulip18, You say that you noted stool mixed with blood. In hemorrhoids, usually there will be painless bright red bleeding at the end of defecation. In cases of anal fissures however, sometimes the stool will be streaked with blood.  Although your description matches neither, still it could be hemorrhoids. The other possibility is bleeding from higher up in the rectum/colon.  It will be best if you consult your GP who could exclude causes such as hemorrhoids or fissure and refer you for further testing if needed.  Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, An acute epididymitis is normally fairly easily diagnosed on an ultrasound exam (with color doppler). However, a chronic epididymitis may not show up that easily. A testicular appendage or an epididymal appendage are often fairly easily picked up on ultrasound exam. If any one said that the testes were 'about to burst' with semen during sexual activity, that will be very far from the truth!. No normal testes would distend with semen. As you may be aware, most of the seminal fluid volume is the contribution by the seminal vesicles and the prostate. I hope this information may be useful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 20 year old male who has recently been experiencing some symptoms that concern me.  I've never had any urinary tract problems in the past, but I've had a discomfort in my lower back for the last few days.  It is very mild and hasn't stopped me from working or playing sports.  I've not been sexually active in a while, but I noticed the other day when i ejaculated that not much ejaculate was present and there was a stinging sensation towards the end of my urethra, but only briefly, as though something was being forced through.  I also have a slight redness around the urethra opening, which hasn't been uncomfortable, although intermittently it has itched slightly.  Urination hasn't been painful, but I can't say it feels normal exactly (although this may be in my head as I've thought about this a lot over the past couple of days).  It also appears that urination has been more frequent, but I chalked this up to the large amounts of fluid I have consumed since the symptoms began.  I plan on going to the University Medical Center soon, but they are not open on the weekends.  I know UTI's are uncommon for people my age and gender, but I was wondering if these symptoms seem to suggest I have one.  Also, if that is the case, or even if it isn't, is it safe for me to wait to schedule an appointment at the Medical Center in a few days, or should I go to the emergency room.  Sorry for the length, and I thank you for the help in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I had an inaugural hernia surgery on my left side on October 1st 2009. I now have a very hard and swollen vein on the top left side of my penis which I believe is the Dorsal artery. It is very painful, especially when I have an erection. At the base it is swollen, hard and straight, but at the tip of the penis it feels like it is all bunched and knotted up. Both areas are very sensitive and painful. Also at the base of my penis where the vein leaves is tender all the way to where the surgery was performed. The Dr said that he did not belive it was related to the surgery, as he had never heard of this side affect. He said that he could understand if it was in the balls, but not on the penis. I KNOW I did not have this prior though. Can someone please let me know if this is normal after the surgery, if it is not  normal or if it could or could not be related. I am thinking that that blood vessel is pinched under the mesh...is that possible? I don't care I just want the pain to go away. Can someone please help me out?  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Painful, swollen, hard Dorsal artery after hernia surgery",
    "content": "Hi, I believe that what you are referring to is not the dorsal 'artery' of the penis but the superficial dorsal 'vein' of the penis. There are two dorsal veis, one superficial and one deep.The deep one is usually not visible or palpable because it lies deep to the deep fascia of the penis.The superficial vein on the other hand can be seen and at times felt as well. there are a couple of possibilities to explain your problem... - an acute thrombophlebitis (inflammmation) of the vein - a very rare condition called as the Penile Mondor's disease (characterized by thrombosis in the dorsal vein of the penis).This is a benign and usually a self-limiting disease. Many causes have been mooted -  trauma, excessive sexual activity, prolonged sexual abstinence, infection, certain constrictive implements used during some sexual practices, and some pelvic tumors. Sexual trauma is thought to be the most likely etiological factor. Your hernia surgery may not be related to your problem because, the mesh usually will not reach upto the area of the dorsal vein. [You have not mentioned which type of inguinal hernia surgery he had undergone ('open' vs laparoscopic/unilateral vs bilateral)]. Thank you for your post.\n\n",

I just don't think thats what it is. Now Mondor's on the other hand maybe correct. I just read up on it but most of what I read said that it comes from vigorous sexual activity. Now let me asure you that with the pain from the operation, there was no sexual activiy taking place. But I did see that the hernia operation could cause it as well. But how can I be sure?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello stardust53, Was he your regular partner or was if a casual sex with a stranger?. If he is your regular partner,have him consult a urologist and get investigated. There are many causes for painless hematuria(blood can originate from anywhere in the urinary tract).This symptom should always be taken seriously and cause looked for.  As his urine was bloody, naturally you are concerned whether the blood might have come from some problem in your body.This is extremely unlikely, because, even in the hypothetical event that you had some disease, blood may coat his phallus but should not cause the entire urine in his urinary bladder to stain red.  you mention palmar warts.It does not automatically mean that you have vaginal warts. Have your Gynec examine you so that you can put your mind to rest. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "22 year old male, one sexual partner with condoms during intercourse, no past health issues, currently on Prozac, 40mg/day, for anxiety.  For a long time (long enough that I can't remember when it started,) after urination I've found that if I don't gently squeeze my penis after urinating, it will drip/leak a bit afterward. Even still, I've found that it will leak a drop or two, even after spending 15-20 seconds trying to make sure it's empty.  Additionally, sometimes (not terribly often,) at what seems like complete random, I will still feel like I have to urinate after going. If I try again, I can usually go a little bit more, but it isn't \"vital\" that I go - by that, I mean that it will not leak out any more than usual if I \"hold it\" in instead of going.  No pain/abnormal pressure, no discoloration, no blood, no odd smells.  I'm not sure if either of these are normal, and I'm a bit embarrassed to ask friends/family. I will not have medical insurance for the next three months, so I would like to only have to visit the doctor if it is 100% necessary since I will have to pay entirely out of pocket.  Thank you for your time,\n\n",

    "content": "I had unprotected sex last year, i thought I had caught something as i had symptoms and was tested negative for gon, syph etc. The urologist gave me 4 weeks 2 and 2 of different types of antibiotics at the time as he thought I had NGU, shortly afterwards I noticed that when my penis is erect the head of my penis is covered in small red bumps and broken blood vessels and the skin in very stretched and shiny, I went back and he gave me antifungal cream, it didn't work so I left things as they were as I thought that it could be my guilt manifesting itself as symptoms, I don't think its guilt now. Continuing, I get burning when I urinate sometimes and I also get a sharp shooting pain when urinating sometimes. The opening of my urethra is also always red and irritated. I get pain in my left testicle and some sort of discomfort around the area between anus and tip of penis, it feels like a twitching and as if fluid is being extracted but it isnt. Also when I a flacid there is always a red blush/rash/quite patchy to my meatus and it feels as if my urethra has hardened in some way. I also had like a weepy graze type thing which was painless and cleared up after a day or 2, I think I may have scratched myself. I also have intermitant periods where it is itchy around my pubic area. This has been going on a year now and I thought it was prostatitis but that wouldn't cause bumps and discomfort on my urethral meatus would it?  This is causing me untold worries, I have had a urine flow test and digital examination by a nurse and apparently my prostate is fine. i am going back in october for a follow up with a urologist. I week or 2 before I had unprotected sex I caused myself pain when I was sitting on the toilet and I strained/pushed too hard, I got a severe pain in my urethra which took my breath away but only lasted a few seconds, could I have damged my urethra this way and are these symptoms due to this, it does feel as if my meatus has been infected.  Any ideas? I don't think its Herpes... but its always on my mind!!  Thankyou very much in advance!!\n\n",

The colour of the glans penis may vary from pink to pale blue or purple.This is due to the blood vessels(capillaries) under the very thin skin that covers it. Colour may vary with the degree of erection, ambient temperature and whether the person is circumcised or not. Whitish colour may be abnormal(balanitis xerotica obliterans - a condition that may cause stricture of the external meatus).Cheers!\n\n",

Usual process, weighed, measured, BP/pulse, BMI, questions of history and a routine urine test.  so i dutifully supplied a sample, and she tested it there and then while asking me about general life.  The nurse explained, that i had a trace of protein in my urine, which would concur with the information i had provided:  I've recently just graduated but, in this final year i had been doing alot of gym training and riding up until about March this year, then i stopped all training to focus on university, where i was spending 20+ hours a day working, often skipping meals, high amounts of stress and generally caining myself. I started off a healthy 10st 5 5ft 10 BMI 22 active male, and the next time i weighed myself after graduation, i 'd lost 6lb.  the nurse told me that the protein trace would concur with my weight loss, in her opinion in muscle mass. I've since put on weight back up to about 10st 4lb but have only been doing minimal cycling (which is what i was training for as i was on the university team)  I've been booked in in a couple of weeks for a routine blood test to make sure my kidneys are fine.  i'm now, consequently a bit concerned :S i've not done any high physical activity regularly for at least 3months, i'm eating 3 decent varied meals a day, although i am generally active, trying to find a job currently\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   It all started some time about a week or two ago, I started to notice some pain in my right testicle.  It was a dull pain and happened only when walking or sitting wrong.  The pain has not grown more intense as the week progressed just stayed \"tender\".  I decided to examine my testicles when I noticed a small bump the size or a pencil led.  After discovering it, I immediately called my doctor to schedule a appointment.  After the appointment the doctor referred me to a urologist and directed me to get an ultrasound.  After my ultrasound me and the technician started talking, and she noticed that I was visibly upset.  She assured with out giving me a diagnosis that I should not be worried.  She stated that the bump looked superficial (although it looked to be attached the the right testicle) and did not look like a cancerous lump, she also mentioned that she has been doing this for years.    My question is are cysts usually painful and if so what can I do to relieve the pain.  The doctor prescribed me no medication and did not seem too concerned with the bump and even told me to check back in a month to look at my blood pressure (since it was high because I was extremely anxious).  I could not tell you when exactly the pain started but it could not have been more then a week or so.  The only time it hurts is when pressure is on the right testicle (touching, moving, sitting wrong and walking).   I am a 24 yr old, married (4+ years) that is fairly active.  (running, sports..etc)  I am still concerned and awaiting an appointment with a urologist (they are telling me it can be a month before I can even get an appointment).\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned the exact location of this 'lump'. There are some differential diagnoses however... - appendix of the testis (usually at its upper pole)  - appendix of the epididymis(again at the upper pole of epididymis) - thickened lower pole of the epididymis (usually due to epididymitis)  All of these are capable of producing recurrent pains. The first two of them can present with acute excruciating scrotal pain if they undergo torsion on their pedicles(and thus mimick torsion of the testicle). Important to always exclude torsion (doppler during ultrasound examination will be able to show this). I hope this inormation is useful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I take it that your last delivery was a normal vaginal delivery. Was there any particular difficulty during labor? The first question that comes to my mind is 'is this swelling new or perhaps was present prior to the delivery'(but was unnoticed)?. If it appeared following the delivery, one possibility would be a hematoma (due to unrecognized trauma during delivery).The fact that you are able to feel it in the vagina (and the fact that the cystoscopy did not show anything in the urinary bladder) leads me to believe that it may be between the vaginal wall and the urethra.A CT or MRI should identify this quite easily. But in case it had been present prior to delivery,its nature can't be confidently predicted and so, it will need to be fully investigated. Good luck!\n\n",

As far as i can imagine, the only way in which 'ANY' medication can increase the urinary frequency is if one drank too much water at the time of swallowing the said medicines.  I will try to search for more info regarding this and if i do find some, i will no doubt get back to you. Thank you for a very thought- provoking post.\n\n",

Based upon the descriptions I've seen and read I am pretty sure that I have Lymphocele on my penis; the lump is completely 100% painless It has never hurt erect or flaccid. It's not that big but I am alarmed. I just want an expert opinion on what it really is and what I should do. I really would like a doctor to respond as soon as possible. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Penis Lymphocele",
    "content": "Hi, Lymphoceles of the penis occur mostly in men following excessive masturbation or sexual intercourse (you say at the very outset that you did not masturbate for months).However, that dosen't exclude the diagnosis. What makes it less likely is your description of the lump.The lymphoceles of the penis [which are usually located at the corona glandis(rim) part of the penis] would be expected to be described by a majority as whitish, firm \"cords\" or \"threads\". They don't usually appear in a way so that one may call them as lumps or bumps. Thus, i presume that the 'lump' that you describe, may be Fordyce Spots, which are enlarged, therefore visible,sebaceous glands(visible, because they happen to reside in the very thin skin of the glans penis). These are physically harmless except for their psychological impact on the person.Cryo or laser therapy may be beneficial in some cases. Good luck!\n\n",

It has been confirmed that he will need to have it surgically removed, but the earliest date available for surgery is sometime in February 2009.   I am unsure of the stones exact location but it is causing him constant pain the genital and lower back area. I believe a urinary stint of some sort has been placed to allow urine to pass.  Is it possible to last 6 months with a kidney stone that size without further infection or even death. I am very concerned and would like to know.

    "content": "Hi, I do not know your uncle's age.Generally, Any kidney stone which has caused complete outflow obstruction is an emergency. Any renal stone that has caused an obstructed & infected system (pyonephrosis) is a dire emergency. Any renal stone causing severe derangement in the renal function also is an emergency. A renal stone causing obstruction in a solitary kidney is an emergency. A renal stone causing obstruction in a transplanted kidney is also an emergency.  It is not the size of the stone pre-se, which determines the nature of emergency. In your uncle's case, if - any out-flow obstruction has been successfully overcome by stenting and - if there is no on-going urinary infection, no significant harm should ensue due to the wait (if he undergoes regular check-ups,has his renal functions monitored periodically and urine checked for UTI's).Good luck!\n\n",

Normal urethral secretions coat the urethra in between voidings of urine.Also some of the prostatic secretions also would be collecting.The amounts of these will be varying from person to person. Intra-abdominal pressure increases and the inevitable contractions of the bulbospongiosus muscles of the urethra at the time of BM (everytime the anal sphincters contract, the bulbospongiosus also contracts(both are connected to the perineal body). This will have the effect of squeezing out whatever secretions have collected in the urethra. Cheers!\n\n",

Its been 1 month and I have pain urinating, especially towards the end of the flow. And I have constant urge to urinate and pain on the tip of the penis (stinging pain). I cannot exercise, espcially running since I see blood and pain when urinating. And I hv bladder spasm that made me feel that my bladder is pulling my body down.  Is this a stricture? I have seen my urologist and he said this is normal. But its been 1+ month after cysto and biopsy, and I am never the same. Before I had frequency problem but not pain and consistent urge to urinate. This is all caused by cystoscopy and bladder biopsy.  Do you think I will ever recover? Is my bladder or urethra damaged forever?. To all of you who read my story, please do cystoscopy only when you need it. The pain is tremendous and its not as easy as it sounds. Thanks for reading my question\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thanks for sharing with us your progress.Is it possible for a biopsy site to continue bleeding?... Usually 'no' but occassionally, 'Yes'. Different parts of the urinary bladder  experience mechanical stresses probably differently. For example, a biopsy very close to the internal meatus undergoes squeezing type of stress due to sphincter activity. This kind of a stress is unlikely at the fundus region of the urinary bladder. Therefore, a biopsy taken from close to the internal meatus(bladder neck) could heal rather slowly(due to repeated breakdown of the healing mucosa). Another variable is the depth of the biopsy itself. I hope my explanation is understandable. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Lump at base of each teste come and go w/light pain",
    "content": "Assuming I have Bi-lateral Varicocele, Advise please!  I do not know if I actually have this condition. Based on my symptoms I have and everything I have read about every single testicular issue I can consider, I have decided this is my problem. I may end up rambling a bit here and not staying within a proper rhetoric, but I am a glass blower not an english major.  So here is the deal:  For a little while now, maybe 6 months or so, there are two little, what seem to be, dilated or swollen lumps, one on the underside of both testicles. They are in the exact same place on both sides and are not consistent, they come and go. I obviously went through my serious serious cancer scare, but realized this was not the case based on the fact that the lumps appear and disappear at what seem to be totally random times. I then came to realize that these were not actually growths, but the single vein that runs underneath the testicle was enlarging. I find it happens more often on the left, occasionally on the right, and occasionally on both testicles. As a glass blower I obviously do a lot of sitting and standing and a lot of pretty decent heavy lifting. Not heavy lifting in the \"Oh S*** I Just got a Hernia\" sense of things, but I make pretty large pieces of glass and they are swung around and carried on a long metal pipe, so leverage is cut down and weight on the body is increased. I do this every single day and have for the past 3 years of my life. There is also a lot of stress based on my chosen profession, and I believe that is additive to any condition.  There are some days when there are no problems, no pain in the testicles, no lumps after or during work, and it's all good, I can \"relax my balls\". Other days this is not the case. Here is an example. I was drinking with some friends last Wednesday and I got pretty wasted. I came home, intoxicated, and noticed my little \"problem\" and FREAKED out (cancer scare freak out). I scoured the interweb as stressed as can be to find little reassurance. Luckily I was inebriated enough that I could fall asleep/pass out, if that wasnt the case I would have been up all night. From Thursday until this morning I had no problems, if it did occur that I noticed it would only last for say 10 minutes and there was no aching pain in the obvious region. However, today, it was totally different. I woke up and went to work, and it was that aching pain almost all day. I was not bustin' self checks in the studio all day but I assume the little lump things were there. After I got home and sorta chilled out, took a shower, and took of the ol' boxer briefs, it went away pretty quickly, within 30 minutes or so. It is important to note that it is not intense pain of any sort. Just a very minimal ache that sorta comes and goes depending on how much attention I decide to give it.  I do not eat as well as I should, especially when I am living alone. As I research this specific condition I realize that my diet my have something to do with this. I drink a good amount and enjoy frozen pizzas very much. When I am at home or living with friends, which was the case this summer, I eat much healthier and more \"prepared\" foods. I do not recall having this problem at all this summer, at least not the pain aspect of things.  I will be returning home this December, I work in Europe at the moment, where I have already scheduled a meeting with my physician and told him I am expecting to get an ultrasound. So that advice is not needed, I know I need to do that and I will in a month and a half. I am really just wondering if people think that this is my actual condition and whether or not I should be worried about it. Aside from the pain I have no problem with misshaped testicles or overheated testicles. I have not gotten a sperm count done but my testosterone is doing just fine as far as I can tell. I would just like to know if I should be freaking out or not, if someone thinks I may or may not need surgery (I pray to god I don't, S*** freaks me out!), and other other advise. I am going to start a totally new diet here based on this condition I have, even if I don't have this it can't help since I am living pretty unhealthy at the moment.  Thanks for anything you guys can throw out there, nothing like a bunch of anonymous dudes able to talk openly about their balls!  Cheers Mates Svensk\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your extensive description of those \"bilateral lumps under the testicles that come and go at random\" and the observation that  a \"single vein that runs underneath the testicle was enlarging\", i find it difficult (i am certain most medical doctors would be as well) to place an anatomical or a pathological diagnosis. You do have an increased risk for varicoceles due to your profession but, anatomically, the 'pampiniform plexus' which dilates to form the varicocele is 'above' the testes. Epididymitis occuring bilaterally, affecting the tails of the epididymis, and as you have described \"if it did occur that I noticed it would only last for say 10 minutes\"- again seems out of place. As your condition appears to be a very unusually strange, i suggest that you must consult a urologist who would have a chance to examine you and arrive at a diagnosis and we hope to hear from you what the final diagnosis was. Thank you for such an interesting post.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a urinary tract that is severely undersized, with a severely restricted opening as well. I've had several surgeries to enlarge the opening but they have not helped and created scar tissue, which has resulted in a spraying urine stream.  after having an x-ray by my urologist, it appeared my entire urnary tract was undersived and would need to be reconstructed. the reason i needed the surgery is because over the years i've been getting several cases of urine infections as a result of urine backing up into my kidneys and not being able to totally empty my bladder.  my surgeon has given my two options:  1. to totally rebuild my urinary tract, with the downside being they would have to harvest skin tissue from my mouth to use as the skin material to rebuild my urinary tract.  the recovery would take a month and they would have to put a cathater in my cuck and it would be extremely painful, with a success rate of 88%.  2. bypass my urinary tract and cut a hole below my scrotum that would be my new exit point for urine (as well as as semen) the drawbacks of this operation would be obvious: i need to squat to urinate. the upside, i can still get an erection and ejaculate, and the recovery time is quicker with a better 98% success rate.   my question for you guys is: has anyone had this procedure? (#2) what kind of muscle control can you excersize in squeezing off the flow? can i expect leakage more easily than through my penis, for either fluid? does the sensation of having to urinate operate differently if i get #2?   and generally, your opinions on which procedure is better, overall.

Therefore i will try to answer your question from a general point of you rather than as a specific recommendation pertaining to your case. Stictures of urethra that are longer than 2 cms (some authors site 3-5 cms) are not suitable for an anastamotic urethroplasty(ie: removing the stricture and joining the cut ends). Larger lengths of strictures need some kind of urethroplasty.(in your case, the urologist has suggested a buccal mucosal graft).  Generally,if the penis is left intact(as in a perineal urethrostomy without penectomy), there should not be a problem with erection or ejaculation or orgasm(except that the ejaculate would naturally exit through the urethrostomy).The bulbo spongiosus muscle would still be acting(if it is in good shape and not involved in the stricture process or due to repeated surgeries). On the contrary,a urethroplasty is an extensive procedure (associated with its own complications,successes and failure rates). If it turns out to be successful, well, NOTHING LIKE IT! But,in case it leads to recurrence, one may end up in square 1!I hope this info will be useful to you in your decision making.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I just want to ask if my concern is normal.  My girlfriend told me that my penis is fully and big erect while I'm doing the in and out movement slowly.  However, whenever I do it fast (especially if I already want to cum) then my penis will suddenly retract and more often it is already small when I cum inside her vagina.   Basically, I can control my orgasm but when I'm ready to explode then my penis retract.  I would like ask if this is normal or this can be the reason why we cannot make a baby.  Thanks for the advise.  JM\n\n",

The bladder neck may fail to close (or remain open) at the moment of ejaculation.If the urinary bladder happens to contract (or if intra-abdominal pressure increases during the spasms-as it usually happens), urine may be ejaculated with or without semen.This problem usually settles sponteneously with further maturity of the urinary system including the prostate gland.To complicate matters,you seem to have a neurogenic bladder and you self-catheterize on a daily basis.   Still, I expect you to be better by now.\n\n",

    "title": "Lower back pain with no infection for a year?",
    "content": "My symptoms all started when I had my third c-section in November of last year. Everything went fine with pregnancy, but after the c-section I had sever menstral bleeding and stomach cramps. I went to the ER numberous occasions for pain. They could never find anything out of the ordinary. Finally in March 08 my OB did a laproscopy to see if they could find anything. They found sever scar tissue wrapped around my bladder and uterus and removed it. But did not find the cause, the pain was more sever then before so the OB went in again in April 08 and found endomitriosis. New symptoms started appearing everything smelling bad, dizziness, Migrains (on one side of the head at a time starting from the back of the head crawling up to behind the eye), inability to hold bladder, nausea, felt like I was swallowing a rock everytime I swallowed, excessive weight gain, pain under my rib cage left side, inablitiy to concentrate, fatigue (could sleep all day), weakness in my legs and arms, neck pain. Found out the pain under left rib cage is a swollen spleen (no doctor can figure out why). Has been swollen twice the size of a normal spleen since February 08. No sign of sickness. Went to a Reumatologist (have been checked for all soft tissue diseases) and auto immune disorders. In April I receive Depo provera shot, seems that is when the Migrains may have started, and aslo the throat swelling. on 4/27/2008 went to the hospital for sever migrain and was given Tramadol, Benadryl and Compazine (seemed to help a little, just wanted to go home.) Went home and went to bed, 15 hours later woke up with a little headache, drank some coffee, felt like my throat was burning (like I was getting a sore throat), then my nose started closing up, had a hard time catching my breath, (called an ambulance after the tongue was swollen). This all happened within 15 minutes. Here is the report from the ER Visit we still can not figure out what happened I went to an allergist and am not allergic to the coffee.   Neurologic Status- The patient had remained alert, oriented, and with a non focal exam. She had been complaining of a new onset of headaches approximately one to two days prior to admission which had peristed. She had been seen in the emergency room as previously outlined. Because of ongoing headaches, a head CT was performed which showed cerebellar tonsillar ectopia consistent with a borderline Chiari I morphology without evidence of hydrocephalus or significant deformity of the cervicomedullary junction or upper cervical cord. There was a mild prominence of subarachnoid space of the cranial vertex.  No subdural collectons noted. Because of the changes seen on th CT, an MRI of the brain was preformed. There was mildly prominent subarachnoid spaces overlaying the cervical convexities bilaterally. This likely represents a normal anatomic variant.There is tonsillar ectopia measuring up to 1 cm without evidence of associated hydrocephalus. There is no evidence of dural thickening or enhancement. The study was otherwise unremarkable.  Pulmonary Status \u2013The patient had acute tongue and throat swelling. She was examined in the emergency room and had minimal swelling and bogginess of the tongue and the uvula. The etiology of the angiodema was not clear but she had drank coffee. The patient did not have any other exposures that she could recall. She did receive medications in the ER The day before.   Cardivascular status The patient initially was tachycardic after receiving subcu epi. Her hemodynamics improved and were stable throughout the hospital course.  GI- The patient has cronic abdominal pain in part felt to be secondary to endometriosis. She is on chronic narcotics. Her outpatient medication regimen was started with the exception of NSAIDs which could potentially cause angiodema. The patient will follow up with he primary care physician.   5. GU Renal function remains stable.  Endocrine. No acute endocrine issues.  Infection Disease- As part of admission to the ICU, a nasal swab was obtained for MRSA. The patient did have a positive for MRSA. No signs or symptons of active infection.   Well this is the report I have been seeking answers from all sorts of specialist to find out what is exactly wrong with me. The only thing that is consistent in the blood tests is reactive lymphocytes of 7. I just seem to be getting more fatigued and a migrain atleast once a week. I am leaking urine just enough to make my underwear wet, not enough to wet through pants, since my last laproscopy as well, my bladder is tender and my kidney seem to be causing quite a bit of lower back problems, but no infection to be found. In the CT they did find some lesions on my right kidney but to small to know if they are cysts or what? I do not know where the pain is comming from but I am in alot of pain with no answers. The lower back pain is constant. I am only 27, what is wrong with me. I have been in pain for a a year now with now answers?\n\n",

As you have mentioned that you had been found to have a Chiari Type 1 malformation, one may try to start to analyse from this point... Chiary malformations are known to be associated with certain other disorders - one such disorder which is capable of producing chronic low back pain & urinary symptoms is  \"Tethered spinal cord syndrome\" or \"Occult spinal dysraphism\" -usually manifesting in children, but can go on into adulthood unnoticed. I have mentioned this only with an intention that a condition (although very rare), deserves a mention in your particular case - because you happen to have Chiari's malformation. Good luck!\n\n",

I have had Human Papilloma Virus (HPV) for approx 7-8 years now. My wife knows about the HPV and she does not have HPV. We had sex the other night and the following day (around 12:00 noon) I noticed a little bit of reddish/brown fluid in my boxer shorts (approx. a dimes size worth.). By the end of the day I had approx. a quarters size worth of reddish/brownish fluid stain on my boxer shorts.   My initial reaction was that the reddish/brownish fluid was a blood and urine mix. What could this possibly be? And should I be concerned. I found related forums on here that gave me some comfort however I would still like a response from a Doctor. Thank you so much.!!\n\n",

    "content": "Over the past 2-3 months I've had two ureteral stent procedures and a procedure to break up a kidney stone for removal.  Since removing the ureteral stent (10 days ago) I have noticed two issues/side effects after the surgeries.    1) There is a hard vein? which runs down the side of the penis when urinating and causes a 30-60 degree bend at the head of the penis which was not present prior to procedures.  The bend is in a similar location to swelling that was present for 2-days post removal.  There is also occasional pain towards the head of the penis when urinating.  This bend is only noticeable when urinating, the vein can also be felt at that time.  I can't be certain whether or not it is felt during an erection due to issue 2:  2) Since removing the stent, and possibly during stent presence, it has been very difficult to acheive and maintain an erection.  I on occasion will wake up in the morning with a full (though slightly softer than normal) erection.  However, during sexual activity or masturbation it is very difficult (if not impossible) to acheive and maintain an erection.    I am an otherwise healthy 29-year old male, so at my age this is obviously a major concern.  I'm not looking for a solution or a definitive judgement on the issue, due to that obviously not being possible without a medical history and/or consultation.  I'm simply looking for advice and guidance to compliment my urologist, who at this point I don't entirely trust after the way things have progressed, and I'm still working to find a new one.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I hope you are not confused between 'ureteral' stents and 'Urethral' stents.The ureteral stents are placed within the ureters, the tubes that carry urine from the kidneys to the urinary bladder. A stent in this location should not have caused any problems with erections. Is it possible that you resumed sexual activity too soon following the two stenting procedures and one procedure for removal of stent? The 'Bend' in the penis you describe, probably has nothing to do with the procedures you had undergone.The thickened vein you mention could be as a result of thrombophlebitis.This is also most probably is not related to the 'bend'. I trust you are OK since then.\n\n",

When the medicine stopped working I saw a urologist who perfomed multiple tests in his office and he suspected a fistual, because he had me take medicine to color my urine orange, and then he filled my bladder with blue water, and placed a tampon in my vagina, and due to the color of the tampon he immediatly thought fistual. But because the urine was stress related he said that was not a symptom of a fistual. He put a sling in me, and this helped with the urine expelling from my vagina due to sneezing, coughing, excercising etc. but did not help with a continuous urine leakage from my vagina. I have had stents, CAT Scans, ultrasounds, exploratory surgeries, bladder function tests, x-rays and the doctor cannot find any reason why I am always wet with urine. Today, I was told there is nothing else that can be done for me, there has to be a reason for this continous urine leakage. I am at a loss as to what to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I sincerely empathize with you for the problems you are enduring.From your description,this could be a fistula(vesico-vaginal or uretero-vaginal). If all other options have been already tried (and failed), in a situation such as this, sometimes a temporary/permanent urinary diversion may need to be considered. Ofcourse, this should be decided after giving lots of thought to the 'Risk-to-benefit' ratio,age,the extent of morbidity etc. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Problems after bladder neck surgery",
    "content": "Hello, i am a 37 yr old male from the uk.  Over the last 4 or 5 years i have been suffering from urological problems including difficulty starting, poor flow, incomplete emptying.  I had numerous tests over these years and in August had a bladder neck incision op.  I was told my my urologist prior to the op that there was no guarantee it would work but after all the years of suffering with my problem i felt i should give it a go.  I had been told previously following a cystoscopy that i had a tight and high bladder neck but my bladder pressure was low.  About 2 months after the op i felt really good. Easier to start urinating and also a stronger and thicker stream and thought i was well on the way to overcoming this problem that i had had for a number of years.  However i now find that this has reversed. I am finding that when my bladder is full and i start urinating, everything is ok but then towards the end the flow rate seems to trail off quickly and i have to force out the rest of the urine, even doing this does not seem to leave me totally empty.  I have been to see my urologist and i am going to be doing some proper flow rate tests at the hospital and they will check for residual urine too.  I feel as though i know my own body well enough and that since the op it has made it easier to start a flow mostly but that there is insufficient pressure from my bladder to force all the urine out.  What i would like to know is this. Are there any excercises that can increase the force which the bladder squeezes with?  Or is there any medication that can be taken to improve how much pressure my bladder squeezes with.  I have suffered for a long time with this problem and sometimes it drives me to despair to be honest. So any help or advice would be really appreciated.   Best Regards   Bobby\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Problems after bladder neck surgery",
    "content": "Hi,  The fact that your urinary flow improved following the surgery indicates that your bladder contractions (although may be weaker than normal), are strong enough-provided the out-flow tract is wide enough.  It seems likely that your problem has recurred (the bladder neck stenosis).It will be best to have it corrected again rather than to try to increase the bladder contractions,as this may cause back-pressure and damage your urinary bladder further as well as harming your kidneys.Cheers!\n\n",

    "title": "Penis Surgery Performed from Childhood",
    "content": "Around 1976 when I was about six years old I had surgery performed on my penis. At the time I was told the surgery was performed to increase the size of the urethra through the penis (and I believe also the urethral opening) to stop bed-wetting (which was not really a problem in the first place... as I only recall wetting the bed-wetting once or twice before the surgery). I am positive that it was not done for what I understand to be called hypospadias, as there was nothing wrong about the placement/ position of the urethral opening. It was simply as I believe to increase the size of the urethra to help empty the bladder.  As a result I was left with a scar on the underside of my penis from end to end. I once briefly asked my mother about this surgery. She told me that she was told it was the thing to do for boys at the time (as my three-year older brother also had the surgery then too). It's honestly left me embarrassed to discuss with anyone including doctors. With a former girl-friend and now my wife, I've simply said little and I have kept the physical scar out of view.  What I would like to know is what was the technical term for this surgery? Plus is it still performed today? I am not looking for any surgery to correct the physical scar, but rather information on the procedure to put to rest the emotional scar.  Thank you for your time to review and possibly shed some light on this for me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description. it could have been a \"Meatoplasty\", a form of surgery to correct a 'Meatal Stenosis' (narrowing of the external urethral opening).Meatal stenosis could be congenital or aquired. This condition can cause back-pressure changes and later even result in renal damage. Surgical correction is definitely indicated. Theoratically, it can cause chronic bladder distension and overflow incontinence (which could have resulted in bed-wetting). Usually at surgery, the meatus is fashioned  larger than its intended final size to adjust for the inevitable post-operative fibrosis.Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Ankylosing Spondylits and urethroplasty to repair stricture.",
    "content": "Hi. Apologies in advance for the length of this post.  I am a man currently awaiting a urethroplasty operation to repair a recurrent urethral stricture near the s-bend in front of the prostate and have some questions I would like to get a second opinion on.   I am very lucky to have an excellent urologist who has a great deal of experience but I have severe Ankylosing Spondylitis (an auto-immune form of arthritis) and am very concerned about not only how the urethroplasty operation itself will go but also about how my A.S. is going to react post-surgery paticularly in relation to the two catheters I will have post surgery.  In 2007 I had a urethrotomy to try repair the stricture which was only found due to my going into Acute Urinary Retention due to constipation caused by pain medications. The surgery was successful for a time. The post-surgical period was horrendous though. My A.S. was flaring out of control and due to the catheter my penis swelled quite severely and my urethra seemed to attack the catheter with huge amounts of pus which turned out not to be an infection but had plenty of inflammation cells in it (it was sent off for tests) and my penis head swelled by about 15-20% at a guess and it caused a hypospadia.  The stricture returned, however, and now I am waiting for surgery again and I am very worried about this happening again after my urethroplasty. I am having to come off my strongest immune suppressant pre-surgery because of the risk of infection and am very concerned that this will make the situation worse as I have been told I will come out of surgery with two catheters (suprapubic and urethral) and they both will be in for a minimum of two weeks. I just know my body will attack the urethral catheter again.  Is there anything I can do or ask the urologist to do to minimise this kind of reaction? The surgery is going to be unpleasant enough without having to deal with this kind of reaction. Am I correct in my thoughts that the inflammation cells in the pus were a result of my immune system attacking the catheter?  If you read all this then thank you for patience. Any responses gratefully received.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have been already diagnosed as having Ankylosing Spondylitis.The moment you mention urethritis, the next thing that comes into one's mind (rightly or wrongly!) is Reiter's syndrome. Reiter's sndrome is thought to be autoimmune reaction of the body to an underlying infection---- presenting as uveitis(and conjunctivitis),urethritis and arthritis.  This process has not been reported to 'attack' a urinary catheter. It is easier to imagine a foley's catheter...causing infection.....precipitating a Reiter's syndrome. At the time of your first urethroplasty, you had not mentioned any flare-up of your arthritis or presence of uveitis. Therefore Reiter's syndrome becomes less probable (although it could have been atypical). In all probability, the catheter associated urethritis was a local problem (? caused by a an inadequate peri-catheter space). Hope your second procedure will go ahed smoothly. Good luck!\n\n",

If I press it, it feels like it is sore just under the skin. If I take a shower the warm water seems to numb the pain. There are no visible signs of damage or swelling and no discolouration, but over the weeks it does not seem to have got any better. I haven't seen the GP yet. Am not sure if it is anything to worry about, as it is only a problem when I press it.  I am sexually active about once a week and masturbate occasionally. I think it became sore the day after sex, but it was not particularly vigorous.  Any one got any ideas what may be causing it?\n\n",

Epididymitis is usually secondary to an episode of UTI (usually a retrograde spread of infection via the vas deferens). So, in order to prevent further episodes and to prevent further increase in the size of your scrotum, it is better that you consult a urologist, have your urine cultured and UTI(if any),treated.Cheers!\n\n",

However,I always have sexual intercourse longer than the average man, say, for about an hour and above-sometimes even up to 2 (two)hours: still yet, I cannot ejaculate normally and when I am finally tired of moving my waist and boring my lover,I then resort to using my hand on my phallus. And this has got nothing to do with the condom.   The size of my penis is a little below average i.e not tiny like a baby's or gigantic like you should expect in a black male-but just enough to make a woman sigh when I penetrate.   When I have intercourse without protection,after 15 minutes I have this uncomfortable feeling like electrical shocks on the head of my phallus: this feeling can be likened to anti-climax-even though I am no where near ejaculation or climax.   In oct.1999,when I sustained some bullet wounds,the doctors removed a lot of those lead pellets,however they didn't notice the single pellet embedded beneath the skin on the left side of the shaft of my phallus.     HELP. Please Doctor,help me  (1)Pescribe drugs that would temporaly reduce the unnatural time (which I would injest before intercourse). (2)Permanent Solution :both drugs and Surgery.

    "content": "Hi, The most common causes for delayed ejaculation are psychological.  Some of the common psychological causes: - Getting accustomed to certain unique masturbation patterns - A strict religious upbringging, resulting in the person viewing sex as a sin - Certain past events (like having been discovered during illicit sex or while masturbating, or learning about a partner's affair with someone else etc) - Lack of attraction for a partner - Some suppressed anger towards the partner  Drugs that may cause this problem: - mellaril,prozac,and guanethidine Neurological causes:  strokes or Severe back trauma.  As of now,I am not aware of any drug that can temporarily shorten the erection time. Also i am not aware of any drug or surgery that would be of use to you.  The only management which has been shown to be helpful is psychological councelling of both the sexual partners by experts in this field.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all, my first post here. I am so glad to have found this forum.  OK so here goes, hopefully someone can give me some guidance.  I am a 37 year old male in good health up until this past year. Over the last year I have lost roughly 40 lbs -- I started at 5'8\" & 185 and now weigh 145. I have had a chronic discomfort in my back to right side below my last rib. In addition to fatigue I experience periodic nights waking up sweaty and have had fevers on and off. I have no family history of High Blood Pressure and have had excellent blood pressure my entire life. For the last 7 months I have been on high blood pressure medication after it was found that my blood pressure was averaging 170/110 -- after a variety of dose adjustments I have my blood pressure under control at around 125/90.  I smoke and have done so a pack a day the last 18 years. During a bad case of Brhonchitis I was sent in for a chest x-Ray to rule out pneumonia. On the x-Ray they found a nodule about the size of an acorn so a CT was added the next week. The non-contrast CT turned up some long name for the lump in my lung that in short equals just something to keep an eye on.  What came as a surprise was an 11cm x 15cm cyst in my right kidney at -4HU. I could not get an appointment with a urologist until Aug 10th but between now and then he wants me to do a renal scan with and without contrast.   After learning of this my wife and I did the next worst thing, we started to google for more information.I came across many reports that indicate in cases such as this doctors tend to leave the Cysts in as opposed to removal.  I have a high degree of confidence (always trust your own intuition) that this is nothing more than a speed bump in my late thirties and that once cleaned up the high blood pressure, pain/discomfort and fatigue will both go away. Heck I may even put weight back on.  [A little later] There is one other symptom (if you can call it that) which my wife just reminded me of after I complained about it my last time in the bathroom -- every other day and sometimes every day while urinating I have a white/gray thick discharge after the urine. There is no pain, just the discharge which to me looks like semen. This has been going on the last three months or so. I brought it up with my doctor and he suspected I might be dehydrated and in need of fluids. I have been drinking bottles of Propel the last two months and have seen no change. I don't know if this is related to any of the above but thought I should make mention of it since it is fairly new.  Any opinions, suggestions, recommendations, hostorical knowledge would be greatly appreciated. Have a good day.  Regards, Brian\n\n",

The swollen left testicle has been like this for a while.  I have been hit in the the groin a few times, but not too hard.  Replies would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, Eric You should see a doctor for a definite diagnosis, but it sounds a lot like a varicocele. It is not unusual in teens or young adults, is usually on one side and does not change quickly. Until you can see a doctor, wear underwear that give some support rather than letting your scrotum hang free.  It may not ever get worse, but you do need an exam to rule out other things.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi shadoweric, The description provided by you makes me to first think of (just as opined by dlugose, R.N.).. a varicocele. It is probable that you also have an associated hydrocele/hematocele (which may or may not be associated with the trauma that you sustained). You must consult your GP first who may the be able to refer you as necessary. In the mean time, you should follow the instructions provided by dlugose, R.N. Good luck!\n\n",

When I start having sex after a while without it, I get  bladder infections, and my urine smells like rancid bacon. After A while though my body got used to it, and I was fine.  A few weeks ago, my fiance had had his urine smelling bad, but he didn't tell me anything, and whatever he had, passed over to me. His symptoms dissappeared after about a week, but I have had my urine still smelling.   It smells different than when I had a bladder infection. It no longer smells like rancid bacon, and I don't have the sensation of having to pee all of the time, or the pain of a bladder infection.  Now my urine smells as if it has been rotting inside my body. There is no pain, but it is darker than usual. These are the only symptoms I have had, and I have had them for awround 2 weeks now.  My step-dad said something about chlamydia, and I looked up symptoms, but I don't think that I have it, but I am still going to an STD clinic to be safe. Chlamydia symptoms range, but it seems that when you have chlamydia you have pain.   Is there anything else that it could be besides chlamydia? I am hoping it is just some type of bacterial infection.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Smelly Urine",
    "content": "Hi Raine, Let me begin by saying that if urine smells anything other than urine, it is UTI unless proved otherwise. The only certain way to know this and to know which organism is responsible is by a urinary culture & sensitivity test. I do not think it is wise to jump to a diagnosis of chlamydial infection without first excluding other UTI's. Chlamydial infections often produce symptoms of recurrent urethritis in men - but in women they may remain asymptomatic. Therefore, i suggest that you consult your doctor, who in all probability would request a urine culture. Finally, as i always tend to say... have your partner also tested and treated(if necessary).Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am writing this post for my boyfriend. He is a 27 year old Male.   About 4 years ago, he experienced an extended erection after intercourse, that lasted approximately 12 hours before he sought medical attention. He was given an injection which brought the erection down. Ever since that day however, he has been experiencing the following problem:  During the night, he will awake after about 2 hours of sleeping, with a painful erection that will not go away on its own. This happens every single night, multiple times. He has seen many urologists and all of them tell him the same thing - they have never seen anything like this - and they don't know what to do. He was given viagra to counteract the erections, and that worked for sometime, but then it stopped working. He has been through extensive tests, MRI's etc, and nothing has ever been found as a cause. He is currently giving himself injections when this occurs during the night - the injection takes about 15 minutes to bring the erection down - then he can go back to sleep for about another two hours until he wakes up again with another painful erection.  the only other time this sometimes occurs, is if he is sitting for a long period of time. It doesn't happen when he is moving around during the day - only when he is in a relaxed position for over an hour or two.   He is still able to have a normal erection brought on by sexual arousal. After ejaculation, sometimes the erection does not go down, and he must give himself an injection. Other times, the erection goes away on its own.   This has been going on for 4 1/2 years now... he is not getting more than 2 hours of sleep at a time and he is at a loss as to what else to do. No urologist has been able to help him so far and he has seen ALOT of them. He is seriously considering having a shunt put in, to put an end to his sleepless nights- but there is a HUGE risk of impotence with that kind of surgery!! And he is so young! The doctors don't usually like performing that surgery for someone so young because the rest of his life ahead of him.  If anyone has ever heard of or seen anything like this PLEASE contact me as soon as possible. Both of us would sincerely appreciate any help or suggestions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Cindy.  I'm male 29 years old and have beem suffering form painless priapism for that past 18 month's which  i'm convinced is down to when i damaged my superficial dorsal vein some how aorund 18 months ago.  I'm convinced that its veno occlusive priapism and not high flow. I went to the doctor about the vein and i was diagnosed with superficial vein thrombosis but i was so unhappy with his general attitude that i hav'nt gone back since and have no faith in our National Health Service anyway and never have.  I can't afford to pay for private treatment unfortunetly  Sometime's i've woken up 12 times in a night with an erection.  I can get them to go down and they don't last anywhere near as long as your man's erections do. The longer ive had the erection for the longer it takes to go down and ive noticed that they are taking longer and longer to die down too. This applies to normal erection's and priapism induced ones. I've never had any pain but my penis has never been the same since i damaged the vein and is actualy getting worse. I can't get my penis to return to the same flacid state it once was  and ive basically got a partial erection the whole time.  I spend most of my time on my back now with my knee's up because i  believe that this stops the erection's when i'm awake.  If i sit in a chair i sit the whole time with a partial erection.  I'm sitting here typing this now with a partial erection.    It sound's like your man has high flow priapism. I seem to have symptoms of both types of priapism and even though there is no pain i'm convinced that i'm developing fibrosis. My left Corpus cavernosum has become bigger and is much harder than the  right one. When iv'e done a lot of exercise,  I'm cold or nervous about something and my penis shrivles up (like when your nipples get cold) i can clealry see that my penis is getting bigger because it's not as compact as it used to be. Especially the left Corpus cavernosum.  From the research ive done i'm convinced that this is due to fibrosis so like people with peyronies disease i'm trying high dosages of vitamin E with every meal.  Can you tell me does your man ride a push bike? Maybe the saddle from the bike has damaged the arterty to his penis?  The same thing  can happen if you ride motor bikes or horses too. The artery lies in the area between the anas and the scrotum.  Can you tell me if your man's penis has ever returned to the same flacid state that it was at before he sarted suffering from priapism? Does he suffer partial erections? Has his flacid penis gotten any bigger or become harder?  Does he suffer from partial erections too or are his erections always full blown ones?  When you mentioend that your man doesnt get erection's when hes active i think thats down to the fact that whne you are active your body drains blood away form parts of the body that don't need it and pumps blood to the parts of the body that do. When i used to work out alot and lift weight's my penis would become very cold and compact because my penis didnt need much blood. All the muscles i used needed it so my body drainned blood from the ares that did'nt need it and pumped it te the area's that did.  Something  ive noticed is that before i started to suffer from priapism when i needed to empty my bowls or urinate my penis would become compact (like when ive exercised a lot or i'm cold). Now blood gets pumped into my penis instead of being drained from it.  Basically i start to get an erection when i need the toilet.  I've also noticed that if ive been laying down for a long time and i get up to do somthing i start to get an erection. Like gravity is forcing blood into my penis.   Anyway Cindy i wish you and your man good luck  with all of this. The problem with priapism is that it's rare and there's not much research done into it because of that.  All you can do is keep gathering information and try new thing's. Maybe your  man should  try and change his lifestyle? Diet?   Anyway if you want to tlask about it and share info on symptoms etc then feel free to come back to this thread and talk with me.   Good luck and keep me posted!\n\n",

    "content": "CIndy. Be carefull with those injections because they can cause peyronies disease (scar tissue/fibrosis). In fact the pain your man is gettign may be from internal fibrosis due to trapped blood becoming stale and turning to scar tissue during bout's of priapism.  Injections sites could make it even worse.  Please do some research into peyronies disease, Cindy.  The useless urologist's you've seen have obviously not even menioned this.   Also, i don't understand why they gave him viagra when viagra gives you erections. It doesn't counteract them. Viagra can actualtl cause priapism and in some cases as actually lead to people getting chronic priapism. The last thing anyone with priapism shoud be taking is viagra.  If you are suffering from prolonged erection's then why on earth would they give you a drug that is designed to give you prologed erections? Fools!  I cannot get my head around this at all. To me it's just ridiculous, stupid and dangerous.   It's clear to me after reading your post that the urologis'st that you have been dealing with are absolutely uselss. Just like the one i dealt with.   I've found that you learn far more from reasearching on the internet than you do from most of these so called \"experts\"\n\n",

On the internet,an 'expert' diagnosis is mostly impossible - as  a) the 'expert' does not have access to the full history   b) the patient can't be clinically examined and  c) one can't investigate the patient.

Doctor told me it was nothing to worry about, everything is relatively normal.  Today, almost 2 months later, i am experiencing a sort of twitch in my left testicle.  At times i can visibly see it pulsating or both testicles moving on their own when i'm lying down.  Can you offer me any insight as to the \"twitch\" or why they are moving on their own?

Please do not go about researching topics such as the 'Benign fasiculation syndrome'-as this may worsen your apprehensions. It is best to ignore it. In case you are still worried, consult a urologist.Good luck!\n\n",

He was in so much pain that he could not even walk or stand up straight. I took him to the ER and was told it sounded like another kidney stone and they told me to take him to a urologist.

    "title": "Re: impotence after prostate surgery",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for your post. Firstly i would like to clarify that impotence is an important complication following 'Radical' prostatectomies - although to a lesser extent with 'open prostatectomies'. Remember that more often than not,a surgeon would be behind a robotic surgery as well!  So, what is important is the personal experience of the operating surgeon,the 'volume' of cases of this sort done at a given institution and the unique situations for a given case (anatomical variations etc).  ICI(Intracavernous injection) therapy with various agents such as prostaglandin E1 (PGE1) and a combination of phentolamine, papaverine, and PGE1 (Trimix). Quadrimix (Trimix + atropine) etc have been tried with varying success rates.  Vacuum erection devices (VEDs) also form an important part of the urologist\u2019s armamentarium for patients with post prostatectomy erectile dysfunction. They offer an additional option for post-radical prostatectomy patients who fail to have response to ICI (or can be used in combination with ICI therapy). 'Patient and partner acceptance' in decisions about long-term usage of erectogenic agents is mandatory for successful outcomes.Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Restricting Urine Flow Leads to Blood",
    "content": "2 years ago I had to get a drug test for a new job. I am male and had to pee into a cup. When I filled up the cup, I restricted the flow of urine from my penis until I could make it to the toilet. I must not have stopped the flow from my bladder by using my muscles, because I think that I ruptured something in my urethra. As soon as my urine stopped, I had a few drops of blood come out of my urethra. Fast forward 2 years, I was having sex last night and my wife squeezed my penis as I was about to ejaculate, restricting my semen and causing something to bleed inside of my urethra again. It bleed a little more this time, gently for about 5 minutes or so. We then fell asleep and when I went to pee in the morning, I guess the blood dried inside of my urethra because my urine took a second before it came out. once it came out (after less than a second), I had the sensation of bleeding and drops of blood came out after I had finished urinating. What is going on? Can it get infected from passing urine while there is some kind of wound in my urethra? Should I see a doctor or is there anything they can do? Is it serious? Help please! You can imagine it is a little traumatizing to see blood coming from your penis. Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Restricting Urine Flow Leads to Blood",
    "content": "Hello thehtizzle, Sphincters in our body are what one can call as \"The wonders\" in our bodies. Acts such as defecation,micturition,ejaculation (just to name a few) involve a very finely orchestrated interplay between the various components of the nervous system.Some muscles need to contract and some muscles(the sphincters) need to reciprocally relax (or the other way around at times!)! Sphincters once damaged, usually stay damaged. No one has yet been able to devise a sphincter! If one interferes with these finely co-ordinated acts, problems (such as the ones you have mentioned) are bound to occur. It is likely that the high pressures which built up(usual) in the distal urinary passage during micturition and ejaculation perhaps caused rupture of a tiny vessel-resulting in bleeding. Given rest, this should clear soon. Wounds in urethra, anal canal or perianal region usually heal surprisingly well despite bacteria present in these areas constantly.The reason is that these bacteria are 'commensals' and normally non virulent or of low virulence. I trust this information will be useful.Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The amount of urine voided in a day depends upon a lot of factors (such as the ambient temperature, nature of a person's work, intrinsic sweating ability, amount of liquids drunk etc etc). It is not enough at times to drink 2 1/2 bottles of water a day but what is more important is that an adult person drinks enough liquids in a day so as to put out about 2000 mls of urine in a day! This is the advise we ususlly offer to prevent urinary stone formation. I feel that if you follow this, you will get better.Please get your urine cultured and treated for UTI (if any) under the care of your doctor.Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi vanessa23 , I fully agree with Dr.Safaa Mahmoud.I will explain why...  Penile size is variable, depending upon the time of the day, extent of sexual arousal,seasons, etc etc.There is no 'resting' size...I do not believe so (personal opinion). Penile growth stops sometime shortly after puberty. Just like our bones do not continue to grow for ever, penis also (Thank God!) does not continue to grow. To site one undisputable fact, even androgen (testosterone) producing tumors of the adrenal glands in adult males for example, are not known to produce penile enlargement as part of their symptomatology. But....If one is happy due to perceived penile enlargement, so be it!! Let us not dispute it. But science does not seem to support it.Cheers!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi etanen69, There are some possibilities which come immediatly to my mind... a) It is possible that you had a type of undescended testis [(the 'nubbin' - where a tiny button-like remnant of the testis remains) - which can be only confirmed at surgery)] on one side and a unrecognized torsion on the other side, leading to testicular atrophy. Or.. b) Had an episode of torsion on one side first, leading to total testicular atrophy and later torsion of the other testicle, which is presently soft(atrophic). possibility a) is most likely. This could have resulted in loss of endocrine function of the testes (often some endocrine function remains intact despite loss of spermatogenesis). Please consult an endocrinologist to evaluate your problem.cheers!\n\n",

Im quite embarrased about this next part which is why im hesitant to see the doctor, the strechmarks in groin area has somehow affected my penis, it has left it constant shrinkage and sometimes inverting, and im circumcised. It use to just hang normally but after I got the strechmarks my penis never hangs from how it use to..  Also at start of the strechmarks forming in groin area everytime I would go to the toilet to pass urine it would burn like an std, but I was not having sex around this time. The buring sensation lasted about 1 month.  Is there a possibilty that my penis has been damaged due to the strechmarks?   Any feedback would be much appreciated thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,strech marks generally occur due to sudden change in weight.The middle layer of skin known as dermis is elastic and when streched beyond becomes loose and appear as strech marks.These are generally permanent.Any area of skin inluding the penile skin can get affected.Also in obesity the visible penis can get tucked in to the fat and may look smaller,but after erection become its normal.You may need an endocrine workup to rule out rarer causes but then the best couse of action would be to lose weight if that is the cause.External aplications are of little value.Immature strech marks,ie red in colour do respond to lasers.I do not think burning micturition has anything to do with the episode.You may need an urine examintion to rule out pus cells,or stones.There would be no damage to penis due to strech marks.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ncfirefighter46, Persistent testicular pain is NOT normal. Of the three physicians which you have seen were any of them a Urologist? If not, I would strongly suggest that you have an examination by this specialist. Some of the disorders that may cause persistent testicular pain are inguinal hernias, inflammation of any one of the male reproductive structures, epididymis or prostate gland, previous injury causing torsion of the blood vessels in the testicles, abnormal growths such as tumors, etc. Kidney stones may also sometimes radiate pain in the testicles. Again I would strongly suggest an evaluation by a urologist. The causative factor for the testicular pain should be taken seriously and you should not settle for a \"just deal with it\" answer. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi bsignificant, Iam not sure you mean pain in the testicle or in the scrotal wall.The fact that you feel worse when you stop walking almost excludes groin strain due to sports injury (where the  pain is aggravated on walking).Apart from the more common causes of testicular pain (such as orchitis,epididymitis etc),one may occassionally come across causes such as Genito-femoral neuralgia(here, the pain tends to increase on extension of the lumbar spine-ie:leaning backwards.Sufferers of this malady often tend to bend forwards to get relief).This condition is believed to be due to genito-femoral nerve entrapment or traction. Isuggest that you be examined by a urologist first.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have questions that I have been looking to get solved for the past 6 years. Im a 28 m from new york. Well about 6 years ago I was always getting urinary tract infections. Proply from using dirty sex toys- Fake vaginas. Anyways I feel sick about this. Welll I always had urinary tract infection type thing or burning while urinating. I suffered with this for about 2-3 years. Well one night I broke out into a extremely painful fever with extrem joint inflammation throughout my body. This lasted for about 1-2 weeks. I have suffered with joint inflammation, low grade fevers in feet, ankles, knees, prostate. This has been ongoing for the past 4 years. I went to several doctors who never made a complete diagnosis. They said they never found inflammation in my blood but I don't see how this can be when I cant stand up for long periods or do physical activity without getting inflammed. I am inflammed even when im not doing activity on the couch. The only thing they found was hla-b27. My first doctor thought I might have reiters or psoriatic arthritis. Im sick of living with this condition. My joints are always hot, and I cant even sit in a chair due to inflammed prostate that makes me crazy. I started taking alot of garlic thinking I had a infection for these past 4 years but nothhing stopps this inflamation. It helps when I abstain from masturbation for at least 4 days then the inflammation kinda stops , but once I ejaculate with masturbation or sex this prostate fever, fire, burning inflammation comes right back and I cant stand it. What can I do to stop this infllammtion/? I had a bad problem with masturbation through the ages of 12-27 have I ruined myself from masturbating to much causing me autoimmune response ? I have no idea why my immune system is attcking myself\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  For the past week or so, I have had a continuous urge to urinate. It feels as though my bladder is full but when I go, there are very small amounts of urine. I have been prone to UTIs in the past and assumed that this was the problem. I saw a doctor who performed a urine test. The dip stick showed the presence of blood, protein and another substance that I do not remember, she also sent a culture to be tested. I was given antibiotics last Monday but after taking them for the entire 5 days, the urge to urinate did not go away. I checked back with the doctor and the results of the culture taken before the antibiotic treatment was negative - I did not have an UTI after all.  I do not have a fever, no pain in the kidneys, wear cotton underwear, wash with Dove soap, wash my clothes in Gain... nothing has changed except for a prescription cream to heal a small tear in my posterior fourchette. The cream is ketoderm & 2% HCP. Could this be the cause of my problem? If not, what else do you think it could be and what can I do to reduce this constant urge? It's so bad that it keeps me up at night!  Thank you for you help\n\n",

I just wanted to tell you about something I found out the other day while visiting my Physio who is also a massage therapist. I was explaining about going into the urologist for this test and how embarrassed I was to have to do this.  I should also tell you that I was 27 when I had to have a hysterectomy and repair on my bladder. So now its almost 20 years later. She asked if she could just feel my abdomin. She found horrible amounts of scar tissue. She had me feel it. I have been feeling it for years but I thought it was some sort of cellulite. She said that scar tissue can attach to intestines and other organs causing the inability to function properly. She said it felt as if this scar tissue was causing the nerves around my bladder to be pinched and that is why I have no urgency and I have a hard time emptying my bladder. She said she worked on another woman with an incontinence problem and she had an over amount of scar tissue. By breaking it up she avoided surgery and now her bladder functions fine.  Maybe some massage would also work for you? Also.. it hurts like a bugger. Just be warned. =) I'm going to give this a \"go\" before I chose the surgery option.  Good luck =)\n\n",

I've heard horrible things about the muscle pain & people think it should be banned, but I like this doctor & I get the feeling I'm tieing his hands by not taking this next step.  So I got the first shot & he was concerned about my BP being so high, After driving home (1 1/2 hr drive to his office) I threw up for 8 hours and had to go to  my local doc to get a shot to stop.  this obgyn doesn't have emergency contact they said they'd let a message for him & he'd get back to me on monday.  so I e-mailed him & went  to my general doctor.  We have no clue if it was a reaction to lupron, or add-back or just a virus.   I e-mailed him again to say how good I was feeling the next day, being off everything & the nurse called me at home, monday & said get back on everything, My blood pressure was too high when they gave me the lupron shot & want me to go back to my local doc & get different meds for my bp.    I will check into the scar tissue thing, That would be nice if that was it.  So thanks.   It's been a year of this search & It hasn't been fun. I've seen 3 obgyns, surgeon, gastroenterolgist, urologist, & 2 family physicians. Each time we try something else,  I feel like I'm just a test case & am losing confidence in my doctor.  Who has been the only one sticking with me, So I really need ot appreciate him.   Thanks again Diane\n\n",

    "content": "Well, for the past week I have been having problems with my vaginal area. The vagina is very itchy and also my urethra , and I also have symptoms similar to an urinary tract infection. Pain when I pee, my urine smells, and I haven't had a full flow for a few days. I also noticed that my bladder is constantly feeling full and I have been extremely uncomfortable in the vaginal area. My OB/GYN isn't open, and I don't know how much of an emergency this might be.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is true your symptoms are suggestive of UTI. In this case simple urine analysis would be useful as an initial test in the diagnosis.  Urine culture and sensitivity would be needed to identify the causative organism and describe the most effective antibiotic.  It is always better to start treatment early to avoid complications that may have either a chronic damaging effect or may mandate longer course of antibiotic.  Candida infection (vaginal) may give similar clinical picture and should be excluded too as well as STDS like herpes virus infection.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor, a thorough clinical history and direst clincal examination are essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old female with urinary pain.  I have been having the pain for 2 months.  The pain is very inconsistent.  Some days I will have it, others I wont.  Sometimes it doesn't start hurting until after I urinate with an urge to urinate frequently.  It gets unbearably uncomfortable to the point where I need to drink 30 oz of water just to make it more comfortable. Its not painful with sexual intercourse. I went to a prompt care physician and my obgyn.  I was tested for a UTI which was negative, but they gave me antibiotics anyway which seemed to help but only temporary.  My obgyn was thinking that it was interstitial cystitis but its not more painful with drinking cranberry juice or some of the other non-recommended food items. Its not vaginitis and I am not pregnant. Also, I know its not weakness in my pelvic floor muscles. This pain is interrupting my life and I need to find out what it is.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "25.M.Past Cured Chlamydia Infection.No Surgeries. No Family history.  I have been passing yellow/orange solids in my semen, they occur approx. 1 out of every 3-4 times I ejaculate.  As mentioned I had chlamydia and took my antibiotic and tested for cure 30 days later and was in fact cured. Now I am suffering with this annoying problem. I tested for all other STD's and was negative. The solids somtimes cause discomfort, like they are hindering my semen from releasing, blocking it.  Somtimes I feel the solids get stuck in my shaft and have to force them out manually. What in your opinion could be causing me to release these annoying solids about 30-40% of the time I ejaculate? Should I worry about Cancer? Can it be somthing extremely serious? I am trying to get an appointment with a physician as we speak, but your advice would be greatly appreciated and could prepare me for what may lay ahead. There are no other problems in that area, my urine flows fine and at regular intrevals, no noticable marks or scars on my penis, aside from the solids in my semen, it would appear everything is fine down there. Please help me with your expertise. Also anyone who may have had a similar experience your imput would be greatly appreciated as well. Also, worth noting. The first time this happened, there was blood in my semen for about 3 days, then the solid passed for the first time, leading me to believe it was the reason for the blood.  Now I just get the solids, no blood in semen or urine.\n\n",

    "content": "This is a little perplexing to me.  I would hypothesize that what you are seeing may actually be small amounts of blood still in your semen.  The blood may be clotting forming the solids you describe.  Infection is possible.  If STD's are possible I would recommend you be tested again.  Also, STD's often run in packs, so if you had chlamydia it is possible that you may have another infection as well.  The testing for gonorrhea and chlamydia is not 100% sensitive so a negative test may have missed an infection.  Infections may or may not have pain.  With blood in the semen, cancer is a possibility.  Infection is probably more likely.  I would recommend you see a urologist for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you doctor for the quick reply. Maybe this scernario will shed some more light on the subject. I caught chlamydia 5 months ago, I was not diagnosed and cured until 2.5 months after catching it. Gonnerrhea was negative then, just positive for chlamydia.  I went back for 2-3 weeks later and tested for everything else via a blood sample, after 2 weeks my results came back negative for syphillis, Hep A and B, and HIV. I then returned 3 weeks later to test for cure for chlamydia, which came back negaive for both chlamydia and gonnerhea. So in short I have tested twice for Chla. and Gonner.  and once for the rest. I really hope that the STD could not pass undetected with todays testing. Also, the solids are yellow/orange, which does not look like blood, but may be, I am not a doctor. It is just very odd, this only happened a couple of times before I was cured from my infection, and now after cured, it seems to happen more often. I guess the only way to know, would be to see a doctor and have more tests done. Well, I just wanted to add to my post just incase the additional info helps. Thanks again and if there is anything you would like to add please do, I feel I wont get into the doctor for a few days, so some more advice would be nice. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 35 year old. For the last year or so I have been spending most of my time sitting in front of a computer. Sometimes, I felt my underwear (briefs) put pressure between my leg and toolkit, basically on the swimsuit line, as they \"rode up\". I adjusted occasionally, other times I just put up with the slight discomfort (often on the left hand side, maybe just my imagination).   3 months ago I started dating a woman. We have been having vigorous sex. 6-7 times within a 24 hour period on weekends two times a month. The dull ache that I feel, is as if the sex is vigorous enough to have me believe that my scrotum is hitting her hard enough to cause a slight pain from banging against her during coitus. This now apparently isn't the case. I haven't met her for over a week yet I feel this dull sensation. It seems to feel like something is swollen at the top set of \"tubes\" that connect to my left testicle in the area just above my scrotal area, where the hair is thickest and where a (tube/vessel/connecting tissue) seems to run just underneath the skin. Or as if there were some kind of swelling occurring in the upper part where those connecting tissues connect to the left testicle.   I have preformed self examinations. No signs of lumps, no painful discharge when urinating, standing does seem to relieve the pain slightly. It is as if sitting pulls the slack out of the connecting tissue and makes it tauter (tighter?). I haven't been doing any strenuous activity other than our sexual routine, which often leaves me a bit exhausted.  I will make a trip and see if I can make an appointment to see a Urologist tomorrow.   What do I need to tell the doctor and what kinds of things should I expect from the doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 29 Years old. I have been experiencing this for a few weeks now (maybe since mid October). I figured it would just go away by now but I have been having a pain inside of my penis during erection, like a sore muscle type pain, but more pronounced and sensitive before ejaculation. I felt all around it for any plaques or scars or things like that and haven't found anything like that, and no bending either (but I think I have been imagining it slightly curved more, but that could be all in my head since there are no plaque areas, and I have been closely examining it more). I can't think of any trauma having occurred to it then or ever. The pain feels like the muscle is completely flexed inside almost like it wants to burst (especially before ejaculation). I do not have a sexual partner and for the most part have not been masturbating much since I am stressed and busy with work/school. Recently I tried masturbating more frequently to see if I just had 'build up' inside, but so far I can't notice any difference either way. So, I wonder if this pain is due to my having to sit at a computer for many hours at school, and stress, and the fact that I have days where I barely get in a few hours of sleep due to school? I don't like sitting and can feel some discomfort in the muscle that runs from anus through penis. When it is flaccid I have a very slight tingle (almost ticklish) near the opening, like the way it would feel after sex. So, can anybody help? Thanks.\n\n",

If I lubricate the area, the catheter is able to move freely and this too helps.  I have found a temporary solution by using an external catheter with the foley, pulling my skin over the head of the penis while I unroll the external catheter.

    "content": "Hi, I truely sympathise with you. As a surgeon, i am well aware how difficult catheterizations can be at times.This could be due to a narrowing of the prostatic urethra or due to reflex spasm of the bladder neck.Try to be patient, never do it in a hurry, relax, lubricate well - if necessary empty sufficient local anesthetic jelly into the urethra, milk it upwards & let it act (wait for 10-15 min) and then catheterize. Good luck next time and every time thereafter!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 45 yr old female who started getting left back pain just below end of ribs in apr 2007.Pain slowly increased on both sides moving around toward front, then in Sep 07 I urinated and agonizing pain was gone.I assume I passed stones.But the original pain has stayed since.K.U.B xrays,ultrasound,urine and bloodwork show that there are no stones and kidneys are fine,but the pain just below ribs still stays.Cat scan just showed gallstones and 2cm cyst on left ovary.My GP says I'm not dehydrated even though,skin fold on hand is positive and I did a intake(67oz)and output(67oz),I am on oxycodone,amitriptiline,benedryl,colace,zopliclone and oxaepam(which I believe dehydrate me).which means I'm in the negative everyday if I'm urinating out the liquids I take in.I am also sweating with every activity and have been since 2007.Also with activity my temperature lowers..after 20 min of shovelling snow my temp was 94.3..2007 it was 91.2 after 2 hrs of shovelling,but will increase after I stop activity.Pain seems to increase whenever I drink anything.My right thyroid was removed in 2004 and am on .075mg levothyroxine.My T3 T4 Tsh levels are also fine.My GP says its got to be my back,but my back pain wouldn't increase because of drinking water.Could this be because of Dehydration?I am also on calcium and vitamin d because of losing half of thyroid.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can Chronic Dehydration cause Kidney Pain?",
    "content": "Hi, Dehydration is certainly related to renal stones.A good urinary output prevents crystal formation in the urine.Although at times imaging does not reveal a urinary stone,still renal colics can occur due to crystals(not actual stones-but precursors of stones)-temporarily blocking the ureters.They may not be visualised on imaging as they might have been washed away. One should take the precaution to drink adequate amount of fluids to put out about 2000 mls+ of urine/day(adults). As you are on calcium supplements,there is an increased risk of urinary stone formation.So, keep drinking enough liquids. As i said earlier,drink enough water to put out an adequate urine output! Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Alright, I was diagnosed with IC back in early 2007 and since then I've been on the morbidly expensive, but helpful drug Elmiron ever since. I'm also using Nuvaring for birth control. Prior to being diagnosed I'd taken fat-burning supplements and recently I've packed on a few pounds... Seeing as summer is approaching rapidly and I'd like to shed a few I picked up a GNC fat burner called 'Sliced'. I'm reluctant to take this as I'm afraid it will cause more damage or irritation to my bladder, but I've a refund option in case it doesn't work out for me. I'm a moderate - very active individual and I eat right...  Would it interact badly with the drugs I'm already taking? Would it cause more damage to my bladder or render Elmiron ineffective? I was just wondering. I spoke with my doctor a few days ago but I failed to mention this subject as it was predominantly a spontaneous decision. Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "title": "Urethral Stricture Advice",
    "content": "Hello I had a urethral stricture which was operated on when i was 19. It was cut open and the stricture widened to allow my urine flow to improve.   I am now 30 and have had the stricture stretched twice since the above operation.   Since doing some research and also being told by the doctor previously I am aware that the scar tissue can over time cause the stricture to close up again and this will require more stretching or another operation to cut.   I looked online and it mentioned about how a coil can stop the stricture re occuring.   Today when I went back to the urologist regarding my urine stream seeming thinner and having irritable bladder symptoms (frequent urgency. feeling like bladder not emptied fully. waking up in the night needing to go etc) he mentioned about getting me back in for another exploratory minor operation and if it has narrowed again to cut away once more.   I mentioned to him about the coil i had read about and if this is a likely permenant solution. He told me that the hospital does not do it but he can refer me to a hospital that does but questioned why at my age it would be considered as normally it is cancer patients and older men who have it. He didnt seem to answer my question at all as to why a coil would not be or should be used. I got another appt with him and have delayed making a date for a operation with them yet as I have some unanswered questions and may even ask for a different doctor who can explain the options available better.   My question on here is does anyone have any information on urethral strictures that are relevant to my queries. Are there any other treatments besides simply cutting the stricture open again and me constantly having to go back and get it cut open or stretched each time it narrows for the rest of my life.   Does anyone know about the coil. Is there any other treatments that have more permenant results like laser or something?  I recently discovered that its called surgical stents and not a coil for urethral stricture. I don't know if there is a big distinction.  I basically want to find the best treatment with the best and most permenant results and i am posting on here because i was very frustrated with the doctor just fobbing me off and looking at me like a crazy person for even questioning alternatives to him just dragging me in for a operation to look in and then stretch or cut if appropriate. I don't want to keep going the rest of my life waiting for the stricture to close again and then be dragged in for more operations.  Is urethroplasty a decent option. if it gives decent results i will go and see a different doctor and mention it to him.  The problem i have with a urethroplasty is the description of it. It sounds like something like that would cause more problems and scarring than the original stricture?  Advice would be greatly appreciated  THank you very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Urethral Stricture Advice",
    "content": "Hi, Traditionally used treatments for urethral strictures are as follows.. 1) urethral dilatations 2) internal urethrotomy(optical urethrotomy) and  3) urethroplasty.  Urethral dilatations are not in vogue these days.The last resort  traditionally had been urethroplasty. A rather recent entrant in the management of urethral strictures is urethral stenting. Some of the current indications sited are -failed multiple urethroplasties, -failed multiple internal urethrotomies and patient unfit for urethroplasty and  -patients with multiple failed internal urethrotomies and urethroplasties.  Much of the available evidence pertains to their successful use in strictures of prostatic and bulbar urethra. Perhaps more studies are required before it is accepted as a routine procedure in the management of all urethral strictures. I hope this information will be useful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 67 year old white male retired and living in Mexico. I recently developed ( overnight ), a large fluid filled sac on the exterior of my left elbow. It does not hurt and it is not hot and there is no restriction of joint movement. Following a doctors visit and lab work ... urine tests and blood work, there appears to be a slightly elevated Creatinine level ( 1.4mg/dl vs a norm of 0.6 - 1.3 mg/dl ) A course of anti-inflamatory medicine ( Naproxen ) was prescribed but two weeks later the swelling has not receded. A follow up urine test ( sample collection over 24 hours ) indicated exactly the same numerical results as previously stated but a reading of something in Spanish ( which I can't translate ...  \" Depuracion de Creatinina en Orina  de 24 horas \" , showed 66.5 mL/min for me vs a norm of 98 - 156 mL/min for the average male  The doctor has recomended a visit to a urology specialist and without confirmation seems to think there is malfunction in the kidney filtering sytem caused by a build up in tolerance to medications over the years...... altho he says that all the medications I am currently on have no bearing.  However, after reading up on the subject what I have physically seems to be a bursa which could have been caused by a blow to the elbow that I don't even remember receiving. The onlt thing tht doesn't jibe is the fact that there is no pain or heat.  Given the info I have supplied do you feel that it a bursa caused by a blow, or some kind of kidney malfunction that is causing uric acid retention. The doctor does not want to lance and drain the sac and indicates that it is a serious ernough issue that I should get it checked out further and refrain from strenous exercise  Do to my lack of medical expertise in Spanish, your comments /opinion would be appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The bursa that you are referring to is probably an enlarged olecranon bursa behind elbow.This may be a result of trauma (esp repeated minor trauma rather than acute severe trauma).The back of the elbow is constantly subjected to pressure.One is usually unaware of this (for ex: the common posture of resting one's head in one's palm with the elbow supporting the weight of the head).This,in some individuals,may result in enlargement of the olecranon bursa(olecranon bursitis). The slight alteration in the creatinine values could have been caused by NSAID use-but better be investigated.I do not think that olecranon bursitis has any direct relationship to kidney fuction.

    "content": "On March 6, 2009 my 23 year old son had surgery to correct a ventral congenital curve that I was not aware he was born with.  His fiance and he, not knowing where to go,brought it to my attention 1-1/2 years ago.They had confided in me that it was virtually impossible to be intimate because of his downward curve.We did alot of research,and after many months he decided to go forward with the surgery. The surgery was performed by degloving the penis right below the gland and then two non-desolving stitches where placed to \"tether\" the penis in the opposite direction of the curve. I thought we had done our \"homework\" and we reasearched the subject and felt it was safe to do.he Dr. told us that there would be no problems with the proceedure.Well now he finds himself nearly 3 months post surgery and although they are able to be intimate he has vertually no sensation other than in the gland.He is now feeling a very very little at the base and a small section on the side. We are concerned that the dorsal nerve bundles has been damaged.How long does it take for nerves to reconnect or regrow nerve endings?Is it common to have temporary loss of sensation after this surgery?  How many months can he expect before full sensation returns?  The two sutures are also a bit painful and raised.  I would apprecite any direction, suggestions or help you could offer.  We are all very concerned about this.Thank you for your help!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr.Jagesh, Thank you so much for referring the post by kissxxx.  In patients presenting with this kind of symptom, a surgeon would like to first rule out  a) an acute anal fissure and b) a sub mucus anorectal abscess. Both can present with excruciating pain in the anus especially during defecation.In reading her account very carefully, i would tend to suspect a condition which presents as episodic,severe pain (spasms) in the anorectum -ie: 'Proctalgia Fugax'. This is also at times called as the 'Levator ani syndrome'. This usually affects females, is episodic, usually occurs during nights and lasts upto 30 minutes or less.Believed to be caused by spasm of the levator ani muscles and the internal sphinctre muscle. Many types of management are quoted (such as sitting on a base ball!,bending and touching ones own toes,anal massages and pharmacological therapy - calcium channel blockers,NSAIDs,Botulin toxin etc). Whether her urinary frequency is related to this problem - i am not so sure.It needs to be evaluated as well. Thank you once again for this thought provoking referral.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-- I'm a male in his early 20s with no STIs. In the past 4 years I've had a single partner and for the past 7 months I haven't been sexually active. Don't know if this will help or is necessary, but i typically masturbate between 3 and 5 times a week, sometimes more. I'm not real consistent.   It seems like when I urinate soon after ejaculating (+/- 10 min) afterward I continue to have to pee (pressure/discomfort in urethra--not bladder), sometimes for hours. There's nothing unusual about the color or smell of the pee. Occasionally the urinating is accompanied with some pain near the end of the urethra with the pain increasing with the strength of the stream, i.e., a very strong stream might be accompanied by a brief sharp pain. The inconsistency of it all is confusing. I want to say that I've experienced something like what I've described to varying degrees for quite some time, but I only really noticed recently. From what research I've done online the symptoms seem like they might possibly be consistent with either UTI or stricture--then again, I tend to think I have whatever disease I research.   Thanks very much for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The most important in your case is to rule out nongonococcal urethritis.Since I do not have your sexual history, this is in general about NGU which can cause a urethritis as well as a prostatitis in causing a rectal pain.There may be a mild discharge not as much as in gonococcal urethritis.Chlamydia trachomatis is the commonest organism.The complications incude epididymitis,arthritis and prostatitis.In women pelvic inflammatory disease is a complication leading to tubal block and infertility.Best treated with azithromycin or doxycycline.Do get our self examined and treated.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The normal penis is suspended from the pubic bone(part of the pelvis) by two ligaments (suspensory ligament and fundiform ligament).They suspend the penis in such a way that the normal penis hangs from the pubic bone with an upward convexity in the relaxed state(this convexity disappears during an erection).These ligaments can become weak or can undergo tears (violent masturbation, other trauma - acute or chronic). This may result in the loss of normal curve of the penis and a palpable gap just above the root of the penis where it attaches to the pubic bone.Erectile dysfunction can be a sequel.Your problem may or may not be related to this. It could be an erectile dysfunction due to another cause. Injury to the ligaments of the penis does not normally result in a shrunken penis as is your case. Torn penile ligaments can be repaired with successful outcomes. An expert urologist should be able to sort out your problem. I thank Dr.Jagesh kamath for referring this post to me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi suna, Penile fractures are actually tears in the ligaments of the penis since the penis contains no bone structure. However, there is typically a snap with excruciating pain when the injury occurs. The injury most often occurs when the penis is fully erect. Untreated injury can result in impotence or Peyronie's disease (curvature of the penis). If a MRI was suggested I would strongly suggest that you have this diagnostic study completed for an evaluation. I can understand how this would affect you both physically and emotionally. The first step is to have the diagnosis reached by a specialist physician. If you have currently received no adequate answer by your current treating physician then I would encourage you to seek a second opinion by another specialist. Again I would also encourage the MRI diagnostic. Best wishes! Thank you Dr. J. Kamath and Dr. M. Kamath for the referral!  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Suna, Penile fracture, as correctly alluded to by Theresa Jones, RN, occurs commonly during the erect state of the penis. It is due to rupture of the \"tunica albuginea'- a fibrous envelope sorrounding the corpora cavernosa of the penis.The corpora also may fracture along with this depending upon the forces involved. The suspensory ligament and the fundiform ligaments are usually uninvolved but injuries to these ligaments may co-exist. You may approach the Manipal Hospital, or the wockhardt hospital in bangalore. I wish to thank Dr.J. kamath and Theresa Jones, RN for their prompt replies.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Suna, If it had been a fracture of the penis, ideal time for repair(to get the best possible outcome) would have been immediatly following the trauma(as an emergency repair). If it had been rupture of the suspensory ligament or fundiform ligament, then the ideal time for repair would have been after a week or two following the injury (time needed for the acute post - traumatic inflammation to subside). As you can see, we are discussing about this 6 years hence. As i am no expert in this type of surgery, i may not be able to accurately predict the outcome of such a late repair. MRI may be able to reveal the damage(if any) to the tunica albuginea but whether it may image the suspensory and fundiform ligaments, i am not that certain. Also, an MRI angiogram may reveal the current state of the erectile tissue (the corpora cavernosa). This will be very useful in deciding on the future theraputic options.   I wish you luck!\n\n",

    "content": "sir,      i have taken second opinion of situation from another urologist in mani pal hospital. here i am giving my complete details of case history.i want is ther any  risks invloved diagnosing this situation as iam much worrlied about even in gentic and long term effects of it. as unble to know exactly  thecause of the problem.     Some time (about 6 years   ) ago   I   had a self made injury to my urinating organ while I was raising and lowering urinating organ in the erected state. At that time I felt  momentary pain at the root(staring  of the penis) of urinating part.iam not sure of about sound of tearing .immediately  penis got shrunken drastically which I  can feel it(of shrukenness) in my mind and also recognize it  by seeing smooth folding of skin over penis.and also cannot move horizontally or vertically(lift) which I think before the injury  was able to do the same , it is loosely hanging as if lost completely control over it.  i think the  incident caused damage to some tissues in side penis at the base of the penis which r responsible to control it and support. .  I thought I broke a ligament which supports in right position (or fix) and control its movement mere by wishing with out help of hand. I feel like I have broken some thing which holds tight in position and and right manner (with out skin folding).i can feel and sense some thing loosely hanging and shrunken which is so since injury .but nothing of emergency sort happened; hence I didn\u2019t care about it. Prior to injury I used to get my urinating organ just by thought only now I need to use help hand to get it erected.  In addition to shrunken ness (became small) I sense in erected state I sense it became thin in erected state.  As it is affecting my being since then, recently I met urologist. They say they could not find any abnormality in it except its smallness in size (which I would say was not earlier) .but when I complain they say it needs mri or ultrasound test to confirm it. They did not ask me that it is necessary and they closed my case saying no urology required. But they were not listening my complaints of feeling of brokenness. I think they thought that it is better to continue in the present state than take a risks involved either in diagnosis or there after surgery which is unworthy to proceed further.   After some I went to another urologist as I could not solve my problem which am facing. Another urologist also examined and said it is normally so only and all are due to my thinking only.for my satisfaction asked for ultracsound scanning test.  I thought no one is able to understand my situation of having kind awkward feeling of broken and shrunken penis and also sense of it just by physical having look at it.  And I am worried about risks (short and long term side effects of tests (functioning and genetically) involved in diagnosis as I don\u2019t want deteriorate further my condition.  Hence I want to physically examine well with the following symptoms.  Status before the injury: 1.I think prior to the injury size of penis was longer(which I can sense of becoming  small later)earlier I did not have any kind of feeling ,I was normal and not worried about its size (what ever its actual  size).  2. Skin over the penis is normal I do not have any worry about it. 3. I can get erection just by thought only no need of help of hand. 4. I think I had control over movement when ever I wish to move either for passing urine for direction without help of hand. Incident: I was lowering and rising my urinating I think in erect state .suddenly I had sensed pain at the root of the penis, I think immediately lost erected state and became normal. but at the time only I sense I could not  move it little  also could not  it erect   by thought only and I can sense the shrukenness by size drastic change. And nothing of emergency happened.  At the time of injury: I sensed a momentary pain at the root of the penis I think where the it is balanced. I think I heard sound of tearing but I am not sure of it .then i thought I have teared my ligaments.  But nothing of emergency sort happened so I did not care. But I noticed some difference in feeling due to its size and movement and thought wise erections.i think I was straining my ligaments which lead to this injury  after some time(I think role of fatigue ness in  it is cause)    Status since the injury:  1.I think after  the injury size of penis became  smaller (which I can sense by its smallness which earlier was not there)earlier I did not have any kind of feeling ,I was normal and not worried about its size (what ever its actual  size) , now I am worried about its shrukenness as its state let me so. Some times some of my friends complain me about what have I done with my urinating organ just when my shirt in inserted in pant (in shirt). Means they r able to judge it by out side look only some thing which is abnormal. and I see some people stare at my urinating organ as if some thing  was abnormal in its state. This makes me quite emarrssing.duet o which I am not able to concentrate as it is effecting my being both internally (self) and externally (others perception) also. One of my urologists also said this in his report. 2. I am sensing its shrunken state (feeling of shrukenness) which I can recognize by its smooth skin folding over penis. I do have worry about its folding skin over the penis. 3. I think I had lost control over its movement when ever I wish to move either for passing urine for direction without help of hand and hanging loosely which ever side I move as If completely teared it supporting ligaments or so.  4. I cannot get erection (only little almost nil) just by thought only which I can surly say I had earlier. But have erections with the help of hand only but with sense of reduced thickness in its erected state.  i am not sure this is called penile fracture or not and what this situation is known . And i wish to know is it reversible. If so does it require need of surgery? is treating it risk worthy enough to improve situation with out complicating further . .      for that  i wish to be diagnosed my situation. And also i wish to know any side effects of mri or ultra scanning of any type on my both general and sexual health of which I am fearing. I want some  suggestion about   how to diagnose (without undue requirement)without side effects both genetic or short term which I am worried more and go about solving this problem and what would be the right way of handling this problem.is there any treatment to this condition as its been long time for it.  Please give some suggestion to better way to get better.\n\n",

    "content": "Please help,  For about a year now, every time, and I do mean every time, I take even 1 aspirin, or 1 Tylenol or just 1 Ibuprofen within 10 minutes I begin having urinary tract pain. If I take several OTC pain meds I will get intense pain in my urinary tract. I take the Tylenol, etc. for foot pain, knee pain, etc. Once at my sister's house I became so uncomfortable that she told me to drink apple cider vinegar in water, I did and the pain stopped after several sessions of drinking this mixture. I still drink it now and it overcomes the pain but when I saw my doctor last I totally forgot about the issue. What is causing this pain that only occurs after taking OTC pain meds....I have never had this happen prior to this past year???\n\n",

One caviat: over the internet I cannot say for certain if this is or is not torsion.  If testicular torsion is present this is an emergency as the longer the torsion remains the less likely it will be to save the testis.  If you are still concerned it may be torsion I recommend that you see a doctor as soon as possible.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  kidd34, There are certain indicators for the diagnosis of torsion of the testicle. a) what is known as the 'lie' of the testicle-- ie: horizontally placed testicle rather than the normal vertical lie. b) scrotum which may appear inflammed (red) and very tender. c) spermatic cord which may feel 'twisted' d) lifting up the scrotum worsens the pain. However, as surgeons, we usually keep our threshold of clinical suspicion very low and would prefer to request a scrotal  ultrasound & doppler study to exclude this diagnosis. Actually, we would 'explore' if we are convinced despite the results of the investigations!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy 26 yr old male. I recently started to develop UTI symptoms a day or two after I had sex with my girl. We started out with foreplay in the shower. I ejaculated in the shower with soap all over my penis area, and we also had a very long night of rougher than usual sex. (Maybe this data could be helpful?)   The symptoms are an irritated feeling in my urethra area and also a slight discomfort/tingle/burning sensation during urination. Also there may be a slight increase in my need to urinate. I bought the AZO UTI home test and tested positive for Leukocytes but negative for Nitrites. Could this still be a UTI? I know the presence of Leukocytes is WB Cells, so there is an infection along the urinary tract, correct? If not a UTI, what other conditions could this be? Also, I am taking the OTC pills for UTI by the same company AZO, and have noticed some relief from the irritated feeling. I have also refrained from re checking today with a new test strip due to the discoloration of my urine from the OTC meds, which I figured would somehow throw off the results. Thank you very much in advance and hope to get some help soon!\n\n",

    "content": "I perform intermittent catheterization due to a psychological issue (paruresis, shy bladder). Yesterday evening during an intermittent catheterization the catheter was slipping out so I kept pushing it back in, then some blood came out. Before that I did get urine flow from the bladder. I immediately removed the catheter and urinated normally about 250 mL of normal clear yellow urine, but with two small blood clots. I did not feel any pain during any of this.  A little later I urinated a bit and another small clot came out. A few hours later that night I urinated 400 mL of cloudy, orange urine, but no clots. Then just a few minutes later I was able to urinate a bit more and it was clear yellow. About half an hour later, before bed, just a small amount of urine, but it was pink, and with a clot.  The next morning (today), urine was normal, clear, no blood clots, and it's been completely ordinary all day (though I've been very gentle when urinating, avoiding straining). Through all this the only pain has been occasional soreness in the prostatic area when bending down or straining; I haven't had any pain urinating or when the sphincters open/close, as I sometimes do after catheterization. I've never had any urological symptoms like this or any urinary tract infections in the past, and have catheterized myself about 50 times total.  I don't have the money to see a urologist at the moment, and just wanted to get an idea of what this might have been. Basically, I'm thinking that bleeding due to catheterization might be common, and that the lack of pain and other symptoms might support this conclusion, but want to get some ideas. My guess is that I either irritated the urethral surface, hit the inside of my bladder with the tip, or perhaps pushed it into the ejaculatory duct (I was using a really soft catheter). Thanks for any insight.\n\n",

I just thought I was constipated and took some over the counter meds. Then, about Monday I started to feel a burning sensation in the middle of my Penis. When I urinate it feels like there is something stuck in the middle of my penis and is extremely painful. Could I be trying to pass a kidney stone or prostatis.  Thanks\n\n",

He had a vasovagal reaction with this recently where he became diaphoretic and his pulse rate dropped dramatically.  He recovered upon lying down in the modified trendellenberg position.  The pain usually lasts between 5-10 minutes after ejaculation.  The only thing that he has found that relieves the pain is by massaging the area internally through the anus and by mentally trying to relax the muscles in the area where pain is felt.  This  pain does not happen every time he ejaculates, but it is worrisome due to the sudden increase in severity.  We haven't been able to find any information on this subject thus far, and are wondereing if Is this a common problem, and what do you think that we should do about it?  Thank You so much!\n\n",

    "content": "I am posting on behalf of my girlfriend, who is profoundly shy and lives in circumstances that discourage her from seeking medical help. I am very puzzled by the symptoms and have found nothing in the literature that seems remotely related unless she has a calculus lodged in an unusual location that never causes any pain and only abrades from shifting caused by the combination of orgasm with elevated physical activity in surrounding hours. We only see each other a few times a year, and she has never had any other partner, so the correlation between sexual intercourse and the symptoms seems solid.  Between 3 and 12 hours after sexual activities involving penetration culminating in orgasm, she seems to slide into shock: a gradually intensifying feeling of \"weirdness\" which verges on fainting if she is ambulatory. There is some nausea. These recede within an hour or two. However, two out of the three times they have been accompanied by gross h\u00e6maturia. She states the discharge is definitely urethral, and it seems to be fresh blood with little urine. There is no pain associated with any of the symptoms or activities. The sexual activities are not what anyone would consider unusual or rough.  This has happened three times, all in this past year. The first two occurred in my presence, within some hours of sex culminating in orgasm for her, while we were out walking around. Other sexual activities not resulting in orgasm did not provoke the symptoms; nor do her own frequent masturbatory orgasms, which do not include significant penetration. The third and most recent episode occurred when she was alone, but within a few days seeing me, and following masturbatory orgasm. She had been more active physically than usual in the hours surrounding the episode, and this is also a feature of the first two episodes.  She is otherwise physically healthy, age 20, slender, but somewhat sedentary. She is probably borderline an\u00e6mic and needs to drink more water, which I goad her to do \u2014\u00a0it is this constant state of near dehydration that suggests to me a kidney stone. She takes no medicines of any kind.  Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

The vas was cut, both ends tied, and both ends quarterised. Pretty much a bullit proof job you would have thought, but it appears not.  My first sample went in after 5 weeks and 25 ejaculations and it showed a small amount of live sperm, Ok I thought lets give it a bit longer.  I put in another sample this morning, so thats now 7 weeks and about 40 blow offs and the results have come back showing even more live sperm  Is it possible that sperm can still be alive after 7 weeks? Or does it seem like the tubes have joined up again. Im absolutely gutted as I went through so much pain and trauma after the Opp.  My doctor is off this week so cannot help me.

    "content": "Time to sterilization after vasectomy varies from individual to individual. In general, about 90% of men have no sperm in the ejaculate 3 months after a vasectomy. The other fact is that ejaculation is a very inefficient \"pump\" to remove residual sperm, probably clearing 15% of sperm in the tubes after each episode. So, this means that some men need up to 6-8 mos to \"clear the pipes\" after vasectomy.  Having motile sperm persist in the ejaculate after 6 mos is a concern however. This needs to be followed monthly while other forms of contraception are continued. If it persists up to 8 mos post-procedure, then I would consider it a technical failure and repeat the vasectomy procedure.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  These lesions are probably the common and simple whitehead-like eruptions found commonly on the male apparatus. They can be due to inadequate hygeine, overproduction of oil by the skin, or sometimes due to irritation from masturbation or even tight underclothing. Try washing with mild soap and warm water once or more daily, followed by gentle drying with a clean, dry towel. If they don't disappear in a week or so, you might want to have a doctor look at them, as he may be able to prescribe something that will safely cause them to dry out and go away. Since you've had no sexual contact they are not STD-related (and especially not herpes, which can sometimes look like what you describe), so other than any minor discomfort they may cause they are very likely no cause for concern.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

To provide some more information, I have had sex without protection some time ago, maybe 6 months or even longer prior to this problem; I would like to know if this problem may relate to a sexually related disease or is this just a eczema related problem?

    "content": "Hello -  This  doesn't sound like eczema to me, mainly because of the discharge that appears when these lesions rupture. You also have a history of unprotected sex, so that adds to the possibility of this being a form of inquinal lymphadenopathy, possibly supperating lyphogranuloma. I need to ask about the size of these bumps and if there is any swelling beneath the skin as these lesions develop. Do they just appear spontaneously then eventually rupture and drain?   This needs to be cultured and blood work done to determine if you have some form of lymphadenopathy.  While it is eminently curable via antibiotics, if left untreated it can cause some rather unpleasant symptoms, even though it may go into remission for long periods of time or even resolve on its own.   I wouldn't count on this going away on its own and, because of the history of unprotected sex, I'd be concerned that this may berelated to that encounter. It does sound a good deal like some sort of inquinal lymphadenopathy, some forms of which can, as I said earlier, this can lead to some rather unattractive complications if untreated. You may need to see a different doctor if this one continues to dismiss this as \"just cysts.\"   I hope this is helpful.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I searched a lot for this but nothing seemed to quite fit my problem.  Since yesterday's night I was aroused and feeling the need to masturbate. I held myself of doing it yesterday knowing I'd be with my girlfriend today but in the morning I woke up.... aroused. So I did masturbate but every time I was close to reach the orgasm I stopped, until I was so close that I barely could stop but I did. Than I managed to do other things. And when I was with my girlfriend we took long reaching my orgasm on purpose, but by the end my testicles started to hurt so much that we couldn't even touch them. It felt like the reason was because I pushed them so much and so hard preventing the orgasm that they started to hurt. My scrotum had shrunk a lot and the testicles were very pressed against my abdomen. When I reached orgasm the pain looked like it intensified and an even stronger pain appeared in the lower left and right part of my abdomen. It was like this for about one hour. Crouching seemed to help, I had a really hard time urinating even with the need to do so but eventually managed, although it did not decrease the pain. And in the end a hot bath seemed like it helped starting to revert the situation.  The pain in the abdomen disappeared short after. And only the testicles pain dragged for a few more hours.  My testicles and their veins/tubes looked swollen and my scrotum with a more purple color.   About 7 hours have passed and I can only feel a little something on my right testicle (which is the most lowered one for me) and corresponding abdomen part which seems normal considering the intensity of the pain earlier.   I wonder if it is something that I should be worried about or just something normal when one makes such an effort to contain an orgasm.  Sorry for such detailed messaged, just don't want to leave anything  behind in my explanation. And sorry for my poor English as it's not my first language.  Jokingly I said to my girlfriend that my testicles had collapsed, joking so much about it made me get even worried.  Thank you.\n\n",

It has gone from nightly to only 2-3 nights per week, but shouldn't be happening at all by this age.  He is very active in athletics (football, basketball, baseball and track) and is in extremely good athletic condition.  He is a typical teenager eating junk food, candy and carbonated drinks I'm sure more than he should.  He falls to sleep easilym at night and has always been a very sound sleeper.  Do you have any suggestions on how this problem might be resolved or at least alleviated to less frequent occurences???  I know for his own self esteem, we need to find a solution soon.\n\n",

    "title": "Kidney Stone sporadic non-debilitating pain",
    "content": "I am currently 'loaded' with my 30 and 31st kidney stones which are 4mm in size in both kidneys.  I have had two CTs in the past month for this reason.  Yesterday while traveling I began to experience the 'classic' kidney stone symptoms for me- dull ache pain in the similar to a tennis ball being pressed into my back.  This pressure increased to a golfball pressure, at which point I went to my urologist and dropped off a urine sample to (hopefully) prove I had blood in it from a stone.    Two hours later (8hrs from start) I called and asked for Oxycodone/APAP 5/325 to control the pain as it was progressively getting worse.  Four hours after that (12 hrs from start) a switch was flipped and the pain just stopped and I was able to urinate freely again.  About 4 hours after that I had 2 minutes of muscle spasms in nearly the same spot.  Unfortunately I did not have the presence of mind to grab a sharpie and mark the locations of the pain and spasms.  The next day I had the 2nd CT which confirmed, according to the radiologist, that the stone was still present, had not moved, and there was no blockage- the stone is near the top of the kidney.  The PA I saw (my doctor was in surgery) gave me the same statements that my urologist has given in the past- that stones simply do not wiggle around like that, cause pain, and then go away... and that my pain must be from something else.  The CTs showed no lesions, bumps, lumps, clots, etc.  A cytology of the urine sample was also ordered since I did used to work for a chemical company (nothing was present at the last scoping when I had ESW to remove a stone) to rule out any tumors or bladder cancer.  In short, I'm going out of my mind here because I am feeling intimidated by the doctor repeatedly telling me that my random bouts of pain can not be related to the stones, even though it can start, stop, and present with needle like sensations in the tip of my penis.  I've run through the  standard pain meds trying to find one that works without impairing my work ability.  For a while the Oxy 5/325 when cut in half (permissible) worked fine- no more than a 5% tested slow down in reflexes (I have access to that sort of equipment at work) and suppressed the (apparent) stone pain so that I could function.   The bouts would be sporadic and last no more than 24 hours over several days, and up to two weeks for 3-6 hour stretches.  What am I doing wrong or not communicating- or, as I am starting to fear, am I simply hallucinating the pain (and now apparently blood) on an irregular basis?  The pain I describe is non-debilitating- I can function.  I have had stones with so much pain I have been in fetal position in the bath tub being blasted with a waterjet to try and numb the position while taking heavy doses of pain killers, for hours- that I call debilitating pain.  Yesterdays was strong enough to prevent me from being able to concentrate and function at my job, but not enough for me to present as an invalid at ER.  Help in any form of suggestion or conversation would be greatly appreciated- this is even more 'speaking' than I've been able to get with my doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Around the middle of May, which would be about two and a half months ago, I began having the typical symptoms of a UTI (painful urination, frequent urination, etc).  I went to my family doctor and the urinalysis confirmed that I indeed had a UTI.  I was given Cipro for five days.  The medicine helped a little bit, but I still noticed that I still had painful urination in the morning after the first voiding of the day, and then it would completely go away after a couple hours.  I had called the doctor back a total of four more times, each resulting in more medication which didn't completely relieve my morning burning sensation.  By the middle of June, my doctor decided to see me again for another urinalysis.  But this time, the urinalysis was free of any bacteria.  I have tried taking cranberry pills and a product called d-mannose to see if they would work, only to wake up with the same problem every morning.  My doctor recommended seeing my gynecologist, whom I wouldn't see for another two weeks.  During that time, however, I had gotten my period and noticed that I no longer had any burning sensation in the morning, or at all for that matter.  I thought that finally had stopped, and when I went in to see my gynecologist, she didn't seem to think anything of it.  Two days later, after my period ended, it came back again and has not gone completely away in the morning.  I have had another urinalysis done showing no bacteria and was put on Bactrim combined with a prescription strength urinary analgesic that somewhat subsided the pain, but did not completely go away.  I was wondering if anyone could help me figure out what could be wrong?  This has been going on for almost three months; the burning sensation I'm feeling ranges in severity and only bothers me a minute or two after I'm completely done voiding for the first time on any given day.  Please help me! ~Sincerely,  Chelsea\n\n",

Rest of my body hair ( including that on the scalp and facial hair) is okay.   I'm ninetenn and not under any prescribed medication.I don't do recreational drugs .I havn't gone for a full body checkup but as far as I can tell , I don't have any ailments-urological or therwise except for this hair loss.  A few things that may or may not be relevant :  I do weight training occasionally-no steroids.  I used to wear somewhat tight underwears-now I don't anymore since I hard it affects test production.  I'm quite large- not fat, more like beefy-athletic frame.  My penis is about average size.No difficulties with erection or libido.No pain or anything there.My balls are pretty big and hang well suspended in the scrotum-only when I get erect (or cold) they stick to my body.  hmm....I guess thats all I can think of now...This thing is scaring me a little.Could this be something serious ?

    "content": "Hello, I am an 18 year old male who is not circumcised or sexually active. I have recently noticed many light grey spots appear on the shaft of my penis. They seem to be a sort of discoloration. When erect or when I stretch the skin, the spots seem lighter. There also seems to be discoloration on the under part of the penis near the genitals; it is becoming whiter overall and more of those grey spots appear. They cause no pain or irritation whatsoever, but I was concered of what they may be. Should I be worried and what should I do next?  Thank you.   Sincerely,  confusedandconcered\n\n",

    "content": "I am 33. Have suspected prostatitis. Symptoms are groin pain, left testicle pain, pain when sitting, reduction of pain when up or performing an activity like Pilates. Occasional erection issues. No painful urination, or night urination, however I experience a strong immediate need to urinate when bladder is full, i.e. cannot hold for more than a few minutes. I am allergic to fluoroquinolones, I got an inflammation of my kidneys after the first day on Cipro. I did not have any fever or chills and was not found to have a bacterial infection, although only a urine test was performed. Epydidimitis, cancer and torsion was ruled out. This condition has been going for about a year and a half with degrees of pain intensity. Pain is about the same now for the past few weeks. Can't sit for longer than a few minutes, pain in groin, leg and testicle increases. Is prostatitis possible without dysuria? I drink about a gallon of water a day and keep relatively active. Depression has set in because of the pain. Someone suggested a possible pudendal, however wouldn't the pain be constant with pudendal? I have very minimal pain when in bed, sleeping. No pain when swimming or doing Pilates. How would a self performed gentle prostate massage affect the pain? Unable to fully function the past few months. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend is 54.  He recently had a surgery that required a catheder for urnination.  He had it in for about 2 days.  When they removed it there was sharp pain and blood.  It is now 10 weeks later.  When he ejaculates he has extreme pain in his lower abdomon, just above his genital area (more on his left).  He feels like he isn't getting \"it\" all out and more of the ejaculate comes out when he urinates later.  He does not have pain when he urinates.  He has also been complaining about feeling full/bloated.  I have had him increase his fiber to help clean him out a little.  (They might be completely unrelated, but I had to mention it - just in case.) He is in good health.  His surgery was for a growth on his thyroid.  He's had a good part of his thyroid removed.  However, his doctor does not feel that he needs to be on a daily thyroid medication, due to his current blood tests. He was not treated well by the doctors involved in the thyroid removal, so it is next to impossible to get him to go to a doctor.  If I can give him an idea of what it might be then he is more likely to go.  His erection is just a little smaller than what it was before surgery.  He is able to get hard and then have an orgasm. Could it be some sort of an infection from the catheder?  (Please forgive me for my spelling.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I found a small wart on mid-section of my penis.  It's definitely a wart as I had a few 6 yrs ago and recognize it.  I've looked online for treatments and found Tetrasil and Viranol as the most popular.  However, the online testimonials seem biased or contrived at best.  Have you experience with either of these?  Each has a money back guarantee, so the risk is minimal.  However, I'd like to double check with an expert.  What other OTC genital wart treatments do you recommend?  I'd like to nip this in the bud as it just surfaced a few weeks ago.  Let me know.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Frequent Urination and Excessive Fluid Consumption",
    "content": "OK, I really feel like one of those lame patients on House M.D. that has a problem with a really simplistic answer.  I keep having a frequent urge to urinate.  This includes getting up several times in the middle of the night to urinate.  The cause is excessive drinking of water, which I can't seem to stop doing.  For the last week or so I have been drinking at least 3-4 liters of water a day.  It seems that whenever I go to the bathroom I need to drink immediately after.  I had this happen about 2 years ago as well.  I went to the doctor because my grandfather developed diabetes (although at a late age) and I tested negative for diabetes and a UTI.  The one similarity between then and now is that I have started having sex again.  I started having sex with my now ex-girlfriend two years ago and it was around then that I had these symptoms.  We have since broken up.  I dated a Catholic for 16 months (no sex there).  After we broke up, I started dating someone new.  Now that we are having sex, the symptoms seems to be returning.  At first I thought that this might be a UTI that is causing frequent urination.  But given the fact that I have no other symptoms (pain, fever, etc), I'm not sure that a UTI is the answer.  If I throw out the urination symptom of excessive fluid consumption, then I need to know what could be causing me to crave water continuously.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 36y/o male & at this age, am happy that I still regularly wake up with \"wood\". About 2 weeks ago I've been waking up with a hard-on every day, which I take care of with not problems. Not only would I be hard in the mornnings but I found that my dick would get hard durring the day with no help from me or other. I know it's not from lack of sexual activity or ejaculations...I always jerk at night before bed & in the morns, so that's at least 2x a day but I usually blow a load more than twice, solo or with a partner. So this is why I am a bit concerned with what I'm going thru today. I woke up hard again but this time my penis was ragging rock hard & the erections was a bit painful. I thought I'd go soft by jerking it & cum but I couldn't jerk because it hurt my penis more. I laid in bed for a while waiting for it to go soft but nothing. I didn't go to work because I had to stay home with an erection from hell that lasted almost 4hrs. When it finaly went soft it seemed like it was semi but wasn't (I know what my semi dick looks like). It just seemed like it was hanging longer, and up til now my dick has been hanging naturaly soft. Although I'm glad it's no longer rock hard, I'm concerned... I am dripping pre-cum more than usual, I do pre a lot but usualy only when I'm horny or hard, this is not the case today & it's almost constant leaking. Now what really has me weireded-out is the spontaneous ejaculations (I've blown 5 loads today) while hanging soft & without any stimulation at all. I'm at home in boxer briefs, relaxing, watching TV, doing chores, eatting or what have you and all of a sudden I cum. The sperm amount & intensity of the blow isn't as big as usual but still enjoyable; yet I can't help but to be concerned. I have no other issues with my penis, only aching balls that have been hanging low most of the day but at times they go tight & up to my body, this is only for a few mins thou, then they drop. Could this be excess my body needs to release on it's own... I do that everyday myself ????\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, age 24 good shape.  Problem with my penis started 3 months ago after a couple hours of masterbation... A few days later I noticed a bit of discomfort on my penis glans or the \"Head\" of my penis. The pain happens around the ridges of my glans, where the foreskin meets the glans, but it's the glans themselves that are inflamed. A little blue, sometimes red... I noticed they've changed shape a little, the ridges don't seem as prominent on the back. The color looks like it seems to get better for a bit than just comes back after sex and or masterbation. I've let it rest for a week, but the problem just comes back. I have a high sex drive, so it's hard not to refrain from sex or masterbation for more than about 5-6 days.  I've been to 2 doctors, the first said it's not a big deal and it won't be like that forever. He said not having sex 2 times a day will make it heal faster but it should get better anyway. The second one looked at it and prescribed Viaderm KC Cream \"Triamc acet/neomy/grami+\" for 10-14 days... Didn't do anything, since I doubt it was an infection. The cream Kinda made it more red.   So, here I am again, going back to the doc's tomorrow to get an appt with a urologist or maybe he'll give me a cream for some quicker healing.   What are your thoughts, please help. It hurts! ty\n\n",

    "content": "In 2004 I got a yeast infection which I didn't see the doctor for a couple months for. It was itching like crazy and extremely sensitive during sexual activity, and would get dry easily. The doctor gave me an antibiotic for the yeast infection and hydrocortizone cream to treat the area on the base of my penis.  The itching and soreness during sexual activity continued. I saw a couple urologists and dermotologists for this, a couple of them gave me a higher dosage of hydrocortizone cream to apply on the area. Finally, one dermotologist determined that the redness and soreness were actually caused by overuse or burning from the hydrocortisone cream.  I discontinued the use of the hydrocortisone cream in 2005. The redness is still in areas where I had applied the cream; on the base of my penis and on the scrotum where it meets the base. The skin still gets really sore and dry during sexual activity.  How can this red and sore skin be treated so I can go back to having a regular sex life after 5 years?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy 20 year old male that is a smoker.  I do not have a medical history with any problems.  I have had these yellow bumps that appeared sometime ago.  They cause me no pain, or itching whatsoever.  I have no idea of what it is exactly.  At first I thought they could be pimples because I shave completey down there.  I squeezed them and most of them didn't pop.  However, there were a few of them that when I continuesly squeezed them they popped.  It wasn't like a pimple in the way that when a pimple pops it is quick and after all of the puss comes out then blood will come out.  The yellow stuff that came out of them came out like a string of yellow stuff.  It wasn't wet, slimy, gooey, or any of that.  On some of them if I scratched them with my finger nail it will just bleed with no puss at all.  I am not sure what it is exactly and I just want it off of me.  I read some of the other forum pages and wasn't able to get a clear answer of exactly what it could be.  I have one bump on the underside of the shaft of my penis and the rest are on the sides of my scrotum where they constantly are touching my thighs.  I take a bath once or twice daily and keep clean.  I pay special attention to my genital region and scrub vigourously.  I need some help and multiple opions of the finest doctors in the medical field.  Thanks again for your time, USArmyMP8807\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. I am a 21 year old female and for the past year now, I have been having problems with urinary frequency. I feel like I have to pee all the time, like I have a constant pressure on my bladder, and I go to the bathroom about once an hour (or more). At night I wake up an average of 2 times to go use the bathroom.  First I thought it was a urinary tract infection. My doctor put me on antibiotics and nothing happened. I had my urine tested--nothing wrong. I had a bladder and kidney ultrasound--nothing wrong. I had a cystocopy and bladder scope--nothing wrong. I had my blood tested for diabetes and such, but my blood work came back normal.  I saw a gynecologist who gave me a pap/pelvic exam in case it was related to that but guess what? They didn't find anything wrong.  I have seen two seperate urologists over course of the past year, and I've taken numerous medications for overactive bladder which haven't helped at all (i.e. Sanctura, Enablex, Detrol LA, Toviaz, Urispaz... and probably more that I'm forgetting).  If anything some of these medicines have just made it more difficult to urinate, so that I feel the need to urinate even more frequently! My symptoms aren't completely in line with overactive bladder anyway. I don't have incontinence and a scan of my bladder showed that I am emptying my bladder fully.  Also, I'm not urinating larger (or smaller) amounts, just more frequently because of the pressure.  My diet hasn't changed or anything like that.    I'm a pretty healthy person in other respects, but I am starting to fear that this problem is never going to go away. I am desperate for any suggestions anyone might have or if anyone has any idea what my problem could be. Thanks!\n\n",

It's generally recommended not to use this along with other drugs for the same purpose, and it can interact with a number of medications, so I would strongly suggest discussing this with your doctor before using it at all. You seem to be doing fairly well with the \"real\" medication you're on right now, but your physician, who knows your personal history best, would be the one to discuss this  with.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,    I have had a kidney stone for about a week and a half now. It has moved from my kidney, but has not reached my bladder. I taking painkillers and anti-nausea medication. However, I was recently given Uroxatral to help the stone to pass. This medication makes me feel extremely weak, and gives me headaches. Also, when I read the label it said it should not be prescribed to women, or anyone with kidney problems. All of my internet searches have told me the same thing--and that this medicine is for an enlarged prostate. Why would my doctor prescribe this medication for me? I am obviously female, and my kidney is definately damaged.  Before my kidney stone, I had a urinary tract infection. I have been experiencing blood in my urine for close to 3 weeks now. I have had 1 trip to the ER (hydracodone, promethazyne, ibuprofen) and 1 trip to the urologist (uroxatral). I have one, relatively large stone that was in the right kidney.  Is it safe for me to take the uroxatral, and, if not--Is there a better alternative for me? At this point I'm not sure which is worse--the pain from the stone, or all of the side effects from the medication!\n\n",

    "content": "I would imagine the reason your doctor prescribed this drug is that while it is rarely prescribed for women, it not only relaxes the prostate in men, but the bladder neck in men and women both,  which may (hopefully) help the stone to pass more easily. It is something of a stretch, but barring some noxious side effects it should do no harm. The side-effects you're having are typical for this drug. The blood in your urine is no doubt due to the size of the stone as it moves toward the bladder.   This strikes me as a rather primitive way to handle a large stone, and leaves you to be subjected to some rather severe pain and other side effects and potential risks and, in the distant past, might have been the best and only way to get the stone out. However, shock wave lithotripsy is now in common use and can resolve most such problems within a few minutes. I'd certainly ask if this is an option for you, and if not, why not.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: test to determine reflux nephropathy",
    "content": "Hello --  Both tests you've had done carry a high degree of confidence in the result and both can produce false negatives and positives,mostly with regard to scarring, which doesn't help resolve your dilemma. Since your doctor performed the nuclear scan,he is obviously more confident in his finding, but the other two tests are equally reliable, so what you have is essentially a best two out of three result, but the findings are totally oppositional to one another. Your doctor, therefore, is being conservative and this is understandable, but considerable doubt remains as to whether you actually have RN or not. For this reason I would suggest a second opinion from a different urologist, perhaps without any further tests, but simply to have him study all three reports and try to find a cause for the disparity. I  suspect the nuclear scan has produced a false positive result, but of course cannot know that. We want the best outcome for you, so I strongly suggest the second opinion if this is possible. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Catheter use effect on PSA reading",
    "content": "Hello --  While the reading is just borderline, and while there are certainly mitigating circumstances (the DRA, the \"sounding\"), statistically it is impossible to ignore the possibility of cancer, since 25-30% of men with levels between 4-10 tend to have it, is it feasible to have the test repeated with no DRA and with you having abstained for maybe a week from sounding? This should give a more accurate result and, if it is normal then, and especially if it is significantly lower, that should clear this up once and for all. On the other hand, if it is positive again, you can then reasonably plan for a biopsy.   Seems fairly simple, but I realize there are often some extenuating issues. It might be wise to have it done by another doctor -- or perhaps just clarify all this with the original doctor before repeating the test. At any rate, that would be the simplest way to avoid a potentially serious problem.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "hi! i am new to this forum and very much glad that i discovered this kind of community, hope someone could help me.  i am 23 years old asian male, 5'10 and weighs 230lbs...i just recently had a urinalysis because i was having fever like symptoms and has a history of urolithiasis. My result concluded that i have some pus and some traces of blood on my urine thus having UTI, i am on Ofloxacin 400mg for 3 days because of this. My questions are:  1. Since this happend, i am feeling a weird numbness, dull pain in my left thigh radiating on my left leg? is there any connection to the uti i have now? or something else?  2. Also, i am experiencing a weird sensation on my left testicle. It feels like a dull pain that i cant seem to pinpoint perfectly but i know that it is in the area on my left testicle, its as if it feels like dull and heavy yet pulling inward? kinda wierd actaully.   3. Lastly, i havent had any appointments on any urologist or medical practioner with regards to this in my life time except for for the 4 consecutive years on medical examinations done compulsary in school that didnt say anything life threatening or resulting to abnormalities...I just want to ask if my genital organs are normal? for a 23 year old that is...well...It seems that i have small sexual organs...my penis is like about 4 1/2 inches long only and that is erected already!, my testicles is not that big and often seen pulled or closer to my body (the left testicle is more closer to the body than the right one). Am i normal..i am a very shy boy eversince that is why i havent had the courge to go to the doctor and mainly because i don't want my parents to spend money for my sickness, if i am sick that is (we are not that economically convinient also thats why). I sometimes think of the fact that i am only like this because i weight too much or i am a late bloomer but ofcourse u cant blame me for worrying knowing that i am 23 already...because of this also, my self esteem is fully affected and still is a virgin. I am so scared of having testicular cancer...:'(  kindly enlighten me anyone...i am beginning to feel depressed about these things\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  First, in general I'd say your genitals are normal, at least externally. The 4-1/2 inch penis is the low end of normal for an adult male, and as far as sexual performance is concerned, diameter is far more important than length anyway. That size is really not unusual.   Now then, as for the UTI and the sensations in your leg. While it may be unrelated to the UTI, it sounds as though you may have either an inflammation of the left  epididymis, a torsion of the left testicle, or even a lower back problem that's radiating to the groin, testicle and ultimately your leg. There is a nerve pathway that connects these areas, so it could be either orthopedic, gonadal or just due to the influence of the UTI. Hopefully by now it's resolved, but if not, please follow up with us here. If it's still going on you'll probably need a consult with a urologist to figure out whether this is related to a UTI, an inflammation of the connections to the left testicle, or simply a low-back problem radiating down into there.  I hope this is helfpful Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Tear of the frenulum during intercourse is not terribly unusual, so however the original tear was caused, it's unsurprising that intercourse (or masturbation) could cause a re-tear. The best treatment, in most non-traumatic cases, is direct pressure followed by application of a lightweight pad and gentle handling/treatment of the member until it is fully healed again. If the frenular artery is torn it can cause fairly significant (though not dangerous) bleeding, and might require direct medical attention to get it controlled so that it can heal.   I hope this is  helpful to you. Please follow up here as necessary. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding frenular tears and bleeding. Yes this is common and is due to the high insertion of the fernular tissue on the glans penis. It is a physics issue really. As the uncircumcised (preputial) skin rolls back and forth during intercourse, there is stress on the frenular tissue and it can tear. Tearing causes bleeding. Once the area heals, the tear usually heals and the frenular insertion is lower on the penis and more stable. It may bleed again if it tears again. Eventually the insertion area is more stable because it is lower and there is scar tissue to support it and bleeding eventually stops. However, if it does not, you can also have a frenuloplasty under local anesthesia that takes the frenulum down to a stable location and prevents further tearing and bleeding. This takes about 20 minutes in the office. A circumcision is not required to treat this.\n\n",

In between a few weight sets last tuesday I was doing jumping jacks and on one particular motion (when you bring your legs together) it felt like My testicles didn't shift around right and they stayed side by side and so they got pinned in between my legs. I assumed the minor pain I felt was normal and stopped working out and went home. The next day my testicle was a bit swollen and painful (I assumed that would be normal, like a bruise.) and I continued on with my day. It's been three days now and I feel a lot of discomfort, but this morning I woke up and the swelling had gone down. I started to check everything out to see if I was bruised or anything and I noticed an odd lump just behind and underneath my left testicle. Now I have no kind of insurance and I'm a single parent, living from paycheck to paycheck, I can't afford the surgery for a hernia, and I haven't gotten to the doctor yet to see If I have it because money is very very tight right now. I'm crossing my fingers hoping this isn't a hernia, because being out of work for recovery just absolutely is not an option. I'm hoping someone can tell me that all of this is normal and it will go away, but I don't want to wait if it's something that can progress, get worse and do permenant damage.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Early diagnosis and proper management of any scrotal mass or swelling is very important to avoid permanent damage. Thus, direct clinical examination is essential.   Minor blunt trauma to the scrotum can cause pain and its swelling.  Mild self limiting inflammation in the scrotal wall usually needs decreased scrotal mobility. This can be achieved by scrotal support, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications and rest for one or 2 days.  Some doctors recommend ice packs application in the early hours.  If these conservative measures fail in two days, your doctor would recommend ultrasound and Doppler studies to exclude testicular damage and vascular problems.  Other causes of scrotal swelling like hydrocele, hernia, and spermatocele should be excluded by clinical examination and radiologic evaluation.  - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle. It may be the result of a direct injury or occur spontaneously in the remnants of an embryonic sac that remains formed around the testicle from birth. Small hydroceles may hardly be noticed and often resolve without treatment.   - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin.    So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  i am a medical student. I am afraid that the swelling will be prmenant. Minor injury easily causes damage to the epididymus, which after that forms either of the following; -a spermatocole, a sac full of sperm cells. -an epididymal cyst, that contain thin fluid.  They do not cause any problems generally. Though they might influence your sperm cells passage, depending on their location, especially if there is constant increasing ache on that side due to blockage and build up of sperm cells.  You need a semen analysis and ultrasound to be done to rule out other illnesses and to confirm the diagnosis.  If they cause you sub-fertility you might need surgery, however i do not advice to carry any further surgery as this can risk exposing you body defence system to your sperm cells, which is more dangerous than the initial problem and will result in fertility.  If the semen analysis is ok and the ache subsides then you do not need to do anything about it, as removing it is contra-indicated.  All the best my friend.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree with most things said on this post regarding testis pain and a \"lump\" after working out. If the pain continues more than 1-2 weeks I would seek medical care. The lump could reflect your discovery of normal anatomy or something abnormal. Most commonly, when men start to examine themselves, they find the comma shaped and doughy feeling epididymis behind the testis. Either that or the vas deferens or a clinical varicocele. These are normal.   Given your financial situation, I would perform weekly testis self examination. If the \"lump\" is tender or increases in size, you should seek medical attention. Most anatomical issues in the scrotum can be detected on physical examination and a scrotal ultasound is not needed.  Having said this, in men ages 17-35, testis cancer is very common. It almost always presents as a firmness or lump WITHIN the testis or enlargement of the testis but not as a mass or lump around the testis. It is also unusual for testis cancer to present with pain. If this is not quite clear to you, then you should also seek medical attention.\n\n",

I went to my doctor last week with what i thought was a kidney infection (i have had them before) - symptoms were; blood in urine, the feeling that i need to urinate all the time, soreness in my back - the doctor perscribed Cefalexin (unsure of the spelling there - sorry) this did not cure the problem so i returned to the doctor this week.  He prescribed Nitrofurantion and got urine an blood tests done.  The urine had blood in it but no infection.  The bloods were normal except the 'full blood count' - he said that needed to be done again but without using the cuff and on 'flowing blood' (they had difficulty getting blood from me!)  He said that he wanted to double check the blood result which would also cause blood in the urine.  I still feel the need to urinate all the time. He has refered me for a scan at the hospital.  I asked him what he was checking for and he said i would need medical knowledge to understand it (note to the medical profession - that is really annoying!)  Can you please tell me what he may be looking for that would cause blood in the urine and would give an 'abnormal' fbc result?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First, duly noted: a comment such as the patient would  need \"medical knowlege\" to understand a diagnosis or suspected condition is beyond annoying. It is avoiding the issue. How can one treat a patient and not take the time to explain what is going on? \"Medical knowlege\" can  be translated, it simply requires a few extra moments and some imagination. Enough said.   Now then: what your doctor was looking for was probably (based on the deliberately obfuscated explanation) any one of a number of possible disorders which could include various inflammatory conditions of random parts of the urinary system, or  a bleeding tendency, and there are too many of either to go into here, at least without enough of a clue as to which ones he thinks might be the culprit. There are various types of anemias, clotting disorders, etc., all of which would require  a consult with a hematologist anyway, and I'm quite sure a specialist would be able to figure out how to explain to you what he  thought might be going on.   Hopefully the scan has cleared up the issue. With more information I'd be happy to discuss specifics. Please follow up with us as needed, and update us also. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 43 y/o white male. I have had, up until recently, a \"normal\" appearing semen. Meaning whitish and with consistent texture. However for the past 18 months or so my semen has become yellowish with a presence of gelatinous clumps. Most forums I've read have said that this was normal provided that there wasn't an underlying STD etc. About the time this issue started I had mild presence of blood and some burning while urinating. I went to a urologist who diagnosed me with mild urethritis and put me on antibiotics. This was after flow tests and std tests were done and all appeared normal (all excluded). I had no discharge but only mild burning while urinating and pinkish (occasionally) semen. Shortly after, the change in my semen occured. I am not sure if the two are tied but I would like to find out if there could be other underlying issues that might promote such a change. In addition I suspect that my urethritis may have become chronic because there seems to be an on/off recurrence of the burning sensation while urinating. I am planning to re visit my urologist but wanted to get an independent opinion. Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This really sounds like possible prostatitis, which will produce symptoms of urethritis along with changes in semen color and consistency and sometimes straining to urinate. It can be chronic (as can urethritis),  and sometimes requires repeat courses of rotating antibiotics to resolve. This is well worth a followup exam, as it can become awfully uncomfortable and eventually may lead to a febrile illness which can make you feel terrible.   There are other possible problems involving the prostate which can also cause this sort of symptomology, but inflammation is most likely.   I hope this is helpful to you.

    "title": "Re: Effects of alcohol after a bilateral reflux surgery",
    "content": "Hello --  I think the key here is a) the amount of drinking you do and b) understanding the fact that you have less kidney capacity than others and that alcohol can, in excess, damage normal kidneys (and the liver), so you have to exercise some care and restraint in drinking, which is probably all to the good anyway, since alcohol is not necessary to life, but at least one functioning kidney is necessary to life.   That being said, drinking in moderation or lightly should not have an untoward effect on your better functioning kidney, although it could well damage,over time, the one rated at 25%. Since between them you have the equivalent of one fully functional kidney, you don't want to damage etiher one, and you really must avoid liver damage via excessive drinking as well.  For one with diminished kidney function drinking can cause loss of electrolyted (potassium, magnesium, etc.) in the urine, which has consequences of its own. So  my advice would be to learn to keep your drinking to a minimum, realize it's not the  determining factor in your enjoyment of  life, and be careful to keep a close rein on your intake of alcohol. It's as simple as that. While your buddies may be drinking heavily (never a great idea anyway), you'll have to be the sensible one in order to insure you have sufficient kidney function to live out a normal, healthy life. This does not mean giving up alcohol altogether, but it does mean learning moderation early in life when many young people are throwing caution to the wind,  often with unfortunate results later in life. You don't have to be like them.  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  I think you probably have more than one thing going on at the  same time,  which happens  a lot and really confuses the picture sometimes. Your doctor is probably correct that endometriosis isn't causing the overactive bladder, and interstitial cystitis probably should be ruled out (or in). Since the two conditions are happening in related areas and at the same time, this would necessarily be pretty confusing, but overactive bladder or interstitial cystitis doesn't cause red blood cells to show up in the urine, and kidney disorders rarely cause overactive bladder symptoms. Endometriosis could definitely account for the RBCs in the urine, however, so both problems must be looked at separately. Hopefully this will be sorted out sooner than later. There are therapies for both if this is the case (which it almost certainly must be), but they are different.   Hope this is helpful.

I'm more concerned about the volume of water you're taking in, as it is a remarkable amount, about 50 per cent more than what's considered \"desirable\" and a good deal more (naturally) than average. Just make  certain you note any unsual symptoms, especially neurological ones, since this amount of water intake can, in some people, cause slight swelling of the brain. Otherwise, everything seems perfectly normal.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain and \"leaking\" semen after masturbating",
    "content": "After masturbating, my penis continues to \"leak\" small amounts of semen, sometimes even for a few hours after I've ejaculated. I usually use toilet paper to cover my urethra during this time, so that the semen doesn't get on my underwear. Also, for a while after masturbating, usually a few hours, I feel some kind of dull pain in my genital area, especially when my penis is erect. It is hard to tell exactly where in that area the pain is coming from, and it sometimes hurts enough to distract me from whatever I'm doing at the time. I'm not completely sure, but it's possible that the pain is more noticeable when I haven't had a particularly good orgasm, so it may be blue balls or something, but I'm not sure. Finally, after cleaning up and washing my hands with water and soap, my hands are somewhat sticky all over, even if I get very little semen on them. They usually become less sticky if I dry them off with a serviette or paper towel, but if I dry them with a regular towel, small hairs and the like become attached to them.  Are these things normal, or should I be concerned? Also, is there a better way to make sure that my semen doesn't get on my underpants, or a better way to wash my hands after masturbating and cleaning up?\n\n",

That's a little odd, and may be related to the type of soap you're using. Everything else, however, is pretty normal, from the leakage to the vague aching (both related to incomplete or unsatisfactory orgasm, not unlike \"blue balls\", same principle but less intense).

We're just not in a postion, here, to give permission to change the dose of a prescription drug for an individual, even though it might be perfectly fine in theory.   Do that, ask your doctor, make that phone call, and I'm sure you'll get the OK. It's certainly within the usual dosing range and given the other things you're taking, it would probably be just what you need to get the desired result.

    "content": "Hello --  What you describe sounds like frequency-urgency syndrome, which in childhood is pretty normal, and otherwise often occurs in women, but with a great deal of pelvic pain and discomfort. When it occurs in adult men it is even more of a challenge to the doctor than the other two subsets, and these are difficult to begin with. The only thing I can suggest to you is to arrange a consult with a urologist, who may be able to give you something to manage the symptoms while looking for an underlying cause. The problem tends to resolve spontaneously (in men and children, not in women) but can recur and can be extremely disruptive of normal activities. There's usually no serious underlying cause if any cause can be found. \"Overactive bladder\" is a newer term to describe this condition,  and there is medication which can sometimes help with or resolve the problem.   Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While this is not normal, it is not surprising either. The urethra contains a great number of rather fragile capilaries and it is easy to break one or more with even a swab. Usually the bleeding will stop on its own, but to be safe, don't do any heavy lifting or other straining, and if the bleeding intensifies before you can be seen during regular hours then by all means go to an acute care facility of ER. If it remains as is, just use something absorbent and wait. Along with whatever was causing the original distress, the subsequent DIY swab undoubtedly is what's caused the bleeding. Again, it should resolve spontaneously, and if it doesn't, but especially if it gets worse, have it seen by a professional before the appointment date.  Good luck to you with this. Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "title": "Akward Testicular Movement with Hydrocele",
    "content": "For as long as I can remember I've had a hydrocele in the right side of my scrotum appearing to be somewhat attached to my testicle.  It, oddly enough, gives my testicle an appearance that somewhat resembles a peanut.  I'm stretching the memory here, but I think it was diagnosed during a physical around the time of my 7-9th grade year in school.  I'm 21 now.  I've never noticed it growing larger, although it may have grown in proportion to my normal body growth (I've grown quite a bit since then, up to 6'4).  In the description here, I don't mean to sound vile, but it's really one of the only ways that I've notice the symptoms, but, what is happening is as follows:  When I use the restroom to go #2, I notice that once I'm seated and get my penis situated so I don't urinate all over the place, my left testicle \"hangs\" in what seems to be a normal position.  My right testicle however \"creeps\" up and sits next to my penis, I guess you could say.  I can't say that I'm really sure how long it's been doing that, I just haven't paid enough attention or never really noticed it.  Well today, something different happend that worried me a bit.  I was with my girlfriend partaking in some sexual activities, and she was attempting to ejaculate me with her hand.  Well to make a long story short, I looked down and noticed that while my left testicle was there, my right was magically gone.  It looked like half of my scrotum was empty.  Well it freaked me out, so I sat up.  Fluently with my motion of sitting up, the testicle moved back into place.  I didn't experience any pain.  Since I've had the hydrocele diagnosis when I was younger, I've been very active, played three varisty sports in high school, always running or doing something active whether it was baseball, basketball, football, volleyball, golf, etc.  I have never had any kind of problem with the testicle at all.  My first question, I suppose, is if the hydrocele could influence the testicle in moving upwards \"into my body\" or whatever the term may be?  As far as the testicle disappearing, that has never happened as far as I'm aware.  I have noticed the akward feeling before during sex, so it may have happened.  The only time I get this \"testicle pulling into my body\" sensation is when I am either sitting on the toilet and it raises next to my penis, or when I'm laying down with an erection during some sort of sexual activity.  I have noticed that my scrotum often feels like it is \"tight\" and close to my body.  A bit more often than it used to be.  Not much more often, but a bit more.  I'd really appreciate any insight as to what's going on, and if it's harmful to my health.  I'd also like to know if it's progressive.  By this I mean, if it's happened once, is it fair to expect the frequency of this occurence to increase?  One of my main concerns is that I'm planning on becoming a USMC officer once I get my degree, and as I was looking at the medical part of the application the other day one of the mentioned things was \"have you ever had an ascending or undescended testicle\" and now I'm worried that this will somehow disqualify me for service.  PLEASE HELP!!!  -HopefulMarine\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  What you describe is not all that unusual but certainly does warrant clinical attention. Usually when there is a \"hiding\" testicle, even part time, it is because a hernia has been present for some time, and is related to the origin of the hydrocele. This in itself isn't necessarily a problem, but it can become one, as the testicle can wind up in a torsion situation or otherwise become strangulated by its tendency to be pulled up into its infantile location.   Generally this is corrected by very minor surgery. If it is corrected prior to graduation you can answer with a qualified \"yes\" regarding the undescended testicle and not have to worry about it. Having worked in MilMed I feel safe in saying this should not be a problem if it is addressed now.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Many doctors do believe that cranberry tablet supplements are helpful in prevention of UTI's.  Please ask your doctor before taking any supplements however.  Cranberry helps prevent and helps treat UTI's because it creates a more acidic environment in the urinary tract thus leaving bacteria with a much less thriving environment.    Also increasing your water intake is always a good idea if you do not drink enough water on a regular basis.  Of course cranberry juice is a good choice.  However, what I have found is that most cranberry drinks on the market really have little actual cranberry juice.  It is usually called a \"cranberry cocktail\" which is a mixture of many other ingredients and a very small concentration of cranberry.  Also consider any bath products you use if you like to take baths rather than showers.  Some of the products for baths may increase irritation in the urethra for some people who are sensitive.    Wearing cotton underwear would be a suggestion also that may help if you do not do so already.  Materials such as nylon are not as breathable as cotton.  Please explore with your physician why you are so susceptible to UTI's.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "So, I was not so smart and had unprotected sex with a new partner.  Afterwards, she informed me she has herpes but \"its in remission\".  Within 1-2 days, I started having a pain/discomfort in my urethra (about 1 inch or so up) after urination, and also thick green discharge.  The discomfort almost felt like there was a foreign body in there, because when my urethra closed after urination, it felt like it was closing on something.  I went to an STD clinic, and they did a urine test and a swab, and started me on doxycycline.  They also told me that I was likely dehydrated.  Within a couple days, my symptoms cleared up, but due to side effects and negative urine test results they took me off the doxy.  About 3-4 days after stopping the meds, the discharge has returned.  So far the discomfort hasn't.  I haven't gotten any results for the swab, but I'll be calling on Monday.  The girl claims she went in and got tested \"for everything\" and only has a yeast infection (other than the herpes).  In my area, STD clinics will only treat guys for STDs, and refer them out for anything else...and I really can't afford to go to another doctor unless absolutely necessary as I have no insurance.  I'd really appreciate some input.  P.s.  I've been having no trouble urinating, no change in frequency of urination, and no pain with ejaculation. THanks\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds more like gonorrhea or some other type of STD rather than herpes.  I suspect that the clinic suspects something other than herpes also because an antibiotic such as Doxycycline would not be used for a viral illness.  (herpes is a virus, not a bacteria).  The green discharge is typical with gonorrhea.    It sounds as if the sex partner was not very honest with you.  I wonder if she told you about the herpes before or after the sex encounter?  It is possible she has herpes in addition to some other STD.    Let this be a lesson learned.  Also, beware that \"protected\" sex is not 100% protected.  And also herpes can be transmitted even if the partner is not in a flare or the lesions are absent.  It may be less likely transmitted, but not impossible. But, if it is gonorrhea it is curable.  Just make sure and take what they give you as prescribed.   It may be something else, I don't know.  Just saying what it sounds like.  Because this girl was not honest with you, please be tested for HIV also.  Just in case.  We also know that HIV is not always visible and people often look healthy before they get ill with it.  So you can never tell for sure without testing.  Best wishes, Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Lesson definitely learned!!  She didn't mention herpes until afterwards, which is why I kinda freaked out about that because I always hear you can still get it between outbreaks.  Needless to say, I will be watching for any signs of herpes, and I will be more careful in the future.  I am furious with her over this, and if I test positive she's going to have some explaining to do since she's the only possible source.  I clarified with the clinic, and although they told me they were running both chlamydia and gonorrhea, they only ran chalmydia because it was negative.  They did also tell me they tested my urine for bacteria and it was negative...so I'm assuming that rules out a UTI.  They are trying to tell me the State Lab where I live won't test for gonorrhea unless chlamydia is positive.  However, a friend used to work for a place that did testing thru the state lab for gonorrhea or both regardless of results of chlamydia all the time (unfortunately they were booked up so I had to go elsewhere).  Even though she says she was tested for everything, I'm pretty sure she was either lying or they didn't run gonorrhea.  I will be going in for a gonorrhea test as soon as I can get in elsewhere(it's actually what I've suspected all along based on the discharge), and I'm DEFINITELY getting an HIV at the same time and in 6 months.    Thanks so much for your input, I'm glad to hear from someone medical that my suspicions are likely correct....when they told me everything was negative, I really started to worry about what else it could be.  At this point, I'm hoping it is gonorrhea because at least then it will be treatable and over with.  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Life long Phimosis/Circumcision aftermath",
    "content": "So I went to see my urologist today as it's now 10 months since the circumcision and I still cannot masturbate or have sex because touching the head of the penis remains unpleasurable. My urologist insists that everything is fine and did not really supply any cause or answer or how long it will take to heal/fix. I asked if this was normal and he proceeded to ask me if I can pee and get erections and since I can he concluded that everything is fine. He seemed much more concerned with ushering me out of his office (I think he overbooks so is constantly in a rush).  So anyway, I'm planning on seeing my GP and hopefully getting another referral to a different urologist. I'm just wondering if there's anything you guys might be able to diagnose or take a guess at what the problem is and maybe comment on if it's ever going to be resolved...  The symptoms are pretty straightforward, sometimes when I pee I'll get a slight burning sensation, the head is unpleasurable to touch and the tip/hole seems a bit discoloured/darker.  Thanks for any help or advice..\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding increased penile head sensitivity after circumcision, I always tell my adult circumcised men that penile sensation is very high as the now newly exposed glans penis will rub on everything and that they should expect this feeling (sometimes pleasurable, sometimes not) for 1-2 years. Your penis needs to get used to rubbing against things all the time now, unlike what it has experienced in the past. You can consider rubbing topical anesthetic creams (EMLA) on the sensitive areas for 5-15 min and washing off if there is a particular kind of activity or time of day that it bothers you the most. This will temporarily numb it. Should improve as nervous system adjusts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I started getting UTIs when I was 6 years old, and didnt have another until I hit puberty and from then on I've had about 6 a year give or take a few. It's terrible. I've done everything recommended, I pound water all day and try to drink alot of cranberry juice. I limit caffiene and alcohol, I wear cotton underwear, I shower sometimes twice a day and then once I have sex I'm back in agony. I've even gotten up in the middle of intercourse to go to the bathroom, as one doctor suggested, and I still got a UTI. The thing is, they progress into kidney infections within a couple of hours, which is terrifying because I'm not always close to an emergency room when they strike and I mean, kidneys are kind of important ya know?? I read somewhere that doctors are developing a low dose antibiotic that people can take daily, or even OTC, I was wondering if anyone else has a similar experience or if they've been on some kind of daily treatment?   It's just that statistically,the more UTIs you get, the more you're going to have, so I'm basically screwed. I don't know what's wrong with me, and it's definitely affecting my life where I have to leave work to get to the doctor immediately, or basically not have sex at all, or have a guy jump through hoops before we do anything because I'm so terrified. Someone help please!\n\n",

    "content": "UTIs are rather frequent with you, and I'm sorry to hear that's happening to you.  I'm presuming you have had your urine cultured at the doctor's office when you see the doctor for your UTI.  The results of the culture will identify the what is likely bacteria that is causing your UTI, and assure you are prescribed the right antibiotic.  Sometimes, there can be physiological abnormalities that can cause frequent UTIs, such as something called VUR.  Your OB/GYN doctor would be able to discuss this with you.  Yet from what you wrote, it sounds like you may have instead what is called cystitis, which means the inside of your bladder is inflammed or swollen.  Frequent UTis, as well as with other symptoms, indicate cystitis.  You will want to see a urologist to examine you for this, as the treatment for cystitis is different from just taking antibiotics, as you have with your UTis.    You don't ever want to have a UTI and not treat it, or have it get worse.  It could lead to a larger issue with being infected at other locations aside from your urinary tract.  Hope you get better,  Dan\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I just found out recently that the woman I am seeing has HPV. She knows this because when she went to see her gynecologist they did a pap smear and found abnormal cells, which they believe to be a precursor to cervical cancer. I am not sure if they did HPV test but she informed that she has HPV and she is scheduled to get the cancer cells removed in about a month.  Since, I am pretty sure she has given me this virus since we had only been together sexually a couple of months and I would assume that is not enough time to cause cell changes. The question is, now that I have this virus do I need to be alarmed because of the strain of HPV that she has that I might need to see my doctor and ask about the possibility of cancer or some other complication? I know after doing some reading there is no testing for a man and for those that get HPV that most of those infected can fight off the virus after a year or so, I am just concerned to know if this means I am now likely to spread a strain to other women that might cause cancer. Thank you for taking the time to read and give advice.\n\n",

    "content": "I think it's a good idea for you to get tested, just because you should anyway, but also because you know that your partner has something. You may have even been the one to give it to her without even knowing you had it.  The thing with HPV is that it's so common and there are so many different strains that a huge number of people have a certain form of it or another. Alot of times it doesn't show symptoms. and for most men it can range from a skin irritation to full blown warts (Google images, but make sure you're not eating dinner while browsing).  It poses more of a danger to women because the cells can mutate inside the body and lead to cervical cancers. Several of my friends have contracted the virus and 2 girls I know had cancerous cells. They were lucky to catch them early, as is your girlfriend. If you're concerned about spreading the disease to others, wear a condom until you know for sure if you have it or not. It can be spread from skin to skin contact, so even if you're wearing a condom, there is always a risk. It's best to up front with someone you're sleeping with before anything happens (you would want them to tell you the same, right?) especially where HPV would drastically affect her life if it were to develop cancerous cells. I would encourage any new partners (and daughters, nieces, cousins etc) to get the HPV vaccine.   Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Problem Maintaining Erection",
    "content": "I have been dating a girl for about 5 months now.  Before we started dating I had sex on only four different occasions.  The 2-3 times we had sex everything would be fine until I put on a condom after which I would lose my erection.  I researched and found out that it was most likely due to anxiety and being nervous about having sex.  After the first couple times I had no problems for about two months everything was going fine.  About two weeks ago I lost and erection in the middle of intercourse and had no idea why but I didn't really think anything of it.  The next few times we had sex I kept loosing it and I'm pretty sure it had to do with the fact that I thought about it and assumed it would happen again and it eventually did.  After this we continued to have sex and everything was fine, probably the best its ever been, but then again today I lost my erection in the middle of intercourse.  I am extremely attracted to my girlfriend and am easily aroused by her.  I feel like there might be something wrong with me more than just anxiety.  It almost feels as if I don't have the strength that I used to have in my PC muscles.  I've been tested for STD's before and have been clean and she was recently tested and was also clean.  I'm really worried about this because my girlfriend feels as if I'm hiding something from her or that I'm not attracted to her, but that is not the case at all I have nothing to hide and as I said earlier I am very attracted to her.  I really would like to know what is wrong with me because I feel that if this continues I'm going to lose my girlfriend please help...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Problem Maintaining Erection",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is really a fairly common problem, and quite often, in younger, healthy males it's due to anxiety (\"performance anxiety\" to be exact). It sounds as though that may be a part of the problem here, as well as perhaps some other anxieties about the appropriateness of what's going on, or some other subconscious concerns. It could of course also be physical, but that's pretty rare in younger men. It could even be the condom, which may be too tight at the base and may be cutting down on the amount of blood available to maintain an erection -- although this, too, can also work the other way (and  often does).   I don't think this likely has anything to do with an STD, but what you might consider is that there might be a physiological and/or psychological problem that a doctor could detect and treat, or perhaps refer you to a counselor if there are other concerns that are bubbling under the surface. It seems you're generally healthy and while this often happens, it also often requires having someone to talk with about concerns that may not be obvious.   I hope  this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and try to not place too much pressure on yourself to perform. This should be a pleasurable experience, not a competition or a test. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Those little \"scabs\" are fairly common after a TURP. They can go on for a while, but shouldn't keep showing up beyond a month or so. If they do, you may need to have that checked. It wouldn't necessarily be serious, but if there's a tiny bleed on the prostate it makes things more prone to infection and other problems in the future.  During sex the prostate is stimulated and sometimes engorges (or at least enlarges to some degree), then tenses and releases, for lack of a better way to describe the function. It's close enough to \"spasm\" for our purposes here, and certainly could cause release of small flakes of semi-dried blood during or after sex. If sex is satisfactory and doesn't cause any discomfort in the area, things are probably fine. This is something you may want to just mention to the urologist on a non-urgent basis and follow his  advice.   Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Urine leakage after orgasm is not an uncommon complication after prostatectomy. In fact some reports described orgasm-associated incontinence (climacturia) as a complication that occurs in 50% of patients who underwent prostatectomy as a result of sphincter disorders.  It affects men with different degrees and in most of them, it is not a constant event with a frequency that does not bother them or their partner.  Most men try to evacuate their bladder before intercourse to avoid its occurrence. Few men need to use for example condoms not to bother their partners.  It is a condition he should discuss with his physician for better evaluation and management.  This will make you exposed to chemical irritants from the urine and organisms that may cause infections. Proper local antiseptic measures and cleaning should be taken and discussion with his doctor for proper evaluation. He would instruct both of you with measures that would minimze the problem.  I would advise you to follow up with his doctor and to discuss with him these issues. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you for the information. I just had my prostectomy 3 weeks ago, and experienced the ejaculation that you mentioned.   How long should this continue (I think it'll freak my wife out knowing that I was urinating into her)?  Other than urine, is it possible for anything else to come out?  Also I heard that it's possible to impregnate my wife (up to 12 weeks post surgery) since sperm may remain in the sperm vesicles.   is this only possible if you ejaculate?  If not, how is this possible, if there were no ejaculation - how would the sperm (that is in the vesicles) travel into the woman?  Lastly, eventhough the vas deferens doesn't serve a function - after the prostate is removed, nonetheless, why did it have to get severed (i.e. why did I have to have a vasectomy?).  Speaking of which - do they make the cut near the prostate (i.e. inside of the body) or do they cut anything in the scrotum sac? thanks SOOO much for the help and info.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I used to masturbate often once a day, but since 4 months, I have been doing it only once in 15-20 days (not due to any particular reason except only due to tight schedule). Since 4 months, I feel burning sensation during the ejaculation phase. It starts just before ejaculation and ends 2-3 minutes after ejaculation. I feel slight weakness after ejaculation but that just goes away after 4-5 minutes.  I am 28 years old and still unmarried and didn't have any sex as yet due to religious traditions where sex before marriage is not allowed. So i am assuming that I don't have any sexually transmitted disease. I urinate normally except one after ejaculation which is relatively burning/painful. I also don't have any particular medical history and I performed regular blood checkup around 6-7 months ago having all stuff as normal.  Can you advice me about my case?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Burning Pain while ejaculation",
    "content": "Hello -  It sounds as though you probably have a mild, non-infectious urethritis (inflammation or irritation of the urethra), perhaps due to the fact that you reduced the frequency of masturbatory sessions. The urethra may have become used to the frequent discharges, then after the \"break\" may have been irritated by the relatively infrequent occasions now.   It is also remotely possible this could be an infectious urethritis due to some non-sexual issue, which happens on occasion, due to failure to keep the area sufficiently clean. It's unusual, but it happens, and there's usually no memory of having been careless -- it just takes one stray bacterium to get in there.   If the burning only takes place folowing ejaculation then it's probably fine. If it starts to happen  at other times (during or after urination or when nothing is going on) then you'll need to at least have a urinalysis and culture done at the doctor's, but it really sounds pretty normal. The weakness  you describe following ejaculation is also fairly common, and if you only just started having that, it may be for the same reason, because of the forced waiting perioid between masterbatory interludes.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us if necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Occasional, isolated hematuria is not terribly unusual. Your doctor apparently felt this was the case. One possible cause seen on occasion is in runners. Some runners experience frequent,  benign hematuria and it is assumed to be a result of the jostling effect on the kidneys from running on hard pavement or dry ground. If you run regularly or had been running for some reason prior to the one occasion of hematuria, that would probably give you a satisfactory explanation. Otherwise it is pretty much open to speculation, and since it only happened once it is probably completely benign.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again -  With back ache/pain showing up consistent with the episodes of hematuria, I think you'll have to have a kidney stone ruled out. Also, since you're not a runner that's not contributing to either symptom. A stone (or stones) could be lodged somewhere and the really severe pain from those doesn't usually commence til the thing starts to move. If you have one of those little spiky ones sometimes it gets lodged in or near the kidney and can cause intermittent problems. This could be caused by other things too, of course, but the simplest explanation is usually the most likely one. It would probably be the simplest to deal with as well. At any rate, you'll now need to see a urologist who can determine just what's causing this. Once is fairly unremarkable. It appears this is going to be a recurrent event.

    "title": "Calcified area on kidney",
    "content": "I am a 36 y/o female with a long history of calcium oxalate kidney stones.  I had a CT w/o contrast done in 11/07 which revealed a stone in the right ureter (which I subsequently passed) and an incidental finding of a \"1.5 cm paritally calcified mass in the lower pole of the left kidney, which may just represent a complex cyst.\"  CT w/ contrast was recommended.  My first urologist did not feel it was cause for concern.  In July, I had two more stones on the right (10mm nad 8mm which required lithotripsy)....the partner MD of the original doc ordered a CT w/ and w/o contrast to followup on the CT from 11/07.  On followup CT, done 8/19/08, the radiologist states \"bilateral renal cysts, as well as complex area measuring 2 cm involving the lower pole of the left kidney, demonstrating borderline enhancement.  Due to streak artifact from contrast enhancement, it is difficult to determine if true enhancement of this lesion is present.  It is favored to be a complex cyst.  Either close followup with CT or further evaluation with MRI is recommended.\"  Also there was a \"partially liquefied subcapsular hematoma of the right kidney measuring 1.8 cm\" which I am assuming was from lithotripsy one month ago on that side.  My doc has ordered another CT in 3 months, and was not concerned about the hematoma or the cysts.  (There were \"several small cysts on bilateral kidneys\")  I have a few questions:  1) Is followup in 3 months soon enough?  What are the odds this could be a malignant process?  2) Is there anything to worry about/check for, etc, with the bilateral renal cysts?  3) Is the subcapsular hematoma anything to worry about...will it self resolve?  4) In 2006 I was diagnosed with a calcified meningioma on a head CT done when I had a TIA.  (I have a history of a clotting d/o and have had a pulmonary embolus, etc.)  My internist was not concerned about it, stating that it was entirely calcified...could the meningioma and the calcified area on my kidney be related, ie metastases from somewhere else?

    "content": "Hello,  That's a good question but as you have experienced first hand, it's one that's not easy to answer. The problem with renal cysts vs malignancy is augmented by the fact that the kidney is not readily accessible for biopsy.  In situations like yours there is a set of criteria employed by radiologists called the Bosniak Criteria for Renal Masses.[1]  Generally speaking the diagnosis favors malignancy when the mass shows: # thickened irregular walls / septa # enhancement after contrast  MRI is useful when U/S and CT are not diagnostic / contrast cannot be administered. It's also useful in assessing invasion.  Apparently, your radiologist seems to think that the complex cyst does not fulfill the required criteria and he is even doubtful about the enhancement. Also, you don't seem to be having any of the alarming symptoms (eg, blood in urine).  I would say that 3 months is an adequate period for follow up. During this period you should report any new complaints right away.   Re: the hematoma, it should resolve spontaneously unless something is actively bleeding there.  Please keep us updated!

    "content": "Hello -  While proteinuria can be a feature of any of the serious problems you mention, trace amounts of protein often occur in the urine of healthy patients and this can be caused by fever, exercise, heavier than normal drinking and other relatively benign things.   Best way to determine if this is a problem or just a transient finding (as it  usually is), is to have a repeat test in a few weeks. If there are still trace amounts or if the amount of protein has increased then you might need to be further worked up for possible kidney problems, but, again, this finding is very common and usually transient.   Hopefully this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Trace of protein in urine test",
    "content": "Hi,  You have asked some very good questions: First, let me mention that there are limitations with the dipstick test commonly used to assess proteins in urine, which make the test less sensitive when there is a small amount of protein in urine (trace). This makes the results of the test less meaningful.  1. On the day of the test, I drink very little water. I just got urine a little bit more than the tube the doctor provided, the color was dark yellow, does this affect the result?  Yes, the dipstick method is associated with false positives in highly concentrated urine. This is overcome in the lab by doing another confirmatory test called sulfosalicylic acid test.  There are other causes of false positive results such as contamination with disinfectants, x-ray contrast media, massive doses of penicillin, cephalosporins as well as other drugs (including sulfa drugs). The dipstick method is also less sensitive to positively charged proteins as opposed to negatively charged proteins such as albumin.  I think you can see why your doctor isn't willing to give too much importance to your results when there's only a trace of protein detected. As the test is very unreliable in this range.  There are also many benign causes of the so called transient proteinuria which can occur as a result of fever, exercise or cold exposure.  Your doctor would have evaluated your result in perspective to your overall medical history as well as your other test results. If you have another risk for protein in urine (eg, diabetes, hypertension, pregnancy in females), he would want to make sure that this isn't something more serious.  To answer your other questions: 2. I am taking simvastatin 5 mg and other high blood pressure medicine. All my blood pressure and cholesterol results are ok, I heard that some statin drug can break down the muscle, is there any possible of that to cause protein in my urine? Yes, statins can cause myopathy - I personally have seen only one such case. This is because it's extremely rare. However, if this does happen it won't be a trace of proteins in your urine and it would be accompanied with muscle related symptoms (commonly a proximal myopathy). 3. I have a small cyst on one of my kidney, will that cause it? Highly unlikely given that all our other tests are normal and there are no complaints, and the questionable significance of a trace of protein in urine. 4. Should I go back to see a doctor sooner or as my doctor said come back at 3 months? Only if new symptoms / complaints arise, otherwise I would wait for 3 months.  I hope this helps, please keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "prostatitis or STD???",
    "content": "i'm a 27 year old male with an otherwise clean bill of health.  In early 2008 I had a momentary lapse of judgment and slept with someone that I probably shouldn't have (i'm not sure this is relavent but i'll get to that).  A few months later I started having symptoms like inability to fully empty my bladder, getting up multiple times each night to urinate, and having a slight bit of night time incontinence.  I went to see a urologist and he did all the usual tests they do and couldn't diagnose any problem.  He said that it could be prostatitis and also mentioned the possibility of an STI since I had mentioned I slept with a promiscuous girl.  He prescribed me Cipro and I took it and all symptoms went away.  Is this normal for prostatitis or did he prescribe me Cipro thinking that I had an STI?  I feel like I should also mention that at the time this all started I took a promotion at work to a much more stressful job.    Fast forward a few months.  I again had a momentary lapse of judgment (in july) with the same girl.  (this will never happen again with that girl for the record!)  I'm now having similar symptoms, but not exactly the same symptoms.  I have been having occasional night time incontinence (ranging from a quarter size spot on my sheets to a baseball size spot) and i've also noticed here lately that when i sit down i'll occasionally feel some sort of discharge, but when i check to see what it is it looks just like normal lubrication that is present during sexual activity.  The thing that makes me nervous about that is that when it has happened it wasn't soon after being sexually aroused.  It seems to happen totally at random (same with the incontinence).  I've also very occasionally experienced what i could only describe as a spasm in my penis.   I have an appointment to get tested and I plan on making another appointment with my urologist, but I wanted to see what you thought of this problem because my urologist didn't seem to care too much about it.  Perhaps he doesn't think its serious, but to me it is because I've never had health problems before and i'm really freaked out.  thank you for your help and for the peace of mind you provide to so many people here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While the first time was a tossup as to STI or prostatitis (and, of course, could simply be prostatitis due to general contamination -- nonspecific urethritis or NSU), the fact that this happened again following an encounter with the same partner strongly suggests either a) she's not especially hygenic or b) she's carrying some sort of chronic bacterial STI. It would be highly unlikely you could develop prostatitis twice following sex with the same person. Not impossible, mind you, but statistically very unlikely.   In either case Cipro likely would be effective, so you're likely to wind up with the same prescription. More thorough testing may also be in order. That's about it for now. Please keep us updated, though. If you've wound up with prostatitis twice that would be pretty remarkable.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I really thank you for this website. I have two serious, important questions to ask. Firslty, I am about 20 years old and have had this problem for at least a couple of years: my penis causes a bulge in any short/pants I wear. What does this entail and what can I do about it? My second question is that I also have a visible vein that is close to the surface and actually causes a lump on my penis, especially at the site of the sinus (end of the vein). Is this normal? What is meant when talking about lumps in this region? Thank you very much for your help and understanding.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant slight arousal & abnormal lump?",
    "content": "Hi there -  The only cure for the bulge would seem to be to adopt a looser fitting style of pants. Some men are cursed (or blessed, depending on one's point of view) by this \"problem.\" Seriously, looser-fitting pants is probably the only thing that's going to solve this, unless you wear boxer shorts, in which case adopting Jockey-style underwear might enable you to manage this.  As for the vein: this is a variation of normal. It is seen a fair amount of the time. If the lump were to change -- become larger -- over time, it might warrant a docotor visit, but in general this conformation is mostly a matter of scale: if the vein itself is prominent, then the termination at the sinus is likely to produce a noticeable lump. Again, so long as this doesn't change markedly, it is usually normal.  I hope this answers your concerns. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 55 year old male and maintain an active sex life. My wife and I have been married for 30 years and still enjoy sex. Recently a good friend told me of his prostate and erectile dysfunction problems. He said his physician told him that frequent ejaculation by men in their 50's can lead to BPH and possibly erectile problems. I ejaculate either by intercourse or masturbation on average 4 times a week, i might add that masturbation is usually mutual with my wife and not solo. I have no problems with my prostate or erectile problems. My question is should I be concerned abut developing prostate or erectile problems and decrease my sexual activity and frequency of ejaculation? Thank you in advance for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, you're pretty young to be worrying about this! You also seem to be doing fine in the department in question, and I am a strong subscriber to the \"If it isn't broken, don't fix it\" school. While some men -- rarely, actually -- can experience prostate problems because of overuse of the equipment, the reverse is more often the case, and benign prostatic hypertrophy may occur on its own, but is less likely in men who are regularly sexually active.   In short, I wouldn't go looking for trouble. It sounds as though your sex life (and life in general) is pretty healthy. Enjoy it. If you have no systemic illnesses you're not likely to begin to suffer from EDS, even if you eventually do develop some prostatic enlargement.   I hope this answers your concern. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

On Saturday there was swelling on the skin of my scrotum only on the area with the pimple.the swelling was inside of the scrotum. I think i have infected it, then i was advised to take antibiotics.  on Sunday after a shower there was a lot of puss discharge form the pimple.  Today the swelling seems to be decreasing but still there..  My question is what was that pimple like thing, could it be anything serious,It was not a pimple but looked exactly like one and was very firm if it tried to squeeze it...I cant see it anymore maybe it is covered up by the swelling..\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The pimple-like thing you attempted to drain is a very common occurrence. They look like pustules but they're not. Honestly, I don't know what they are, because every doctor I've worked with, when encountering this, has said the same thing: \"It's just normal.\" They don't seem to evolve at all, but they also are very slow to go away, and there may be several at any given time.  The attempt to drain it (or any pimple, boil or mass) is never a good idea. If anything seems as though it may need draining, it definitely should be seen by a doctor first. Your well-intentioned attempt at self-treatment caused an infection that wasn't there to begin with.  Hopefully it will resolve with antibiotic therapy now. Keep it clean and dry, and don't try something like that again, tempting as it may be. The orignal lesion, as I say, is something very common, although I don't know anyone who even knows what to call them.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I was put on doxy for 3 weeks and after that I was fine. About a week after i finished the doxy I noticed a clear precum type fluid leaking after urination. I figured it was just from the medicine and left it alone. It went away a few days later. So now 5 months later the clear precum is back, I have been back to the doctor 3 different times and had every test redone and they are all coming back negative. I was told I had a UTI 3 weeks ago and was put on cipro, which made me feel better, but its all coming back. My penis hurts, my pubic area hurts, my right thigh hurts. I have no problem urinating to passing stool. It feels like there is something stuck in the tip of my urethra but there is nothing there? Any thoughts?\n\n",

Reiter's disease would be a possibility too, but that would almost certainly also involve joint pain and eye  inflammation as well as the genitourinary symptoms. The leaking of seminal fluid would also seem to suggest prostate involvement, so you need to be worked up for that. Prostatitis can also cause urethral discomfort and a sensation of \"something\" being \"in there.\" I don't know why, but it does. It also often presents with flu-like symptoms, but not always. It is a distinct possibility and should be ruled out -- or in. Radiation of pain to the pubic area and right thigh is also suggestive of a prostatic problem.

    "title": "Testicular Pain 4+ Months, STD negative.  Stressed!",
    "content": "Hello, here is a quick list of my history & symptoms  History ---------  - mid 20's sexually active  - always use protection.  There have been cases where the condom has broken however.  - my last partner was fully tested for STD's towards the end of the relationship and everything came back negative.  Symptoms ------------- - I began feeling discomfort during urination & my right testicle started to hurt  around 4 months ago.  The discomfort during urination can be described as a tightening of the urethra or something to that extent.  I notice it momentarily as spikes (maybe lasting a second or so) during a full urination cycle.  It occurs at most once a day and sometimes won't occur for entire weeks.    - The testicular pain is about the same frequency occurring  always in the right testicle.  Some weeks I won't really have it at all, and other weeks it is persistent and quite painful.  It has begun to travel to the inner groin and leg area as well.  It seems worse after a night of drinking.  It can be described as a dull constant pain.  Occasionally my right testicle will be tender to touch.   - It could be my imagination, but my scrotum has been quite 'clammy' and 'cold' as of late and has been producing plenty of perspiration even when doing non-active activities like sitting at a desk all day (my boxers will be a little damp from the sweat).    - Again, my imagination could be getting the best of me, but I appear to have white spots all over the shaft of my penis.  They are under the skin and do not even raise up. No pain or discomfort. They have not changed in size over the past few months and do not look as if they can even be popped or poked. I truly forget if I had these previous to all my other symptoms.  After some googling it appears they somewhat resemble Fordyce spots?  - Lastly, over the past 4 months I have had two  zits-like occurances near my scrotum area.  They are basically exactly like a zit and not very painful.  I was able to 'flick' them off with little effort.  They did occur within a week of shaving my pubic area.  I have since stopped shaving and have yet to have them re-occur.    - I have been to the doctor countless times and have had the following tests :  1) urine tests for bloods/bacteria 4 times - all negative. 2) STD tests - 2 rounds - blood, urine and urethral swab - all tests came back negative.  3) low back / abdominal xrays - negative for any signs 4) physical examination of the genital area by three different doctors - nothing out of the ordinary.   I have been treated with two types of antibiotics for epididymis (one for ghonorrea-related epididymis and another one for non-std related epididymis) even though my test results came back negative.  Both medications did very little in terms of relief.   I plan on going back AGAIN this week and getting a urologist referral.  All signs point to prostatitis ?  At this point it seems like my best guess.  If I could have one wish it would be to figure out what the heck is going on with me!  It is affecting every possible aspect of my life and causing alot of stress.  Please lend me a hand and give your advice on what it could possibly be and what my next steps should be.   Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Considering all the negative findings ruling out everything else, I think you've come up with the most likely remaining possibility, which would be prostatitis with the pain apparently referred. There is usually pain and difficulty urinating, as well as a generalized sick feeling,  fever, and sometimes the whole range of flu-like symptoms. While yours doesn't sound like a typical presentation it should be ruled out too, or in. At this point you probably would like to find something to which to attribute the symptoms.  If the prostatitis idea fails to pan out you may need to be examined for a possible inquinal hernia that's also presenting atypically. This seems unlikely, but would probably be the next most likely place to look.  I hope this is helpful. You seem to be pretty well on top of this, but just aren't getting any answers. Hopefully you will soon.  Best of luck to you. Please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

However, thyroid hormones, pituitary hormones, and sex hormones are all involved in the regulation of the body build and sexual maturity. Thus, a thorough history and clinical examination would guide your doctor what to start with.   Indications of testosterone medications use include men who have testicular failure diagnosed by low serum testosterone levels and above normal gonadotropins (FSH, LH) levels.  - Psychological disorders should be considered if all other causes are excluded.

    "content": "Hello,  Urine odor may change due to many causes that may be physiological (benign) or pathological (disease related).   These physiological causes include: - Food and medication can causes abnormal urine odor as their metabolic products are excreted by the kidney into the urine. Asparagus containing food Vitamins especially B6 Supplementation  In these conditions you may notice the change in the smell of urine few hours after ingesting these elements.  -Concentrated Urine is another causes and commonly seen in dehydrated persons.  - Diseases like: - Urinary tract infection that can be diagnosed by a simple urine analysis and culture, in addition to symptoms of UTI like dysuria, frequency and or urgency. Despite your symptoms are not typical for UTI it should be excluded.  - Metabolic diseases like Diabetes but other symptoms of the disease will be present like polyuria etc. And blood sugar test will help in the diagnosis.  I would advise you to drink a large amount of fluids every day and see its effect, it dehydration was the cause, the urine odor and color should change with proper hydration.  If the condition persists you better be checked by your doctor. He might recommend urine analysis & cultures as well tests for exclusion of systemic diseases.  Please keep us updated.

    "content": "Hello, Difficulty in starting a urinary stream is known as urinary hesitancy. It is seen in both women and men, but more commonly seen in men with prostatic hyperplasia.  Many conditions can result in urinary hesitancy like URI, neurologic problems affecting nerve supply to this area (postoperative or in diabetics), medications like some antidepressants, and changes in the anatomy of the pelvis around the urethra and the bladder like fibrosis in the pelvis after a surgery in the pelvic organs.  A thorough history and direct clinical examination are essential for initial evaluation. Investigations would include urine analysis, pelvis US or CT scan. Thyroid function tests are better checked too if not done recently. Proper management is essential to avoid urine retention in some conditions.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I've noticed today that my right testicle seems enlarged, larger than its usual size.   I first experienced a little discomfort a few days ago, but it was only a slight discomfort in my lower abdominal region, and nothing severe or excruciating. I examined it and everything seems fine, it doesn't hurt when try to touch it or move it around. However, a day later I noticed that some part of the testicle was larger than usual. It was some structure atop it. But when I checked it again today, it seems that the right testicle has grown larger, though I;m not sure if it can be called as swollen. There's no sign of fluid accumulating around the testicle, and it's the testicle itself that seems enlarged. Again, it isn't painful when I examine it.  Would you say that this is torsion?\n\n",

    "content": "I would not even try to guess without you having an exam of your testis. Yes it could be torsion but also something more serious. Make an appointment with your doctor or a urologist asap. Scrotal masses need to be accurately palpated by an expert since most growths inside the testis seem to be malignant while scrotal masses outside of the testicles seem to run benign. I can't emphasize enough how important it is for you to have a testicular exam, non-invasive and no pain. Ultrasound may be used to visualize any mass that you have in the testicles. Please follow up on this and let us know how you are doing.  Good luck to you,  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Alternative medicine like herbal medicine is known also as a traditional medicinal or folk medicine. It is base on the use of plants and their extracts as a source for trace minerals. Silica is one of these minerals and is important to many body organs although a relatively rare element.  There are food sources of silica like cereals, especially oats and rice, cucumbers, asparagus, lettuce cabbage, onions, potatoes, sunflower seeds and strawberries.  Other sources of silica like horsetail in the form of a preparation of silica supplements. In medicine the safety and efficacy of each plant should be tested in different clinical trial phases before they are recommended for medical use. Pharmaceutical companies claim it is a good source for silica. In addition, consumers may think being natural it should be safe. However, they may interact with drug of proven efficacy or they may be contaminated, so there are risks that are not examined to make their recommendation by physicians an option.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is possible that another stone has been formed. Another possibility is fibrosis and narrowing of the ureter after stent occurred as a complication.  If recurrent stone is to be the cause then understanding the reason why it is formed (nature) for avoiding its recurrence is mandatory.  If the reason is narrowing of the ureter, then evaluation of its degree and its effect on the kidney (back pressure) and consultation of surgical urologist is needed.  Other causes that may be unrelated are of gastrointestinal origin like gastroduodenal and biliary tract causes considering your digestion problems. IBS is a disease diagnosed by exclusion and is a consideration in all causes of abdominal pain and maldigestion.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for thorough clinical evaluation and exclusion of recurrent renal stones. He might recommend simple urine analysis to exclude infections and an US abdomen & pelvis or plain X-Ray to evaluate the urinary system.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   What you described is known as Interstitial cystitis (IC)/ painful bladder syndrome (PBS) / Overactive bladder syndrome.  The hallmarks of interstitial cystitis painful bladder syndrome (PBS) are:  - Urgency without incontinence  -Daytime frequency more than 8 voids per day  -Nighttime frequency more than 4 voids per night  -Bladder pain is usually relieved by voiding  - Sometimes the pain is felt like that of penile origin.   No proven cause for the disease yet, theories include: an autoimmune, hereditary, infectious or allergic condition.   Symptoms may get worse after stress or the intake of caffeine containing beverages like tea, coffee, cola, etc, and by alcohol. Probably after sexual intercourse the symptoms increase due to pelvic congestion.  Medications, regulation of diet and fluid intake and special type of exercises are helpful but none is curable.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.   Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I have peyronie disease but its not that bad I have been having it for about a year now. My peyronie doesn't hurt although I have the scar tissue underneath my skin I can feel it when I have an erection its harder then the rest of the tissue also and when flaccid I can see it too shape out alittle also.    however before yesterday I had  an erection at night and messed around with it but but didnt really masterbate with it I got a random erection.This happened before I went to bed.  In the morning I wake up suddenly with a sharp pain. Its under the tip on the right side close to the scar tissue area not sure if it can be on a small part of it but I doubt it because the pain is sharp it doesnt hurt like the peyronie pain i used to get early or if I masterbate hard. which feels sore instead of sharp like a knife.  can sharp pains in the penis be peyronies disease or is it more likely to be that I stretched a tissure or tore one or something else? My penis length hasn't decreased and its fairly straight and is only slightly curved but it has always been even before peyronies.  The pain seemed to hurt if the area was touched. yesterday was hurting constantly more because when penis flaccid hangs down in my pants and walks the tip keeps getting in contact with the jeans inside. It hursts alittle less today though. but still hurts  -- IS sharp pain a sympton of peyronies or only sore pain? ????? The sharp pain is somewhat like when I recieved the trauma that caused my peyronies sharp pain except that I can catch an erection and It  don't feel like blood is leaking and gusing inside\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Peyronie's disease is characterized by a localized inflammation that heals by a hardened scar forming plaques or lumps in the penis reducing its flexibility. Plaques are not cancerous.The disease is of unknown cause although in some reported cases the disease developed after trauma.  Symptoms (mainly pain and bending of the penis) range in severity from mild to severe. Pain usually occurs during and after erection making sexual intercourse difficult. Inflammation and pain resolves shortly in mild cases but may cause significant long lasting pain or permanent bending.   Congestion due to unrelieved sexual excitement may also cause or aggravate the pain.  It is more likely that this pain is due to peyronie's disease but exclusion of other causes like infections is mandatory.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper assessment.

Dermatitis may also occur due to contact with an allergen or irritant like soap, creams, synthetic cloth, or after vigorous sexual intercourse or masturbation. The skin in this part is very delicate and can be easily inflamed and this is likely to be the reason of your symptoms.  Sometimes when your partner has vaginal candidiasis, allergy and inflammation occur after penile exposure to the candida lesions during sexual intercourse.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for exclusion of other skin diseases like fungal infection.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Your doctor might consider postponing the procedure if you have severe infection with fever or low blood counts that indicate a weak immune system.   Physicians usually prescribe you antibiotics during and following cystoscopy to avoid infectious complications. So you will be covered anyways.  Hope you find this information useful.

I ended up having to postpone my cystoscopy until yesterday because my doctor was ill last month the day I went in to get it done.  They thought that I might have interstitial cystitis, but the cystoscopy showed that I do not.  There were some blood vessels that had hemorrhaged and a small area of metaplasia.  She prescribed me a month's worth of Levaquin to take, but to be honest I don't remember why that was.  (I'm shocked I remember any of it with the pills and the shot of Toradal I had to take.)  She should that it should hopefully take care of the symptoms of frequency and incomplete emptying that I was having.  Also, I ended up having bronchitis (and still do), but my doctor said that as long as I am taking pills for it, she could still do the procedure.  Thank you again for your response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Flowmax user with burning sensation when urinating",
    "content": "Hello -  While Flowmax may have made sense at the time, if the infection hasn't resolved this can only make  the discomfort worse. Prostatitis is very painful anyway, so it's a tossup as to whether the Flowmax is a good or bad idea. Urination would otherwise become more difficult and would still be painful. If you have completed the course of Bactrim you may need a change of antibiotic or re-evalution of the problem. With an infected prostate, as with any other infection, a blood test to check for white count would help confirm the infection (since it sounds as though your doctor may have assumed the diagnosis without adequate tests). If you do, in fact, have prostatitis, you likely are running a fever and feeling rather lousy overall. Sometimes it requires a second course of antibiotics to knock these infections down.   Given the degree of discomfort and failure to improve, I would call the doctor, explain the problem as it is now, and see if he won't bump up your appointment based on your discomfort.  If not, then  you might want to resort to an acute-care walkin facility for relief.   I hope this is  helpful to you.  Good luck. Please follow up with  us here.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 45 year old male, in 2001/2002 I had a cystoscopy/BiLateral IVP due to blood in my urine that was not resolved with time or meds.  The Urologist found scar tissue in the urethra and lower part of the bladder that they removed.  I have had no issues since until about a month ago.  I noticed  small blood spots in my underwear, and at times a pus like discharge, along with mild burning when I urinate.  The Dr. ran a standard urinalysis, and it came back negative for anything...  The day after the test, I was still seeing the discharge and visible blood.  They ran not only a thorough urinalysis, with initial stream and mid-stream samples, and also tested blood and urine for gonorrhea and chlamydia and they also say they came back clean...  They have done an abdominal ultrasound on the kidneys and bladder, and an abdominal CT and see nothing abnormal.  I go in on the 19th of this month for a Cystoscopy to see what is wrong I am trying to find out for myself what else it could possibly be, since even their lab says there is no blood, when I can see it with my own eyes... Family history is pretty much limited to strokes, heart issues and high blood pressure...  I have High Cholesterol, that is under control with meds. and hypogonadism I am currently on the following: Lopid 600mg twice daily Zocor 20mg daily Lamictal 300mg daily Celexa 20mg daily Seroquel 25mg daily androgel 5g/5mg daily  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

He checked my PSA also, and it was 0.50, way down at the bottom of the scale.

The problem is that I have never had sexual intercourse, oral sex, anal sex, or any kind of fooling around that might have resulted in getting Chlamydia.  I should note that I have been getting what I believe are recurrent urinary tract infections for several months.  The main problem has been the feeling of needing to urinate all the time.  But in the last month I have been having pain in my abdomen area.  It feels cramped, inflamed, or like something is going to burst.  Every time I go to the doctor I get prescribed antibiotics and the problem returns and it has only gotten worse.  It also seems like the problem returns after I drink alcohol.  I believe that is what is re triggering these infections.  Can I never drink alcohol again?  Could I get Chlamydia some other way besides having sex?  What should I do about my recurrent UTI's if antibiotics don't work?  Is there another diagnosis I might have?  Thank You  (PS I have seen three different Urologists)  (PS I have been on anti depressants and anti anxiety drugs for about 6 years.  I recently stopped taking them in February.  I have been having my Urological problems since June.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is quiet unusual, Chlamydia infection is known to be a sexually transmitted disease and the other mode of transmission is during child birth from the mother to her child causing mainly eye infection.  It is an infection that can produce no symptoms or uretheral discharge and a burning sensation when urinating. Pain in the lower abdomen is not uncommon.  Diagnosis is done by culture the organism from the patient discharge.The test is very accurate and I never heard about false positive results.  If you have doubts about the diagnosis you may repeat the test (if you did not start antibiotics) and discuss this with your doctor. You better repeat the test after completion of therapy to make sure you have been cured and the organism was eradicated to avoid recurrent attacks and also to be reassured.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concern.  Hope you find this information is useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-   There are a number of ways to eliminate a calculus, depending on its size. I assume your doctor had been hoping you would be able to pass this on  your own, but at 54 grams it sounds like it is pretty good sized. While there are several substances that are sometimes used to try and dissolve the stone, these aren't always effective and one can even, sometimes, cause calcium to collect on the stone, making it even larger.   There are three differect surgical approaches, and the least invasive one which seems most workable is usually the one chosen. All three are, by now, fairly minor, so if the stone becomes problematic (and it sounds as though that's happening now), and the stone can't be dissolved by use of substances to shrink or totally dissolve it, you may need to have a minor surgical procedure to remove the thing once and for all.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  These lesions  don't (so far, at least) sound much like they are STD-related. My  first thought was that  your having shaved the area probably had caused some ingrown follicles, and that's still entirely possible. However, the lesion that later appeared on your shaft sounds like a different sort of thing -- probably still just a pimple, but keep an eye on it to make certain it doesn't turn into an ulcerative sore (open) or otherwise change in a disturbing way. Ideally, with proper hygeine, this should go away sooner than later.   If any of the lesions change or last longer than a couple weeks you probably would be wise to see a doctor to rule out any STDs, but it really doesn't sound like that's what you've got going on there, especially given your history of very limited recent sexual activity.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife gave birth last week at a hospital in NYC.  She was givin a low dose epidural (walking epidural) that allowed her to walk about and still have some sensation.  She was able to urinate a bit throughout the labor (very slow trickle) and thought that it was sufficient to empty her bladder.  She had an IV as well, went though about two bags before her delivery 12 hours later, and also was taking in some fluids orally.  However by the time she was ready to push, the OB noticed that her bladder was very full (protruding a lot- a big bump on her stomach).  She immediately gave her a catader, and was astonised by the volume that came out: 1.5 liters.  She was extremely angry with the nurse staff for overlooking this- and made sure to report it.    My question: could she have sustained any damage to her bladder?  She appears to have regained most of the mucle tone now (5 days later), but I'm concerned that the 1.5 liters could have damaged the muscle lining.  She's only 100 lbs normally, and before her pregnancy could never really hold much urine (thought she had a small bladder). 1.5 liters is a tremendous amount I think, and would like to know if there could be any potential compliations.  Becuase of the epidural, she lost most of her sensation, and if the spincter muscle (or whatever holds the bladder shut) was frozen shut, could the normal over-pressure dumping that typically occurs been over-ridden?  Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Typical bladder capacity for moderate filling would be 500 to 700 ml.  But, greater than a liter is still common at times.  Sometimes your body just has to accommodate more and it does a pretty good job.  I don't recommend doing this voluntarily, however.  Unfortunately the epidural would have made it difficult for her to have the full sensation so she needed to depend on the staff to alert her to that problem.  I would not expect any long-term damage from this.  Yes, it was irresponsible and not good nursing care.  It can also make it harder for the baby's descent.  This is why the doctor was unhappy about it.  Bodies are quite resilient and the capacity to stretch and then resume the original size and shape is quite remarkable.  Epidurals can also cause some delay in function but most likely she will be good as new soon if not already.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I've never heard this set of symptoms before, I believe there very well could be some connection between the odd sensation in the area of the prostate and testicles and the appearance of the hemorrhoids. You may, due to your history of difficult bowel movements and this set of symptoms, be  referred for a colonoscopy to rule out any sort of growth in the intestine, although a thorough colo-rectal exam may be all that's required.   It's difficult to say exactly what's going on, but I do believe these are probably all related and should be diganosed as soon as possible.   I hope this  is helpful to you. Please follow up with as as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "About 2 weeks ago I contracted an infection of the prostrate. As I went to hospital they performed a few checks on the penis, testicles and prostrate. Apart from the infection of the prostrate, the doctors also found that the blood veins to the 2 testicles were not the same size.   The prostrate infection is being treated by antibiotic medicine by hypothermia treatment to support the medicine and to reduce the size of the prostrate which has boecome to big because of the infection.  What I want to know is your opinion on the blood veins to the testicles. To one testicle the diameter is 1.8 mm and to the other one is 2.8 mm. According to the doctor it shuold not be larger than 2.0 mm and advizes surgery on the one which is too large. During surgery they close this vein and later a new vein should develop itself. If I don't do this surgery it is said that I will get pains in the subject testicle.   Can you give me your opinion on this problem? Is it really something that I need to be operated on?  Thanks, Wim\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The enlarged vein is quite large, but I'm not sure why that would be a problem. I suppose it may be so large for its purpose that it doesn't provide adequate blood return. If that's the case then it probably should be repaired surgically, but again, I have my doubts about the timely development of a collateral vein, and can't help but wonder if that wouldn't create a worse blood return.   I think it's generally wise to seek a second opinion when elective surgery is suggested anyway, and in this case it seems it would be a very good idea.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -    This is not at all uncommon (nor abnormal) but can certainly be annoying at best. It is less likely as one gets closer to middle age, but  even then, depending on the individual, it can still be a problem.   My suggestions, such as they are,  would be to a) use a longer cool-down period, so that any physical motion or contact which may be contributing to this is reduced before you're ready to actually dismount, and b) if you don't already wear jockey-type underwear,  start wearing it at the gym. It not only helps rein things in,  but also helps produce more body heat locally, which can be of some help in reducing the intensity of unwanted erections.  Other than that, try finding something that distracts you, as this had been a time-honored way of avoiding unwanted erections. Eventually this  should take care of itself. I wish I could give you some magic answer, but I'm afraid this is just one of those annoying things that come with being a young male.   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe may be a variant of normal or it could be Peyronie's disease, which can cause this sort of \"ridge\" like formation. It can also cause,  in some people, an annoying bending of the penis. A urologist is the best specialist to diagnose and treat this problem. You should  have it ruled out (or in) and if it's not that then you probably have nothing else of concern going on. If it is Peyronie's, you'll want to treat it and have it followed, and the earlier treatment is begun the better the outcome and the less annoyance will be likely.  Best of luck to you.

    "title": "terminal hematuria",
    "content": "Yesterday morning I awoke with an erection.  I attempted to urinate while erect.  Immediatly I felt a burning sensation in my penis.  There was no blood in my urine.  When the urine flow ended, a small flow of blood appeared at the tip of my urethra.    I urinated again about an hour later.  The urine was clear.  I saw a doctor in the afternoon.  He said that he suspected a prostate infection.  I conveyed that I had had pulled a back muscle over the weekend and was concerned that it might be a kidney stone.  He said that terminal hematuria is caused by problems below the bladder.    He did a full check pushing down on my kidneys and abdomen.  All was normal.  My bp was normal as was my temperature.  There continued to be a slight burning when urinating.    The doctor checked my prostate.  He said it seemed normal.  He ordered a urine analysis.   The urine analysis came back with no sign of blood or infection.  The docotr told me that he does not think it is anything serious and was probably a transient problem.  He said if it happens again, he will send me to a urologist. He told me not to worry.   Can anyone shed some light on what might be happening.  I am very concerned as to why he did not order more tests and what this might be?  Also, can forcing yourself to urinate while you have an erection cause terminal hematuria?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: terminal hematuria",
    "content": "Hello -  While  even trivial hematuria can be quite unnerving, it is usually a transient problem caused by a weak capilary inside the ureter. This often happens during erection, since the erection is  maintained by capilary (and greater vessel) engorgement). Whatever passes during an erection may have some blood on occasion, and if it happens during (or at the conclusion) of urination, it will appear to be a greater volume of blood than it actually is.  Your doctor is correct that terminal hematuria is almost always caused by a problem south of the bladder. It could be prostate-related but I doubt it.   Not worrying is good advice. This is a fairly common problem (randomly, not usually frequently repetitive in the same patient). No one wants to see blood come out of any orifice, as it really is supposed to stay inside, but on occasion a fragile capilary can cause this sort of surprise. If there are no other symptoms and no frequent recurrence, I would take your doctor's advice.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Somehow my reply to your first post showed up after your second one, which asks how the doctor can be so certain of the benign status of your problem. The simple answer is that this is what medical training and lab studies were intended to do: find out what, if anything, is wrong. In this case, the answer would seem pretty clear cut. I understand your anxiety, but you've been given a provisional clean bill of health, and reasonably so given the findings. I'd try to relax and go with that unless, of course, the problem recurs frequently or other symptoms develop as well, which seems fairly unlikely.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "pain in penis glans/testicles following urination",
    "content": "A little over two months ago I went to costa rica on a business trip for a weekend and stupidly had sex with four different prostitutes. Before this trip I never had any of the symptoms I am about to describe. The symptoms started a few hours after the last girl in which the condom broke. I gave another oral sex two days before the last. The symptoms started as and have continued as pain on the left side of my penis glans and pain in both my testicles. The pain is most intense following urination (never during), but also when I wake up in the morning, some showers, sitting certain ways or on certain seats, or if I don\u2019t drink enough water. After approx. 20 days I noticed a dark spot appear on my glans where the pain was coming from, to the left of the meatus. A few days later I noticed tiny bumps starting to appear in a cluster there. If you look at the pictures you can see what I mean. I don\u2019t think they\u2019re herpes or warts because if I give the other side of my glans a gentle squeeze I can see the same pattern of bumps under the skin, just not raised. This tells me (I think) that these are some sort of glands at my penis head and something on the left side is infected or irritated underneath causing the glands to swell. This spot is where the pain started and continues today. Sometimes it\u2019s there, like the pictures, and sometimes it goes away. Usually when it hurts I can see it, when there is no pain it calms down. Anytime I\u2019m in an examination room under fluorescent lights it is not flaring up and the doctors can\u2019t see it. I show them the pictures and I guess they think it\u2019s not the same penis. It is very frustrating and is causing me great emotional distress. I feel like my sex life is on hold, that possibly the urine culture and analysis I\u2019ve had done might not be picking up what is there and that I might still be contagious. I\u2019ve stopped masturbating and drinking alcohol which hasn\u2019t helped so far. So far my treatment has been the following: Four days after the symptoms started I was tested for all major STDs and was negative. My GP put my on 10 days of doxycycline, 100/mg day, which seem to make the testicle pain subside but the penis pain did not change. He referred me to a urologist who tugged on my scrotum, did a urinalysis then said I needed surgery on my varicoceles (bogus). I begged for a 5-7 day urine culture but only got a 1 day. I did not take any more medicine up until Aug 26 (about a week ago). The pain became so intense in my penis that week I went to an urgent care center. He did a prostate exam and put me on cipro for prostatitis. At that point it was my third prostate exam. A little over a week now of cipro and the only thing I feel is an increase the testicle pain. I don\u2019t know how this is possible even if is an abacterial issue, unless it IS a bacteria and resistant to cipro, but is there also a chance it\u2019s just the symptoms getting worse before they get better? These are my uneducated guesses. I know that there is a chance this is bacterial prostatitis and it usually takes more than a month of the right antibiotic to cure, but I cannot find any pictures online that look like my penis does and I\u2019ve spent over 100 hours online researching this since it started. I\u2019m nervous about having another prostate exam because I read that the bacteria can be pushed into the blood stream if it is too rough. I am afraid this could turn into something serious if not treated soon with the right care and I don\u2019t know where to turn next. I have a follow up with my GP on the 15th, the day my urgent care cipro runs out. There are 6 pics posted. Four show the visual at it\u2019s worst. The last two show when it seems to go away temporarily.  Have you heard/seen anything like this before?  What should I do?  What would cause the pain in my testicles to worsen by taking an antibiotic?  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic1.jpg  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic2.jpg  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic3.jpg  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic4.jpg  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic5.jpg  http://i363.photobucket.com/albums/oo79 ... 5/pic6.jpg\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Well,  as you probably realize by now, Photobucket has blocked the photos, and not unreasonably I guess. It's unfortunate, though, since there's no way to get an image of what you're trying to describe. That being the case, everything else sounds like (best guess) prostatitis, and although it is a terribly uncomfortable and annoying thing to endure, given the way it was probably contracted (if it was, this is, again, just a guess -- impossible to do better at a distance and without visuals to help confirm) it could have been a lot worse. Then again, you'd do well to continue to be re-checked for at least six months to be certain there's nothing else waiting to bloom.   Because of the diversity of symptoms you describe, it is possible you also have some localized bacterial infection not normally classified as venereal. The Cipro would seem a good choice overall to cover the most possible bases, and I can't imagine why taking an antibiotic would cause an increase in pain in the locus of the infection, but it may be coincidental.   Please do stay in touch with us here and keep us updated. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

There are several potential causes of this including a urinary tract infection, worsening diabetes that now has high blood sugars and sugar spilling into the urine, or a condition called diabetes insipidus where the kidney is not reabsorbing water properly.  The other possibility is that you may now be experiencing a side effect of your medications (or an interaction between some of your medicines).  There are less severe causes but this needs to be evaluated further since some of these conditions can be dangerous if not treated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds like, in the first instance (your feet) a contact dermatitis, and in the second (your hand), a different sort of allergic (probably contact) reaction called angioneurotic edema. Neither, so far as I am aware, could have any relationship to a prostate problem. You've most likely come into contact with something to which you're allergic, although sometimes an autoimmune response can cause the same sort of thing to occur spontaneously. If you should experience another episode similar to what took place in your hand, you might  try Benadryl (don't plan on doing much, as it can make you very drowsy). If it makes the swelling and itching go away then it's definitely an  allergic problem and the trick will be in figuring out just what you've come into contact with. This can be quite a challenge, as sometimes the thing never repeats itself.   Good luck to you and again, I very much doubt there is any relationship between these incidents and a problem with your prostate.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While you are no doubt experiencing some sensation in your abdomen, and it may in fact involve your bladder repairs, the bladder doesn't have enough urethral \"tether\" to permit it to drift that far up, not to mention the gravitational pull downward of the organ even when it is not holding water. So no, it seems to me physically impossible for this to have happened. However, just like referred pain, other sensations may also be referred and you may actually be \"feeling\" your bladder in an area where it is  not.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  While it's impossible to know the true score from a distance, there are a couple observations that can be made with relative certainty regarding your problem. First, a lump such as you describe shouldn't be left to just go away. While the fact that it's painful coupled with the history of vasectomy and reversal suggest it is benign, we can't just guess about things like that. The fact that it's not near the epididymis doesn't necessarily eliminate it from that loop, but it also leaves it suspicious because it's at  some distance. See a urologist at once and rule out (or in, as the case may be) anything serious. Never leave something like this to resolve by itself.   The hernia (or non-hernia, depending upon whom you believe) doesn't sound like  it is related at all, but it is probably a lymph node that's being felt. This could be checked also, but it sounds rather innocent. The other thing probably is too, but that doesn't mean it can safely be left alone.  Good luck to you and please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Spermatoceles really aren't very serious at all. There are alternate routes for sperm to pass the blockage, even if there are some dead sperm at the blockage. Surgery to relieve the blockage is usually not recommened because a) it's not really necessary and b) because it can actually damage the vas deferens, to no good effect.  The cyst should not get much bigger than it is, and weight training shouldn't bother it either, but I can't (since you asked) recommend penis enlargement pills, because most don't do anything (except put your money in someone else's pocket) and a few can actually do damage to the structure. I'm sure you don't want that.   I hope this is all helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Large painful lump in penis",
    "content": "Dear Doctor,   I have a fairly large (nickel sized), hard lump deep in the penis.  It is located approximately half way along the length, and stays hard and visible while the penis is flaccid.  During an erection, it constricts the flow of blood such that the end half doesn't become fully erect, making it look somewhat deformed.  It's as if there is a girdle around it that keeps it from becoming erect past the lump location.  The lump is somewhat painful to the touch when flaccid, but more painful when erect.    I previously had a small lump under the corona that was similar, with similar characteristics, and a urologist diagnosed it as a form of Peyronie's, but the occurrance of this second, larger and more painful lump in a different location leads me to believe that the diagnosis was a shot in the dark.  The urologist took no tests other than feeling the shape and nature of it.  I am concerned now, because I can't obtain an erection without pain and deformity, and I don't know whether it may be a form of cancer--the lump is getting larger, more solid, and more painful over time.  It does not restrict the flow of urine, but has nearly cut off the blood for an erection.  It is more on the dorsal side, by the way.    I hope you might make a suggestion if the condition has occurred with other patients.  I am a bit leary of going back to the same medical center because of the lack of successful treatment from the last lump--the treatment I received was injections into the lump that were supposed to soften it over time, but it resulted in a loss of sensation and difficulty in obtaining any arousal at all.    Thank you for your time, and I look forward to your response.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Large painful lump in penis",
    "content": "Hello -  I think the first urologist diagnosed your earlier lesion correctly. What you describe this time is classic for Peyronie's disease, which is a poorly understood but benign problem which, as I'm sure I needn't tell you, can be painful in more ways than just physically. Generally it is suggested to wait a year or so before considering surgery, since the disease will sometimes stabilize or even resolve in that time. There are also some experimental treatments, such as oral vitamin E (which, taken in reasonable doses can't do any harm and could possibly help), and a few other involving  injections of various known drugs or substances, but these are of unproven effectiveness. Many affected men are willing to try these while  waiting for surgery, because of the discomfort and generally disruptive nature of the disease. Injection of steroids is not recommended because of unwonted side effects and the possibility of damage to tissues in the area.   There isn't too much more I'm aware of which I can tell you. The disease may be inherited in some  instances, and some sufferers may also develop similar plaques in other parts of the body (mostly the hands, I believe). Getting counseling on how to cope with and accomodate the problem is often helpful.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please let us know how things are going.\n\n",

The question here is why you are having to get up so often during the night to urinate, and of course two things immediately suggest themselves: one is a simple urinary infection. The other is possible early-onset of diabetes (which seems less likely for sure, but may need to be ruled out). The repeated erections can certainly cause soreness in the penis but again the question is: why such frequent  urinary urges at night? I'd strongly suggest seeing a doctor about this, not so much for the soreness (although that could also be a product of a UTI), but to find out why you're having to go so often.

It also could be an immune response to the intrusion of the circumcision, even though it is not directly in the area of trauma. These things are not unusual and  can sometimes be dermal cysts. Give it a while  to go away, since you're still in healing mode. If it remains and especially if it gets larger, painful, or changes in appearance, then by all means have it checked by a doctor.

My lips had swollen up and my vagina ached like crazy..and it still does now. I looked at it closely and it seemed as though i had cut the skin..and this is what was causing the burning.. i didnt know what to do so i went out and bought some vagisil and i have been using that for 4 days now. However in the last couple of days i have found that there are 4-5 little spots growing on my lips.They arnt tiny spots but they are of moderate size..and they scare me because i don't know what they are or how to treat them.   im incredibly scared and in a hell of a lot of pain..i cant sleep at night because the pain is that bad and yesterday  during the day i found blood in my knickers. i don't know where this blood came from as i had only just come off my period and i know that it wasnt a period.

    "content": "Hello, There is no real risk to your health here unless it is interfering with your life in other ways.  You should be sure to have clean hands and use water-based lubricants to avoid soreness if the area is too dry.  Sometimes you will notice some size variation but it would not be caused by this activity and should not be of concern.    If you do develop an infection, either urinary or yeast, you should get treatment.  For yeast you can get over-the-counter anti-fungal creams.  Yeast has an odor, white, cheesy discharge and sometimes pain and/or itching.  Urinary tract infections occur when bacteria enter the urethra (close proximity to these areas) and usually present with urgency to void frequently and pain with urination.  It may require antibiotic treatment.  Don't worry too much about doing harm.  As long as you are gentle with yourself and don't use sharp objects, you should be fine and it will not hurt your uterus.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi David_1988,  This is a relatively common issue for uncircumcised men.  While the tight foreskin itself isn't really a major issue there are some dangers to this.  Specifically, there is the possibility that the foreskin may slip behind the head of the penis and become trapped cutting off blood flow.  If this occurs it requires urgent circumcision to solve the issue.  There are basically two treatments that I am aware of that have been shown successful.  The first is circumcision.  This resolves the issue by removing the foreskin.  For most older men, a circumcision is not really a favorite choice.  So, there is another treatment that may help.  It involves using a very strong topical steroid cream (not the type of steroids that make a persons muscles grow).   This cream is applied twice a day for about a month to the tip of the foreskin.  Basically it takes advantage of the skin thinning effects of strong steroids.  During this time the foreskin is gently pulled back to help stretch the skin several times a day.  Often, over the course of the month the skin will loosen sufficiently to resolve the tightness and take away the risk of the foreskin getting trapped.  These steroid creams are available by prescription only so you'll need to see your doctor.  You may need to suggest this treatment if needed as it is still somewhat new and not well known.  I have used this method with several of my patients and had very good success.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "hey,  I too had the same problem. I went to the doctors and basically was told they would not offer anything because i can pull it back when not errect so i can clean normally behind it and doesnt cause me pain.  Also i mentioned the steroid cream that the doctors on here mentioned but he said that is not common practice here in the UK  not sure where you are based?  So basically if you can clean under it (which should be done daily) and doesnt cause pain while intercourse they probably wont do anything for you, but go get checked out anyway. I was scared to go to the doctors at first but honestly it was fine its not as rare as your prob think\n\n",

Even if you have stopped the medication, it is possible it is a lingering effect that will resolve on its own.    Be careful with the steroid creams (cortisone) as these should only be used sparingly.  A rich ointment such as lanolin might help (purified form such as Lansinoh, often used by breastfeeding moms for sore nipples).  Definitely talk to the dermatologist about it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 24 year-old male currently living in China. I have recently broken up with my girlfriend of one year and thus have been sexually inactive for two months. Whilst with my girlfriend I did not sleep with anyone else.   About three weeks ago a small red mark appeared on the base of my glans. It's maybe a centimeter across and shiny to the point that it looks as if it's leaking clear fluid if in strong light (it's not leaking anything, however). Every two or three days it becomes very pale to the point where I have been fooled into thinking it's going to disappear. However, a layer of dry skin simply comes off in the shower, revealing the red, shiny skin underneath again.   It doesn't appear to be getting any bigger, it is completely painless, and it is not raised at all. Masturbation seems to make the dry skin flake off more quickly. It has been there for nearly a month now and is a considerable source of anxiety, however.   I have not been to the doctor's yet because, frankly, I distrust Chinese doctors after past misdiagnoses for unrelated illnesses, and privacy is also a real issue here. I would have to explain the situation through a translator and it is rare to see a doctor in a closed, private room, so I am very reluctant to go to the hospital with this unless absolutely necessary.   I am currently taking two caplets of minocycline daily, for the treatment of acne. My penis has been circumcised for around three years; prior to this I also had a frenuloplasty due to the foreskin being too tight.\n\n",

There are also many times something seems abnormal which in fact is quite normal but you would have to be seen by a doctor to be absolutely certain it is nothing.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Coolio,  In severe cases, there may be some surgical corrective procedures that can be done to straighten the penis.  However, the curvature would need to be quite severe and interfering with function.  To my knowledge, short of surgery, I am not aware of any other corrective methods.  This certainly does not mean that there aren't any other treatments options, though, only that I don't know them.  Penile curvature is actually quite common and nearly always ends up allowing normal functioning.  If you are concerned that there may be problems with functioning I would recommend you discuss this with your primary care doctor.  If needed, a urologist would be the specialist to see.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello OhioStateBuckeyes,  In general, with epididymitis, sexual contact should be avoided during the episode because most of these are caused by an STD.  The abstinence is suggested due to risk of passing the infection.  In addition, ejaculation may be painful due to inflammation of the epididymus.  There are more causes of epididymitis than just STD's.  You are correct that UTI's can cause epididymitis.  If your urine has not been evaluated for an infection this would be a good idea.  Continued follow up with your doctor is important to help determine the cause.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It started with a few barely noticeable skin colored bumps but  has gone from a smooth to a wrinkled, crackled, blotchy irritated appearance.  It doesn't itch, hurt or burn but psychologically its killing me.  I have been tested for the whole std lineup about 9 months ago b/c of a yellowish white discharge.  They gave me two abx in the office but my results came back negative on everything.  I have been to two doctors since( dermatologist and urologist ) because of the unhealthy appearance.  They both said there was nothing to worry about but it has become worse since then.  I remembered my ex girlfriend, who I had just started dating when all this started, said she was prone to yeast infections.  I thought maybe I had balanitis as a result of being with her. I started applying lotrimin a week and a half ago and has seen a slight improvement.  If this is the issue, how long should it take before I'm back to normal.  Please...., any help on this issue would be greatly appreciated!!  This is destroying me in what I feel like is the prime of my life....\n\n",

Treatment should be continued until about a week after the rash has resolved.  If the rash isn't improving after 2 weeks I would suggest you follow up with your doctor for a re-evaluation.  There are other possibilities so if the treatment for a fungal infection is not improving seeing your doctor again for a re-evaluation is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 24 yrs old and am 22 weeks pregnant with my 3rd baby.  I am having severe pains in the ribs on the right side.  It goes into my back and side area as well.   This pain is unbearable sometimes. So I went to my OB and told him about it and he thinks I have a kidney stone. One night the  pain suddenly dropped to my lower tummy side area.  He thinks the pain that suddenly went from up high to down low was the stone dropping from my kidneys into my ureteros.  He gave me pain medicine and told me to drink ALOT of fluids and I should pass it.  Well this was a couple weeks ago and I still haven't passed it.  I was hurting really bad one night last week and went to the hospital and they did a one scan xray to try and find it and didn't find anything.  He said after I have the baby they can do a CT scan and find them if I haven't passed them but I'm wondering if this is really a kidney stone.  Last week I spent 3 days throwing up.  And when I start hurting bad with this I get nauseaus.  I am taking darvacet and demerol for the pain.  Most of the time if i take the 2 together the pain will go away but sometimes it won't. It was just hurting me at night but it has started hurting me earlier and earlier in the day now. My urine tests they have done came back fine.  I'm concerned because of the pain meds I'm having to take while pregnant and I don't want to become addicted to them.  What do u think?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your symptoms are consistent with a kidney stone.  I suppose it could be something else like gall bladder as well.  I imagine your doctor has considered all the possibilities.  Sometimes blood work helps to diagnose a kidney stone (uric acid or excess calcium) or a 24 hour urine collection test to see if you have excess stone-forming minerals but a regular urinalysis could look normal.  Pain medications are considered safe in pregnancy when they are needed.  I understand your concern about addiction though.  I'm sure your doctor feels you will get past the point of needing them before dependence occurs.  I know this is a very painful and frustrating thing to have to just wait it out.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Doctor,  I did read the other post titled \"broken penis\", but my case sounds a little different so i figured I'd ask. During intercourse about a year ago, my girlfriend accidentally pulled my erect penis to hard in a downward motion. At which point we heard a light cracking/popping sound, but i experienced no pain what so ever. Because of the lack of pain we continued with no problems. I didn't experience any pain or bruising at any point, and everything appeared normal. A while after the incident (4-5 months later) I noticed that it has began to curve a little bit and began to experience minor pain on the left side of my penis at the base, right where it enters the body, and on my left testicle. I went to the urologist and he said my pain was caused by a swollen vein, and it could be corrected with surgery if it continued to bother me, but was not essential. However, i did not mention what happened earlier with my girlfriend. So, that explains the pain, but not the curvature.  Note that I am note that i am 19 years old, so it might be possible that it has just naturally begun to curve. I just want to know if the curve in my penis could have been caused by the incident with my girlfriend, and if it could have also caused the swollen vein. Also, if there is anything i should about the situation.  Thanks, Colbi R.\n\n",

The medications have usage instructions included.  If this doesn't help I would suggest you talk with your doctor about this the next time you are in for a check up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Earlier in the week, I was feeling fine.  Suddenly I had excutiating pain in my left flank which felt exactly like prior kidney stones. I have been diagnosed with I think it is called Spongy Kidney, where I had multiple stones in each kidney.  Being 28 weeks pregnant I called my OB GYN and he sent me to the hospital.  He did an Ultra sound and Urine test.  The Urine test came back positive for blood but no infection.  The ultrasound said that there was not any stones.  I still have pain in my urethra, pain with peeing, peeing quite frequently to the point that I cannot sleep.  They tested my urine again today and once again there was blood but no bacteria.  I am concerned because of the pain and frequent urination, but he is not.  He said to watch my temperature and call him if it gets worse.  He has not even seen me in person.   Am I being overly concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Snocat247,  Urine tested by dipstick may occasionally miss an infection but in an adult this is less likely.  This can be tested for by doing a urine culture.    Your symptoms initially made me think of a kidney stone.  Ultrasounds can pick up some kidney stones but not all.  The better test is a CT scan; however, in pregnancy this should be avoided.  If you are having persistent blood in your urine, a kidney stone is a possibility.    If your symptoms persist you may want to consider seeing a urologist (bladder/urinary tract specialist) for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm not sure exactly what this is; however, from what you are describing about the only thing I can possibly come up with is a nerve problem.  Perhaps there is a nerve in your lower back that is somehow being compressed or irritated from the musculature relaxing during urination or the continued motion of walking.  It may be helpful to have some imaging of the pelvis such as an MRI.  I would also consider seeing a neurologist for further evaluation of this issue.  The other possible avenue would be to see a urologist.  I'm honestly fairly stumped on this.  When you find the cause, will you please update our forum so we can all learn?  Best wishes.\n\n",

And if it were urological, wouldn't I have any other urinary problems? I don't. Unless there is some vein or nerve that runs alongside my bladder....I still think it is a leg problem, as more and more I feel it when I stand up in the morning and when walking around. It is very localize--I can put my finger directly on the spot. So I suppose imaging is the way to go. The problem is that I can only afford very high-deductible health insurance, and MRIs and ultrasounds are expensive. I was hoping there might be a less expensive diagnostic tool.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Pita3,  There are several reasons for blood to appear in the urine.  If there is some vaginal bleeding for any reason that is not sufficiently cleaned it can lead to detectable blood in the urine.  An infection of the kidneys or bladder (either viral or bacterial) can also cause this.  Kidney stones can do this also.  There are really a countless number of things that can cause hematuria (blood in the urine).  The best thing to do is retest the urine again in a day or two.  If it continues with blood it may be appropriate to do some further testing.  If it resolves it is likely nothing to worry about.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is not particularly painful, just a moderate constant irritation. It feels  similar to a poorly inserted tampon. So far I haven't had any symptoms of a urinary tract infection. I'm wondering what is going on and do I need to see a doctor immediately or if I can wait until my annual exam which is scheduled in a week? Should I stay off the bike in the meantime?\n\n",

I know the morphology is low but will my husband's high sperm count and motility help even out the low morphology?  I figured with that low of a morphology out of the 195.3 million sperm 7.8 million are of good quality.  Is that enough to get pregnant naturally?  We have only been trying to get pregnant for 2 months.  He was told to take 1000 mg of vitamin C, 400 IU of Vitamin E and a multi vitamin.  We will do another sperm analysis almost 3 weeks after the last one.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "The follow-up testing will help determine if the morphology abnormality is temporary or permanent so it is important not to worry prematurely.  Also, I wonder why you are having sperm analysis with only two months' efforts at pregnancy.  It is typical for it to take up to a year for a young, sexually active female, off birth control, to achieve pregnancy.  I'm not sure when this all became so scientific and planned.  Relaxing and letting nature take its course is a good plan.  Needless worry is known to have a detrimental affect on hormones.    As a rule, fertility specialists aren't needed until you have reached that point where natural pregnancy has not occurred in six months (for older mothers) to a year (in mothers younger than 35).  If everyone who achieved normal, healthy pregnancies had been previously analyzed, many would probably have been found to have some disturbing results.  But, when pregnancy occurs naturally, we never know what the condition of the sperm was.  Perhaps you have reason to be worried due to drug use, etc. but in the absence of that I would advise you to just relax and see what happens.  Becoming pregnant can be something of a nice surprise as well as a planned event.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They are also based on many false ideas of what a penis should be and have little relevance to how partners feel about it.  They are selling an illusion that bigger is better.  Even surgical techniques for cosmetic penis enlargement are not endorsed by  The American Urological Association, the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery and the American Society of Plastic Surgeons(ASPS).  In fact they have all issued policy statements against cosmetic surgical procedures to enhance the penis.  Perception is often the problem - you think you have a small penis, and assume that increasing the size will make you more sexually desirable.  Most likely your penis is within the normal size range \u2014 and even if it is smaller than average, it may not matter as much as you thought. Avoid time-consuming, expensive or dangerous techniques that may at best be only minimally effective. The most effective solution may be as easy as open communication with your partner, talking with a professional counselor or enhancing yourself in other ways.     Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ConfusedinCali,  Your pain may be do to a few things I can think of.  It may be that you have a compressed nerve that supplies the groin region causing your pain.  It may also be a condition called a torsed appendix testis.  This is when there is a small amount of testicular tissue that is outside the testis.  It typically has its own blood flow and can twist cutting off the blood flow.  When this happens it is extremely painful until the appendix testis dies and the pain stops.  I would have expected evidence of this to have been seen on a CT scan though.  Seeing a urologist is definitely an appropriate step to help determine what is causing your pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may also be some bruising that is causing your pain.  Testicular twisting (called testicular torsion) is actually a surgical emergency because the twisting cuts off blood flow to the testis.  In six to eight hours the testis can become unrepairable if blood flow is not restored.  This condition is very, very painful so I doubt that this is what is going on in your case.

    "content": "Hi HawkIII,  This may be due to something pushing on the nerve supplying sensation to the penis and testis.  Possibilities include a hernia, muscle strain/tightness, or an enlarged lymph node.  It may also simply be some simple irritation of the nerve due to a previous (even unnoticed) injury.  Seeing your doctor is a good idea to see if there is a treatment to help this resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a healthy 19 year old male.  I lift weights and body build.  Recently, I have noticed that I get a pain in my right testicle.  It mostly starts to ache after I ejaculate.  However, sometimes when I wear tight underwear or sit a certain way it starts to ache.  I have never had a problem with this and don't have a family history of this.    I also got my wisdom teeth pulled about 5 months ago.  I was taking a lot of anti botics and I'm not sure if it was mentally or not but the pain seemed to disappear.  So I started to think that I might of had some kind of infection that was cured by the anti botics but the pain is now back.  What is going on?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "If you had infection that was treated by the antibiotics, I would not expect the pain to return but it is possible if it was not an effective dose or the right medication.  There are other conditions that can cause pain so if this continues you should have it checked by your family doctor or urologist.  It is possible there could be some anatomical concern, such as a vessel twisting, or it could be caused by a sexually transmitted disease.  In either of these cases a doctor is needed.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Frostkman,  I'm not certain what would be causing this pain.  Perhaps you have a strained muscle or some inflammation of the spongy part of the penis that fills with blood to cause an erection.  I would expect that both these would present with pain before ejaculation though.  Given that the pain starts after ejaculation it makes me wonder if you have some inflammation of the urethra or the vessels that carry semen.  If this were the case, the pain may be triggered by the semen flowing through the vessels.  This type of inflammation is commonly caused by STD's but it can also be caused by various viral infections as well.  If this pain continues I would recommend you see a urologist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the past few months I've visited my Campus Health Center because of some burning with urination.  They gave me some antibiotics that seemed to do the trick the first time.  When the burning came back, I went back, and they gave me some more antibiotics. It wasn't really cut and dry like the first time, the problem lingered and eventually faded away. Apparently my first urine culture was negative.     Now I have a very different sensation with urination - to the point it is almost orgasmic. I feel normal urination at first, but then it climaxes when I finish, almost like ejaculation is following urination.  What concerns me is a white, semen-like substance that secretes following the feeling, with a red tint to it.  It almost appears that it is semen mixed with blood.  For a few days prior to this I've felt a tingle below my rectum after urination, which I believe is the prostate?    So... what's going on?  I'm reluctant to bother to go back to the health center, but certainly will.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi va2ny2ca, Hypertension can certainly have an influence on erectile dysfunction as can many other conditions, diabetes, arteriosclerosis, certain medications, alcohol and drug use, etc. Elimination of causative factors will identify whether this is a longstanding problem. It would be impossible to say your condition is or is not permanent and the best recommendation is a physical exam by your physician. Generally speaking, especially at 34, elimination of known causative factors can improve overall health. If you have been so diligent otherwise regarding your health, it would be beneficial to you to take measures to decrease your blood pressure levels and limit your alcohol intake to more moderate levels if not abstaining altogether. However, since you drink 4-5 drinks per day, and have for quite sometime, I would strongly suggest that you discuss this with your physician as well as there may be an issue with alcohol withdrawl. Appropriate measures concerning this can also be initiated. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sean,  Swelling such as you are describing may be due to edema (basically water leaking into the soft tissue).  Edema tends to settle in more gravity dependent areas such as the scrotum in men.  Often, this will develop because the albumin level in the blood (one of the blood proteins) is low.  This can occur in several conditions.  Conditions that lead to a rapid development of edema are often related to loss of albumin in the urine (usually due to a kidney problem filtering too much albumin or not reabsorbing enough).  i would recommend you see your primary care doctor for some screening labs to check your albumin level and kidney function.  Your liver function should also be evaluated.  Your primary care doctor can also evaluate to see if this really is edema or something else.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Markomary,  Urine infections can cause back pain but it would be a little unusual for the pain to be only with running or standing.  You may want to see your doctor for an evaluation.  Sometimes a slight difference in leg lengths can be the underlying cause of this type of pain.  Pulled muscles and slight twists in the spine are common causes as well.    The urine issues may or may not be related.  One possible way to connect the two would be that there are some nerves in the spine being pressed upon causing the pain and causing bladder function problems.  This often will be accompanied by loss of sensation of the skin of the inner thighs/groin area (in a saddle distribution).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "40yr old female, period lasted 30 days, after all the tests my body has no desire to pee.  My tests were fine, ultra sound, pap, endo biopsy, blood work were all normal.    I know your not an obgyn, but is there a connection, I had heavy period & then 1/2 way through I got heavy bleeding, & pain between my belly button & hip,   If I push really really hard, I can pass a few drops.  I finally peed a little today after 2 days, I'm wondering if I should be searching out a cause or just wait & see if things normalize.  I do have an appointment with my family dr. but i  don't know what really to ask, I don't have pain   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Problems101,  I would suggest you see a urologist about this.  Seeing your regular doctor is still a good idea.  Being unable to urinate can lead to pressure on the kidneys and other problems.  If the inability to urinate persists for more than a day you may need to use urinary catheterization to relieve the pressure.  When you see your doctor it may be a good idea to ask about having your electrolytes and kidney function checked to make sure everything is OK.  I am a little suspicious your issues may be due to underlying endometriosis.  Follow up with your gynecologist can help evaluate for this also.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If the office put you off and the doctor wanted to see you in three days, I would call the doctor back, ask to have him return your call (as opposed to speaking with the receptionist) and let him know they could not accommodate his wishes.  He may feel it is more urgent than the staff is aware about. If so, he will arrange for you to get an appointment.  If it is not so urgent, he will let you know that too.

    "content": "(40 yr old woman) it was a bad day for me, my family physician, wanted another internal ultrasound but I haven't voided in a few days, to do the test they told me to drink 40 oz of water,  I reminded them of my problem & they said to do it.    So I did & I was so full I couldn't stand up & walk to the car. I was sick.  Lucky for me this ultrasound was suppose to take place in the same building as my new urologist.   I needed to drop off my in/out chart so I went to do that first & doubled over in pain,  I started crying & asked to see my dr.   He took me & had me immediately catherized.  He got a quart & we emptied 3 of the leg bags of urine out of me.    My in/out chart was only for 1 1/2 day but my water intake was 3407ml /640 ml out  so now I wear a bag, we're still in search for the cause. My blood work, ultrasounds are all normal, he even took xrays of my back to see if something happened there.  How do people determine when the bag isn't necessary any more?  I know I need it now,but I'm hoping not for forever.   He's thinking part of the problem is due to when i was a child I didn't use the school bathroom & have kind of trained myself to hold it.  The last few months, I've had problems with my menstrual cycle, & considered female issues & started a college class -- could stress be a cause? my blood pressure was 162 over108. so now I'm on blood pressure pills.  Diane  Thanks  D\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane,  Learned voiding avoidance may cause increasing volumes of urine in the bladder.  However, learned avoidance should not prevent voiding when the bladder is extremely full as you are describing.  If you are physically unable to void I would be strongly concerned that there is an obstruction of the urethra or possibly a nerve or muscle problem not allowing the bladder to contract.  I would recommend that you continue to follow up with your urologist for further evaluation and testing.  Regarding knowing when to stop the bag collection is often a bit of trial and error.  After a certain period of time the catheter is removed and voiding is assessed to see if you can void without it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane,  Bladder catheterization can be a bit tricky at first.  The most common reason for failure is actually not getting the catheter in the urethra.  The bladder can easily slip down and along the top of the vaginal opening.  When self-cathing this is less likely to occur since one would be able to feel this.  The other possible reason for not getting urine return is to not insert the catheter far enough so the catheter stays in the urethra and doesn't enter the bladder.  In women, the urethra is typically around 1-2 inches.  The catheter needs to be inserted at least this length to get urine return often times.  One other thing would be to flush the catheter and make sure it is open.    It may be, though, that your bladder is empty when you cath.  If you had to urinate after the catheterization it may be that you had a small urine pocket that was moved after the catheterization.  If there is still concern, I would recommend you contact your urologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane,  From what you are describing the test you were having may have been a test called a  VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram).  This is a test where they put a dye into the bladder and using x-ray take pictures to help determine if there are blockages.  If x-ray was not used it may have been a test to measure bladder pressures and residual volumes.  Urinary retention can certainly cause abdominal pain.  If the bladder is distended it can cause pain.    I'm sorry that the visit was so unpleasant for you.  Follow up with the urologist really is important to help determine why you are having urinary retention.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doctors,  I think I posted on these boards around mid july regarding this problem. I am a 22yrs old male, who has been experiencing a frequent urge to urinate (around 5mins after ive been to the toilet) and feeling thirsty. Coupled with this, I cannot get a 100% erection since this problem began - its always around 80-90% never full. I consulted my family doctor who first diagnosed me with a UTI.  I went through a course of 2 different antibiotics and after my urine sample was sent to the lab - my doctor discovered I didnt have a UTI at all. He then checked my blood sugar recently for diabetes and it came back all clear for that too. Owing to the erection problem - I wanted to clarify I am still a virgin. So I found this very puzzling as to whats going on.  My Doctor has dismissed my case and says I probably have an irritable bladder and that I should learn to live with it (which made me very angry) - but this doesnt answer why I cannot get a full erection and why I am still getting the urge to have to urinate/get thirsty.  Im stuck at the moment and do not know which way to turn. What advice could you give me now Doctor? STD's/Diabetes and UTI have been ruled out. I am baffled as to what else it could be - any ideas what it could be and what I should do next?  Thank you very much Razz\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Razz85,  When I hear of someone being very thirsty and having to urinate a lot there are a few things that come to mind as things that \"can't be missed\" on my list.  First is diabetes mellitus (insulin and sugar kind).  If this is not present the next question is is there a problem with water regulation such as with diabetes insipidus (DI).  DI can have two forms.  It may be central in that the brain may not be making antidiuretic hormone (ADH, the hormone that controls water retention) or it may be peripheral in that the kidneys may not respond to the ADH.  The tipoff to DI is that the water intake and urine outputs are very, very high.  Some of my patients with DI have been drinking seven or eight liters of water a day with similar urination amounts.  If your urine is particularly diluted this would also be a tipoff.    With your difficulties with erections and the need to urinate so soon after urination you may also have a problem with your prostate.  The prostate may be blocking your urethra some so that you can't fully empty your bladder, causing you to need to urinate shortly after prior urinations.  Usually, in this case, the thirst is not increased, though.  I would recommend you consider seeing a urologist as a starting place.  The erection issue may or may not be related to the thirst and urination.  The urologist can help sort this out.  Also, your primary doctor should be able to do some screening tests for DI and a few of the other water retention problems.  If there is some concern or uncertainty about how to do this seeing an endocrinologist would be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have just discovered a reddish (slightly brighter in color than the surrounding area) lesion at the tip of my penis just within the opening of my urinal tract. The lump/lesion is slightly concealed as it is inside the opening and can only be seen properly when spreading the opening. Therefore it is hard for me to say how long it has been there as it can be hard to notice it. The lump/lesion is soft, raised and approximately 3mm in diameter.   It is painless, doesn\u2019t itch and does not hurt when I urinate.   I don\u2019t know whether it is an STD or not. I have not had sex for more than 2 months and in the last 1.5-2 years I have had sex with only 2 partners. Could it be genital warts? As far as I know my previous partner does not have genital warts, however I do have a wart on my hand \u2013 is it possible for a wart to be contracted from hand to penis?   I am very worried about this, and any advice as to what it might be or possible treatments will be greatly appreciated.   Thankyou very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pscholes,   There are a few possibilities regarding this.  This lump may be an area of irritation from excess moisture, etc.  It may also be a lump related to an STD.  Commonly STD's are asymptomatic in men so if STD's are possible I always recommend testing.  Unfortunately without an exam I really can't give you much of a definite answer.  I would recommend you see your doctor about this.  Regarding the transmission of the virus from a hand wart to the genitals this doesn't occur.  Warts are caused by a virus called human papilloma virus (HPV).  There are over 100 different strains of HPV.  The strains that cause warts on the hands (generally type 1 and 2) do not cause genital warts (which are most commonly caused by types 6 and 11).  It is possible to be infected with more than one strain of HPV, though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am a 22 year old male.  When I urinate, 99% of the time the stream will split.  Sometimes it is the main stream accompanied by a drip, most of the time it is split into two streams, and sometimes it gets real bad and sprays the whole toilet.  It seems to be worse when the pressure is not that strong, so if i have to go REAL bad it is usually a single stream until the end when the urine pressure begins to subside.  I have had this problem for years now.  Sometimes my urethra \"itches\" deep inside and occasionally I notice a slight discharge dried up at the tip, but it could just be normal fluids.   If I did contract an STD it would have been over three years ago, and although I remember slight burning while urinating for a while after that sexual encounter, it did not persist.  Sometimes it does sting now, usually in the morning, but nothing too bad.    Could I have some kind of infection that would cause these symptoms for years without either progressing or dieing off? Could it be prostate issues at 22? Or possibly scarring inside my urethra from over self stimulation using harsh lubricants in my younger days?  I do remember once having a raw spot which turned into a scab on the very tip of the urethra after using inappropriate lubrication probably contained alcohol among other things.  But as far as I can tell there is no damage inside, atleast as far down as I can see.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Split urine stream ALL the time.",
    "content": "Hi Mattp,  A split urine stream would usually indicate some form of an obstruction near the end of the urethra.  Problems further up, such as near the prostate, would not be expected to cause such a splitting.  Basically, you can think of this as a garden hose.    An obstruction in the middle of the hose doesn't cause a split stream because the water has the remainder of the hose to reform into one stream but putting your finger on the end can split the stream.  I would suggest you see a urologist.  This way you can have a full evaluation of your symptoms.  It may be that they need to use a tiny camera to actually look at the urethra and see if there are any obstruction or adhesions that are dividing the urethra into two channels.  An STD is a possibility but this would not be typical for them.  However, STD's can remain asymptomatic for years, especially in men, so I would suggest you be tested for STD's if there is any chance you may have one.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I saw a doctor about 7-8 months ago, he performed an exam, including physical examination and urine sample, but could find nothing.  I don't know if this is related, but it seems that after i have a wet dream, the pain does not come up for a day or two (i do not masterbate).  I have performed self-evaluations since then and have found no abnormalities to my knowledge.  Please reply with any and all possible answers.  I have done alot of research online, but cannot find any answers.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Testicular Pain for Five Months",
    "content": "I am 22 years old.  Last April, I noticed that my both of my testicles had risen slightly, and I was experiencing pain in both of them.    I went to my doctor a few weeks later and he diagnosed it as epididymitis.  He put me on a week's worth of Doxycycline and called it good.  The antibiotics didn't do anything so I returned to my doctor the following week.  He then put me on a bactrim.  That didn't do anything either.  After coming back for a third time, he decided to send me to a urologist.  I had my appointment with him and he told that he \"couldn't feel anything out of the normal\".  He sent me to a radiologist to have a testicular ultrasound to get a better understanding of what was going on.  Nothing could be determined from that either.  I set up an appointment with a different urologist and basically went through the whole process of there being nothing wrong yet again.  So for the past five months or so, my testicles have been slightly raised and hurt quite regularly.  The right one seems to cause more pain in particular, but sometimes it's just the left one and sometimes it's both.  I can't really pinpoint anything that triggers the pain.  It seems totally random.  I'm completely lost.  My testicles used to hang very loosely in my scrotum, and that hasn't been the case for five months.  I'm not imagining the pain either.  I know this isn't just in my head.  I've read some very similar stories(practically identical) of people going through the exact same thing as I am, yet all of the doctors I have been to were totally in the dark on what might be going on.  So, I guess my question is, do you have any idea what could be causing this?  Anything that the doctors I've been to may have overlooked?  Is there any information you could provide me with that might help me out?  Any ideas that I might present to one of my doctors?     Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

You may want to talk with your doctor about having some imaging (such as a CT scan or MRI) of the pelvis and testes.  These images give much more detail than an ultrasound and may give you more information.  If it doesn't seem that anything is going on with your testes my only other thought would be that there may be something in the pelvis pulling the testes up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I've got a bit of a concern that's been bugging me a while now, hope you can shed some light on this issue.  About me: 27 yrs old male, good physical condition, pretty fit. I smoke about 10-20 cigarettes (per week) want to quit.   I've noticed over the last couple of years that my bladder capacity has dropped quite a lot. I would reckon that 200mls is the average void for me (only going when I have to). There is no pain, or anything when I pass urine, the strength of the flow does vary sometimes though.  I am definate that I used to have a much stronger and bigger bladder.  Normally bathroom trips are about every 2-3 hours, however drinking a lot of alcohol, caffeine or water means repeated trips, which is pretty embarrasing.  Sometimes I think that because I think about it a lot, I want to go. It's a bit of a mental circle.  Is there a way to improve bladder capacity? Or is there some sort of underlying condition like prostate or bladder problems?  NOTE: I have seen my doctor about this, but apparently these problems are uncommon in young men. I had urinary tests, on the first reading there were signs of microscopic hematuria, which they sent off for further investigation, but the microbiology report gave it the all clear.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 53 y.o. WM with an erection problem that began thusly:   3 months ago, about 6 hours after vigorous intercourse with my wife, I experienced a sudden lancinating pain that started in my perineum and traveled down the length of my penis. This lasted only about 15 to 30 seconds, then stopped. Since that time, when sexually aroused, my penis will get erect, but only about 2/3 of its length. The distal 1/3 including the glans will remain flaccid. There is a slight upward curvature of the distal 1/3 that was not previously present. I can achieve orgasm, though it is more difficult to do so. I have no pain, there is no discharge nor lesions. I should mention that I have had 2 episodes of prostatitis about 10 years ago that resulted in a hospitalization, and a left varicocele, otherwise healthy. No family history of note. Current meds are ECASA 81mg qd and a multivitamin qd. Thank you for your time, and yes, I am a medical professional.\n\n",

The doctor elected to allow me to drain and self-close instead of re-closing the incision.   Scar tissue developed in the open wound (3cm in dia)as it was closing. The epididymis (which at the time was swollen for another reason)tethered to the scar tissue. Additonally, the skin of the scrotal is now adhered to the scrotal sac.   Now, after a few hours each and every day, my epididymis and/or testes throbs. At night I have to sit still with my legs apart and wait for the throbbing to go away.   Doctor recommended Motrin and then a steroid product. He also suggest I try to pull apart the scar tissue (very lightly). If those did not work, a simple surgery would \"clip\" the epididymis free.   Seems to me the drugs are simply covering up the problem.   What are the risks of my present situation? What should be my next step?\n\n",

I think that  these abnormal activities must have caused this condition for me.And not consulting doctor over the years would have worsned the problem.Urine test didnt show any infection .I didnt have any urinary problems in the childhood .Otherwise, i am healthy and play sports as well. I havent been diagnosed relating to this before.Nobody from my family has had such problem. Please guide me as to how i can overcome my condition and become normal  again. thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 16 year old male and has just had a biopsy done yesterday on a black spot right near the tip of the penis. In order to stop the bleeding, the doctor put in place 3 sutures and a haemostasis chemical. Though it has only been a day, I have noticed that there is blood seeping out of the site at an extremely slow rate (you cannot see the blood, but if you press a tissue against it, you can see a red mark about the size of the wound). Can anyone tell me if this is normal, and if so, how long it would take for the scab tissue to properly form? Also, I've noticed some pain during occasional nocturnal erections, might it prevent the proper healing of the wound (or even break the sutures)? If so, what should I do to minimize the risk? Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ppmanppdan,  This may simply be due to varying levels of stimulation.  The size of the penis during erection is related to the amount of blood trapped in the spongy tissue of the penis.  This occurs because the outflow veins of the penis contract slowing blood exiting from the penis causing a \"backup\" of blood into the spongy tissue.  The amount of vessel contraction is variable and can be effected by arousal state.  I cannot tell you how to have this happen every time though.    Best wishes.\n\n",

It may also be that you have some skin pores that become clogged and resolve on their own.    Pearly Penile Papules often look like you are describing although they are less likely to come and go.   If there is ANY chance of an STD I always recommend testing to be sure.  These are often asymptomatic in men.  Your description doesn't really sound like an STD but its best to be sure.

    "content": "I am a 21 yr old male that just recently (July 13) went through a kidney transplant giving me a third kidney. Cause of the disease is unknown and termed chronic glomerulonephritis. It is believed to have been caused by strep throat.       For the last 2-3 months I have had a nephrostomy tube inserted into my kidney which should be coming out w/ in the next 2 weeks if all goes well with my nephrostogram on October 31.       Kidney problems have not generally been prone to my family, although my mother has been recently diagnosed with metastatic kidney cancer. Other than that there is no history of kidney problems, except some kidney stones in my great grandmothers older age (she lived off of well water which may have caused this).       My current medications include a blood thiner in the morning (baby aspirin). In the morning and at night  I take 3 blood pressure medications (Metoprolol 100 MG, Amlodipine 5 MG, and Clonodine .1MG), 2 Myfortic tablets of 360 MG/tablet(for anti rejection)(I was on Neoral for aprox. a month but they found it to be to toxic for my kidneys), Iron and Vitamin C (both for my hemoglobin levels). I have been on  Amoxicillin 500 MG twice a day for the last couple of months due to a strep infection attracted through my nephrostomy tube(but my last dose is tonight).  During the middle of the day I take 2 1MG tablets of Rapamune(for anti rejection), Valcyte 450 Mg (for the CMV virus which I acquired through my donor kidney), clonidine .1 MG, and an iron tablet. on Monday's, Wednesday's, and Friday's I take Bactrium as a regular antibiotic to counter act my low immune system. I also take 200 MG (I think) of Procrit for my low hemoglobin level due to the Valcyte and possibly the Bactrium.      Now finally to my problem. Recently I have become fit and able to move around freely enough to indulge in some sexual activities. I have noticed when I ejaculate before a date that my semen is not consistent like it use to be. There is the normal white milky part, but also I have noticed a hard gelatin like material in it. I can feel this material as it comes out, although it is not painful. There is no color to the material when it comes out, but if left to dry it changes to a clearish light tint of yellow. What could be my Problem, and what should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "1. 39 2. M 3. ~13 years uncontrolled diabetes hovering around 400 mg/dL. 4. no surgeries 5. no family history 6. Metformin.  Hi,  Diagnosed w/ Type 2 diabetes approx. 13 yrs. ago with relatively poor control hovering around 400 mg/dL.  Slight numbness at bottom of feet, hand and eye blurring and lastly, ED.    I no longer can get the kind of erection I used to.  I first realized I had erectile function when about a year ago, I was not able to get an erection to close the deal with a girl; dog gone it!  Anyway, at that time, the penis looked normal, flacid but just maybe 1/4 the length of a full erection; no distortion, etc.  Just looked like less inflated.  About 6 months ago, I started to see what look like possible damage to the mechanism of my penis; it started with the right side.  When I attempted to arouse myself, was it not only difficult to get it inflated, but the right side of the penis looked \"cutoff\" and the penis with some inflation, was bent towards the right.  It physically looked like the right side's inflation apparatus had been blocked.  Then about, a couple weeks later, the same thing happened to the left side.  Now, all I can do is create a less than quarter the size of when it was fully functional and the shaft area just below the \"head\" looks roped off.  From having skimed the web, it seems that the \"spongy\" material that is on the left and right side of the shaft and that gets filled with blood when aroused possibly is the culprit.  That's my diagnosis.  Do you think this is right?  And if so, are there medications or like that I can take to recover the damage caused to the inflatable \"bladders\"?  The 3 drugs touted to help ED I think does not help diabetics because the problem is not with blood flow but damage to the \"spongy\" material that makes the penis errect.  I remember I tried using Cialis? and it didn't do anything except make me feel some what uptight within my body.  If I were to get my diabetes under control, is it possible that the penis can naturally recover or am I condemned to live a celibate  life?  Also, possibly due to not being able to get an erection, it is almost impossible for me to ejaculate; is that a problem for me to produce children in the future.  For the sperm to be healthly, does one have to regulary ejaculate and create new sperm, etc.?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, im a 20 year old male. About 2 months ago I started noticing a little different type of burning when I start my stream while urinating.  I say little different because I've always had a little stinging when first starting because I had a surgery when I was like 5(?) to make the opening of my urethra bigger. Since then it's always burned a little bit.  So two months ago it started feeling different. I've never had sex without a condom more than a couple minutes with just a few girls.  I went to my family doctor about a month ago and they said they would do a swab thing to check for clamydia, and they gave me the shot to treat it that day and the two pills. When she stuck the swab in she said it was a little more difficult than usual to push in.  I went to the urologist and the one doctor said some bacteria may be piling up in there where the surgery was done, they both suggested just to drink a bunch of water and flush it out. They said they would take a look if it wasn't that. I have another appointment in about a month there,  It seems that urine leaks out a little bit for a little while after i urinate, and the same with ejaculation.  If im just sitting around it's a little bit uncomfortable mostly in the spot between the testicles and the anus, like right below the testicles. It feels like something is blocking something. Like if i do the flexing thing with my penis it kind of hurts right there.   Can you tell me what this could possibly be. Do I have anything to worry about as far as STD? I haven't had any type of withdrawl or changes down there. Only leaking of semen and urine afterwords. After sex it seems like my penis goes numb.  I'm taking a medication for acne called Minocylin(?)  Thank you\n\n",

What was more concerning was the CT scan showed \"mesenterica adenopathy\".  The ER doc just said to get another CT scan in 6 months and not to worry, but I am worried.  Are the swollen nodes just reactive to the kidney stones?  Is this common with a kidney stone?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mikes,  Mesenteric adenopathy is relatively common.  It can occur when fighting off a virus or other infection (generally of the GI tract).  If you are having no other symptoms it is reasonable to simply have a repeat scan in 6 months to see if things have resolved.  It is probably not related to your kidney stone.  Most likely, had you not had the stone you would not have found the mesenteric adenopathy.  Mesenteric adenopathy can cause pain that can occasionally mimic appendicitis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My urine flow decreases immediatly after I quit taking this medication, but I am able to relieve my bladder, although with a slight burning sensation. I do have a stream, but a week one. I have an appointment in December, and I have enough Cipro for 8 more days then my prescription runs out. Do my symptoms warrent continuing to take this medication?

Generally speaking blood in sperm is caused by either an inflammation of the prostate (bleeding at the begining of the ejaculate) or the seminal vesicles (bleeding at the end of the ejaculate).  The extent of trauma to these organs needs to be assessed to be sure and safe. Hopefully it would be nothing to worry about.  Good luck and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ws7678,  You may want to see a urologist about this.  There are a few possible things going on.  It may be that your testes/epididymus are bruised.  Ejaculation causes semen to move through these structures and can cause pain if there is inflammation.  It may also be that there is some scar tissue compressing the vas deferens leading to increased pressure on the testis/epididymus when ejaculation occurs.  The urologist will be best able to evaluate this and recommend treatment for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is sometimes several weeks (3-8) between his ejaculations, and he told me that he has had problems masturbating recently.  He has no problem keeping an erection, infact it will stay hard for hours at a time when we have sex.   He has told me that this is a problem he has been dealing with for 2 years, but has never been to see a doctor.  He has had no surgeries, and is no family history that I know of.  He takes no prescription, or over the counter meds.  He quit smoking cigaretts and that seemed to make things better, but now that he is smoking on a regular basis things are the same.  I was wondering if it could be the cigaretts or if it is the fact that he is a long-term weed smoker, or if there could be something else wrong?  He has told me that he has cut way back on the weed, but still does it. Should I insist that he go and see a urologist?  Any insight would be helpful.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "I am a male in my 20s.  About a year ago, my penis started having the 'hourglass deformity' while flacid.  It usually occurs when I am nervous or cold, and occurs along with a tight testicle sack.  Sometimes, I have a perfectly normal flacid penis.  The hourglass shape disappears when I have an erection, and I have no erectile curvature.  I am quite embarrassed when I have to reveal my flacid penis with the deformity.  However, about one month ago, I contracted Gonorrhea, and received Zithromax and an injection of ceftriaxone as treatment.  After the treatment, both the Gonorrhea and 'hourglass deformity' vanished!  The 'hourglass deformity' unfortunately came back after about ten days.  But during the 10 days, I could be cold, nervous...whatever...and still have a perfectly normal hanging penis.  Do you have any idea what caused this?  Is there an ingredient in either of the drugs I received that could have temporarily cured it and that I may possibly take permanently?  I'd appreciate any information regarding my situation.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Just turned 25, male, uncircumcised, no prior sexual history. No pre-existing medical conditions or past pharmaceutical treatment, including no surgery, major or otherwise.   Haven't had any problems with my penis until recently. Discovered two white bumps on the left side of my frenulum and one on the right side. They appear to be more pronounced pearly penile papules, in relation to a more inchoate formation of papules lining the base of my corona. They stand apart however, (noticed them a few months ago) and as mentioned, experienced no prior problems with them.   Since a week there seems to be a constant irritation and sensitivity situated around the two white bumps on the left side of my frenulum. In the following days I've noted that the entire corona has become more-or-less sore, painful and sensitive. The area around the two white bumps has become inflamed; red. (The right-side of the frenulum has also turned red.)  My only recourse so far has been rinsing it twice or more a day with lukewarm water and gently & delicately rubbing it clean with my fingertips. Tried keeping it dry, by dabbing it with a towel afterwards, but this caused a painful sensation when pulling back the prepuce. (normally I leave it moist to a slight degree, after showering.)   What could be the problem? Haven't performed any unusual 'activities' on them. It could be that I'm causing the spread of the sensitivity and soreness by 'cleansing' it so steadily. Heretofore I have kept my glans mostly covered in light of its sensitivity, being an uncircumcised male. Albeit this does not account for the original source of the 'soreness', the area surrounding the two white bumps. (The soreness seems to radiate outward to the left of my glans, though my frenulum is also unusually sensitive.) When aroused the sensations in the glans are also different.  Any thoughts? Couldn't be an STD, nor do I use unclean towels used by others. Scoured the internet for info and did read that an early form of penile cancer, when situated on the glans, manifests itself in small white bumps, before ulcerating. But I also have a typical, though undeveloped formation of PPP on the corona of my glans. PPP is supposed to be asymptomatic right, but can cause enhanced sensitivity?   Haven't yet visited a physician.   (Would they mind if I just photograph the 'areas'? Not too keen on a physical examination. Unless of course they want to take swabs or whatever.) Anyway, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Since you have a doctor's appointment in a few days I would recommend not using any anti-fungal or other medicated ointments until you see your doctor.

    "content": "My physician settled for the pictures, it was a 10 minute appointment, she didn't think they were pearly penile papules in light of them not being skin-coloured. (disagreed on that point) Can't remember what she called them, presumably they could be related to the infection, for which she prescribed an ointment/cream.   She ruled out STD's, genital warts or anything of that sort based on my history. Don't know, kind of ambivalent to the proceedings. She didn't think it was penile cancer because that usually manifests itself as a sore, though the medical definition found online also lists papules. Of course I'm 25, so it's unlikely to begin with.   I'll give the cream a try, thanks for the info, will see if it clears up.\n\n",

    "content": "The over-the-counter anti-fungal cream (lamisil) hasn't exactly worked. The infection seems to diffuse itself wherever I haven't applied any of the cream. (though now it just weathers through any meticulously applied anti-fungal treatment.)  Started out with applying the cream on the entire base of the corona, which seemed to work at first, however the infection spread to the prepuce. (figured that one out 10 days ago.) Which I've subsequently began to treat as well, to some avail, albeit the infection has now spread across the corona unto the glans itself. The soreness/burning sensation vacillates from one region to the other. This is beginning to get extremely frustrating. Plus, it has already been a month, the treatment should have worked within 14 days. Hadn't contacted my physician earlier, because I was using the cream-- as it turns out, too squeamishly at first. (or so I figure) Significantly used more cream during the course of this 'treatment', which might have actually contributed to a certain resistance within the fungus to the anti-fungal cream? (slow, gradual exposure to increased amounts of Lamisil. Any thoughts on this matter?)  Basically I either applied the cream two or three times a day, rinsing each time with warm running water before applying the cream on the glans and prepuce.(see above)   - somewhat rubbed the skin clean, though there wasn't any build-up or anything.)  - Used no soap during the entire month. (until today out of frustration.)  Could this have anything to do with the tenacity of this  fungal infection?   Made another appointment, but they couldn't schedule me in until next week Tuesday.   My only consolation, to some extent anyway, is that the region with the two pearly bumps is consistently asymptomatic at the moment, at both sides of the frenulum and has been for two weeks or so. (Occasionally it becomes tender when I direct my thought to the region, but in all likelihood the sensations of the nearby afflicted regions contaminate the area.) Though I've constituted that one of them has increased in size in the last month. (Out of curiosity, I'd also attempted to 'rub' one of them off, with no negative consequences. Just to make sure it wouldn't ulcerate, or whatever.)  --------------  Questions:   - Soap, will it have any positive effect?  - Has the fungal infection build up a resistance to the cream? And if so, will any additional treatment with Lamisil help?   - Rubbing the furrow of the corona clean during rinsing, has it any negative effects?    Anyway, you have my gratitude for offering a place to vent.\n\n",

Seeing your doctor again is a good idea, though, to help be sure you're still dealing with a fungal issue.  Using soap can help as long as the soap is mild.  Some soaps can irritate the skin further.  The soap can help kill the fungus.  Gentle washing is OK.  Don't do anything too vigorous or it makes it more likely the soap will irritate.  Washing the edge of the corona is OK as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi doc  I would really appreciate your feedback regarding the following:  Exactly one year ago i was out for a walk in the morning when I started feeling a little limp in my left leg as I walked. I ignored it thinkin it was a temporary thing. But it kept getting worse and worse until there was a certain amount of pain (on and off) in the back of my left leg. This was followed by my left testicle starting to feel weird and hanging lower than it normally did. I went to get a scrotal ultrasound and nothing unusual was found. These symptoms persisted for afew months until the discomfort had radiated to both my testis. It felt as if my right testicle was a bit swelled up past normal size. They had both become sensitive and ached if pressed a bit hard. It also felt as if there was some kind of dilation of the nerves. Afew months later, along with the discomfort and ache of the left leg and both testis, my right leg also started to ache. My right testis also seems to be protruding out further than the left accompanied by pain on the inside of my right thigh. Again I went to the doctor and was told to get another scrotal ultrasound. This was two weeks ago and again nothing unusual was found.   On the same note: Last month I woke up one day and felt the right side of my body feeling weak and tingling. Now lately, I have been experiencing days on and off when my entire right side of the body (arm and leg) feels weaker than the left side. I don't know whats going on. And I am quite worried as nothing has ever persisted this long before. FYI, I am 27 years old.  Please help.   I/\n\n",

    "content": "Dear rubens2009, I can certainly understand your frustration.  Aside from seeing another urologist or genitourinary physician for a second opinion there is not much more we could suggest.  You could approach it from a psychiatric point of view.  Perhaps you could be evaluated to see if there might be a mental condition that is contributing to this disorder.  Our minds are powerful players in our physical well-being.  This is not saying it's not real; just that it could be originating in your brain somehow.  The mind is very complex.  Another approach might by therapeutic hypnosis.  This is not the type of hypnosis where you go to a theater to watch people perform, but rather something that is done as alternative medical treatment by a qualified hypnotherapist.  Sometimes this method is employed in pain control where the subconscious mind can be reached even though traditional pain control measures fail.  There are other alternative medicines that some people find successful so once you have exhausted more traditional methods, it might be worth exploring some of these.  Good luck in your efforts to solve this puzzle and don't give up.\n\n",

I am thinking about being circumcised for cosmetic reasons, but i don't know what sort of doctor i would need to see.   Do i need to see a cosmetic surgeon?   I have been told that better results can be produceed by having the procedure done in USA, as in America this procedure is a lot more common (i am from the UK, where it is quite uncommon to be circumcised). Would it be worth going to the states?  The reason i am thinking of circumcision is because i have little white spots on my penis. The spots are mainly on the penis shaft not the foreskin. Would it be possible to keep the foreskin in tact and remove the skin which has spots on it?  Hope you can help.  Thanks, steve.\n\n",

If you are wanting to have the circumcision to correct the white pumps you are describing I do not think this will help you.  Depending on what the spots are there may be a treatment for them.  Usually, surgical removal of skin lesions will result in a small scar taking their place.  The urologist can discuss the risks/benefits of circumcision including recovery times with you so you can make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may be simply an area of increased pigmentation although if this were the case I would expect you would have noticed it sooner as it would have been present for some time.  Another possibility is that you had some irritation in the area leading to some inflammation.  Inflammation can be followed by hyperpigmentation that can last for several months before fading.  A third possibility would be a fungal skin infection.   I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated when you are in the office next.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I also have right kidney pain, and occasional lower right abdominal pain, during bowel movements, or without.  I had surgery for a 1.4 cm kidney stone back in January of this year, and was currently diagnosed with another kidney stone about 2 weeks ago. I had surgery for a hernia in 2004. I was also diagnosed with a low thyroid level (.02) and was supposed to go to an endocrinologist but never did. Now the embarrassing part, I used to be able to have sex for about 2 hrs without losing an erection, and now I'm lucky to be able to stay erect for 5 minutes, let alone at all. About a month ago I did a cycle of steroids because I was losing weight, but am not currently taking any of that. I drink about 1 1/2 gallons of water a day because they told me it would help pass the stone.  I had unprotected sex, well not really, stopped after 2 minutes cause I wouldn't stay erect, about 2 weeks ago with a girl I barely knew. I have been told that it sounds like I have a bladder or kidney infection, and am really worried.  My girlfriend thinks I don't want her anymore because I wont sleep with her, but I'm too embarrassed to say it's because I can't stay erect. I am leaving town for about a month on Labor Day for business, and am wondering if this is something I should really worry about, to the point where I should find a doctor where I'm going.  I'm sorry that this is really in depth, but I thought I would go into full detail.   It doesn't sound like I have an STD does it?\n\n",

But this is not enough, and still I am hampered regarding active endeavors since there is irritation when this area on the penis rubs against any clothing.  Sometimes I feel pain sitting completely naked.   For an active person, this is difficult to endure and my psychological well being is deteriorating.  I occasionally use some antibacterial soap and non-perfumed vaseline intensive care to sooth the area, and there is temp relief, but still pain if the tender areas rub against anything.

    "content": "Hi Vinh,  The small purple dots you are seeing are most likely blood vessels that are close to the surface.  These are relatively common.  The irritation you are describing may be from excess moisture or a fungal infection.  You may want to try an antifungal cream (jock itch) cream to see it this helps.  If it isn't getting better you should have your doctor evaluate it to see if there is a different treatment needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may also be that you damaged some of the connective tissue of the penis that is now healing.  If this does not get better slowly or if it gets worse I would recommend you see a doctor.

I am a little suspicious that your pain may be related to a hernia, particularly because the pain began when you were carrying weight.  Usually hernias would not be associated with bleeding though.  I would recommend you discuss this with your doctor and be examined for a hernia, especially if your symptoms return.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My Doctor has put me on 500 mg Ciprofloxacn , 2 tablets a day.. total 24 tablets. i have five days or 10 tablets left. When i first went my testicles were swollen tremendously. They had been going down with the Cipro and the pain was minimal. As of tonight, they have swollen once again very large. My Doctor found no unusual lumps etc. and said he thought it was an infection I had a fever at the beginning and pain when touched, my fever has since gone when i returned to the Doctor 3 days ago. However, I am now once again concerned as they have swollen again. My last visit he said they had fluid in the sack. There will be a large hard triangle under the base of my penis at the top of the sacl but it will go away then return as i am laying down.

    "content": "Off and on for a few years, I have had months where I strongly feel the need to urinate, even immediately after I go, and often have very little urine production, even when it feels like I have to go the most.  Two different urologists came up with nothing after cystoscopy/diary/physical therapy/bladder emptying test/etc.  I also wake up many times a night to go, and often have to go 2-3 times before I can fall asleep.  Today, I woke up early to a weird muscle sensation/contraction feeling.  I had urinated in bed, and was still doing so.  I had absolutely no control over it;  it just kept happening.  I have leaked a little bit since, and control has been difficult.  It was a lot of urine, not just a leak.  And I had just gone to the bathroom about an hour before.  My urethra area stings quite a bit, as well, and two days ago, I had to leave work because of a similar pain.  No UTI was detected, but they did find white blood cells in urine. I was not dreaming about urination when this happened. The small leaks feel like air bubbles passing out of my urethra;  a very odd sensation.  Also, for the last month I have been having vision problems, in one eye only.  The vision in my right eye just seems \"off.\"  What I see out of that eye is whiter, blurrier and just a different color (a little pink.)  It causes some dizziness, as my eyes just don't \"mesh\" well together.  My eye Dr found nothing.  I feel like I'm slowly losing vision in the eye.  I'm only 30 years old, and female. I am terrified to go to sleep.  The only thing that ever came up in all my Dr tests was an ANA test ratio of 80, which they said might not mean anything, or could be from birth control pills.  No lupus or MS was diagnosed. It also hurts to be intimate with my bf... that's been going on for a few months.\n\n",

Some STD bacteria can cause prostatitis; however, it is much more common for women to have symptoms than men.  (This, of course, does not rule out an STD cause so if this is a possibility STD's should be tested for.)  It is more likely that the cause is not a bacterial infection.  Other causes include a narrowed urethra through the prostate, prostate trauma, autoimmune causes and the nebulous unknown cause.  If your husband is not improving I would recommend he see a urologist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

You may also want to talk with a urologist to see if there are possible excess pressure issues in your urinary tract that may be causing some pain and setting you up for kidney infections.  With your urinary tract infections have you had  repeat urine culture after treatment to ensure that the infection has cleared?  If you have not and your infection is not being cleared you may be having pain from this.  Muscular pain is also a possibility but with the UTI's it may be a good idea to also look a bit more into the urinary tract.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't know how it started but when I feel my testicles, I don't want to say I feel a \"lump\" on the left one but it certainly hurts when I feel it compared to when I feel the right one. I've noticed that my left testicle is in more of an oval shape than my right one. While standing up, if I exhale deeply I notice that my right testicle rises immediately while my left does so but is more slow and does not rise as high as the right. Also when standing my left testicle is about half a centimeter (only a slight difference) lower than my right one in the scrotum. If I'm lying in bed and I roll my body from left to right I feel a lot of pain in my left testicle when it moves with my body.   I think my left testicle may be dysfunctional. I'm worried and don't want to tell anyone. Please help. I don't know why it hasn't gone away on its own after almost 3 months now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi IamVeryWorried,  Sorry for the delay.  You are correct that I didn't see it.  Pain in the testes for 2 months is unlikely to be torsion.  Testicular torsion causes severe pain and must be addressed as soon as possible (ideally within 6 hours) or the testicle begins to die.  By 2 months the testis would be non-viable and likely would no longer have feeling.  It is also likely that you would have had more and more symptoms until it was extremely severe.  More likely is a smoldering infection or inflammation of the epididymus (the collecting tubes that sit on top of the testis) or of the testis itself.  If an STD is possible, this is definitely something that should be tested for.  Even if an STD isn't possible, a chronic infection could be present.  I would advise you to see your doctor for an evaluation.  You may benefit from seeing a urologist as well.  Regarding the left testis being lower than the right and not rising quite as high, this is normal.  It's basically a space saving technique that allows the testes to fit in the scrotum better.  Please feel free to post again if you have any follow up questions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for that reply. I'm positive I do not have an STD because I have never been sexually active. So if not an STD or torsion, you think it might be a chronic infection? I really don't want to tell anyone because I'm so embarassed to do so. But since you bring up the fact that I can tell a doctor (not necessarily a urologist), do you think a family physician would work? My mom has been one for over 20 years in all areas of physiology. She's not a urologist however. I guess I'll tell her if the pain doesn't stop within one more week.   I thought of a possible cause of the pain. I notice that by default, my shaft is always pointed left, and rests above my left testicle. I think that over the past few years as it has grown it may have been too much weight on my left testicle, causing it to pain this badly. Is this a \"valid\" cause for my situation? Do you know if others have this same shaft position as me. This is the only reason I can think of for why I'm in this much pain.  I'm trying to sound as honest and least childish as possible here, I don't want to see a urologist because I am afraid that they will not want to see me because my skin is of a different color than Caucasians (I'm Indian). I doubt they would want to examine me (and if they did so it would be with a feeling of 'weirdness'...and I don't want this at all).\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  Discussing this issue with a family physician would be a very appropriate place to start.  Most family physicians are very qualified to address these type of issues.  I'm not sure where you are located but hopefully skin color would not be an issue.  I do understand your hesitation, however.  Your question about the shaft of your penis putting pressure on the testis, generally the testis would have enough room in the scrotum to move and relieve this pressure.  The exception to this could be if you were very tight fitting underwear that could constrict the space of the scrotum.    A chronic infection can occur without being an STD so I would recommend at least a screening urinalysis (from the first part of your stream rather than the mid part as a typical urinalysis would be done; doing the 1st part allows better evaluation of the urethra and prostate for any signs of infection that could also be present in the testis).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "ok. so ive been having a bit of trouble recently it started with a little bit of discharge and an itchy feeling then burning while urinating so at first i thought it was just some chlamydia that i may have contracted a during a threesome a couple weeks prior, but then i noticed pain when i got an erection it took a couple days for this to appear, and remembered a couple nights ago me and my wife were having sex, she was on top and it poped out and she came down on it and it did make a pop sound, it didnt really hurt that much, i was able to finish and i thought nothing of it, but now i can tell that there was damage. when i get an erection it kind of bends downward, and hurts, it was the under part of the penis that was injured about 2/3s the way up and there is extreme pain when i  get a full erection, er well close to full erection and especially if i lift my penis toward my belly while its even slightly erect. its been about 3 weeks since the incident and it seems to be improving a little but there is quite a bit of discharge it started out kind of yellow and now it is white, also there is a small discoloration kind of like a bruise where it feels like it was injured, i cant feel anything hard but it is making my penis bend downward a bit, ive done a bit of research on peyronies disease and im hoping that it heals 100% but my question is there anything a doctor could do to help me? how long may it be for the pain during erections to go away ? and am i injuring it more by getting erections? and what sort of care might i try to go about to help this heal, i don't want it to heal to where i have a bend in my penis. is stretching good or bad at this point? any advice would help me out thanks in advance\n\n",

When it torses, it twists its blood vessels causing blood flow to it to be cut off.  This can cause pain until the appendix testis dies.  At this point it simply is resorbed by the body.  No treatment is necessary other than pain control.  Your wisdom teeth treatment may help in terms of pain.  The antibiotics will neither hurt nor help the testis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Markg,  What you are describing is actually more common than you suspect.  It sounds like a condition called phimosis where the opening of the foreskin is very tight.  This is a condition that should be addressed because if the skin does come back it can become trapped behind the head of the penis creating the need for an emergency circumcision to prevent bloodflow from being cut off to the tip of the penis.  There is a non-surgical option to try if you prefer not to be circumcised.  Your doctor can prescribe you a high potency topical steroid that can thin the skin enough to allow it to normally retract.  If this is unsuccessful, surgery is usually recommended.  You should see either your regular doctor or a urologist for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had surgery and had it removed. I am now 35 yrs old, and have successfully fathered three children. The doctor told me that one testicle would produce enough sperm for me to father children, and he was right. They implanted a prosthetic in place of the removed testicle. He supposedly used a large prosthesis as he guessed by my size then I would be a large man. My question is that I feel my penis is on the smaller size. My left (real) testicle is signifigantly larger than the \"fake\" one. Could the left one have grown excessively to make up for the non-existient right one, and could there have been a lack of testosterone during puberty, and if so would that have hindered my penis growth? I appreciate your time, and would welcome any and all info you could give me regarding the possible problems caused by this during puberty.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jenztoy77,  The main issue with undescended testes is that they are at risk for developing cancers in the future.  They are brought down into the scrotum so they can be examined easier for tumors.  If your other testis was in the scrotum it is unlikely that you had a lack of testosterone.   Prior to puberty very little testosterone is actually needed.  During puberty, the good testis should easily produce enough testosterone to allow for normal penile growth.  There are a few other conditions that may cause decreased penile growth, such as growth hormone deficiency.  If you are concerned it is reasonable to see an endocrinologist for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in Left Testical with bloody sperm ?",
    "content": "43 year old hypochondriac Realtor here :) I have had pain in my left testical on and off for 20 years. Usually minow dull ache. When I was younger I was severly constipated and believe I have a varicocele as I have the classic \"bundle of worms\" that disapear when I lie down. Anyway, the last few weeks the pain has returned, and so has the constipation. The other day while pushing very hard to force a stool, a very thick dark yellow secretion came out of my penis. Looked almost bloody. I havent had sex in a while also. Yesterday is happened again, this time it was just a tiny speck, jelly like in consistency, but blood red. Also the left testical pain is there. Does this sound like cancer or infection? There is no changes in the testical size and no bumps or masses as far as I feel. Tonight as I lie in bed typing the pain in my left scrotum is radiating to my lower stomach and back. My health insurance doesnt kick in till sept 1, so If I go now to the doctor, and its just an infection, fine I can pay for it, but od forbid its serious, then the insurance wont cover it next month because they will say its pre-existing. So if its minor I can go now, or if its serious I should wait 3 weeks. Any advice would be apreciated\n\n",

He felt that a sonogram was not secessary, and he said the blood is inconsequential because it was just an isolated event and not ongoing. He said if it continues to bother be follow up with my doctor. I am disapointed, if he had said it was an infetion I would at least know where I stand, now I feel he may have overlooked something.

    "content": "I am a 33 years old and my ejaculate has been full of red or brown blood for 6 months to a year.  I have asked my doctor what this could possibly be during my normal checkup in the last year, and he said it is very normal and lots of men experienced it and even though it is very frightening for me to see the blood it is not out of the norm.  After having this problem for this amount of time, it has started to weigh on my mind and my wifes even though it is considered within the norm to have it.  I don't have problems urinating at least nothing extreme that I have noticed like frequency or pain.  Within the last month I have started to see blood come from penis during a bowel movement.  This doesn't happen all the time, but if I strain at all it will, so since this is something new it is another indicator that maybe things are progressing in some way.  I have read a lot online, and a lot of things suggest that all these things can be considered within normal symptoms of what you can see with an irritated prostate, and not usually a sign of anything like cancer.  In my career I sit at a desk for almost all of the day, and from what I can read, this can be one of the major catalysts to the irritated prostate because a male sits on his prostate while sitting down.  My main concern is that there is nothing horribly wrong and I am not taking care of it, but on the other hand I don't want to have a bunch of procedures done just to find out the problem is an irritated prostate because of prolonged sitting. Does anyone have any information?\n\n",

    "content": "I had bladder surgery July 30th (bladder sling) and went home about 1 1/2 hrs after I got out of recovery but from the walking from getting up and leaving and going to the car, my hip went to hurting EXTREMELY bad. I also developed a limp from the pain and was walking really slow because of it. I ended up feeling pain radiating into the upper part of my leg too. I am doing better now but I keep having spells where I get achy and am having trouble walking, which is causing me to walk really really slow. It usually happens after I've sat down for awhile & it occurs every day though it ends up going away.  Finally to the question.. If a nerve was possibly damaged during this surgery, would it cause such problems OR is this a typical reaction to surgery??? I haven't told my urologist what is going on and don't really know if I need to.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Darkestdays30,  Pelvic surgery can cause a significant amount of hip pain.  There are several reasons for this.  The muscles that run from the pelvis into the hip may be irritated from the surgery causing some pain.  The nerves that supply the pelvis can cause pain that radiates to the hip.  This radiated pain can be quite difficult to tell if it is coming from the pelvis or actually the hip.  Nerve damage would be possible if the nerve were hit during the surgery.  The nerves that supply the hip are generally located at the back of the pelvis and out of the way.  I would recommend you talk with you urologist about this to be sure everything is OK.  I suspect that this pain will slowly get better.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If, however, the skin is tight and will not move forward on its own there is a risk that it may become caught behind the head of the penis cutting off blood flow.  This is a surgical emergency.  If you find that your foreskin is tight you should see your doctor or a urologist for an evaluation.  This may need to be treated to prevent it from becoming stuck behind the head of the penis.

    "title": "Getting rid of a skin bridge",
    "content": "I have come to realize that I have a skin bridge on my penis. I never knew what it was until a little bit ago when I did a little research. There is only 1 section, probably 1/4 inch long or so. I would like to get it cut but I have a few questions.  To me it seems like it would be quite simple to get rid of. Just a little slice. So Im going to try and locate a urologist in my area. Do they do this sort of thing? And about the procedure, how much does it cost? Im 19 so Im really hoping this isnt very expensive as my money goes towards school. About how long does the operation take? Do they use anesthetics? After it is done, do I have to take any pain killers or is it not painful? Those are a few questions I can think of now. Sorry if my entire post just seems like a list of questions.  I truly appreciate the help.\n\n",

They will likely use some local anesthesia.  It should not be very painful afterwards.    I am not aware of how much this would cost.  If you have insurance it will likely pay for most of it.

Ideal pregnancy spacing is actually 18 months to 2 years between pregnancies so there is an additional benefit to waiting a little while at least.  Pregnancy spacing does impact the health of your baby.  More neonatal complications and deaths are associated with too close spacing.    Add to that the additional risks that could present in connection with the kidney stones and it just makes sense to hold off a bit.    Good luck.\n\n",

There are some medications (such as DDAVP nasal spray) that can help decrease urine production during the night and help eliminate night time wetting.  These medicines are simple and safe enough to use in children.  I suspect that your bladder is sensing it is full and your brain responds by dreaming about it.  I would also recommend a simple urine analysis be done to look for anything such as diabetes that may be causing your increased urination, especially if you find yourself going lots during the day as well.

For instance, before I go to bed at night, or before I go into the shower, I am unable to release any extra fluids, sometimes even after two hours, where at least some urine should get released.  I have also been expereincing slight discomfort near my left kidney on ocassion, nothing severe, just slight pain.  This problem has been occuring ever since I attended an event in which a bathroom was not acessible for about six hours.  I held my urination for that time, and ever since attempting to urinate after returning home, I have had trouble urinating.  I can urinate at a steady stream when I do go, and my urine is clear, with no blood or anything at all.  Is this something I should worry about, or should it correct itself soon enough?\n\n",

If it is not getting better soon I would recommend you see a urologist for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Burning sensation when urinating but don't think it's a UTI",
    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 29 year old female and I have beeen having this ongoing problem for the past 3/4 months now. Everytime my bladder seems to fill up it feels irritated and when I urinate i get a burning sensation. I don't seem to want to go all the time though, unlike cystitis. I have been to my GP and they did a stick test for a UTI but it did'nt show up that there was one present, and she also took a swab for any sign of infection.  She gave me a short course of antibiotics just in case. The antibiotics did'nt seem to make any difference and I am still left with this problem. I also find it's painful when having sex. I have also been having a slight watery brown discharge and a pain in my lower right hand side of my pelvis which sometimes seems to filter down into the top of my leg. I have also been having pain on my right side and feel cold most of the time. I have been diagnosed with undifferentiated connective tissue disease and possibly ME. I would really appreciate any help on this. Many thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several possible causes of pain with urination (dysuria).  A UTI is generally at the top of the list; however, there are many other things.  Given your other symptoms, if an STD is possible I would strongly recommend being tested for these.  Also,  occasionally women will have a yeast infection that can cause inflammation of the distal urethra leading to pain.  Inflammatory bowel diseases are possible (particularly Crohn's disease) but would be less likely than other causes.  I would recommend you see your gynecologist or a urologist for an evaluation to help determine what is causing your pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctors,  *deep breath*  I am a tee total 21 yr old male - about a week and a half ago I started having urges to keep going to urinate. I went to the walk in clinic where they checked my sample and said I had a UTI. I was given ceflaxin (250mg) antibiotics. I started developing excessive thirst - along with urges to urinate and urinating atleast 6-7times in the day. When I urinate there is no pain/burning and I urinate at a normal flow with a considerable amount (no drips). Sometimes I feel slight pressure in my abdomen. My ceflaxin course came to an end and I went back to the doctors who changed my antibiotics to nitrofurantoin (been taking them for the last 2 days). I have a family history of diabetes but after checking my urine sample the doctor gave me the all clear for diabetes.  My urine sample was sent for further analysis and the nurse informed me the results are clear.  I also have a high sex drive - im a virgin - ive noticed this problem has affected my erection (it doesnt erect 100% like before - mayb 90% now) - I have masturbated a few times during this period and it has burned very slightly when I ejaculated - therefore should I masturbate at this time or abstain?  Im completely baffled as to what it could be. Im still  getting thirsty and having to urinate frequently. Any ideas what is going on and what I should do next?  thanks doctor -  a very worried Razz\n\n",

    "content": "I would recommend that you have a repeat urinalysis done that includes a urine culture.  Your symptoms may be related to a urine infection but given your symptoms with ejaculation it is also possible that you have an infection in the prostate or other genital organ (although this is less likely).  With the excessive thirst I would be a little concerned about diabetes (both diabetes mellitus related to high blood sugar and diabetes insipidus related to a problem retaining water).  Continuing to follow up with your doctor is important.  If your symptoms do not resolve in the next 1-2 days I would be suspicious that either the antibiotics are not effective against the infection or you do not have a urine infection.

Given your increased thirst I think this is probably less likely though.  If your urine is very dilute you may want to look into diabetes insipidus.  This takes some blood tests and urine tests to diagnosis.  It is a condition where the body does not make or the kidney does not respond normally to the hormone that says to keep water in the body.  Beyond that I'm starting to run out of ideas.  Follow up with your doctor will be important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm 18, and male, i have 1 prior surgery and that was to my arm for \"strawberry?\", my family history has had diabetes. Now the subject. Well start off i currently have cold sores on the lips. Now for last 2 months ive had 2 accounts of cold sores on the lips. And for last 2 months ive notice i don't know if its connected to the cold sores or not a distinct odor in the genital region, and on and off give or take a week before  my mouth breaks out with the cold sores, my right side of my shaft of penis jsut below the head, becomes blood red and the smell pursits, some swelling on 1 accurance, but no blisters, bumps, or anything other then that, just a blood red and some smell. The size of the redness is about the size of thumb. It does cause some burning with fricition. After the first accurance of the red spot it left darkened skin for the persisting time until this resent accurance. I am still a [u]virgin[/u], and havent had oral sex either. so question is, could the cold sores(HSV-1?) weaken my immune system and alow a skin condition or a infection to attack the skin in that area? Or does the signs show that i might have genital herpes?\n\n",

    "content": "Your area on your penis does not particularly sound like a herpes lesion.  These typically follow the pattern that develops on the lips as well (more blister like).  It is possible for the HSV-1 virus that commonly causes cold sores to infect the genital region and produce genital herpes outbreaks.  So, it is possible that the HSV-1 virus was spread to your genital region (possibly by your hand touching your lip with a cold sore then subsequently touching the skin in your genital area).  This is fairly uncommon, though.  The darkened area after the resolution of the first episode is indicative that there was some inflammation in the area.  This makes me think it isn't simple a blood vessel area or something of that nature.  Unfortunately I really can't say what it is.  My best recommendation is to visit your doctor while you have the spot.  This way it can be examined and even cultured for the HSV virus if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear HOLLOW, Recurring UTI's are of some concern, and continuous antibiotic therapies can sometimes contribute to the creation of antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria.  A very important part of bladder health is adequate hydration.   Good intake of fresh water is very important to helping keep kidneys and bladder functioning well.  Are you drinking enough water during the day?   The fact that you are able to void a better amount first thing in the morning leads me to wonder if it is coincidental to sleeping 8 + hours at night. Your body generally creates about 30+ ml of urine each hour - that would be therefore 240+ ml of urine when you wake the next morning. If your water intake is slim during the day, and you are also fighting a urinary tract infection, it is possible that you are voiding only dribbles of urine during the daytime.  So long as you do not have a restrictive intake of water (such as people with certain types of heart failure or kidney failure), you may wish to increase your water intake during the daytime and see if that helps.\n\n",

In 2005 I had to spend almost 25 hrs or more in a airplane while travelling internationally.I had a couple of stop overs though.Naturally I had to use the latrine in the flight and the airport restrooms.  During that period I noticed after 3-4 hrs after I board in the plane, my  underpants started becoming a little smelly n wet, it felt more awkward  in course of time, I tried washing  and powdering myself as long as possible, but that's was not much of a help. In 2006 I went for a pap smear test as a part of my annual checkup and the result was all normal, no abnormalities, no infections.Normally I tend to sweat quite easily and this slight wetness and a very little discharge is sometimes there, specially before I get my period every month.It draws my attention only when I have to wear undergarments for longer time, otherwise while at home everything is normal. I am not very comfortable wearing capries ,pants , jeans or anything of that sort all the time.Please suggest me whether I should  use any odor absorbent pads or other ready made methods that I am not aware of for  prolonged journey.Where can I find these products? After my period is over each month, I feel the area is quite dry and no discharge is there....it lasts for 5-6 days and then gradually the dryness is gone.Is it normal?\n\n",

I trust your TB test turned out negative.  And I commend you for attending to routine feminine checkups like your pap smear.  Therefore I am going to guess that you may have already checked with your doctor and found out that there is nothing clinically of concern regarding your personal odor issue.  If that is so, and there is nothing clinically of any concern at this time then yes, I would recommend you experiment with underpads and find the one that seems to be best absorbent for you.  These pads can be changed out as often as needed without fear of irritation - since they are not invasive. Some brands boast on \"ultra-thin\" and have nighttime brands that are touted as being very absorbent.  These could be changed out as often as you felt necessary, discarding the used one in an appropriate receptacle.  At certain times of the month you will normally have an increased vaginal discharge,  if you know the timing of the increase based on your normal cycles, you can better prepare for your long journeys. Perhaps even feel comfortable in capris again!\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is almost 8 yrs old. She just spent the last two months fighting a UTI/bladder infection (e-coli) with 5 different antibiotics. During this time, we are almost certain she also passed one or more kidney stones or crystals due to crystals appearing in lab work (urine). Because symptoms of both are sometimes very similar, it was sometimes confusing as to what was causing her discomfort/pain. Then a lymph node in her groin became enlarged and remains enlarged, even though she seems to be over everything else. I was told there was no connection to the UTI infection or kidney stones. But.... I then read that if a Dr. thinks you might have kidney stones, he/she will check your groin for swollen lymph nodes when doing a physical exam. Is this true? Is it common to have swollen lymph nodes with kidney stones? Do I need to be concerned that it remains somewhat enlarged?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Common causes of lymph node enlargement include infections in any part of the area drained by this group of lymph node.  The inguinal lymph nodes drain the lower limb (leg, foot, and thigh), vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, and lower anal canal.   Any history of previous infection in these parts of the body may result in inguinal lymph node enlargement that does not disappear completely after recovery from infection; instead they remain as shotty small swellings.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.  It is not uncommon to have inguinal lymph node enlargement due to lower urinary tract infection (severe urethritis).   A coincidentally enlarged lymph node due to other causes is possible too.   It is important to follow lymph node size and number by serial physical examination regardless their apparent bengin cause.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Urine analysis shows no sign of bladder infection or blood in urine. Also, I am not experiencing pain when I urinate, just a major increase in frequency. No lesions or external signs of STD (nor would it be possible as I have been sexually inactive for about a year).  I went to see the doctor today but ended up just seeing a PA.

    "content": "Increased urinary frequency may be due to a decrease in antidiuretic hormone (called diabetes insipidus)  producing very dilute urine.  If the urine is concentrated it really basically rules this condition out.  Another possibility would be a an undiagnosed diabetes mellitus.  The high sugar in the urine pulls water along with it and causes increased urination.  A urinary tract infection can cause the increased frequency and the lymph node swelling.  If you've not had urine culture this may be helpful.  A normal urinalysis makes infection less likely.  You may want to see a urologist for further evaluation.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Approx 2 weeks ago my partner and I stopped short of intercourse, and I had a severe case of \"unrelieved prostatic congestion,\" or blue balls.  This continued for an hour and I relieved myself, but it felt like I had to urinate while ejaculating. This has continued! It is uncomfortable, and just recently I let out a bit of urine before I ejaculated. I know that anatomy pretty well, that is NOT supposed to happen. No dysuria or blood or anything, but it makes ejaculation unbearable. The ejaculate has no propelling force, it just dribbles out. Also odd.   Probably not as uncomfortable as whats coming at the urologist's office. Sorry for the lack of brevity.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 22 year old male with no previous urology problems. About 3 days ago after ejaculating I had a very sharp pain. Also when I would urinate the first 10-15 hours after it was very painful. Not buring a deep sharp pain like some one was riping the skin or a muscle apart. After a good night sleep and some tylenol the next morning I had the pain a little bit when urinating but not even half as bad. Later in the day when I would urinate there was no pain at all. Once again after ejaculating that evening there was that pain again. It was not as bad this time but still very stong. When I urinated it hurt just like the time befor. I took the tylenol pm so I could sleep. The next morning when I urinated there was no pain and no pain from urinating at any time during that day. I chose not to masterbate that evening because it felt like I had riped something and i thought the masterbating was iritating it. With out masterbating/ejaculating for 2 days I had no pain that whole entire time. I decided to masterbate after the two days and I had that pain again. Now the pain is not as bad though. Its still very uncomfortable but manageable. Did not need any medication for the pain. When I urinated this time it hurt a little but not much. So it seems that I am only geting this pain after ejacualting and it seems to take a few secounds after befor I get it. I have not been to a doctor and will prob go on monday or tuesday if this does not go away. The last time I and my girl friend had sex was about 2 weeks befor this and I had no problems when masterbating befor this. If some one could please tell me what else this could be if it is not some sort of uti or infection. Why does it only hurt after ejacualting and does not hurt while masterbating? Why does it not hurt to urinate unless I have ejaculated with in the last 30mins or so? I know that it could be an infection, but why would it only hurt when I ejaculate and not when I urinate?? Is it posible that I riped or damaged something between the urethia and the tube that comes up fron the prostate or the ejcaulation duct?  Also when I get this pain the tip of my penis becomes very sensative.  Thanks oceanview2007\n\n",

A hematoma is a collection of blood , whereas the contusion itself in other words is a bruise. The body will reabsorb the blood in the hematoma eventually,  but this takes time. The pain is partially caused because of the space this blood clot (more or less) takes up in a small space.  It is not unlikely that the pain will continue until most of the hematoma goes away. If the pain gets worse, or you have additional problems, you need to address these to your primary care physician.\n\n",

Specific characteristics: - left testicle only - it feels like a dull swelling-outward pain - causes stomach pain & diarrhea - semen volume is about 1/3 of normal  Most days it's tolerable, but it's considerably worse if: - i'm stressed - i get little sleep - i have a stomachache ( they seem to go hand-in-hand )  What's been done: - originally treated at epididymitis w/ doxycycline (5 days), then 7 days of levaquin, then 30 days of cipro.  No change. - one urologist thought it might be prostatitis - another one later took a fluid sample and said he saw no signs of infection (I've probably seen about 5 docs between an ER guy, a normal doc, and 3 urologists)  other tests run: - ultrasound - no signs of cancer - hernia - none felt - mri - back/spine look normal - urinalysis - no blood, etc. - prostate fluid sample showed no white blood cells (infection)  Any ideas?  This problem seriously makes it hard to function on bad days.  I pretty much just end up curling up in a ball holding my stomach and hoping for it to end.  Ibuprofen only mildly helps.  What tests or actions could I take next?\n\n",

    "content": "Multiple sclerosis can present in a large number of ways.  It is possible that your symptoms are related to MS.  The diagnosis of MS is dependent on having multiple neurological symptoms in different locations of the body at different times.  An MRI of the brain and possibly spinal cord can be helpful to look for lesions consistent with MS.  Given your symptoms I would recommend you talk with your doctor about a brain/spinal cord MRI.  With your urinary retention, the spinal MRI will also help look for other things such as a tethered spinal cord.  I am not an expert in fibromyalgia but I do not believe that urinary retention is typical of fibromyalgia (although some of the treatment medications can cause this).  Best wishes.\n\n",

Went there and got diagnosed with Pearly penile paules. They told me they are nothing to worry about. However, they are really big and unsightly and its putting of sexual partners and i cannot tie a relationship down as i now have no confidence.  I went back to the doctors a few months ago and a different doctor still never heard or seen of them and so he sent me to a urologist. I went to the urologist as he didnt know what they were or heard of pearly penile papules. He said i needed to see a dermatologist.

Generally a solitary cyst is not a problem; however, they can begin to cause symptoms if they get big enough.  It may be that your cyst is causing some of your pain.  I would recommend you see a nephrologist for evaluation to see if there is anything that should be done for your cyst.  Regarding the average size, renal cysts are quite variable.  They can be very small (a few millimeters) to quite large (several centimeters or more).  Best wishes\n\n",

It works by causing the kidneys to retain water rather than excrete it into the bladder.  This means less urine is produced and as such, the chances of night time wetting go down.  It is safe on the kidneys.  It's action in nasal spray form only lasts for about 8-12 hours.  At that point, it wears off and the kidneys begin to excrete water again.  It is likely that while using this, AM urination will increase because the kidneys will filter off all the water they would have during the night to keep the proper fluid balance for the body.

I consulted many physicians and did the routine urinal test many times and found no infection. i did the scanning and the pictures show that it is chronic epidimytis. But there was hardly any sort of pain from scortum area. The pain usually comes during urinating. Sometiems the pain comes from the base of the urethra, sometiems from the shaft. Sometimes, the pain comes at the shaft, not at the time of urinating also. Nowadays the pain comes from the middle-back of the left thigh also. I feel this thigh-pain the same time I feel the shaft-pain from the left of urethra. Is it really epidymytis or what?. I am seriously confused and concerned. The pain is there even after ejaculation also. The erection increases the pain.. Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am 19 year old male and recently, I have noticed that on some areas on the foreskin of my penis has become dry and flaky. I have never had a problem like this before. At the time I thought nothing of it. However when my penis fully erected several areas surrounding the foreskin have torn, causing broken skin because of the expansion. It does not itch, or irritate me, it only hurts when the broken skin is expanded or touched. At the moment I have not consulted a doctor and have started treating it with a moisturizing cream. I would like to know what I have and how to treat, also if it transferable during intercourse? My girlfriend and I are our first and only partners. Is there anything I can pickup at a local pharmacy to treat this without a perscription? Please let me know if there is any other additional information I can provide to help in a diagnosis.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "help: Assurance for prostate biopsy",
    "content": "I am a 76 year old male who recently visisted my GP after problems with passing water.He prescribed antibiotics which cleared it up.He suggested I had a CT scan and depending on it's outcome I may have to have a biopsy on my prostate. I then underwent a CT scan and there was some doubt about the condition of one of my kidneys. I have always enjoyed good health and still do having no symptoms or pain of any kind. I am due in hospital tomorrow for a prostate biopsy but having read several doctors opinions and necessity of a biopsy I am in doubt as to whether it is really necessary.  If I can be assured that there is no alternative I will gladly abide by my doctors opinion.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

In cases of benign prostatic hyperplasia (non-cancerous) it tends to be normal or only very slightly elevated and in cases of prostate cancer it tends to be elevated quite significantly.  If the PSA is high I would completely agree with the biopsy.  This may give you some more information to help make a decision.  If your doctor has felt any nodules I would also recommend having the biopsy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Peyronie's disease ??? unsure",
    "content": "40yr old, male diagnosed as Peyronie's disease  Meds: Vardenafil  At the end Nov of last year I was severely dehydrated from being sick, during a bathroom break I noticed a pee sized lump in the center of my penis about an inch from the end.  I really did not think much about it as I was that dehydrated. My wife and I are very sexually active together, and during the month of Dec I was in school and away from my her so instead I masturbated (2-3 times /day) no pain or discomfort. At the end of the month when I came home the first time making love, I had trouble having/ maintaining an erection even with half a pill and was forced to stop. The next day I used a whole pill and when my penis had a full erection the last inch or so was very painful, this lasted for 1-2 minutes (this has happened several times). Everything was normal until I had my orgasm, it felt as if it was blocked at or near the lump until the second spasm and then a huge release and everything was normal. Since then I have had one or two painful ejaculations (burning sensation) at the penis end, sometimes there is pain at first (almost like the pressure in the head is to much however to the touch it is not), sometimes we need to change positions because it is to painful to me to continue. On 2 or 3 occasions in January as the orgasm approached and movements were a little less controlled it felt as if my penis popped followed by a very sharp pain (best way to describe it is to break the joint/ cartilage on a piece of chicken) my wife even felt it. Several times there has been no pain what so ever. If you feel the lump from the side it feels like there is a grove in the center, sometimes it is hardly noticeable, sometimes there is discomfort when touched (the lump) more so after intercourse. There is no lump when erect, there is no bend and I do not believe its length has changed (it\u2019s been along time since I was concerned how big it was and taken a measurement), but a lot of time when the penis is flaccid it is a lot shorter, like when it\u2019s cold outside. I have seen 2GP who had no idea and one urologist that felt it and said it was Peyronie's disease and to come back in a year. Now it seems to me as if the limp has moved towards the base \u00bc to \u00bd of an inch. I have doubts this is Peyronies and I\u2019m wondering if this is possibly a fracture if it is how or can this be repaired?\n\n",

    "content": "Peyronie's disease is a relatively uncommon condition in which a fibrous band forms along the top or underside of the penis.  When erect, this band pulls the penis into a curved position that can cause pain/difficulty with intercourse.  If I am understanding your description correctly, you are not experiencing a curvature of your penis when erect.  This makes Peyronie's even less likely (essentially ruled out) as the technical definition of the disease is a fibrous band that causes curvature of the penis.  It is possible to \"fracture\" the penis.  This is when the corpus cavernosum that is mainly responsible for erection becomes damaged, often during trauma from the erect penis being bent acutely.  This condition is quite painful and considered a surgical emergency to help prevent erectile dysfunction later.  I would strongly recommend you follow up with your urologist and possibly seek a second opinion for your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Age:27 Sex: Male Family History:  My dad\u2019s brother (My Uncle) has had kidney problems in the past.  However, nothing in our immediate family has occurred like this.    I went to the hospital because I had stabbing pains ever minute or so in my penis, extreme back pains, was dizzy.  I did not have excruciating pain in my penis, but it felt like something was in my shaft.  I went to the Emergency Room at St. John\u2019s hospital in Lebanon, MO and they took a sample of my blood and did a urine test.  They found blood in my urine, but no sign of an infection.  They did a cat scan with me lying on my stomach and an X-Ray with me lying on my back.  After a little wait the doctor came back and said I had two kidney stones.  One I was getting ready to pass and the other was still in/attached to my kidney.  About an hour later I passed my first stone which was very tiny and was black/brown in color.  The doctor said they were both 2mm in size.  After I passed my first stone the doctor wrote me a prescription for Percocet 5/325MG and told me to take 800MG of IB Profen to keep swelling down.  He doctor gave me a urinal and a strainer and told me to strain all my urine so I would know when the other stone passed.  When leaving the hospital I was not in very much pain, but my penis shaft hurt a little.  I had assumed this was because of the stone being tiny and sharp so it may nave made small cuts in my urinary tract system.    I started taking the Percovet as needed for pain.  A couple of days later the pain then developed into a small pain in my testicles.  I took the percocet, but the pain grew and my testicles and sack then became tender to the touch.  About a day later the pain spread into my lower back and it felt like I had a bruised tailbone.  Shortly after this pain I started experiencing pain in my butt.  My cheeks were tender to the touch, but I also had the feeling that someone had stuck something up my rectum.  As I told the doctors I never had anything stuck up it.    I went to a different hospital.  This time I went to Lake Regional Hospital located in Osage Beach, MO because all of my pain was great.  I explained to them that about a week or so ago I passed my first kidney stone and the doctor told me I had a second stone but wasn\u2019t sure when it would pass.  I told them that I had been straining my urine every time I went to the bathroom but no stone came out.  They gave me two different pain medications through an IV and gave me a third solution to help balance the pain killers because of the side effects.  The pain medication through the IV did nothing to stop or lighten the pain in my testicles, rectum or lower back area.  So they did a cat scan with my lying on my back.  The doctor came back later and said they found no stones in my entire urinary tract system, but he did see a couple of tiny ones in/attached to my kidney, but that they were so small that I probably would not feel them if I urinated them out.  So the doctor prescribed me some more 5/325MG Percocet even after I told him that the Perocet was doing nothing for the pain.  He did an external rectal exam after I told him my pain was very high in my rectum area.  I told him that I blow gas a lot and can poop just fine.  He was reluctant but prescribed an antibiotic called Levaquin 750MG.  As I said though he was very reluctant to do this.  He could not explain to me where the second stone went.  I told him that I\u2019m not a doctor but I didn\u2019t think they could just disappear and he did not have an answer.  So I then left the hospital being in as much pain as when I first went to the hospital.  I then went to work and after my 8 hours of work I went home and the pain had not gone away even with taking two Percocet.  So I asked my wife to drive me to the hospital, but this time I decided to go back to St. John\u2019s hospital in Lebanon, MO.  So after explaining everything to the nurse they hooked me up to an IV again.  They started with just normal fluids, and gave me something for the pain but again the pain did not go away or even subside a little bit.  Then the ER doctor came in and after explaining everything to him he did an internal rectum exam.  So he lubed himself up and asked me if any areas felt tender while he was in my butt.  There were some tender areas which he said should not have been tender when he touched them.  Since I never had anything stuck up my butt before I had assumed when he said tender he meant somewhat painful which some of the areas were. He then told me he thought I had prostatitis which normally started in the urinary system, could then spread into your testicles and rectum and even into your lower back.  He said sometimes this could happen if you had to go urine but held it back.  So they gave me an antibiotic through the IV.  Well, my urine test finally came back with no infection being found and the nurse made the comment that my urine was very clean.  I told her that because I have only been drinking water for the past 1 \u00bd weeks so I probably flushed my system very well.  However, after having the unpleasant feeling of someone digging n your rectum I continuously had to go to the bathroom.  After doing some research on the internet I found that this is a symptom of prostatitis.  However the urge to go constantly never started until my ER doctor did the internal exam.  Before I left the hospital I went to the bathroom 3 times in under an hour.  I am currently going about twice and hour.  I am still drinking water.  I have had no problems going poop and lately I seem to fart a lot.  However, the urge to fart a lot started after my first passing of my kidney stone.  This morning I woke up and got out of bed.  My pain in rectum area is still present but it does not hurt as much.  Also the pain in my lower back is still present, but also does not hurt as much  However, I now have a bloaty feeling on both sides of my chest which I am assuming has to do with my kidneys.  They are not painful, but feels as though someone stuck a balloon in both my sides and started to fill them up with air.  My stomach is also making a lot of noises like it is either hungry or digesting food.  I currently am taking the Levaquin 750MG once a day and have 4 pills left.  The doctor at the Lake Regional Hospital in Osage Beach, MO gave prescribed me a 7 day supply.  My testicles are still tender to the touch and now  the tip and shaft of my penis has a painful feeling.  Also, I forgot to mention, but there are no lumps of any kind on my testicles.  It hurts to urinate a little, but not a lot.  Also, when I sleep at night it hurts to sleep on my back because of the pressure it puts on my butt.  A couple of nights ago I slept on my side the entire night and I woke up 100% pain free.  There was nothing in the testicles, rectum, or lower back area.  This is however, before I started the Levaquin 750MG.  However, after moving around for about 15 minutes all the pain returned.  What are your thoughts?  Feel free to ask more questions and I will answer them the best I can.\n\n",

To best look for prostatitis, the first part of the urine stream should be examined.  This occasionally is done incorrectly as a general urine culture is usually collected by first urinating some, then collecting urine for a sample.  If this is done, prostatitis may be missed.  Your symptoms still may be consistent with urinary tract stones.   You may consider completing a full treatment of antibiotics for prostatitis.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor closely to ensure that the proper diagnosis is made.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring pain in the urethra",
    "content": "i'm 24 male. After having unprotected sex i had felt a mild discharge from my penis. Smear and gram stain came out negetive. After that i had a pain in the urethra and was adviced to take norfloxacin and lbuprofen but since the culture tests of urine did not come out positive i was asked to discontinue the medicine. Following which the urethral pain vanished but i started experiencing pain in my right testicle and was prescribed a doxycycline tab to be taken twice daily for one week. Today i get over with the course and the testicular pain has vanished but i am experiencing a pain in the urethra(lower side of penis shaft) again. I have done a VDRL(blood) test but the reports came out negetive and so was told not to worry about possible STD's. I have been having some problem or the other for a month now and have not been able to get a diagnosis. Could you be kind enough to assess my situation and tell me what you think might be the probable reason and what should be my course of action. Also i did feel a pain in my abdominal region on the right side but it is gone now. Also there are a few small red rashes on my penile head that seem to appear and disappear time and again. thanx in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Part of my response depends on what the urine was tested for.  Generally, urine is often sent only for a bacterial culture.  This is not sufficient to rule out infection with chlamydia or gonorrhea.    I would be suspicious of the presence of an STD. Gonococcal or non-gonococcal urethritis can cause your symptoms, including the onset of the testicular pain as the infection ascends the urethra.  There is a urine based test for gonorhea and chlamydia but it is not necessarily available at all labs.  If it is not, a culture can be done via a urethral swab.  The doxycycline will treat chlamydia but is likely to miss gonorrhea.  The two often run together.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "well i was given azithromycin 250mg to be taken twice daily for 3 days and doxycycline 100 twice daily for 10 days.....the pain in my testicle has come down but the pain in my right flank has not. Also i did a prostatic smear for gram stain which showed a few pus cells and gram positive cocci....the culture states that the coccus is staphylococcus aureus. Now my question is can this cause pus cells in the prostatic smear and urine/stool...is it possible that i donot have an std at all because i heard that gonorrhea causes gram negetive cocci..or is it that the culture was not properly done because i am given to believe that this coccus is already present in the human body....my doctor insists on me having the medicines because of the presence of pus cells in the smear and urine/stool even though there hasnt been a definitive test for any kind of std. Also the culture shows that this coccus is resistant to penicillin,doxycycline and azithromycin  but highly sensitive to ofloxacin, tobramycin and meropenem. could this also be the cause of my testicular pain. What is your take on it because i don't seem to be getting a diagnosis thanks and regards.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few things to consider.  First, I would agree with your doctor that you should finish the azithromycin and doxicycline.  These will treat gonorrhea and chlamydia.  You are correct that gonorrhea is a gram negative cocci.  It typically pairs itself and looks like a kidney bean-thus termed a diplococcus.  Grams stain and culture may not always show these infections, especially chlamydia.  The better tests are DNA probes for the bacteria.  Regarding the staph, it can cause infection.  It also lives on the skin of at least 30% of people if not more.  In these patients it can be difficult to determine if the staph is a skin contamination or if it truly is causing infections.  The sensitivities that you list are not commonly used oral medications for staph.  The important question is whether or not the staph is methicillin sensitive.  Based on the susceptibility to tobramycin I am assuming this is methicillin sensitive.  As such, a medication such as cephalexin would be an appropriate choice.  The azithromycin and doxicycline are unlikely to treat the staph.  As for whether or not this is causing an infection, given the presence of pus it is safest to assume that this is an infection and I would recommend treatment.  However, I would completely defer to your doctor's opinion as I have not examined you nor seen your test results directly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Right at the begining I wud like to thank you so much for providing me with the support and suggestions. Following my doctors advice i have had azithromycin 250mg twice daily for three days and doxycycline 100mg twice for 10 days. Following this my doctor had prescribed cynomycin 100 once daily for 10 days followed by sparfloxacin 200mg once daily for 10 days because he said that it would cure prostatitis. I have had the cynomycin and am having the sparfloxacin tablets now. I donot have any irritation or pain in urinating but i still have a colorless and odorless discharge from my penis and the tip of the glans is still red. Also i have a few red rashes on my penis. The discharge seems to be more right after ejaculation or when i am erect and the rashes appear more prominently if my glans is not exposed to anaerobic conditions(because i am not circumcised) and the appereance of the rashes is almost immidiate. This is starting to make me suspect that the staph identified in the culture is causing balanitis or might it be an yeast infection.Or is it possible that if i did have gonorrhea or chlamydia these symptoms persist for a few days. Also recently i have seen a few small red rashes that appear like blisters and turn brown after a few days on my chest and lower leg. Do you think they are connected or am i worrying too much?? My doctor has asked me to just finish the course of medicines and conduct a routine urine test in the first week of may and insists that if no pus cells are found then everything would be fine. But these rashes on my glans which refuse to go and the new rashes on my lower leg and chest are making me loose my sleep over them. Also could the colorless odorless discharge be any kind of  glandular fluid or discharge from the glans due to balanitis. What is your take on it. Thanks in advance!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I have been faithful to the same girl for nearly a year now.  Last 4-5 days, I have noticed an increased pain when urinating.  Last 2 days are hell as I have now noticed white/brown pus as well as blood discharging from the end of my penis which is bright red in colour.  Sometimes, my balls/prostates also hurt when I stand up.    My research has led me to believe that I have gotten Chlamydial Urethritis (apologise for misspelling).  My questions are:  a.  Can I have had Chlamydia for longer than a year and not noticed any symptoms?  b.  Can one get Chlamydia from oral contact like French kissing (I understand one can get it from oral sex)  c.  Is my diagnosis correct?  My partner has had a very active sex life until I met her and I wonder if this has remained so for the past year since I have been with her.  She says that she has not had sex with anyone else but this leads me to think that she might not be 100% honest.  Please answer asap as we are going to the Doctor in a few hours.  Would like an answer before she wakes up.\n\n",

    "content": "Gonorrhea and chlamydia are both common causes of urethritis in men.  Both are often assymtomatic infections, especially in men.    When symptomatic, chlamydia is usually symptomatic within about 3 weeks.  Gonorrhea may take 3-4 weeks to become symptomatic.  While it is definitely possible to be infected for longer than a year, it would be a little strange for the infection to suddenly become symptomatic after a year.  There are some non-STD possibilities as well so I recommend that you be tested to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there!  I'm a 25 yo female and had a question about needing to urinate at night time.   I've noticed in the last few months that I seem to need to urinate at night time a fair bit. During the day I go approx 3 times, which is normal for me. I go to the toilet before bed, and try not to drink anything after 7.30pm but still I tend to wake up at about 11.30pm (or before I manage to fall asleep) and need to go again, then I\u2019ll usually wake up at about 4.00am or approx 7.00am and have to go again. I don't drink allot of water during the day but found that even when I did drink water during the day (approx 500ml), it didn't make much of a difference.  I don't have any history of bladder problems and had a UTI once about 3 years ago, so I'm convinced it's something I'm doing.  My question is, is there anything I can do to help my bladder from filling at night so much or what type of things should I avoid drinking later in the day? Is this unusual and should I consult my GP?  Thanks for reading  :)\n\n",

    "content": "There are many causes of your symptoms.  If it is solely a problem at night, illnesses such as diabetes, etc. are less likely as these would also produce increased daytime urination.  None-the-less it is a good idea to get a urinalysis performed to be sure there is not increased amounts of sugar or other issues.  In some people a hormone called anti-diuretic hormone (ADH) is secreted less at night increasing urine production.  The reason for this is unknown.  Some people also seem to have less bladder capacity at night (also for unknown reasons).  I would recommend that you see your doctor to discuss treatment options.  There are some medications taken at night that can significantly improve this problem.    Best wishes.\n\n",

There are other medications that can be used such as tolterodine (Brand name Detrol) if you are unable to use the ditropan.  Also muscle strengthening exercises known as kegels can help some.  Kegels are essentially just repeated contraction of the muscle you would used to stop urination.  (Do not perform these while urinating.)  Usually, one would start with 10 contractions per set.  The muscle is contracted and held for a few seconds then relaxed.  Start with 1 set 3-4 times per day and work up until several sets can be done at a time several times per day.    Seeing your urologist will be helpful to get a more specific plan for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Stratton46: Have you ever had a prostrate exam?  The prostrate gland encirles the urethra and if it is enlarged it can  restrict the flow of urine.  While enlarged prostrates are usually thought of as disease of the middle aged or elderly it is not unknown for younger men to have it as well. Also a urinary tract infection can cause a feeling of not completely finishing urinating. A check up is needed to test the urine for infection and if you have one, a simple course of antibiotics should clear it up.  So without a check up it is not possible to know what is causing the problem. Best wishes, Carolyn LPN\n\n",

Nocturia subsided for a while, but has returned over the last month, and has gotten worse to the point I'm getting up 3x at night to pee, and afterward lay in bed and cant' sleep because of discomfort in my lower abdomen, also am having some lower right back pain. I don't have urinary frequency during the day.  I went to gyno, who did vag. ultrasound which showed nothing. He suggested using stool softener for a while to see if it would work for bloating, and may relieve pressure on my bladder. He suggested I have a colonoscopy if symptoms don't subside after a month. I have also seen a gp (for gerd symptoms), who took a urine sample, and did bloodwork, but have not heard back yet. The bloating is still there, but it has stayed the same. Please advise. I'm so tired from lack of sleep. Could it be kidney stones?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Woofer,  What is the amount of urine? Do you have any other symptoms such as burning urination or blood in the urine besides the low abdominal pain? Do you drink a lot of fluids before going to bed? Do you drink a lot of caffeine or alcohol? Do you take any medications?  This could be due to a variety of reasons including urinary tract infection, diabetes, high blood pressure, renal failure, overactive bladder or congestive heart failure.  Some patients who suffer from sleep disorders such as sleep apnea will sometimes mistake their reason to awaken to be voiding rather than the sleep disturbance.  If you don't have any symptoms or signs suggestive of the above medical conditions and all the blood tests and urine tests are negative, i suggest that you see a urologist.

    "content": "The first time I urinate, it's an average amount, then a little less each time after that. Occassionally, over the last couple of months, I've had some burning, but it subsides before the day is over. I had a uti about two months ago for which I took anitbiotics.   I don't have any other signs of diabetes, nor does it run in my family. I am a quite active person and run on the treadmill at the gym four times a week with no signs of heart issues. Also yesterday during intercourse there was some pain on that side also, and today I've had some burning. It is just so strange. The burning has not been the most frequent symptom. I'll go to bed around 10:30, and get up at 3:00 to pee. Then it's hard to go back to sleep and my lower right abdomen area just feels uncomfortable, sometimes a burning. Not really painful, but it doesn't feel right. Then I'll finally fall back asleep, usually to wake at 5:00 to go again, at which point the discomfort is not as bad. This morning, however, it was the worst it's been. I've had some burning all day.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Im a 24 year old female. and here's whats happening.  My symptoms: - Vaginal Milky discharge with itching and burning - Bladder/Pelvic pain with tenderness - Burning after urinating and worsening of pelvic and back pain - Sudden urge to urinate. - Lower and Upper back pain and tenderness - Back pain and front pain never connect (as it does with kidney infection or stones) - Back pain is all around constantly but also theres a sharper pain that travels my back upwards and stops a little before my shoulders. (Almost like waves)  It all started about 10 days ago when i had and still have a - Vaginal Milky discharge with itching and burning I went to see my Gynocologist and as a routine check up, they tested my urine. They found blood in it, microscopicly (Hematuria). She also swabbed me for STDs and other cultures. Suspecting I had UTI she gave me atibiotics for treating UTI. As I started with the antibiotics, I started suffering from back pain and pelvic pain. The results for UTI and STDs and other cultures she did all came back NEGATIVE  Now I suffer from all the symptoms I mentioned above. When I went to see my primary care doctor. He was suspecting Kidney or Bladder infection or just simply Kidney stones but thought the pain and symptoms I have were rather strange.  I was in the Emergency Room two nights ago and I''ve had - Vaginal Ultrasound - Abdominal Ultrasound to check ovaries, kidneys, uterus, bladder... - Blood tests - Urine tests - CAT Scan ALL NEGATIVE except the unexplainable Blood in the urine and the severe pain with the discharge. With two doctors in the ER they still could not figure out why I have these symptoms They sent out blood to do some CRP(C-reactive protein) and ESR (Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate) testing. The results are not back yet. Meanwhile they gave me some pain medicine, for the severe pains I have and yet the pain pills are not working as strong as they should. First day on the pain meds, the rhumatism residue I have in my knee started to hurt. (I had rhumatism when I was young and got treated for it) The second day my throat hurts. Third day (today the 29th) i woke up with a really strong pressure/pain front and back. I felt like i was a squised sanwich.  Any ideas? I really don't know how to categorize this but I noticed topics about blood in urine in The Urology Topics.\n\n",

It may also be a good idea to try an empiric treatment for gonorrhea and chlamydia if STD's are possible.  The testing for these are not 100% sensitive and may miss some infections.  I would recommend you follow up with your gynecologist.  You may also want to have the calcium level in your urine tested.  Even without stones, elevated calcium in the urine can cause blood and pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your answer Dr. Lowe  I just wanted to give you an update. Maybe help clarify some things.  I forgot to mention how this thing started. When i had the burning, itching milky discharge. My gynecologist put me on yeast infection treatment without seing me, which did not help but only reduced a little of the burning. I was tested for: Chlamydia, Gonorrhea, Trichomoniasis, Bacterial Infections and Yeast Infection. Both with my gynecologist and then tested in the hospital and all results were negative. I also have not been sexual active for at least a few years. It is possible that these negative test results could be wrong and i still can have one of these infections and/or diseases?  My ESR test results came back and the rate is 25. while maximum rate for a female of my age is 20. Does this mean i have an infection?  My gynecologist has informed me that she feels she cannot do anything else and that is up to ca urologist or my primary doctor to handle this issue even though i continue to have burning and pain when i urinate and a white milky discharge.. So im confused. Is this a gynecological issue or is this not?  My urine was tested with my primary care doctor, my gynecologist and the doctors in the ER. I am assuming that at some point a calcium test would have been done as a routine check up. is that true?  I am suffering from constipation and i get extreme pain and fatigue right before i have to go to the bathroom accompanying with the same crawling up around my back pain that i mentione earlier.  My urine has had this white dusty/powedery substance dispersed throughout it for a long time but yesterday the substance came out as if a spoon of poweder was dumped onto the urine so it was more in a concentrated area. Ive been drinking an extreme amount of water and this morning my urine was clear and i couldn't tell if there was any white powder substance in it. Also when i drink alot i am experiencing pain in my lower abdomen/pelvic aread which is a little stronger than the initial pain i had.  This is very frustrating because no one seems to have any answers for me, the doctors are not able to tell me whats really happening. Im really hoping that you could offer some insight.\n\n",

If you also have pain on urination this would indicate inflammation of the urethra beyond where the vas deferens connects to the urethra.  Perhaps you have an inflamed muscle.  Ejaculation causes contraction of multiple muscles.  If one was \"pulled\" it could cause pain similar to straining a muscle in another part of the body.  I really cannot come up with a great reason for this.  I would recommend you see a urologist to help diagnose your problem and determine a treatment course.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If this is a relatively recent thing blood is about the only thing that would produce such a color.

The more I have thought about this, I believe this discoloration/bruising/blood must be a result of the discomfort I experienced while having sexual intercourse with my wife three nights ago.  One of us moved in a certain way at the wrong time and my penis \"bent\" in a direction that caused a mild discomfort (at the time) just inside my pubic bone area.  I'm assuming this is where the bruising/bleeding initially occurred, and then the bruised blood moved down the shaft of my penis over the next two days due to gravity.  Does that sound probable in your estimation?  Thanks again, and I will consult with my doctor if for some reason the appearance doesnt improve over the next several days.\n\n",

As such, a PSA is unlikely to be helpful.  Your doctor may still want to do this for thoroughness.    The infectious work up you have had are all appropriate.  As they were all negative it appears that this is unlikely.    Perhaps you have some nerve damage from a trauma or other injury that may be causing pain.  These can be very slow to recover and typically will produce  a burning type of pain.    Unfortunately I'm at a loss for other ideas.  Have you seen a urologist?  This may be of help.

    "content": "To be more specific I went to a dermatologist ruled out skin then the sensation changed more to pressure fullness draggin sensation on testicle feels almost like its being pulled up into stomach which explains the pressure in stomach almsot like lossing my breath, I then went to a basic healt clinic to get stds cleared after that urologist ordered the testicular ultra sound to rule out cycst tumor growth blockage fluid and most importantly torsion after that the hernia idea finally came up which is what prompted the ct scan of pelvis and abdomin. ct was negative waited a while pain persisted I then went to another urologist. After hearing all I had been thru he gave me a thourough physical exam and recommended seeing a surgeon cause he felt an inguial hernia as well. Before I saw the surgeon I went to a private testing clinic that was quite expensive to try to rule out all bacterial and std causes. all tests were negative. surgreon said minor hernia prolly not the cause. I also consulted a gastroenterologist he thinks its not diverticuli clitis or anything just because its mostly groin based but he offered to set up a colonoscopy. Im jsut not sure what the best avenue of approach next is doctor aappointments take so long to get in so i want to go to the right one. A nurse I spoke to says a semen culture is essential and she cant beleive they have yet to order it to rule out epiditimitis which causes this pain. the psa concerns me because so many peopel on posts I read had chronic prostatis as the culprit of this type of pain. Im going nuts over this and im willing to pay anything or fly anywhere to get this treated. I don't want to leave something really gbad to get worse due to misdiagnosies and lack of proffessionalism. I feel my treatment thus far has been neglagant and ive only ruled things out on my own never really getting good advice from the docs ive seen. The only way i made it to all these specialist is thru nurseline which is a service my insurance provides. My primary doc who ive only seen twice as i just moved to florida from milweaukee decided that since I the ct scan was negative for herrnia that paxil would help me? can u beleive that have u ever heard of anxiety meds for goin pain? what a quack. I have absoloutely no history of anxiety depressioj and previous tho this condition I had not seen a doc for 5 years.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible that the hernia is the source of your pain.  Typically, small hernias don't cause much discomfort but it is possible.  Epididymitis should present with pain in the epididymus.  The epididymus is located directly on top of the testis.  It can easily be palpated through the scrotum.  No pain on palpation makes epididymitis very unlikely.  A semen culture can be performed but this is not the typical method of diagnosing epididymitis.  If there is concern about the possibility of such an infection, a treatment course with antibiotics is warranted.    You definitely have a tough case.  I recommend you find a primary care physician that you feel is taking you seriously and pursue the diagnosis with him/her.  Having a good primary care doctor is essential to being able to coordinate all the subspecialists and keep a \"non-tunnel vision\" view of things.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several causes of orchitis.  It most commonly follows a viral infection.  When mumps was common, orchitis was also very common.  Now that mumps is much less commonly seen, orchitis has dropped in numbers.  There are still several other viral causes.  It is most likely that you have had one of these viruses.  Orchitis from a viral agent will generally resolve without incidence.  Most cases resolve in 3-10 days.  The affected testis will often loose a little size in about half the cases.  Fertility is generally not affected with unilateral orchitis.  Follow up with your doctor is important to ensure that there are no other complications forming, such as fluid sacks that can put pressure on the testes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "About 5 years ago during a routine self-exam I found a small lump on the top of my left testicle.  It normally was not painful, but there were bouts of pain on occasion.  I went to see my Urologist and after a routine examination sent me for some scans.  All bloodwork, urine analysis, and scans came back just fine.    Upon visiting next it was concluded that I may have a case of epididymitis.  I took a course of antibiotics which didn't do much to help really.  However, the pain eventually went away.  Well over the last couple of years it has come back, a bit more than usual and more often.  Another visit and another set of scans reveals nothing as well.    My symptoms include the lump I found on my testicle, a rather dull, heavy pain in that general area, and a pain in my left side / thigh.  I am told these are symptoms of epididymitis, which I was diagnosed with.  I've read that this is mainly caused by STDs (which I am clean of), being uncircumcized, or by previous a previous surgery.  None of those apply to me.  Could this just be a rare instance of epipdidymitis, not due to the usual causes?  If my scans and lab-work came back fine, is there still reason to worry it could be something worse?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "The location of the mass is certainly consistent with the epididymus.  Also, your pain symptoms fit this.  Typically, however, antibiotics should help rather than having the pain go away on its own slowly.  One other possible thought would be an intermittently torsing appendix testis.  This is basically a small amount of testes tissue that is located outside the testes.  It often will have its own blood supply and can twist (or torse) resulting in cutting off blood flow causing pain.  Your symptoms aren't classic for this but it is a thought.  If this is the cause, the torsion ultimately leads to the \"death\" of the appendix testis and the pain subsides.  This is not a dangerous situation, only painful.  I recommend following up with your urologist if the pain persists.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, i am writing this for my 85 years old mother who has type 2 diabetes, under control though by diet alone. She has lost almost 70 % of her body muscle mass since about  a year ago after we tried to unsuccessfully shift her to Zoloft from Xanax due to her insomnia but due to really bad Xanax withdrawl symtoms, ultimately had to put her back on increased dose of Xanax (1 gram)  in three divided doses daily. Since last couple of weeks or so she has developed nocturia which requires her to make hourly trips to the bathroom to void her bladder and she says the first time she goes at night, the quantity of urine is more but it gets lesser  on subsequent trips. She does not appear to have any kind of incontinence as there is no involuntary loss of urine, just the excessive number of times she has to go (she feels tingling in her feet and and / or some pulsations in her bladder  area which makes her too uncomfortable to resist the urge to go). About seven years ago she had surgery for the removal of a crcinoid tumour from  the mesenteric wall of her large intestine and she was fully recovered. Beside Xanax she currently also takes adalat retard (nifedipine) 1/2 tablet daily and 1 Oscal/day.  I wonder if there is some medicine of benefit to her condition, as she is too weak for any surgery.  Thanks and best regards\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 17 year old male. A few months ago I found a small pea sized lump on the right side of my scrotum. I went to see a doctor about it and it was diagnosed as an epididimal cyst. I had and ultrasound to verify make sure the doctor was right (which he was), but they found what they thought was a varicocele on the left side. I went to a urolologist about a week ago to check that out but he found nothing and said i have nothing to worry about. However, over the past few days, my left testicle has been aching. I found a lump on the bottom of the testicle that feels like it is a vein and it enlarges when I bear down. Should I wait for a while to see if it goes away or should I go back to the doctor for a second examination.  I also have another problem wich isn't really related to the above. I found a lump right next to the base of the scrotum on the left side ( not actually in the scrotum) that is also the size of a pea. This is what I'm most worried about because I just noticed it today and it dosn't feel anything like the cyst I mentioned before. If anybody could tell me what this might be I would be extremely thankfull as I will not be able to visit a doctor for the next few days because I am traveling out of state to visit family.\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding the varicoceole, this is basically a collection of veins that enlarge within the scrotum.  It generally is an innocent finding.  Occasionally it is associated with infertility.  If this is an issue, it can be repaired.  Generally they are not painful.  They are often more prominent upon standing.    If you are experiencing pain, I recommend that you be evaluated by your doctor.  If the pain is severe you should go to the emergency room do to the possibility of testicular torsion.    Regarding your lump, I'm a little uncertain as to the location of this lump but in general, there are a few possibilities.  It may be a lymph node in the area that has become a little larger in response to an infection.  If the lump is actually on the scrotum it should be evaluated due to the possibility of testicular cancer (unlikely but possible).  Also less likely, it may be a lipoma (a small, benign fat cell tumor).    Follow up with your doctor is important, but as long as you are not having significant pain (anything more than a minor discomfort) you can wait to be evaluated until you get back.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,  Ive had dull pain in my left testicle groin area for almost a year now. It started out slowly with a pulling feeling on my left testicular region while standing periodically, then got substantially worse and hurt while sitting in the car, stand, almost everything. After about a week or so it went back to a dull pain/numbing ever since then.   I have also periodically a pinpoint (always in the same spot) pulling feeling in my lower abdomin on the left side sometime when i strain my abdimon or twist my torso greatly to on degree or the other. Also my bowel movements have changed since then, most always very loose and acidic, and abnormally foul smelling. And i seem to experience a difference in the severity of the pain before and after bowel movements.  Also, it 90% of the time feels better when i wake up in the morning, or if i do nothing but lay around all day. Which makes me think its a hernia of some sort, but i do have a small lump at the top (not side) of my left testicle, which as far as i can tell hasent changed size in the last 8-9 months. Which is why im scared it might be TC.  Ive never had any swelling, tenderness, hydrocele, or change in size of the testicle ever. Ive also had a testcular exam by two \"walk-in\" care doctors, who said it didnt seem like it was a concern. They didnt even notice the lump. Ive also had a CT scan, testicular ultrasound, Colonoscopy, and when it very first started about 9-10 months ago a general surgeon did a ultrasound on my abdomin.  I have an appointment this friday with a urologist, which ill be brining my ultrasound results (which had already been cleared by another doctor who said ti seemed fine just a few cysts.....but i never really got a detailed report on it, just was told that over the phone) Just to hopefully rule out this possiblity.  So im just asking if i should still be concerned about TC, because its really making me nervous. after 9-12 months should i have noticed more severe symptoms by now if it was TC? Doctors cant find a hernia either, everyones kinda stuck on what to do. Although i have heard this is kind of common in a very small hernia where i might have to see a specialist to find.  Over all id just like any suggestions, or chances it could be TC versus a hernia.  sorry for the long post, just wanted to be thorough. Thanks.\n\n",

Do you notice that with straining or increasing your abdominal pressure (as if bearing down to have a bowel movement) you develop a bulge in the groin area?  This would be consistent with a hernia that is only present during increased abdominal pressure.  An ultrasound of the inguinal area that includes images with increased abdominal presssure may be helpful.  Also, you may be experiencing some intermittent compression or twisting of the spermatic cord that carries the blood vessels, etc. to the testes.  This can cause significant pain.  Your urologist will be able to look for these types of things.  The lump you feel on top of the testes may be the epididymis.  Basically this is the collecting system for the testes to store semen.  It generally does not feel hard, however, so an evaluation is important.  I think you are on the right track by seeing the urologist.  He will be able to evaluate for many of the possible causes of your pain.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply   No when i bear down on my abdomin i do not feel increased pain or discomfort or even a buldge. Nor do i feel any different when i lift something heavy. Only when im say laying on my back and lift my feet up or go to sit up i can feel a little mroe discomfort there.  And it doubt its strain on any chords only to the fact that i can always feel it. 24/7 i feel that dull ache in my testicle, and about 40% of the time i can feel it in that spot in my abdomin as well.  And that lump that i have found is hard. its not huge, everyone says abou the size of a \"pea\" which for a lump is fairly substanial, but this one is about half the size, if not even less than that. But it is deffinetly hard.   If it could be TC coudl it be possible they missed it with 3 physical exams by diffrent doctors, a ultrasound of the testicles, and an abdominal CT?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 25 year old male who, since 2005, have been having a lot of buttock, groin, back, and genital pain. Always feels like something is inside my urethra and some strange discharge. Anyway, during that time, I went to a urologist who did urine studies, eps culture, ivp, and kidney ct. Nothing was found, but I tried doxycycline followed by levaquin and no resolve. Anyway, I branched out and went to a regular doc who did routine blood work and also a gastro doc who did a colonoscopy. All these tests are normal. Fast forward to 2007, I still have the same symptoms all this time. It's a nightmare. Anyway, it's like this strange urethral discharge, sort of like liquid, but white like which keeps making me think it's urological. But, maybe it's neurological. It's usually when I am starting to have a bowel movement, it comes out first. Anyway, any ideas what to look into next?\n\n",

    "content": "Here is some more info.  Basically, I have this sort of feeling like something is near the end of my urethra just like sitting there inside, even when I'm just walking around.  During bowel movements, the pressure gets insane almost like the muscles to squeeze things out the urethra are being activated, even when nothing is supposed to come out.  So, unless I have to urinate as well, I just makes the crazy feeling up front, but nothing comes out.  Other times, it forces me to urinate right away during bowel movements.  Anyhow, bowel movements themselves are difficult, like something is restricting them, not sure what though.  I think it goes hand-in-hand with the pressure it's creating in the urethra.  However, 2 colonoscopies and abdominal ct don't reveal anything about the bowels that would suggest they are blocked.   Also, another strange thing, I feel that same pressure even if I'm just like passing gas.  It's like the passing of gas somehow gives this sensation near the end of my urethra instead, as if it was coming out there, but it isn't.    Any ideas on possible things to look into?  Best way I can describe is this, and maybe only males would understand this.  Sometimes, probably rarely, you will have a very hard bowel movement which causes pressure up front, probably something with the prostate.  Well, I now have that feeling even without bowel movements, and even the simplest ones amplify the feeling, and even just passing gas amplifies it.\n\n",

However, he has only ever ejaculated completely clear semen. It has been slightly thick, like a gel, but not whitish at all. He is 27 years old and we have sex only a few times a month and he doesn't masturbate more than once or twice a month, so I know it's not that he is just ejaculating too often. Could this clear semen mean that he has a low sperm count? We would like to start trying for children in about a year so this is obviously of some concern.  He is the first one in his family to have had phimosis and no one in his family has had any infertility issues in the past.  He is not currently taking any medications.  Thank you!\n\n",

At the same time they did urine test and found microscopic blood in urine.  They did CT adn found nothing - which i believe ruled out kidney and bladder stones.   He does take blood pressure medication - but the doctor did not seem to think that it would cause blood in urine - although i always thought so. No he is scheduled for Cyctoscopy.  Do you think it might be something serious?  He is very young. In addition, close to a month ago he got this rush on his body.  I have done some research and read about swimmer's itch which also causes blood in urine?  Is it possible?  He has been swimming in the pool at the time he got it.

    "content": "Blood in the urine is a common problem. The medical term for red blood cells in the urine is hematuria. Sometimes blood in the urine is a sign of a more serious problem in the urinary tract. Other times it is not serious and requires no treatment.    In men, the genitals and prostate are considered part of the urinary system. The prostate surrounds the urethra in men. It is made up of glands that secrete a fluid that is part of semen. The prostate often becomes enlarged in older men.  Blood in urine is not always visible. If the amount of blood is small, the urine looks normal. This is called microscopic hematuria because the blood cells are visible only under a microscope. Typically, this is discovered when you have a urine test for some other reason.  A trace amount of blood in your urine is normal. The average person with a healthy urinary tract excretes about 1 million red blood cells (RBC) in the urine each day. This amount of blood is not visible. This is not considered hematuria.  An abnormal amount of blood in the urine can be acute (new, occurring suddenly) or chronic (ongoing, long term). Acute hematuria can occur just once, or it can occur many times.  However, a Cyctoscopy should be done to rule out any possibility of Cancer being present.  Keep In Touch  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms may be that of intermittent testicular torsion.  This is when the testis twists around on the spermatic cord that carries the blood vessels to the testis cutting off blood flow.  When the testis does not untwist it can cause the testis to die.  Generally testicular torsion is quite painful so this may not be what is going on.  I advise you to see your doctor about this for evaluation as there are a few other causes of the symptoms you are describing.  If you begin to experience significant pain you should see a doctor right away.  Testicular torsion is considered a medical emergency.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having chronic left flank pain now for months.  I am a 47 year old female.  I have had a hysterectomy and my right ureter reimplanted due to complications from removing my righ ovary 6 years ago.   Over the past months my left flank has been swelling.  You can see it with the naked eye.  It is getting worse.  I feel pressure as well as pain.  It came on suddenly and has never left.  Ultrasound and CT scan are negative except for a little abnormality of left kidney.  They said not vary impressive.  Interestingly enough, they put me on steroids for inflammation and on the third day you could see a huge difference in the swelling and the pressure is not as bad.  My urine output has also increased since the steroid therapy.  Although urine is clear with trace blood. The pain and intense pressure is to the point that it is getting much worse.  Steroids do help some. History....mva 2 years ago...C7 sublexation.  Also, I am now having severe left sided hip pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms are quite interesting. When you say that your urine output has increased, did you notice that you had difficulty urinating before the steroids-as if something was obstructing the urine flow?  Also, could you see the swelling at the time the ultrasound and CT scan were done?  If so, did they comment that the soft tissues appeared edematous?  I can think of several causes of abdominal/pelvic swelling but they should be seen on a CT scan.  I would recommend that you continue to follow up with your doctor.  An MRI may give better evaluation of the soft tissues to look for swelling or other anomalies.  Sorry I can't be of much more help at this point.  Direct physical examination is important and I encourage you to keep working with your doctor until a cause is found.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

Relief would be the word....As for the scans., the CT didn't show much of anything so they said but the ultrasound showed some edema with soft tissue and the left kidney a bit different but nothing major.  The pain still continues.  One note that I didn't mention before....the pain is from the upper left abdominal quadrant and wraps around the left side to the middle of my back.  The point of the most intense pain moves around from time to time.  Also, when I am most swollen, I feel a frequent flutter just below my sternum.  It drives me nuts because it won't stop.  And...I can't lay down on my right side as too much intense pressure is on my left and I can't stand it. I plan to keep trying to get to the bottom of this because I have to resolve it.  It is getting worse.\n\n",

    "content": "Do you know if the CT scan that was performed was done with contrast or without.  To most effectively pick up kidney stones, contrast is the best.  A non-contrast CT, or a CT that had too thick of cuts may miss the stone.   Your pain symptoms are quite suspicious for a kidney stone.  In addition, steroids would help decrease inflammation and possibly alleviate an obstruction due to swelling around a stone or other blockage.  The blood in the urine fits this diagnosis as well.  Ultrasounds will show stones if they happen to be in the kidney.  If the stone has moved into the ureter and ultrasound is less effective at seeing them.  CT scan with contrast is the best way to find them.  I encourage you to continue to follow up with your doctor, and possibly see a urologist for further diagnostic testing.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "10mm X 6mm Kidney Stone and Stent placement.",
    "content": "Hello,    I am a 24 y.o. male who is \"to put it nicely\" a little mad.  About 5 months ago I had an M.R.I. done, along with 2 x-rays.  These revealed a 10 x 6mm kidney stone in the middle of my kidney.  I have never particularly liked my doctor as he seems like he doesn't really like his job.  I asked him what was to be done about this kidney stone, and he told me word for word \"Nothing! Come back when you start having pain.\"  I told my dad this, and he said that I should eventually switch doctors.  Well, I live in western pennsylvania, but just recently went back up to Toledo, Ohio for my last semester of school.  Wednesday morning I woke up with severe pain in my right kidney, lower right abdomen, and right testicle.  I felt light headed, nauseated, could barely walk, stand, lay down, or sit.  I didn't know what was going on, and could barely take the pain.  I contacted my doctor at home and he said to go to the emergency room.  Upon arriving to the emergency room, they hooked me up to an IV, and gave me a ton of pain killers. They withdrew blood, and gave me (I think) a CT Scan.  The doctor came in and told me that I had a huge kidney stone that had no chance of passing, and was causing things to be blocked up.  I was admitted overnight and was told that I would have surgery the next morning.  The following morning I had a STENT placed and was released hours later.  I am currently on Vicodin which is to be taken (2 every 4-6 hours), and Levaquin (levofloxacin)  (1 daily).  The Vicodin completely knocks me out, and I find myself barely able to walk more than 5-10 minutes without it.  I start my last semester of school this coming monday and am worried that I am going to miss classes.  I have to strain all urine every time I go to the bathroom, and find it always to be extremely painful, and bloody.  I don't have another appointment with my urologist until January 11th, where he is doing x-rays.  After the x-rays he said we'll make another appointment to go in an laser the stone to get rid of it and take out the stent.  This might be for another two weeks.  Now that I got all of this information out, here is my question?   Now that I am going to have to fork out all this money for surgery, medication, and doctor visits, and I might miss the first two weeks of school because of this kidney stone surgery, I am wondering if this could have been provented?  Is there something that my doctor could have done when we first found out about the stone?  Or was this inevitable?   Like I said, I am a little upset with the outcome and setbacks this is going to cause.  My blood pressure has also been a little high for the past couple months, and my urologist said this might have been the cause? Is this possible? Please give me some feedback....Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Large kidney stones, such as yours, are less common than the smaller variety.  Depending on the availability, some urologists are able to use a form of ultrasound (called lithotripsy) to break up the stone into smaller, more easily passed stones.    If there is a lot of blockage and swelling, as you are describing, stents can be placed to \"hold the ureter open\" and allow the stones and urine to pass.    Your urologist can help you to determine the cause of the stone.  After the stone is passed, it can be analyzed to determine its makeup.  Most commonly they are calcium stones.  To help in prevention, it is important to drink lots of fluids.  Also, occasionally, some people secrete excess calcium into the urine causing a predisposition for stone formation.    Kidney stones can be excruciatingly painful.  Hopefully you will pass it soon.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

These diseases include: - Urinary tract infection a simple urine analysis and culture will diagnose. Dysuria, frequency, or pain are usually present.   - Metabolic diseases like Diabetes but other symptoms of the disease will be present like polyuria etc. And blood sugar test will help in the diagnosis.

    "content": "Hi, im a 24 year old male  my symptoms started about a week and a half ago when I woke up in the night with what I can describe as extreme sharp burning pain on my left side a little above the groin area but below the stomach, this lasted a day and slowly went away... then a few days later my bladder started really hurting expecially if I sat or lied down. It feels like there is  sharp pain with some pressure on my bladder, this makes me feel like I constantly have to go to the bathroom and also produces some burning pain from the base of my penis back to the blader, it does not hurt to pee. I went to the urgent care by my house and they did a urine test, no infection, and then they did a ultrasound on my kidneys, blader and prostate, test came back pretty good except for quite a bit of calcium deposits along my uretha. The pain is only getting worse and now the pain in my groin/stomach area is back, last night I was feeling around in that groin/stomach area where the pain was and I found a small lump I could move it around a little bit, when I pushed on it it produced extreme pain in my bladder area... it made me want to go to the bathroom I did when I went back to bed I can no longer find the lump... sorry for the lenghty story... what could this be? im worried I have cancer or something they didnt find, could this be a urology problem, or a GI problem? what ever it is it seems to effect both areas, im seing a urologist wednesday and I just wanted a 2nd opinion till then, thanks agian\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I did not understand well what did you mean by they find (bit of calcium deposits along your uretha), this is not a usual finding and should be investigated. This may indicate that there is a possibility of stones in the urinary tract and could be the cause of these symptoms, probably it is a small stone that moved with little pain till there was an obstruction that results in the pain you felt this week.  A 24-hour urine collection to check for calcium, phosphate, urate, oxalate etc as they all may lead to stone formation.   CT scans and IVP can identify most of kidney stones but have some limitations.   A Spiral CT scan (does not need a contrast) is of choice in evaluating kidney stones as it can identify stones regardless of composition.   - Other causes  to be excluded include:  urinary tract infections (with organisms other than bacteria),  sexually transmitted diseases,  bacterial prostatitis,  prostatic enlargement   - Of significance your past history of Drug intake as some drugs may affect in the contractility of the bladder wall.   - interstitial cystitis painful bladder syndrome (PBS) is diagnosed by exclusion of all other causes.  I could not get also a clear idea about the swelling you felt, (where exactly you felt it).  You may need to repeat the urine analysis, do a CBC, IVP or CT Scan of the abdomen and pelvis according to the urologist advice.  Urological consultation is essential. Keep us updated.

    "content": "Hello,   Possible causes of scrotal swelling include inguinal hernia, , hydrocele, varicocele and cancer. Other causes that are less common in adults include lymphedema, and a spermatocele.   - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, the pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors. Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself.   - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle and may be the result of a direct injury. Alternatively, it can occur spontaneously in the remnants of an embryonic sac that remains formed around the testicle from birth.   Small hydroceles may hardly be noticed and often resolve without treatment.   - Testicular cancer usually affects only one testicle. It rarely presents with pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum.   Clinical examination is essential for the diagnosis.

    "title": "Lump under right testicle",
    "content": "I'm 27 years old. One month ago, while playing basket I felt a sharp pain in my testicle, but didn't think about it because i though i just pulled a muscle. Then, while I was performing self exam i found a lump under my testicle, but it is not connected to the testicle itself. It feels like a tube and it gets hard when i'm standing and soft when i'm laying down.  I feel discomfort (emotional and physical) because it's something down there. This got me worried, so I went to see my doctor and he performed a thorough physical exam.  He told me that i should not worry about it because its not on my testicle and he suspect that it is hydrocele or spermatocele. He also said that it looks like its swollen, but some part of it was healing. He suggested to wear scrotal support and put ice pack on it when it hurts. I ask for treatment, but he said it's best to leave it alone.  I was relieved, but then when i looked it up online i saw some different things that may cause this problem and It made me worried again especially TC. So, the following week, I saw a different doctor and told him my situation and told him the what the first doctor told me. He again performed the same physical exam and he said the same thing and told me if it gets bigger like a walnut, I should come back and see him, but he said i should not worry about it because men get this type of thing and he said he sees this type stuff all the time.   My main concern is that while doing research online, most site recommend to get ultra sound, but my doctor never recommended that. Should i worry about it ? Should I see a third opinion?  Oh yeah, they are military doctors.  I know how comparable their experiences are from a regular civilian doctors.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Possible causes of scrotal swelling include inguinal hernia, , hydrocele, varicocele and cancer. Other causes that are less common in adults include lymphedema, and a spermatocele.   - Hernia: It Occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. Usually, the pain and may be a bulge when standing upright, movement, or bearing down are present.   - A varicocele is a dilatation of the veins within the scrotum. Varicoceles are commonly seen on the left side than in the right due to different anatomic factors. Varicocele can lead to discomfort around the testicle, rather than actual pain in the testicle itself.   - A hydrocele is a bag of clear fluid that collects in a sac around the testicle and may be the result of a direct injury. Alternatively, it can occur spontaneously in the remnants of an embryonic sac that remains formed around the testicle from birth.   Small hydroceles may hardly be noticed and often resolve without treatment.   - Testicular cancer usually affects only one testicle. It rarely presents with pain or discomfort in a testicle or the scrotum.   Clinical examination is essential for the diagnosis.  Hydroceles and spermatoceles are diagnosed by \"transillumination,\" a technique in which a light is applied to one side of the scrotum the scrotum.   If the mass  transilluminates, this means it is filled with a clear serous-fluid and a hydrocele or spermatocele are the cause. Other causes like varicocele and cancer do not transilluminate.

Here are my symptoms: - I need to urinate approximately every 2 hours during the night. Daytime urination is somewhat normal. - Whenever I urinate at night it is extremely difficult and I produce very little urine. - I have a mild abdominal pain half way between my belly button and my penis (not sure of the organ) - I often awake up with an erection (multiple times each night) - After ejaculation, the symptoms seem to be \u2018aggravated\u2019 for about 4 days (especially the pain)  Some of my history as follows: - I am very healthy, don\u2019t smoke or drink, exercise regularly - I have had a Cystoscopy that was normal excepting my bladder wall had \u201ca lot of veins\u201d - My PSA is normal but have a larger than normal prostrate (but not large enough to explain these symptoms) - I had various internal muscles \u201cBotoxed\u201d (i.e. take them out of commission) to see if they were responsible but no luck - I have been encouraged to try various drugs to see their effect (Ditropan XL, Vesicare, Enabelex, Flowmax and the bed wetting drug kids use) with little effect - I have tried not drinking before bed with little change   Needless to say, I am desperate and my quality of life is suffering significantly. Please help!  Humbly,  rob\n\n",

Regards the cystoscopy, I do not have any more information other than a comment made by the urologist during the examination that it seemed to have \"more blood vessles than usual\".  2. Regards the urine analysis, it was clear.   3. Regards repeating the tests, the cystoscopy was not repeated but I have had a comprehensive flow analysis (fill my bladder and take photos with an xray machine) This did reveal a very weak flow. This was how they decided to botox certain muscles to see the effects to no avail.   4. I have been checked by a neurologist and have even had a full MRI/MRA of my spine, neck and head. All was clear.  It seems to me that this could be cone of the following 4 things. If you could help me think through which is the most likley and how to know for sure, I would greatly appreciate it. Here they are:  1. Flammatory CPPS - Chronic Pelvic Pain Syndrome (was called non-bacterial prostatodynia and Non-bacterial Prostatitis )   2. Chronic Bacterial Prostatitis   3. Interstitial cystitis (Painful bladder syndrome)   4. Benign prostatic hyperplasia    Thanks,  rob\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You should first go for urine analysis to confirm the presences of sperms (ejaculate) in urine. A urinalysis should be done shortly after ejaculation.  Normally the bladder neck prevents the ejaculate to go backwards and mix with urine.   In some individuals this mechanism is disturbed like in diabetic patients, individuals with prostate enlargement etc. This is known as retrograde ejaculation, some cases are mild and respond well to treatment. Excess masturbation is associated with similar condition, some doctors reported.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "im a 23 year old male.  For the past couple of years i've experienced a increased frequency and difficulty in my urination.  i atleast go once every hour and atleast 2 to 3 times a night.  I also have a difficulty going sometimes, and the stream is usualy weak unless I have held the urination for an uncomfortable amount of time.  Sometimes even after I have urinated I still feel the sensation of having to go.  Also I have noticed when I work out at the gym, for some reason the frequency increases.  I have seen a urologist already and have ruled out prostate, infection, and other common possibilities.  The doctors suspician was that it might be an obstruction, but I didnt think that was logical since he had checked my bladder and it was empty, but i had the sensation of having to urinate.   Some things I felt uncomfortable telling my physician and the urologist was that between the age of 17 and 20 I experienced with some drugs, which i read in another forum might have had affects, and I'm wondering if it can be reversed or treated anyway.  And also I have pleasured myself through anal sex before with toys and ice, which im curious if it had any affect, but with not with another person, so no exchange of bodily fliuds.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been experiencing blood in my urine, gross hematuria. The blood is visible on a daily basis. I've seen multiple Urologists and Nephrologists over the last several months and had just about every test done. Cancer has been ruled out as well as others, sickle cell, tumors etc. I had many blood tests, a kidney biopsy, a Cystoscopy (twice) and CT scan. Nothing has been found. Tomorrow I\u2019m going to have a CT Urogram. At the beginning of this entire episode (last year) my doctor noticed my blood pressure and cholesterol had gone up. He put me on Tarka and Lovastatin which appears to have controlled both. The Urologist put me on LevaQuin for the second time. The first time the blood stopped after the third dose of LevaQuin. About two weeks later the blood reappeared. I also fainted twice during the last several months. The thought hear was low blood sugar levels due to the blood pressure medication or cholesterol, I can\u2019t remember which one at the moment. I had a stress test performed as well as an echocardiogram. Both came back negative. Needless to say I\u2019m very concerned about the continuing blood in my urine. What other conditions could cause this?\n\n",

    "content": "Do you have any faith in the people who are treating you? From my experience i've no faith in the peope i've seen at all . I think a lot of this boils down to the fact that its hard to find someone who actually knows what they are talking about or atually gives a crap about their patients. I've been for an ultarsound, seen two GP's, radiographers and a urologist and i can tell you for a fact that they missed things that i know that i have. I've still got no explanation for what certainthtings are. They've missed huge varacocele veins on my right spermatic cord even though i've been for a scan nd examined. They've also missed a varacocle on my actual testicle and ive stil got no explanation as to why i keep getting hard lump that appears on my left testicle, or the fact that the texture of my left testcle has changed. Also ive been given no explanation as to why my right testicle keeps becomeing swollen, not to mention other problems. The urologist told me i had a small left varacocle and never even mentioned the 3 huge ones in my right spermatic cord. its a joke! From the research  ive done on the net i KNOW that certain and further tests should of been performed on me to rule out other possible problems yet non of this has even been mentioned. I dread to think what woud happen if i ever need a major operation, and ive come to the conclusion that the only way to find out what your problems are and be happy with what thsese peole tell you is to pay a fortune and see top draw urologist etc. Either that or by some miracle stumble upon a team of people who actually give a crap what they are doing. So far i think the so called \"tests\" and \"examinations\" that have been performed on me have just been down right pathetic. The lack of communication, informatin and these peoples in-ability to listen is also a huge problem.  It only takes a days resasch on the net for me to find out what shoudl be done and how thtings should be done when certain conditions/situations are presented. However these clowns don't seem to know anythign or just plain don't care, can't be arsed etc.  I mean its obvous that there is somethign wrong with you and you've had all these tests and examintaions yet none of these people can tell you whats wrong? Its a joke. You can bet your ass that if you paid the earth and visited a top draw team of specialists they woud find out what was wrong in minutes. The problem i've expericend is that  things just are not being done correctly. Are you sure that these people are checkign you over correclty? I can tell you that over here in england in the past two weeks there has been no end of medical f*** ups being reported in the papers and on the news. One guy had his leg cut off when they told him he had a serious bone infection even though they had'nt performed any tests. All the guy had was excema on his leg for christ sake. One kid who was born with only one testcle and was told that he had cancer in his one and only testcile so they removed it even though there was nothign wrong with him at all. Now he has to take testosterone injections to stop himself from growing tits ffs. One guy was told he had testicular cancer and they removed the wrong one, so in the end he had to have the one with cancer removed  so now he's got no testciles and is taking injections too. This is just the start. There are cases of people beign sticthed back up with instruments still  left inside them and all sorts of things. Form what i've expericemd so far from the NHS i'm not suprised.  :-(\n\n",

And one of the problems is that these doctors don't like to be told how to do their job, which i fell is excalty whati needs to be done. It's like i have to downlaod all the information i've leanred from the internet and all the corrct information i can find on how certain scan shoud be perfomred, then take it to the hospital and brief these clowns word for word on what THEY SHOULD ALREADY KNOW AND WHAT THEY SHOUD BE DOING.   Oh and i wond'nt count on this place for any medical advice that you cam't fiugre out for yourself by doing a little reasearch on the net. It takes ages for someone \"qualified\" to reply here, if at all, and even then they just go over the same old stuff that any can learn on the net within n time. I actaully diagnoesed myself  with Superical Dorsal Vein Thrombosis thnks to the net and atleast that was confirmed by the urorgist i saw the other day. Even though i knew i had this months ago and i did'nt need him to disgnoze me. In fact i didnt need him to disgnose me with anything because i already now what i have. What i expected him to do was to send me for further ultrasound tests, considering that i coudl have underlying problems elseswhere that are causing my problems now. Instead i got nothing but a bunch of stuff i already new months ago.  I'm sick of waiting and then being looked at by someone who's a total arse tbh.  Hey check out this ridiculous case which was on the news today. Apppanrelyt hthis is a TOP hospital too. Also there was a guy in the newspaaer today who went for an hernia opertaion and they accidently cut through his spermatic cord so testosterone could'mt flow into his blood stream correclty. The guy actually started growing tits because of the lack of testoerone. This is the type of ***** we have to put up with over here. F******* pathetic.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 65 year old caucasian male.  My only surgeries have been: tonsilectomy, appendectomy, and surgery to remove a large infected mass of muscle tissue in my left upper leg 2.5 years ago.  Fam history:  No history of cancer or heart problems that I am aware of.  Currently not on medications.  My problem:  For several years, I have had a problem with recurring urinary blood and passing large clots through the urinary tract.  This would usually clear up after a matter of 4 or 5 days.  Sometimes it would be several months before it happened again, and then sometimes it might happen again the next week.  When I was was in hospital for the leg surgery, I mentioned this to one of my doctors, and he had tests run for prostate problems, and could find nothing wrong.  (At the time, I was not having one of the periods of blood or clots.  Now, for the first time since the surgery, the problem has returned, and is much wose that it ever was before.  It has been ongoing now for 6 weeks with no relief.  And the clots are larger than ever before.  Some of them are 3 to 4 inches long, and are shaped as I would imagine an artery or vein would look outside the body.  Can someone give me some...any...information about this?  I am absoluely terrified about what is happening, because I am on a very limited budget and can't afford any high priced medical treatment or hospital stay.[/b]\n\n",

With the excessive amount of bleeding as you describe, you may also become anemic from the blood loss. There are programs in most states that provide services for a reduced cost or free typically based on income. I again, advise you to follow-up with your physician or inquire about a referral to a specialist. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Symptoms of diabetes include excessive/extreme thirst, hunger and urination.  It would be very unusual for diabetes to present with a skin rash.  Your description is more concerning for a dermatitis of some type.  There may be a fungal infection, but if it is not responding to fungal creams, that probably isn't it.  I would recommend not using any medication type creams for about a week to see if it heals.  Occasionally, there can be reactions to the medicines.  Possible causes may include contact dermatitis from something that is coming in contact with the skin (possibly from a soap or other lotion) or dyshydrotic eczema due to excess moisture.  Due to the limitations of the internet, I cannot give you a much better diagnosis.  I strongly recommend that you see your doctor for evaluation.  There may be a steroid cream or other medication that can help.  Without a diagnosis I would recommend against using any medicinal creams as they can have significant side effects in the genital area.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I advise you to increase the daily fluid intake and to observe if this color is changing.  If there are other symptoms suggestive of urinary tract infection like, dysuria, frequency, loin or pelvic pain etc,  You should inform your Doctor and to do urine analysis as an initial investigation.  Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Suspected urological problem, but nothing found...",
    "content": "In April 2005, I woke up and my back and butt were sweating.  As the day progressed, they start burning like crazy, seemingly sensitive only to things touching against them like the bed or my chair.  Sitting in my chair for more than a few minutes produced insane burning in my butt, so much so that it seems to go numb.  They seem slightly relieved upon standing, almost fully reversing the pain, but not 100%.  The next day, I start having difficulty both urinating and with bowel movements.  It just seems like the pelvis area is swollen inside like something is blocking them.  It's extremely difficult to urinate and have bowel movements now, 20 months later still.  The pain in my butt and lower back is insane, and makes me feel like I have totally been restructured physically.  I really feel as if something has totally shifted in my body.  I have this extremely bad pain in my right side near my ribs and flank area that runs into my right groin and right testicle, and right buttock.  Even the right leg.  The pubic area has a lot of pressure on it and my penis/urethra hurts very bad near the end, independent of using the bathroom.  Basically, I have very bad pains day in and day out and marked difficulty using the bathroom, but absolutely no explanation.  I haven't been able to find a good doc yet that will give me the time of day.  I have been to a urologist, but he couldn't find the problem with a urine culture and eps culture and ivp to look at kidneys, as well as scrotal ultrasound.  I also went to a gastroenterologist and he did a colonoscopy and abdominal ct (but didn't cover pelvis region).  MRI showed a bulging disc but not messing with the cord according to 3 or 4 doctors I showed it to.  They all don't think it reveals a problem.  Here are my suspicions based on 20 months of research:  1.  Some type of occult pelvic area hernia.  These could be looked further into with a pelvic ct (for obturator) and groin ultrasound (for inguinal and femoral), neither of which anyone has ordered yet.  Also, pelvic ct can show many other problems.  I've had an abdominal ct to check kidneys and liver and stuff, but it didn't cover the pelvis area, so I feel a pelvic ct is definitely warranted.  2.  Some type of urological problem that just went unnoticed.  Now, I know a urologist would be best, but routine things have been looked into.  My theories on that are perhaps a difficult to find prostate infection, or maybe even an abscess.  An ultrasound of the prostate could rule that out, and I haven't had that.  Prostate infection would be less likely given the negative EPS and I took Doxycycline and Levaquin.  I'm guessing a cystoscopy could essentially complete a urological workup, and maybe a repeat eps or semen culture.   Do you think my problem is urological and do you agree with the tests I think I should get?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with Dr. Chan Lowe as he answered your other posts, A 24-hour urine collection to check for calcium, phosphate, urate, oxalate etc as they all may lead to stone formation.  CT scans and IVP can identify most of kidney stones but have some limitations. A Spiral CT scan  (does not need a contrast)  is  of choice in evaluating kidney stones as it can identify stones regardless of composition.   Another cause to be excluded since you have like hypersthesia (according to your description), neurological causes should be considered too.  You have mentioned that a MRI has been done, did it include the sacral vertebrae within? Did you consult a neurologist?  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Later test showed no white blood cells and everything was normal. I had about two whole days of no symtoms after two weeks from taking the zithomax. On the third day i started  notice increase unrination, up to every 15-20 minutes. I went to the ER and they checked my prostate and blood sugar level and did a culture. everything came back good.     I went to see a doctor who put me on levaquin 750mg for 30 days.   i seen another doctor who told me i should give me body time to heal and it might take two months.  i have been on the levaquin for two weeks now and there has been little improvement. Now urination takes place every 45 minutes. I'm clueless on who to believe.  I called the doctor who put me on the levaquin and she told me to call her again in two more weeks. The other doctor told me to stop taking the levaquin and drink lots of water and give my body time to heal. (months)   I'm so confused.   Could the STD infection damaged something that takes time to heal? the feelign is coming from the tip of the penis area.   Once again confused.  I'm also taking norvasc, toprol xl and diovan for high blood pressue.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The GreenLight PVP Laser Procedure (Photoselective Vaporization of the Prostate) provides unique and simple solution to benign prostatic hyperplasia BPH due to its safety, and it can precisely remove enlarged prostate tissue. Most patients can return to normal, non-strenuous activities within days of the procedure.  Developing urethral stones is not reported after this operation at least to my knowledge.  However before assuming that you have really developed these stones thereafter, I would like to know: How you have been diagnosed to have urethral stones? and Why you have been examined for, what was your complaint?  It is reported for some patients to have some blood clot formation after the procedure which may cause some urinary symptoms that are shared by many other causes.  If we assume that they are stones, why it is not a stone that has been formed due to urinary problems causes by the enlarged prostate. In older men an enlarged prostate can encourage the growth of a bladder stone by restricting the proper and full drainage of the bladder. Once the PVP was done, the obstruction was relieved, the stone could move down and was more easy to be felt and diagnosed.  For primary urethral stone to be formed (rare) it needs obstruction and stasis of urine that predispose to stone formation.  Hope this information is useful. Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you can explain in more details your symptoms.  Is your pain mainly related to full bladder and after micturition you feel better? Or it is part of the problem? You mentioned you have spasm feeling in your rectum? do you have any changes in your bowel habits, loose stool, diarrhea, mucous in stool, nausea etc? Do you have any tenderness on any part of your abdomen. Did you go for stool analysis, abdominal -pelvic US.?   Acute abdominal pain could be due to many causes including: - Coliti and proctitiss: Colitis and proctitis due to infectious or inflammatory disease like Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis.There is tenderness over the abdomen. Stool analysis and complete blood picture CBC help in the diagnosis.  - Appendicitis:. If the pain starts in the middle of the abdomen (para-umblical) then localize to the lower right part of the abdomen, appendicitis is to be considered.  Diverticulitis can cause same symptoms but the pain is felt on the left side of the lower abdomen.   -Renal -urinary- pain:   Pains due to renal problems are colicky pains, felt in the abdomen, back and radiates down to the groin and, commonly associated with other urinary symptoms, like burning micturition or urine frequency  Investigations include: Complete blood picture , blood chemistry and stool analysis. Abdominal US. Endoscopy  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank You for your response. I beleive the symptoms are directly related to my bladder being full or my body thinking that the bladder is full.  I  have misspoken in mentioning that part of my pain is in my abdomen.  It is only spasms in my rectum and in my pelvic region.  I feel like the muscle which stops urination is contracting very quickly and that is what I referred to as a \"spasm\".  My stool is harder than usual and is harder to push out.   There is no blood in my urine nor does it hurt to urinate. I have already done a Urine test, a Blood test, and the doctor poked around my abdomen, but not a stool test.  I hope I was able to explain this a little better.   Thank You,   Golfer2b\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This could be  interstitial cystitis -painful bladder syndrome (PBS)-  The International Continence Society (ICS) defines  PBS as  \"suprapubic pain related to bladder filling, accompanied by other symptoms such as increased daytime and nighttime frequency in the absence of proved urinary infection or other obvious pathology\"  The hallmarks of interstitial cystitis painful bladder syndrome (PBS),  are:  - urgency without incontinence  -daytime frequency more than 8 voids per day  -nighttime frequency more than 4 voids per night  -bladder pain relieved by voiding   No proved cause for the disease yet, theories include: an autoimmune, hereditary, infectious or allergic condition.  To diagnose interstitial cystitis, you have to record the volume of fluid intake and fluid out put daily (bladder diary) and report your doctor with this record.  Other causes doctors would exclude before diagnoses( as they share PBS in symptoms )include: urinary tract infections, kidney stones, bladder cancer, sexually transmitted diseases, or bacterial prostatitis .  I advise you to follow with your doctor and discuss with him this information. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Have multiple symptoms but this looks the correct forum to post my query.  It started three months ago, It was just nausea at first I then noticed pain in the lower abdomen (2 inches below the navel more towards the right). I had to run to the toilet everytime for bowel movement minutes after eating and also had burning with urination. Irregular bowel movements - around 10-12 times a day, COncentrated urine I was referred to a gastroenterologist Tests showed no WBC in urine, and no pathogens in blood, Got a CT scan done to look for kidney stones and other masses, Came back perfect. ONLY THING OBSERVED WAS MICROSCOPIC HEMATURIA.  The symptoms continued, I now had more pain with sitting for a long time, My doctor checked for a hernia, not present was what he said. Got a stool test done for parasites - none Small bowel series - Came back good. And finally a colonoscopy, Found an inflamatorry polyp(confirmed on biopsy results). No other abnormalities at all.  Overall no clinical evidence at all of anything  Diagnosed as irritable bowel syndrome.  Over the next month my bowel symptoms got better. But the pain in the lower abdomen (constant gnawing pain), burning with urination and nausea still persisted.  Got sent to a urologist , Again only blood in urine is what he saw. Got another CT(without contrast this time)   No stones. No calcified veins- nothing.  Went through a painful cystoscopy, After which I felt like I was urinating with broken glass in my urethra.  Bladder looked fine, Prostrate checked, No inflammation.  Could be INTERSTITIAL CYSTITIS was what I was told.  The urologist again kept doing tests for blood in urine, Last week there was no blood in urine anymore,  But the pain in the lower abdomen is still present, the burning with urination is not going anywhere. Nausea persists.  Pain (burning in urethra)with masturbation too. No discharge.  Am not sexually active.(No oral/intercourse) kissing is the only thing I do with my girl friend. Got 2/3 Lap dances in the past- I was fully clothed.- No contact in any way with primary sexual orans. Other than that - Have been doing a bit of weights.  Please help me. I am running out of options.  The symptoms still present are:  Burning with urination/ejaculation - persists after that too almost constantly. Constant gnawing Pain in lower abdomen, Constant NAUSEA- never goes down. Microscopic hematuria at times.(latest sample had none though) Pain in the right thigh.  Another observation is that the burning increases with physical activity, Urine also turns brown after physical activity like cycling etc.  By profession I'm a software engineer. Also was an extremely active athlete,  this problem is really frustrating,  my job, social life and my daily life are going to the dogs.  Please help.\n\n",

This is because kidney stones may\u00a0form when\u00a0your urine becomes\u00a0too concentrated.  Types of kidney stones include calcium stones (calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate and calcium oxalate), uric acid stones, cystine stones and struvite stones.

    "content": "Hello,  There are many possible causes of testicular pain, these include: trauma or surgery; torsion of the testicles; infections such as epididymitis or orchitis; varicocele and hydrocele; referred pain from a kidney stone; an inguinal hernia or pelvic congestion. Pain can also be referred to the testicles from conditions such as ureteric stones or spinal pathology.  Both the testicle itself and the epididymis are prone to infection with microorganisms. Inflammation of the testicle is known as orchitis, and that of the epididymis as epididymitis. When both occur together, as they often do, the term is epididymo-orchitis. All cause pain in the area of the testicle, which is tender, swollen and hot to touch.  Antibiotic drugs most commonly used to treat bacterial orchitis or epididymitis include ciprofloxacin (Cipro), ceftriaxone (Ceftin), doxycycline (Vibramycin, Doryx), azithromycin (Zithromax), and trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole combined (Bactrim, Septra).   Since you have been on it for only 3 days, wait till the antibiotics course ends. You should feel better by then. If you don't then you need a re-evaluation.  Best regards,\n\n",

Mild cystoceles may be asymptomatic (cause no symptoms) but when progression occurs to the extent that the bladder prolapses into the vagina, of course treatment is required. Symptoms may range from urinary incontinence, fullness, discomfort, pain, recurrent infections, etc. Pain at varying degrees is a subjective sign expressed by a patient. For another person to state that this particular condition isn't at all painful is essentially absurd. I hope all went well with your evaluation and follow up. Best wishes.

    "content": "Hello,  Dyspareunia refers to sexual dysfunction manifested as painful or difficult sexual intercourse. Although this problem can affect men, it is more common in women. For women, the genital pain can occur with penetration or during or after intercourse. True dyspareunia is recurrent and associated with a disruption of normal sexual functioning.   Women may have pain in the vagina, clitoris or labia. Women with dyspareunia may feel superficial pain at the entrance of the vagina, or deeper pain during penetration or thrusting of the penis. Some women also may experience severe tightening of the vaginal muscles during penetration, a condition called vaginismus.  Pain at introitus with penile entry is commonly caused by vaginal dryness and atrophic vaginitis (eg, due to menopause); side effects of drugs such as antihistamines and tamoxifen and endometriosis. It can also result from an allergic reaction to clothing, spermicides or douches. Vulvar vestibulitis which is an inflammation of the area surrounding the vaginal opening or skin diseases affecting the vaginal area (eg, lichen planus and lichen sclerosis) can cause severe genital pain. Urinary tract infections, vaginal yeast infections, or sexually transmitted diseases can also lead to dyspareunia. Finally, psychological trauma, often stemming from a past history of sexual abuse or trauma.  Pain with deep penetration can be caused by several conditions including diseases of the bowel (eg, inflammatory bowel disease, irritable bowel syndrome). This may be associated with bowel symptoms. Other causes include chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, endometriosis, enlarged uterus from myoma or adenomyosis; fixed retroverted uterus and inadequate sexual arousal. Pelvic conditions can also result in pain with deep penetration, this can result from pelvic masses or pelvic relaxation.  I do not think it is related to the curvature of your penis.

It is thought that microvascular injury plays an important role in the pathology of this disease. Repeated injury to the small vessels leads to microscopic bleeding which leads to coagulation and fibrin deposition. Repeated fibrin deposition ultimately leads to a plaque formation. This usually occurs near the midline of the shaft.  Symptoms of Peyronie's disease include painful erection, penile curvature to varying degrees and only during erection and a fibrotic plaque greater than 1.5cm is usually felt in the midline either on the front or the back of the shaft.

It's not just the urge to urinate, I really do have to go.  Just last night, I urinated, laid in bed and read a book for 45 minutes.  During that time, I felt increasing pressure to go.  At the end of the 45 minutes, I urinated again and seemed to have a close to full bladder.  Then 30 minutes later I had to go again.  I did okay for another 4 hours, then had to get up and go again.  Then did okay for another 4 hours.    This came on suddenly.  I have had it happen before and usually resolves itself in a few days.  When this started about 8 years ago, I had a cystoscopy which was normal.  In the past, I have \"run\" to the doctor but no infection is ever found.    I have also been checked for diabetes 3 or 4 times and my blood sugar levels are always very normal.  Is this some type of overactive bladder issue?  And what does laying down have to do with this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Nocturia is defined as the need to get up at least 2x or more per night.  Neurogenic bladder (overactive bladder), UTI's, and chronic cystitis have to be ruled out. There are other conditions that cause the symptoms of frequent and night time urination including endocrine disorders (for example, diabetes, diabetes insipidus).  Drinking too much fluid before bedtime -- particularly coffee, caffeinated beverages, or alcohol. Certain drugs such as diuretics, cardiac glycosides, demeclocycline, lithium, methoxyflurane, phenytoin, propoxyphene, and excessive vitamin D.  Benign prostatic hyperplasia (common in older men) as well as chronic renal failure, congestive heart failure and obstructive sleep apnea and sometimes if you experience jet lag are all causes of nocturia.  In your case I would first re-exclude UTI and diabetes before considering an overactive bladder.  Best regards,\n\n",

Absolute obstruction at that level ultimately leads to anuria.  Symptoms may include any of the following:   Hesitancy, intermittency, terminal dribbling (dribbling at the end of voiding): These can be caused by a decrease in the size and force of the urinary stream.  Urgency, urinary frequency and nocturia (a need to urinate at night): These symptoms can result from an incomplete emptying and rapid refilling of the bladder.  Straining to void, painful micturition can result on attempting to overcome a partial obstruction.  Anuria: complete obstruction can result in complete cessation of micturition.  Other symptoms may include inability to control the urine flow (incontinence). Burning or stinging with urination can also be a symptom. There may be flank pain or pain on both sides. The patient may have blood in the urine, or an abnormal color to the urine.  Causes:  This condition can occur in both men or in women. Men usually get a blockage caused by an enlarged prostate. In women, it is much less common, but can be caused by a condition known as bladder cystocele. Other causes can be bladder tumors, tumors of the prostate, and tumors or other structures around the bladder neck or urethra. It can also be a result of strictures in any part of the urinary tract.  In some cases women may have a condition known as a paraurethral cyst (also known as Skene's glands). They are located in the urethrovaginal wall at the opening into the urethra. This appears as a tense, glistening, white or yellow mass reducing the size of the urethral opening.  I would recommend you book an appointment with your doctor and have him check it out.

    "content": "Since the middle of year 2002, I have been urinating foamy / frothy / lather-rich urine. I had looked up on the net then, and found that the reason behind it could be the presence of protien. This reason seemed logical because I was exercising (strength training) and also Myoplex (whey protien) everyday. I linked my increased protien intake to this. Needless to say, it made me feel guilty of not being careful about my health.   In March 2003,  I had my urine tested (morning urine, midstream). The report came negative. Albumin: Nil. I was a bit relieved. The doctors told me that some people have foamy urine by nature. Such an answer from a doctor amazed me (how can they give such a stupid answer). It is 2006 and the flow of my foamy, lather-rich urine has not yet stopped. At times, it looks as if some detergent is mixed with my urine - it is so foamy, lather-rich, full of bubbles.  I do not have any swelling in any body part. No blood. No urination difficulty. No burning sensation. No feeling as if I have not emptied my bladder. No serious illness.  Very rarely, after masturbation/sex, I have a pricking sensation at the tip of my penis. It is painful and very irritating. This is temporary. I have got such sensation even when I was a kid  (15 yrs), after masturbation. This happens extremely rarely and I do not know the reason behind it.  Considering that my kidneys had started to fail since mid 2002 (when I started urinating foamy urine), should my kidneys have failed by now? Should I have died by now?  Whenever I drink excessive water, the foam in the urine decreases drastically.  Do I have a disease? Please answer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Foam formation in urine could be a manifestation of excess proteins in urine especially albumen.   The most general definition of foam is a substance that is formed by trapping many gas bubbles in a liquid. Excess protein can cause the urine to foam in water. This occurs because protein changes the surface tension between urine and water in much the same way that a detergent decreases water surface tension. Protein, as well as detergent, in this case is what physicists call a surface active substance.  Normally proteins are not found in urine (less than150 mg per day) and their presence could be due to many factors which could be a manifestation of a kidney disease. Albumin makes up about 30mg per day. Hence, total protein above 150 mg or albumin above 30 mg per day are abnormal. Total protein above 300 mg per day is known as clinical proteinuria and is usually accompanied by various other clinical manifestations such as generalized edema.  Before we jump to any conclusions you should have a dipstick test for urinary protein or a simple urine analysis. For a more precise measurement, you may need to collect urine for 24 hours (microalbumin study - between 30 - 300 mg albumin per day).   It may also be something as simple as a forceful flow of urine that could make a foamy type of appearance due to excess trapping of air in urine as it contacts water.   I would recommend a you do a microalbumin study if you are still concerned. Renal function can easily be assessed by renal function tests and determination of glomerular filtration rates.

    "content": "I am a 42 year old female, I don't smoke, don't drink, take Prilosec, Synthroid, and Xanax.  For the past 10 years, I have been dealing with intermittent symptoms of feeling a need to urinate but not producing as much urine to match the urgency.  These \"episodes\" will last a few days and then disappear for a long time.  During the \"episodes\", I might feel fine for a few hours, then feel pressure, and then feel fine.  As I said, very intermittent.  Sometimes when I am having anxiety and I cannot sleep, the feeling is worse.  When this first started happening, I assumed that I had a UTI even though there is no burning associated with my urine.  I would go to the doctor and the only thing they ever really found was that the dipstick would test positive for blood in the urine.  They would put me on medication, only to find that the culture would be negative.  Finally, I went to a urologist and explained all this.  He did a cystoscopy in the office and found nothing wrong.  He told me that I probably had an overactive bladder and gave me Detrol.  This did help, but I found the side effects bothersome.    Fast forward now about 8 years and right now I am having one of my \"episodes\".  Again, it follows a period of stress and sleepless nights.  Since it had been so long since I have had a serious flare up of this, I went to my GP yesterday.  Again, blood in urine (dipstick) and they gave me a prescription for Macrobid (which I loathe to take).  I guess my question is:  I've had microscopic blood in my urine for about 10 years now that I know of.  Cytoscopy is normal.  I would think any long-term serious kidney issues would have been horrendous at this point.  So, what is going on here?  I do use quite a bit of Motrin and when I did the urine specimen yesterday I was at the very end of my menstrual cycle and using a tampon.  I really was not even bleeding (at least that I could see) and I cleaned myself very well. Thank you, Christine\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  When the urine looks normal and blood is detected only by microscopic examination , the condition is known as Microscopic haematuria. A normal individual can excrete small amount of  blood in urine daily ( up to one million red blood cells (RBC) in the urine each day) and the condition is not considered hematuria.  In females, hematuria is common due to the high incidence of urinary tract infection (due to their short urethra). Urinary tract infection is usually associated with burning micturition, frequency and urgency.  Other conditions that lead to hematuria include Kidney  and ureteric stones , in which pain (colicky ) is usually present and may radiate to the groin and the upper thigh.  Kidney disease, such as nephritis .  Medications such as warfarin, aspirin, ibuprofen and naproxen    To investigate the cause your  doctors  would recommend you one or more of the following tests , after complete history and physical examination,  -  Urine tests (urinalysis), in this case not only to check for blood in urine but also for pus cells which if present indicate the presence of infection. Urine Culture is to be considered in this condition. -  Blood tests to check also for infection (leucocytosis) and to rule out any systemic causes of bleeding tendency. -  Abdominal US to visualize the  kidney.  Your Cystoscopy excluded bladder abnormalities.  - Kidney,  ureter and bladder-imaging   with (IV) or without dye stenography or X- ray, if stones is suspected.   Doing your analysis during the menstruation is not advisable as contamination with the menstrual blood is very likely to happen. You better avoid as much as possible the frequent intake of NSAID (Motrin) for exclusion and also to avoid any possible renal damage.\n\n",

I would strongly suggest an evaluation by an Urologist for some diagnostic studies along with a physical evaluation to identify if there are abnormalities regarding the urinary system, prostate, epididymis etc. Be sure your physician is also aware that you have had a change in bowel habits.

    "title": "What causes urinary tract spasms?",
    "content": "Could I find out what would cause urinary tract spasms other than UTI's? I understand that I have them in my bladder probley because it's diseased but I do not understand why it causes my kidney's to hurt, especially on the left side, because there is nothing wrong with my kidney's, but that's where the pain is at it's worst. It also gets really tender there so I don't think it's radiating pain. And I pretty much know for a fact they are spasms. Here's my past diagnosis: bladder spams, overactive bladder intersistial cystitis, flank pain, grade 2 bladder prolapse, prolapse of cervix & uterus, uterus overlaying on the bladder causing deformity. Past treatments: cystoscopy's w) distention, hysterectomy w) bladder sling (having uterus & cervix removed 6 mths ago). The surgery more or less cured the frequency going from over 100 times a day to about 15-20. I cannot take overactive bladder medication for these spasms, as for some reason, they have an opposite effect on me. The surgery also made it very difficult for me to be able to urinate but at this point, my bladder is just slow about doing so. Are there any treatments or other medications for this? I do not currently go to a urologist but would do so if it would help. I used to take Elmiron, could it help with the spasms?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Conditions that causes reduction in the flow of  urine resulting from obstruction, or any urinary tract abnormality result in renal spasm due to many causes like: - This increased risk of stone formation, which you already have mentioned to have,  in your previous posts.  - Contraction of the ureteric smooth muscle to push the urine against the full bladder (bladder autonomic dysfunction or mechanical cause), another form of obstruction in the bile flow.  - ureteric stricture following traumatic injury in previous surgery  All of these causes induce increase in the pressure inside the ureter, in addition to the chemical metabolites produced by the infection or the anoxia (decrease oxygen content) will stimulate nerve endings that send the stimuli to the brain.   The pain is then felt as referred to cutaneous structures, that share the same spinal cord neurons through which the brain send back his impulses.\n\n",

My doctor gave me a prescription for Oxytrol which I understand is for overactive bladder.  My doc didn't talk to me about overactive bladder.  Is this a real condition?

Since your cystoscopy results were normal this would rule out a bladder etiology such as cystitis. Aside from the medication, were you instructed to do Kegel exercises, bladder training, etc.? Have you been evaluated by a gynecologist? There has been some research linking pelvic floor muscle weakness with urinary symptoms and doing exercises to increase the strength of the pelvic floor seems to alleviate some of the symptoms.

    "content": "I guess you are now my only hope\u2026  I\u2019ve been to a general surgeon (to rule out hernia), two urologists and a GP who does acupuncture.  The GP/accpuncturist told me to see a psychotherapist\u2026  Acupuncture, I was hoping, would alleviate the pain but the doctor was so impersonal, skeptical and patronizing compounding he recommended I seek mental help I just about gave up.  That is, of course until I saw your website.    Now, I don\u2019t think my prostate is the problem at least I don\u2019t think so.  What I\u2019m experiencing is a dull ache in my scrotum that may have resulted from a full blown 5 block sprint with not much support going on as I was wearing a suit and trying to escape the rain.  Prior to that run I did some lifting and I felt a sharp pinch in the lower left abdomen.  In between the lifting and the run I\u2019d say there was about a week in time but the day after the run (11/17/05) I had the most unbelievable pain in my left testicle.   My wife was also a bit rough on my testicles over several weeks in October as she was being experimental.  She was doing anything weird but after a while I told her I started to feel uncomfortable.  Before going to the ER I didn\u2019t take any pain meds.  Just tried to wait it out and hope it would dissipate on its own.  Three days later the pain shifted to the right side.   After about a week I ended up in the emergency room where they did a sonogram-everything was normal.    Both urologists put me on anti bacteria meds which I cant really say is responsible for the pain diminishing somewhat or if it was just time but between the onset of this phenomenon and the present,  I\u2019d say the pain has gone from unbearable to manageable but I wish it would go away entirely. Both urologists said I had epditimytis but no infection was found.   I had a CT scan done and they found varicoceles on both the left and right side of my scrotum.  The left side was medium sized and right was small.  I asked the urologist if this would be the cause of my discomfort and he replied that varicoceles typically do not cause pain and if they do the pain goes away in time.  Maybe all that banging around during that run caused the varicoceles as a result of trauma?     Anyway the pain has dissipated to a degree.  It used to be continuously painful now it\u2019s just a continuous ache.  The pain I can handle ( I think) it\u2019s just that the pain increases several hours after ejaculation.  This is making it very difficult for me to enjoy my once harmonious and happy marriage and as supportive and understanding as my wife may be, we have to plan out our sex life instead of spontaneously enjoying it.  I need help, very, very, badly.  I don\u2019t know which way to go, who to turn or what lies in my future but all I want is for things to go back the way they used to.  If anything I am mired in depression as my sex life which was once great, now sucks.   I\u2019ve begged and pleaded with doctors to do more thorough tests.  Maybe I have a sports hernia to which they shook their heads.  I feel as though none of the Doctors I've seen want to investigate further into the matter.  I'm told to take another regimen of anti biotics and Advil at every visit.  This approach is clearly not helping and I don't know what to do.  If you can\u2019t hear the cries and the sobs in this letter as I write it believe it when I say it, they are there.  I can\u2019t believe I am to be left in this condition till the end.  There\u2019s got to be a reason for this and there has to be a solution.     Please help\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Very Worried, Varicocele's are often asymptomatic (causes no symptoms). However, when symptoms do arise there is a feeling of heaviness and ache in the testicles, the feeling of a \"bag of worms\" in your scrotum. Mild symptoms may be alleviated by snug fitting undershorts or scrotal support. One of the complications of a varicocele aside from the obvious pain is a problem with fertility because the blood flow isn't properly cooled and may cause damage to sperm. When symptoms become more than mild and there are issues regarding fertility varicoceles are surgically treated. If you have had a CT scan and this was revealed, it absolutely will cause varying degrees of pain and discomfort and I would strongly suggest that you have another evaluation by a different Urologist and take along with you the CT Scan report.

    "content": "Hi the mom pru, From your description it does not sound like typical symptoms of hypospadias. Normally the urethral meatus (pee hole) is located at the tip of the penis. However, in a rather rare congenital abnormality as in, for example, epispadias, the opening is located on top rather than the tip of the penis. It may have the appearance of as if a knife was inserted into a normal meatus and sliced. Generally speaking, this is typically found at birth. Keep in mind that I am not implying this is the causative factor but regardless of the cause, I would strongly suggest an evaluation by a Urologist. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. It sounds like you have \"right sided varacoele to me. Varcocele is one or more varcoise veins in the spermtic cord and sometime they can become visible through the scoutm if they are large. It is possibel that you have islolated right isided varacocele which is rare. The reson it is rare is because blood form the right testicle drains into the\" inferior vena cava vein\" which is the biggst vein in the body and, drains staright to the heart. A sudden onset of varacocele in either testicle is of concern and you should get this checkd out right away. Varacocle is actually more common in both tetsicles than it is in the right one. It is also more common on the left testicle. Let me tell you somewthing, i had isloated right sided varacocle for montsh now. I have three huge veins that are very hard and the blood doeslt drain form the veins back to my heart when i lie down. Now this is a sign that there could possibly be a tumuor or some other type of growth putting pressue on the inferior vena cave vein whcih has caused vein(s) in the spernatic cord to become varacose. Like i said ive had this for mnoths now and about a month a go after having a perfeclty fine left spermatic cord i developed a big varacocle over night. Again this is another cause for concern. Developing sudden varacocle in the left tetsicle could mean that there is a problem with a tumour putting pressure on thekidney vein. You see blood, form the left testicle does'nt drain into the inferior vena cava vein like on the right testicle. It actually drains into the kidney vein and blood to the testcile comes fromm the kidney vein too. I would say that the each of the  three varacocele in my right spermatic cord are about twice the size of a piece of well cooked spagetti when they are at there biggest. I can get them to go smaller but not by much.   Now, I found a lump in my penis a couple of months ago. The lump was right next to where the superfiacl dorsal vein is attached to my penis. I kept messign with the lump because it was driving me mad then all of a sudden i satrted to notice veins barnching of the superfical dorsal vein that i coudl'nt even see before. Then i noticed a vein coloured swelling on the dorsal side at the bottom of th shafte near the pubic area and that the superfical dorsal vein had become closer to the centre of my penis. Then i developed another vein next to my superfical dorsal vein which has become clotted. After this i developed 4 veins on the underside of my penis and slightly to the right side of my penis. The veins on the underside of my penis are hard even when my penis is flacid. I can still get erections fine after all this though. the  way the superfical dorsal vein reacts is inconsitent too. Some times it will become huge and swollen and other times it won't fil up with blood as much. Anway today i went to see a urorlogist and told him that i was convinced that this lump was a clot inside part of a branch vein that branches off the superfical dorsal vein and that part of the lump was inside the main part of the superfical dorsal vein itself. The vein is constantly altering over time to the point where the vein looks a lot differnet to the way it was before. Part of the vein has become about a quarter of the size it was before and the rest of the vein feels weaker and more mushy.  I told the urologist about all the reasearch i did and he too believes that i have add a blood clot and thats why the supperfical dorsal vein has  altered so much, and why i have visble veins branching of ther supefifal dorsal vein that were not there before.  Also he told me that the veins underneath my penis could of appeard because extar pressure is applied to other veins if there is a problem with another. also deeper veins can take over form the suerfical veins too. Now this worries me because i don't want added pressure on the deep dorsal vein for christ sake. Apparenll the deep dorsal vein and the crural veins drain the majority of the poenis including erectile tissue and the superfical vein drains the supefical fascia and covering like skin and skin from the glans. The problem for me is that there is a small connection between the deep and superfical veins and if more pressure is added to any vein, including the deeper systems, it has more chance of becomeing varcose. Also varcose veins have more chance of becoming clotted.  TBH the whole lexpecricme left me cold. The fact that this guy said i only had a small left varcocle is rdiculous. The varacocele in my left spemratic corde is like a godamn mcdonalds straw at times its so big. What i find even more funny though (or tragic depending on which way you look at it) is that he completely ignored the fact that i have these huge varacocele veins in my right spermatic cord. I shoud of been sent for an immediate ultrasound to check the blood flow in my penis and in the veins in my spermatci cord. Also the inferio vena cava vein and the veins to my Kidney shoud lof been checked or any potential blockages. Instead all he did was send me for a blood test and told me to come back at the end of may. WTF? on top of this the guy who did my blood test was a totall weirdo and i'm prety certain that he stuck the needle staright threw my vein. I went to a urologist today so he woud listen EVERYTHING i said and give me the appropiate treatment (IE ultarsoundscan) yet none of this happend. I can tell you that the NHS in england sucks bg time. No wonder its in such a mess. The fact that the guy aggreed with everythign i said and came to the same conclusion that i came to that i'd sufferd a blood clot i the superifal dorsal, then ingored me about other things that he knew i knew what the hell i was talking about, was ridiculous. So far with all the resarch i've done, the two urologist ive see and a scan i did have done a while back ive come to the conclusion that these guys just doint give a rats ass and that i've leanred  more on the internt than the guys i've seen so far.   Anyway good luck mate in finding a urologost who gives a damn. I just thought i woudl tell you about my expecrience because it is somewhat similar to =yours.  Oh and don't bank on getting any medial advice here that you cant figure out for youslef from doing a days resaerch on the net. In fact this plae is almost dead.\n\n",

    "content": "The veins can become bigger over time or you can develope even more veins. The only time they shoudl be operated on is if you have bad pain that you can't handle or if the varacocele veins have made you infertil and you are trying for a baby. Even then though more varacocele  can develope because the remaing veins are under more pressure due to extra blood flow.  Hey if you downlaod a little info from the net and take it to the ER you can present a good case to them so you can get scanned there and then!  The problems though, whcih i believe i've encountered, is that these \"stuck up dip *****\" don't like a \"normal person\"  telling  them how to do there job after learning about urology over the net for a few days. Ive come to the conclusion that the only way i will get checked out properly is if if downlaod a crap load of info from the net, take it to a urologist, and then pull out a gun and force him to what ive printed out. Either that or win the lotto and go and see one of the best uroolgist in the world. The problem with the people i've been dealing with is that they just arn't interested, have a bad attitude and just basically don't give a crap. Also they are badly over paid.  lol I coud do a better job than the urologist i saw today with only the info ive learned off the net. Although i'm sure he knows is ***** its just that he doesnt give a *****. Oh and while i'm at it my GP is a waste of space too.

    "content": "I just wanted to post a follow up to my situation in the hope that it might provide some information for others going through similitar situations.   After multiple lab draws, an examination by a Urologist, and a pelvic and ab CT, I'm totally fine. I haven't had an increase in vein visibility since my last post, function is fine, and I'm pain free.   I agree totally with what many post in these internet forums say when it comes to getting data and doing research. It really does help to be an informed patient. That being said, to often on internet boards folks post a lot of doom and gloom scenarios that can send already worried researchers into full on panic. That's really unfortunate because while the internet is a great medium for gathering facts and sharing experiences it's not a medical diagnostic tool.   So al that being said, guys out there, if you are seeing something different with veins in your penis, scrotum, or whatever, don't panic! We're all sensative about what's going on with our stuff but please don't get crazy to quickly. I know I did and I wish I wouldn't have. Do your research yes and absolutely go get checked out ASAP to put your mind at ease and if their is a problem get treated. Just remember though, for all the posts on all the Urology, Mens Health, ect.. boards out there that we read where everyone is convinced something lethal is wrong, their are experiences where the symptoms are  nothing at all. I was absolutely convinced the large right sided vien in my scrotum and penis was the end of the world. Cancer, rogue vericocele, or whatever else could be wrong and it turns out that absolutely nothing was wrong at all.   So please read these posts and boards with a grain of salt. While the lists of possible symptoms or causes is always long, the reality of the situation may be very simple. Research and get checked and try not to panic. Easier said than done I know, but looking back at the way I handled it, I wish I would not have jumped on the panic train so soon as I made myself and those around absolutely miserable in the process because I was convinced my days were numbered.   Good luck to everyone!\n\n",

Also are these veins hard whne your penis is flacid? You see with me it started off withjust one vein on the right hand side that woudl feel slightly hard when flacid but now i have more and the side of my penis where the veins are has become swollem. I know this becuase now its almost impossible to feel  the right part of my corpus spongiosum because it feels like its merged with my right corpora cavernosa. every single time i get a hard erction  that i maintain for more than 10 minutes something new apears on my dick, Wether it be a vein or a lumpy piece of tissue. I don't even touch the shaft of my penis anymore incase i get more veins that develope or damage excisting veins. Plus these veins hurt. If i try and masterbate now and rub the skin on the shaft of my pensi it almost feels like the tissue underneath has little bits of it comming loose.\n\n",

    "content": "1. Age: 23 2. Gender: Male  I was taking a shower on Saturday (2/18) night and noticed a little bit of pain on the left side of my scrotum (on the upper skin not the testicules).  I looked at it and it looked like there were grayish spots on the skin.  I felt it between two fingers and it seemed just superficial, the skin was just a little tougher than the other side of my scrotum.  Sunday morning it began to hurt when I woke up.  It hurts when I touch it and even hurts a little bit when I don't touch it.  I put a little bit of Vaseline on it so that it wouldn't rub up against my leg.  The spots are now black but seem to remain superficial.  I have taken the best picture of them as I could and posted them here:  http://perfume.t1webhosting.com/DSC00525.JPG or here   This Monday morning it seemed to look better and not hurt as much as on Sunday.  I showered and cleaned the spot gently.  I patted it down with a tissue after the shower and noticed a little bit of blood on the tissue.  Looks like the spots are filled with blood to me.  Can someone qualified please give me some advice?  I have been looking online for something like this or images that look like this but have found none.  Thanks for any help.\n\n",

He has had chlamydia and been treated for it about 2 months ago, but the water or urine infections are still there, and they are getting worse.   The symptoms he gets are:  Discharge (Only recently)  Unable to fully empty his bladder when peeing - the feeling he needs to go again straight afterwards  Not a constant flow   His penis is getting a bit dry as well, but he is washing it and drying it a lot, and too many Antibiotics may be causing thursh, is that correct? I have got canesten for him and that seems to be helping the dryness.   The Dr keeps fobbing him off with Antibiotics, he really needs a refferal to see a specialist, there is an 8 month waiting list.   Does this sound like a UTI? And are there any ways to relieve the symptoms whilst waiting? It is really getting him down.   Also the Dr has now sent him to the GUM clinic for an STI test, is this strictly neccesary? As we have both been cleared for chlamydia and such.  Thanks\n\n",

If the gp confirmed there was bacteria in all the samples it may be another reason, and antibiotics can cause thrush, and it may cause soreness The usual tips to help are to drink lots, spring water preferable, some use bicarb diluted in drinks, but the clinic are experts on uti as well as std and should be able to advice, if it gets very bad you could ask your gp if he`ll speed up referral to urologist. hope you get help soon.\n\n",

    "content": "(I\u2019m a 30 year old, female)I started to have problems in December, I had a UTI. I was treated for this, but I got another one in March. I then started to get pain at the low right back side, I went to my doctor. She did x-rays and found nothing wrong on the x-ray but she found little bacteria in my urine so she sends me to an urologist. He asks tons of questions then he tells me that I have a bladder condition or a gynecologic issues. He wrote a prescription for this bladder condition and then sends me to an Obgyn office. My gynecologist did the examination and found nothing wrong with me. I end up at the ER over the weekend because the pain became worst. They found I had Kidney stone, and a gallbladder stone. (I have a history of Kidney stone)  I called my doctor and he wanted me to get an IVP done, this was done almost a week after going to the ER. He advised the stone is not there, and my pain had gone away.  I was pain free for about a month.  About three weeks ago, I started to have this pain again on the right and left side low back. I called my primary; she did an x-ray but found nothing. She then did a CAT scan and found two stones. She refer me to my urologist, he saw my CAT scan. He advised the stone on the right does not look like it\u2019s in the collective system, but the stone on the left is small and should not cause pain. He believes that I have a problem in the gynecological area, I saw my gynecologist and he sees nothing wrong. I just had a laparoscopy to make sure my ovary's are ok which they are. I still have the pain, now my primary doctor wants to send me to pain management. I'm not happy with this answer, I know my body, I knew it was not my gynecologic area. I believe it\u2019s with my kidney, at this moment I\u2019m recovering from my surgery (laparoscopy) and I can feel the original pain from my lower back right side. I want to see another urologist, but for the moment I\u2019m doing research on what this pain could be. The pain is sharp, throbbing, something burning that radiates to the side; my urine does not burn; I have headaches. If someone can provide information I would greatly appreciate and thank you in advance for your time.  DarkPhoenix\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Darkphoenix,       I am sorry to say I don't have an answer to your problem but rather I am also looking for the same answer as you.  I am a 42 year old female and I had a history of chronic UTI's of which I spent countless hours at Urologists and my OB/GYN. I was actually put on a \"Maintenance\" program with the drug Diflucan and took it everyday for 6 months to try and keep the infections under control. Everything was fine for a few months and then all it took was another chance encounter and it was all back again. The frustration was I thought I was doing something wrong to my body to cause these, and the number of doctors I saw that ran the same tests you hvae gone thru shaking their heads and telling me nothing was wrong only frustrated me further. The UTI's seem to be under control for the past 3 years however as I type this post to you I am now suffering with a lower right side stabbing back pain which if I run my hand up the right side of my back feels like a bruise, I too believe this has to be connected to my Kidney. This comes and goes just as you said yours does.  I have had my Gall Bladder removed 10 years ago after suffering from attacks for almost 6 years only to have it finally discovered by an E.R. doctor that did a UltraSound and found it loaded with gall stones! I am now residing overseas in Southern Spain and the medically care here is not as advanced as I would suspect in the U.S., but if you do find anything out I too would greatly appreciate any information you can pass along. Good Luck!\n\n",

I've found that you have to almost diagnose yourself and have found the internet a great asset. I told them to check my urine and found blood. I told them \"lets just rule out the stuff that could kill me. Give me a scan or mri or whatever but I don't want to be half dead and then they decide , oh  you have cancer and have about a week to live.\"  I have seen that over and over and over again.  You know when there is something seriously wrong so demand the tests. It took a cat scan, which nothing showed up  and then a test with dye.  The doctor said he almost missed it, but finally saw a small stone between my kidney and blatter that as he explained it, acted like a check valve.  Sometime moving up so that the urine could flow out then at other times it would seal shut so none could get out.   He removed it with a thing he called a little basket .  No surgery but they knocked me out .  I haven't had another infection sense. It's been 2 years.\n\n",

The doctors told her she was a hyperchondriac (please forgive spelling) and couldn't find anything wrong. Please be persistant and continue to do testing to find out what is wrong. Have them check your liver enzymes and liver function. Have them check your gallbladder and uterus functions too. Turns out, she had cancer that STARTED in her gallbladder which spread to her uterus and finally her liver. Unfortunately, by the time they found the source of the problem and was diagnosed my mother died of liver failure. The time of diagnosis and death was 1 month. My mother died in 1985 at 32 years old. Please be persistant. God Bless.\n\n",

If you have a lump then the only way you will know what it is, and the only way you will feel any better is if you get it checked out by the proffesionals. I know its embarassing to show your bits in fornt of people but at the end of the day these peole have seen thousands of penis's so they don't make a bg deal out of it. To them seeing a penis is no different to  you and me waking up in the morning and seeing the sun. Basically its second nature to them. Really mate, just bite the bullet, swallow your pride and see the doc. At the end of the day you can spend as much time as you want on the internet trying to find answers to your problems but none of it means anything until you've seen a proffseional in the flesh. Go get it checked out mate and good luck! :-) I'm going to see a urologist myself tomorrow and i'm nervous too so. It comes with the territory.\n\n",

If my penis isn't hanging as long as it was when flaccid, has a persistant sensation of coldness, even when I'm not cold, and am having difficulty getting and maintaining firm erections, with my penis oddly resembling an hour glass like shape when I'm arroused, are these signs of some type of damage to the penis? I've been experiencing this for about 3 weeks now, anyone here have any idea what could be causing this?\n\n",

I feel for you mate, i really do! It is possible  to develope Peyronies at any age but it is more common in older men.  people develope Peyronies due to penil fracture but your case is so sudden then it cant be Peyronies . It is possile that you will develope scar tissue though where you have fracture your penis and the possibly develope peyronies. Peyornies is not actually a disease but nothign more than scar tissue thats formed on the fractured area, and because the scar tissue can become hard and inflexible it causes the penis to bend because the scar tissue is less flexible. You know i've watched porn videos where ive seen a guy fracture his dick while having rough sex. I watched the one where it was clear that he completely fractured his dick in two places but he just carried on having sex like nothing had happend. Also there a lot of guys with fractured dicks that have healed, the hour glass deformety and all sorts of bends and curves and they go on to have normal sex lives. I've seen lots of videos and pcis with some very strange dicks and they were'nt always that way. Come to think of it a while back my penis sarted to veer to the left but not bend like Peyornies. My erection was perfeclty straight but when i followed my erection down with my fingers to the pubic area i coudl feel liek my erection was bent inside my body. I had this for a couple of months but it seems to have gone now. Also i  read a case of a guy who fractured his left Corpus Cavernosum. He felt and heard it snap but there was no pain. he lost his erection right away and tried to get another erection straight after to see what the hell had gone wrong. His right Corpus Cavernosum filled with blood and became erect but his left one stayed deflated. However the next day his left Corpus Cavernosum had rapidly, almost feakishly healed and filled up with blood again. I think it all depends on how bad the fracture is tbh and how your own body reacts to it. The cold penis and weak erections tells me from all the reasearch i've done that you have damaged a blood vessel or artery too when you fractured your dick. The symptoms you have described are so similar to penile fracture that its; almost certian that you have fractued it. hey and if you can't see a urologist right away then you have a strong case to take yourslef to ER and get treated there immediatly.    Keep in touch mate and let me know how you get on. hey  I'll give you my email address later so we can talk privatly if you wan,t OK? :-)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, For the past few weeks my penis has been acting very strangely, for starters when flaccid it always appears shriveled, even when I'm not cold, and when it does elongate, it isn't as long as it used to be...I'd estimate about an inch to an inch and a hlaf loss of flaccid length the biggest problem tho is with my erections..whenever I start getting arroused the bottom of the shaft of my penis starts to grow, but the mid section near the head seems to remain \"shriveled\" causing my penis to resemble an hour glass like shape...sometimes with a little massaging I get get almost fully erect, it appears to be the usual length, but might have lost an inch. I'm 24 years old and have never had sex, but masturbate frequently, sometimes up to 3 times a day, but recently my libido isn't what it used to be and getting erections is more difficult. Is this the sign of some type of physical problem? I started noticing this following an incident I had while masturbating: while getting ready to masturbate I felt an orgasm coming but no semen ejaculated, this was before I was fully erect, After it happened my penis shriveled up very small, smaller than usual, almost to nothing..like a frightened turtle. Since then I've been experiencing the problems. Anyone out there experience anything like this??\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hypohondric,  Urinating blood and the sensation of strong tension in the bladder are usually caused by urinary tract infections in young females (especially if sexually active).  i suggest that you have a urine analysis done to confirm the diagnosis and the treatment is usually antibiotics.  Other causes of blood in urine are urinary tract stones and tumours. Blood in the urine caused by stones are usually associated with severe colicks. Blood in the urine caused by tumours is usually painless.  You have to go to a doctor and have a urine analysis done.

The reason I'm writing this is because he also said I had an enlarged vein in my scrotum(no mention of where),at first I didnt pay any attention to this comment because I was nervous about going to him and having my penis examined(stupid I know).It was only when I got home I remembered the remark and started worrying.  My question is could this be Varicocele?I have never had any discomfort in that area,and also would my doctor report this to the urologist when he is making an appointment?I feel very stupid now for not asking enough questions when I talked to him.

    "content": "After ejaculation for about 2 hours i (only occasionally) get a stinging/burning sensation in my penis. I have read other threads and this has been stated as 'normal', although is the length of time that i experience this for, which sometimes extends up to a whole day, still normal?  This worries me more and is even rarer, but sometimes when i urinate and have this burning, my urine is fine (although a bit difficult to finish) until the very end, where extremely cloudy urine drops out. This is almost white and smells quite strong and fishy.  I also worry very slightly about the colour of my semen, and wonder if it could be related to a problem causing the cloudy urine. This does only happen about twice a month on average. But going back to my semen, it is quite clear yet probably a good consistency. I am 18 and did not hit puberty late, so is this still normal to still be experiencing nearly clear semen?  As additional information, i am almost certain it isn't a STD as it wasnt until a couple of months ago that i had sex for the first time. This has been going on for about half a year although i can't be sure of how long... but either way, well before i started having sex.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Kidney pain",
    "content": "I'm a female, age 35 years. For about 1.5 months I'd been having a terrible pain on my right side. It would start every night when I'd end up sleeping on my right side (I'd fall asleep on my left side or back, but end up on my right while sleeping). After I laid on my right side, the pain was terrible! It would get better during the day, but the pain still came in waves. I'm quite sure it's not a muscle as I've pulled lots of them, and this feels different. And the pain doesn't get worse or better depending on what position I'm in - I can't get comfortable not matter how I sit or lay.  I finally went to the dr because I can't get any sleep - it is just too painful. I had blood (and other things I can't rememer) in my urine, so they thought I had a UTI based on that and my side pain. They gave me Pryidium and Bractrim. I called them back 5 days later to see about the urine culture. It was negative - there was no infection. I was still having the pain (the pain was much better while I was taking the Pyridium though). They sent me for a CT scan, which showed a small stone in my right kidney. They said it should pass on its own. It's been over 2 weeks, the stone hasn't passed, and I've still got the terrible pain in my side.   My dr was concerned because he said that a kidney stone still in the kidney should not hurt that much. I guess the pain from a stone comes when it moves and it's passed? So, now he's sending me to a urologist to see what is going on. I do have mild chronic renal insuff, but my nephrologist didn't seem too concerned about the stones.   Has anyone ever had theses symptoms? Did you find out what was causing them? Do kidney stones hurt while still in the kidney? If anyone has any experience, ideas, opinions, etc, I would love to hear them. I'm at a loss and I'm in lots of pain (they did give me vicodin to take at night, and it does help some, but I can't take it forever...I need to know what's causing it).   I would greatly appreciate ANY help you could provide.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a male and I had a kidney stone pass in June 2004. The pain was almost unbearable. I am not any kind of medical authority but I believe stones within the kidney are usually painless ( not noticed)  until they break off and try to enter the ureter tube. Most stones actually enter the ureter and with great pain usually pass into the bladder. Some stones, however, are too large and cannot pass through the ureter.  I would suppose that these larger loose stones in the kidney trying to enter the ureter would be somewhat painful and would interfere with urine passage. They eventually require treatment to break them up so they could pass.  I would talk with an expert because I have known people in pain who had to undergo shock waves or extracorporeal shock wave lithotripsy (ESWL)  for relief. The stone did not pass by itself because it was too large. Talk to a good doctor, preferably a Kidney specialist. Loose stones that don't pass can cause complications and much pain. I would not rule out kidney stones but I would surely check all possibilities.\n\n",

I'm still having the same pain in the same place - only on my right side where the kidney is. They said the stone was only 2mm, which seems very small compared to other people I've talked to, and I'm surprised that it hasn't passed by now.  I'm hoping that the urologist has some answers (I see him Friday). I can't sleep well (even on the vicoden they gave me) and hope that he can offer me some relief soon.  Again, thank for your reply, and I hope that you never have to deal with kidney stones ever again!  Happy New Year!\n\n",

I also have pain, mainly at night... but more specifically, in the morning, after I've been laying in one position during the night.  It almost seems as if the stone gradually goes against the wall of the kidney or something at night.  I don't have any great suggestions for you, but I wanted to let you know you're not alone!  In the past I had another stone which I did eliminate - it was this same size, and I had to go to the ER for a morphine shot while it was actually passing.  Don't hesitate when the pain becomes extreme to head to the hospital.  Best wishes!   Kelly\n\n",

He also said that would mean that this is something that I'll be doing for the rest of my life.\n\n",

    "content": "For the last 3 years I have had bouts of hematospermia (blood in the ejaculate).  The most recent and still occurring has been ongoing since September.  I've had a prostate exam, taken antibiotics, and underwent a cystoscope.  The digital exam showed that the prostate was enlarged.  The cystoscope showed nothing abnormal.  The antibiotics worked for a short time, but the symptoms returned.  I'm wondering how serious this is, if serious at all.  Shoul I just continue on antibiotics, or should I get a PSA test?  As far as I know, there is no family history of prostate problems.  But I suppose a history has to have a beginning.\n\n",

    "content": "Genital ulceration may be due to infective  or non-infective causes. Infective causes are sexually transmitted and include syphilis, chancroid, genital herpes, LGV and granuloma inguinale.   As you have had no sexual exposure, it must be assumed that your recurrent genital ulceration is due to non-infective causes. However, a repeat test for HSV 1 and 2 at the next outbreak is advisable.  Trauma, Behcet's disease, Stevens-Johnson syndrome and carcinoma are non-infective causes of genital ulceration. In your case, carcinoma is excluded because the ulcers are not persistent, not growing larger and tend to heal on their own but recur intermittently at the same site.   Traumatic genital ulcers may be caused by vigorous manipulation of the penile organ, such as in prolonged and repetitive acts of masturbation, which is not admitted. A common site is the frenulum of the penis, which is the site you are attempting to describe. Behcet's disease is usually accompanied by mouth ulcers. Stevens-Johnson syndrome is a hypersensitivity of acute onset, frequently caused by infection or certain drugs and may occasionally cause genital ulcers, mouth ulcers and a conjunctivitis.  At the next outbreak of these ulcers, please get examined by a genitourinary physician for diagnosis and reassurance.

    "content": "Over the past week and a half or so, I have felt pain in my right testicle and generally across the lower abdomen.  I have a cyst resting on the top of my right testicle that has been present in about it current size for just under 8 years (it has seemed to slowly grow into the size of a third testicle over that time).  In April I experienced the same type of pain and saw both a GP and a urologist.  The urologist initially diagnosed the cyst as a spermatocele, and he felt this was confirmed by the ultrasound they took.  The pain is worse when I lie down on my stomach or back, and also when I sit down.  Someone has suggested to me that it could be a swollen prostate, but I don't really have any urination problems.  The pain in my abdomen is a tight pressure-like pain radiating at times into my back and thighs.  The testicle pain is also a tight, squeezing pain.  I am wondering if the cyst is the cause of all the pain.  The urologist I saw told me the cyst is probably best left untouched, since there is a risk of damaging the testicle if it is removed.  He also told me there was no sign of and not really any chance of malignancy.  What should I do about the pain?\n\n",

There are other conditions that cause the symptoms of frequent and night time urination including Endocrine disorders (for example, Diabetes, Diabetes Insipidus), etc. I would suggest an evaluation by an Endocrinologist to rule out any dysfunction. There are programs that assist those that are uninsured for a reduced fee or free based on need. If you are located in the North Dakota ? area here are two links that may provide you with information in which you may find the assistance that you need. Click here! Click here!

    "title": "Penile injury causing ED?",
    "content": "I am a male in my early - mid 30s.  I apologize for the length of this post, but the circumstances are a bit odd (in my opinion).  On Thankksgiving day (about 10 days ago), I was using the restroom where I had some trouble with a fuzzy toilet seat cover and  a slippery bath rug.  While attempting to use the restroom, I wound up wrestling with the toleit seat cover and seat (keeping them up and not urinating all of ther place).   My shaft of penis was about half way out my zipper (levis) when I began losing the battle.  I stopped urinating and held it.  My penis began to get partially erect (it wasnt fully flacid).  my foot slipped on the bath rug and that action caused me to apply a downward pressure on my penis against the bottom of the zipper (the bottom of my penis was in contact with the bottom of the zipper).  There was a sharp pain which seemed like maybe the urine expanding in my urethra by the force of the downward pressure on the bottom of my penis.  Also, there was some pain in the bottom of my penis where it was in contact with the zipper.    No external abrasions were noticed, but I did have a small amount of blood in my urine.   I did not notice any blood in my urine when I went to the restroom later that evening but there were some drops of blood in my underwear.  Since that episode, I have seen a nurse practitioner who examined me and tested my urine for blood (negative).  Her examination was normal (no bruising, swelling, or abrasions), but she refered me to a urologist because I am now experiencing some erectile dysfunction.  That is, my erections are not as firm as normal, particularly in the head of the penis nor do they maintain themselves.  I have been able to have sex and ejaculate, but again there is some delay in obtaining and trouble maintaining an erection throughout the session.  Ejaculation is relatively pain free, however, afterwards I do feel some slight discomfort for a brief time.  Urination is pain free.  Also, the mid part of my penis (where most of the pressure was applied when it was in contact with the zipper) sometimes has a slight \"burning/heat\" sensation.  I scheduled an appointment with the urologist who first available appointment is in mid January.  I am concerned that whatever injury I may have will have healed by the time I see the urologist and consequently, may not heal properly.  Is this a valid concern?  I am not sure if this injury is even something that is particularly serious and maybe everything will return to normal once whatever was injured heals, but it is disconcerting.  Any thoughts on what the problem could be?  Should I push to be seen sooner?  My instincts tell me yes.  If so, how do I convey this urgency to the medical assistant booking the appointment (she didnt seem to be particularly moved by story when I first told her).  Thank you for you time\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the reply. :)  Well part of the vein has beomce thinner and there are veins branching off this vein that i could'nt even see before. I've had an ultrasound but i have no faith in the person that did it. It just seemed so amteurish to me.   I plan to keep an eye on it and look for any further changes wihtin the next week. If it gets any worse then i will make another trip to see someone who can tell me once and for all what this is. The lump is actualy hard and seems to be at its biggest when an erection has died down. The lump swells. Plus the vein has become more prominenet on erection and ';m getting discomfort in the area where the lump is. Plus  i can see more veins branching off this vein and i get a vein colourd swelling which runs from the branch vein right the way down  the dorsal side to the base of my penis.  Even though the swellign is the colour of a vein i can't see how it can actualy be a vein because it's shaped nothign like a vein. Its almost like there is blood pooling under the skin or tissue.  I also have another vein on the elft hand side of my penis on the dorsal side that runs from the bottom of my penis right the way to the corona. Now before i found this lump this vein was'nt even vissible when my penis is flacid, Now its visible and it looks like there are little lumps or clots in the bottom half of the vein. It's almost like a beeded neckless.  The vein is not hard and the lumos are soft though.  i feel that the only way i can get this checked out and be happy is if i can get an ultrasound whil;el i have an erection and they can inject some die into the veins to check for any damage, blockages etc. I just wish i coudl go private with a great urologst  and get all tisi checked out and be happy with what he says.  So far the free treamtent i've had has been farcial to be honest.  All i got told by the urologist is that it was normal for veins to change shape. Well i've been palying and peeing with my penis for years and it's never looked liek this before. :(\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Daneth, Sebaceous/Epidermoid cysts may arise in many areas including the scrotum when hair follicles become inflammed. These types of cysts (when no infection is present) are usually painless, smooth surfaced and contain a foul smelling, white or cheesy appearing material when drained. These usually pose no problem unless they become large or infected and are ONLY opened/drained by a physician. Semen is normally cloudy white in color although some may have a slight yellow tinge and it may be considered normal. Inadequate hydration causes slight color changes as well as changes in consistency. Dark yellow semen may indicate an infection or STD. Thickness/chunkiness in the absence of infection, and adequate hydration, etc. may be related to hormone imbalance. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician to identify if an infection etc., is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Physician's, nurses and other health care professionals examine problems related to the genitalia when the need arises and it is not uncommon for this to be part of a physical exam.

    "content": "Hello everyone. I would like a professional opinion for the following matter. My husband came down with severe diarrhea for 2 days. He also had fever (38.3). The first day after a bad bout of diarrhea he noticed that his urine had red colour (excuse my language im from europe). The next day he was feeling better and his urine was slightly red. The third day he was ok. The diarthea stopped and the fever as well and the colour of the urine was totally normal. 40 days prior to this incident he had blood and urine exams (annual check up) and everything were normal. What do you think was the cause of the red colour in his urine? He isnt bothered by this incident by i m afraid that it might be something else. Can any infection that causes diarrhea change the colour in urine? Can the lack of fluids due to diarrhea create this abnormality as well? Could this be hepatitis? Any answer would me enormously appreciated. Thank you all in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dark brown or clear urine are more characteristic of hepatitis so that would not be my 1st assumption.   When the urine is more blood tinged...as in a pink or red color, it can be many things but the most likely are side effect of a medication, recently eating something such as beets or certain brries, urinary tract disorders in which bleeding occurs such as: cystitis, enlarged prostate, bladder tumor, stones, kidney infection.   If it were more a dark yellow (to orange tinge) it might be caused by recent use of laxatives or Vitmain B or carotene.  I would not say that bloody colored urine would come from dehydration...that would make the urine very cloudy, dark yellow...even to a orangy-tinge..but not blood colored.   Any time there is something like that, a call to the doctor would be advised.   Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "That sounds exactly like what I am experiencing myself.  I have been to five different doctors and none of them have diagnosed me either.  I know it is not in your mind.  I posted on Oct. 21st about the pain I am having (yzzidlizzy), I didn't notice your post then.  I don't know if you are male or female, I don't think it would matter, but I am convinced that my pain is due to a yeast overgroweth.  You do not always have to have the symptoms of a yeast infection to have one.  I have done a lot of research out of despration and have found that there is a yeast problem called Candida that can cause yeast to grow in your intestines and can cause you to feel bad.  If you have been on antibiotics or are on birth controll you are more prone to this.  I have come off my birth control to see if that will help me.  I am not a doctor or in the medical field at all.  I am just desprate to figure out what is wrong myself.  I am taking Acidophilus which helps build up the good bacteria in your body and am also taking AZO yeast pills three times a day.  I have been suffering since July with the same feeling you describe.  I just began trying this on the 21st and it hasn't worked yet, but I hope this is the answer for me.  I am also doing reseach to see what foods are best to eat for this condition.  After reading about Candida, I really do think that that is what I have.  One of the things about this condition is that doctors normally have a very hard time diagnosing it and from research that I have read it says that over 1/2 N. Americans suffer from it, but don't know it until they begin to feel sick and can't seem to determine what is wrong.  I hope this may help you some.\n\n",

    "title": "Single White Circular Bump On Penis Rim.",
    "content": "First of all, I'd like to thank any doctors willing to take time out of their day to help. I was wondering if you could help me identify a bump on the rim of my penis.  I'll begin by saying that I'm a 14 year old male. I have never had sexual intercourse, but I have received oral sex, although never given (I mention this because it appeared about three weeks after this, although I don't believe it is related). It's right at the point where the glans head meets the foreskin (I am uncircumsized) on the upper side. It's circular, white and is raised a very small amount above the skin. It's larger than pearly penile papsules and doesn't resemble them. I have had it since, oh, mid this summer; quite a few months. I have noticed a small amount of shine to it and it seems to pull the skin in the area up with it (almost as if the skin is covering it). The final thing is that when I first got it (I'd say for the first three or four days), it pained me slightly, but only when it was touched. After that and until last week, it was painless and felt just like the rest of my skin. However, last week it began to pain me again, but went away in two days (very strange, I also had a cold, possibly my immune system?) I've been searching Google and what not for quite a while and haven't found anything that quite matches my description. I also don't really want to set up an appointment with my doctor (female) which would mean going through my parents (embarassing). So any advice (or ideas as yo what it could be) you can give me (which I assume will be get it checked by a doctor) would be helpful.  Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

I have headaches every day. My back hurts, my legs ache, I have a period every 3 weeks. The stomach pain is not as bad as the rest of it. I can deal with it. I also get sick when in the sun but sometimes I just get sick from the headaches. I would suggest that you go to another Dr. I would suggest a urologist or someone that specializes in internal med. I hope things get better for you. I know how it can be living with these symptoms. I'm only 29 yrs old , I'm married with 3 kids. I can't do any of the things that I use to enjoy doing.

    "title": "My penis always hurts. Please someone help me out here.",
    "content": "Ok I went to a doctor about this already but he pretty much sent me out with a pat on the back and told me nothing was wrong but there is something wrong and the guy didn't even check anything. Just for the record I am circumcised. Here is the story. For a while now my penis has been sore and not just sometimes but all the time and always in the same spots which are most of the back of the glans and the left side of the glans along with a little of the more sensitive skin below it. this soreness is accompanied by redness most times and it is just always there no matter what. I try to ignore it but any time I touch those areas it hurts. It gets to the point where I don't even touch the head of it when I masturbate anymore because it just would hurt to much. I think that the reason for this is that back a while ago last year I had been getting very creative and exploratory in masturbating and had decided to try some high friction techniques I would take something cloth like and rub it very hard and fast while focusing the friction on the head of the penis. I had always read online that you cant desensitize yourself and you cant hurt yourself masturbating and that the penis does not get callused or anything like that so I felt I would be ok. I got sore from it but it didn't seem all that bad. there was some numbness sometimes but it always went away after a bit. I kept doing it for a long time even when these things would happen and I only stopped when I realized that I was really sure I was losing sensitivity and that I was getting sore allot and without provocation. It was already too late though because my penis was now cracked and the look of the skin wasn't the same. It was now always sore in the more high friction areas and certain areas were so insensitive that they weren't worth even bothering with. I haven't had a good masturbation session in like a year because I cant really feel anything anymore except for pain. I am really freaking scared and I don't know if it is going to be like this for my whole life. I have a girlfriend and I am sort of scared to have sex with her because I think that it is probably just going to hurt.  I am only 18 and I might as well forget about the rest of my life if this is never going to get better. I have given up on waiting for it to fix itself because about year is plenty of time. This in not a contact allergy. I have heard this explanation before and I can bet my life on this not being a contact allergy. This is obviously not an STD because I am not sexually active. This doesn\u2019t seem to be an infection. This shows none of the properties an infection would have. I believe I have weakened the skin in that area in some way. I believe I have callused and desensitized the skin and it is weakened in certain areas so that it is now constantly causing me pain. It has been something like three quarters of a year now maybe longer and I really don't think that waiting is going to fix this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello whiskeyblue,  From what you have posted, this may be what we can call a \"penile fracture\". the connective tissue surrounding the penile shaft may have been traumatized causing it to tear.  And because of this, the usual complaint is localized pain, sometimes accompanied with swelling. This usually happens when  the penis is in its erectile state and a sudden blow/force is accidentally applied to the shaft.  It is better that you see a urologist to rule out this condition.

It seems that the testicle is a bit larger than the right one as well.  I do realize that this is something that I need to have checked but here is where my questions lies.  I have recently changed jobs and I am waiting (3 weeks) before my medical insurance takes effect.  How big of a chance am I taking by waiting the 3 weeks until my insurance takes effect should this prove to be cancer?  I am scared should it prove to be cancer my insurance company will consider it a pre-existing condition and deny payment if I do not wait.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I just went to the doctor to get a general checkup.  I also asked him to check my testosterone levels.  When the results came back this is what they said:  Testosterone, Total 237.3  ng/dL Testosterone, Free  6.2   pg/mL  Now I obviously have no idea what this means, so my doctor explained to me that my testosterone levels were low.  Now I am a 20 year old male, Latin(Cuban), physically fit( I weight lift 4 times a week, 150 lbs. on a 5'9\" frame.  Regular body structure, no feminine qualities, so everything seems fine on the outside.   When I was around 12 years old I had an undescended <---I don't know if that is spelled correctly, but it sounds like what the doctor said,  testicle (the right one) which was brought down by surgery. On the inside I have an incredible sexual drive, no erectile problems, in fact is is very easy for me to get aroused.   So I am \"stuck\",  should I worry, I have no medical background so I know not where I stand? What can be the cause of this and what can be done?  My doctor recommended Testosterone Shots, but I am not sure whether I want to do that, are there any consequences to that? As much info as possible is appreciated. Thank You!!\n\n",

Friday night i went into the emergency room with the same pain and did a urine test, and an ultrasound, both which came out clear.  After telling the doctor i had been running alot he then asked me about wearing supports, i replied to him that i never wear them so he figures thats what caused my pain.  After coming back from the doctor i noticed that the tube going from my left testical was firm and swollen, i immediatly felt the other and found no such thing i havent gone back yet but i am in extreme debate since my left testical is now slightly bigger and hanging lower than the right --------extremely worried\n\n",

With that being said, I will respond to your other post. Testicular varicoceles (enlarged veins) commonly presents with a feeling of heaviness or ache in the scrotum, pain, an enlarged \"cord\" or feeling of a \"bag of worms\". Conservative treatment when symptoms are mild or nonexistent and fertility is not an issue are scrotal supports. When more significant symptoms are present, and a question regarding testicular damage arises, or there are problems regarding fertility less conservative treatment such as surgery may be suggested. I would suggest an evaluation by a urologist along with a repeat ultrasound. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The pain seems to be more around the testicle then actually on it.  In addition to that I also have minor pains in my right leg. As much as I didn\u2019t want to, I tried looking through my testicles but I didn\u2019t see anything abnormal but then again I  wouldn\u2019t know.

I usually don\u2019t masturbate much anymore but I used to do it quite frequently. please help me, I don\u2019t know what to do and I really can\u2019t take this anymore.

I've also been on a number of different tablets which have not helped either. Around the same time this occured i found out i had poly cycstic ovarian syndrome but my doctors don't think it's connected. I am also on anti depressants as this is a very hard problem to deal with and have wondered whether it could all be an anxiety problem although the anti depressants havn't helped the problem and my doctors don't think its entirely anxiety.  Any suggestions you have would be greatly appreciated as this is affecting my life.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have never had a problem getting or sustaining an errection, however I never ejaculate during sex (with or without condom)  or oral stimulation. I can ejaculate through masterbation but only if I do it myself. I've been with enough different girls to realize that this is a problem with me and not them. I am only 20 years old and this is starting to concern me. I'm wondering if it's a psycological problem maybe. However, I'm also a smoker if that has any bearing on the matter. I find even the thinest condoms greatly reduce the feelings accosiated with intercourse (to the point where it's un-pleasurable) and am wondering; could this simply be a sensitivity problem or is it likely something more serious? Also, is there any kind of sensitizing cream I could try? Any help with this matter would be most welcome. Thanks\n\n",

Toxins you get from smoking can affect a lot of organs in your body and ejaculation/erection is not spared from this. However, as what you have mentioned in your post, we cannot rule out the possibility of an underlying psychiatric illness. It would be best if you consult your physician about this matter.  MD\n\n",

I still did it on occasion as a pleasure-type thing...until one day i noticed when I bend over it would feel as if i had some sort of kidney pain (particualary on the left side).  The pain persisted for awhile, and I had it checked out with my physician, and had a cat-scan performed (he thought it could be kidney stones), and they found nothing wrong with my kidneys.  The pain has stopped now.  I'm just wondering if holding urine too long is bad for you in any way (i don't do it for prolonged periods of time, i just drink some water so i get overfull).  And if it would be safe for me to continue this practice.  thanks in advance for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I'm a 24 year old male.  I had surgery over a year ago to repairan inguinal hernia on my right side.  Mesh repair, non-laproscopic, i have a 6 inch scar.  in the days following my surgery, my right testicle swelled to 3 times the size of the other.  It remains that way to this day.  It is not painful.   I know I should have gone to get this condition checked earlier, but I didnt.    The problem is that 3 months ago i left my job which provided health insurance, and they offerred the COBRA extension to me as a former employee.  Its very expensive, and I can either pay for the COBRA and not have a lapse in my insurance coverage, or not pay, let my coverage lapse, and risk having a pre-existing condition when i do get new insurance coverage and finally have this condition checked and/or repaired.  I wish i could get this checked, find out if this is a serious problem, find out if it is related to the surgery or a separate occurrance, and what my best course of action is.  I will be moving out of state in 2-3 months and will likely have health insurance offerred by my employer.    SO... is the condition normal following an inguinal hernia mesh repair 14 months ago? could it be something unrellated to the surgery? would it be a pre-existing condition? should i sign up for the cobra coverage just to avoid a lapse in my coverage?  please help. thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Some swelling might occur in the region of the pre existing hernia after operation due to a sterile collection immediately after a hernia repair which if not drained might get organised later on. It is unusual for a testicular swelling to occur right after a hernia repair. Is that swelling continuous with your groin?? In any event, you should have consulted your surgeon immediately after that had occured, even now it's not too late. I suggest you go and visit your surgeon immediately. A testicular swelling needs proper evaluation. One thing however is quite possible. Many people with inguinal hernias have a coexistent vaginal hydrocele on the same side which is masked by the symptoms of hernia. It is highly possible that your \"testicular\" swelling is actually a hydrocele which you had not noticed earlier on and which needs just a simple surgery for cure. In any event visit your surgen immediately. Regards.....\n\n",

It's like it's going straight through my body in no time at all, I can drink like 500ml and than urinate it all out in like 1~2 hours. I haven't really noticed any increase in thirst and my urine concentrates when I am not drinking water, and when I sleep I can go about 5-7 hours without having to get up to urinate although when I do it tends to be concentrated and there is a lot.   I went to a doctor a couple weeks ago and he did that dipstick test on my urine to test for any thing and he said it was clean and told me not to worry it would go away eventually. But I am still urinating frequently after I drink. I had full blood work done like 3 months ago and everything was fine, and I have had a cholesterol and fasting blood glucose where I was told I was hypoglycemic.   I looked up on the net and the only thing I could find was diabetes insipidis and renal failure, I am really terrified at the moment that my kidney's are shutting down and I am going to the doctor again on friday. But all the sites and information I looked into said it took time for stuff like DI and Kidney failure to actually cause symptoms and that long before it gets to the point that it will show up on urinalisys or blood tests.  Oh, I am also taking 20mg of Fluoxetine - Prozac(sp?), and one of the side effects is Polyuria and my symptoms started a couple days after taking it, but I asked my doctor and he said no.\n\n",

Dr Anthony Solomon Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine  I don't believe it has been, I had my urine dipped or whatever it is they do with that paper test and it came up negative and I had my electrolytes checked 3 months ago when I went in for heart palpitations to check for possible causes the blood test was good according to my doctors.  Urogenital: Frequent: Painful menstruation, sexual dysfunction, urinary tract infection, frequent micturition.  Infrequent: Abnormal ejaculation, impotence, menopause, amenorrhea, menorrhagia, ovarian disorder, vaginitis, leukorrhea, fibrocystic breast, breast pain, cystitis, dysuria, urinary urgency, urinary incontinence.  Rare: Breast enlargement, galactorrhea, abortion, dyspareunia, uterine spasm, vaginal hemorrhage, metrorrhagia, hematuria, albuminuria, polyuria, pyuria, epididymitis, orchitis, pyelonephritis, salpingitis, urethritis, kidney calculus, urethral pain, urolithiasis.   Those are the side effects listed at Mentalhealth.com as well as many other places. It might be a coincidence that my polyuria started 2~3 days after I started taking Prozac, but before that I had 3 blood tests in the last 2 months one when I complained of palpitations which checked my cbc, thyroid hormones, and I believe electrolytes incase I was dehydrated. Once again in the hospital when I thought I might be having a heart attack, and then again to check cholesterol and blood sugar all of which came back negative for an abnormalities. Then I had a urine test which my doctor performed the dipstick test which came up negative for anything.  I guess though this means it's not all in my head, or something that's just going to go away. What are the chances of it being something serious?  Oh I also forgot to mention I had an ultrasound of my abdomon 3 years ago when I complained of discomfort in my lower abdomon which was later diagnosed as Irratible Bowel.   Although I was told that the ultrasound wasn't to check my colon but other organs to make sure it wasn't them, everything was okay back then as well.\n\n",

    "title": "Multiple bilateral renal cysts- implications?",
    "content": "First of all, thank you for taking the time to read my posting.   I am a 35 y/o female in good health. About two months ago I started having back and flank pain, along with nausea. The pain is between the bottom of my rib cage and my navel, but in my back and flanks on both sides. It's a dull ache, intermittent, that sometimes feels like a burning sensation, and other times like pressure. I have no pain when urinating, or other symptoms. Just the flank and back pain, and nausea.  I went to a walk in clinic, where they did a urinalysis- found no evidence of a UTI, but did find a small amount of blood, along with a trace amount of ketones and protein. He gave me a 3-day antibiotic regiment of Factive-7 telling me he didn't think it was a UTI, but wanted to give it to me just in case.   The symptoms did not go away after the 3 days, so I went to my regular primary care physician. He did blood work, and said all came back normal, but pointed out my BUN/Creatinine ratio was 21. He also did a urinalysis, which again showed a small amount of blood, but no ketones or protein as before.   He sent me for an abdominal, pelvic, and transvaginal u/s. The results showed a cyst in my right ovary of about 2.5 cm, and a cyst in my right kidney of about 2 cm.   After the u/s, he followed up with an abdominal and pelvic CT scan, both with and without contrast. Multiple hypodensities were found in both kidneys. There were 6 total: two of them were about 2cm, and the other 4 were less than 1 cm. The radiologists report stated that the larger hypodensities were fluid filled cysts, but that the other 4 were to small to characterize, but said more than likely represented cysts as well.  My primary care physician had me for a follow up, and wasn't sure what could be the cause of my flank pain and nausea. He prescribed Protonix, which helped somewhat with the nausea, but has not helped the flank and back pain. He mentioned PKD, but I am not sure of any family history (it's unknown on my father's side). My doctor phoned a urologist colleague of his while I was there, who advised him to refer me to a nephrologist.   I wasn't able to get in for a while, because he's going on vacation. I found a nephrologist about 50 miles away, who I went to see yesterday. He did another urinalysis, and found my specific gravity to be 1.0005, and urobilin to be 2mg. Also found a trace of blood and a small amount of white blood cells. Other than that, the urinalysis was within normal ranges.   Even though I told him my PCP prescribed Factive-7 two months ago, he prescribed a 10 day regimen of Bactrim and suspects it might be a UTI.   My questions are these: Can I have a UTI without pain in urinating, frequent urination, etc...?  Are my symptoms (flank and back pain, nausea) consistent with a UTI? Given my situation and findings above, do you have any ideas what might be possible cause(s) of my symptoms?  Provided this current antibiotic does not relieve me of my symptoms, should I visit a urologist or nephrologist, or both? My PCP said urologists basically do surgery, while nephrologists specialize in treatment.   Thank you again for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "KIDNEY CYSTS AND LOIN PAIN",
    "content": "The kidneys are situated at the back of the abdomen, below the diaphragm, one on each side of the spine. Therefore, the site of your pain coincides with the anatomical location of your kidneys and unless proved otherwise, the kidneys are the source of your pain.  Adult polycystic kidney disease  (PKD) is an inherited condition in which multiple cysts develop throughout the kidneys. These cysts increase in size with advancing age and lead to kidney enlargement, progressive destruction of normal kidney tissue and gradual loss of kidney function. One third of patients with PKD will also develop cysts elsewhere, such as in the liver, pancreas, spleen or ovary.  The classical features of PKD include:  Acute loin pain and/or blood in urine  Abdominal discomfort caused by enlargement of the kidneys Development of hypertension or kidney malfunction.  Presence of multiple cysts in the kidneys detected by a renal ultrasound or CT scan.  It appears you have most of these features, but that does not confirm the diagnosis. It is common to find multiple simple renal cysts in persons who do not have PKD.  UTI may present in different ways depending on the location of infection. In upper UTI, acute infection of the kidneys (pyelonephritis) may present as loin pain and tenderness with fever and systemic upset. Lower UTI may present as frequency of urination, burning on micturition, lower abdominal pain and tenderness, and the findings of pus cells and red blood cells on urine analysis. A culture in both types of UTI confirms the diagnosis. In answer to one of your questions, yes, you can have a kidney infection without the features of frequency and dysuria.  You did not state if your blood pressure was measured and if it is normal. What are the individual results of BUN and Creatinine? Your BUN/Creatinine ratio is elevated at 21 (normal range is 10-20).  It is worthwhile waiting for the results of treatment which the nephrologist has initiated. Yes, I agree with your PCP that the nephrologist is the right specialist for your problem.

I don't always get treatment because it always comes back, maybe because of incontinence problems.  However, after I was feeling badly because of the kidney infection, my scalp started to break out in small soars.  First they just cause a bump and then they fill with a fluid that might be puss.  They itch and hurt.  I can feel them all over my head.  After the fluid comes out a small scab forms.  The next day I can feel new bumps and it starts all over again.  I only have them on my scalp and around the edges of my hair.  I do not have facial acne.  What should I do to clear these up and keep them from coming back?  Is is because of a bladder or kidney infection?  Thank you,\n\n",

    "title": "varicocele (ultrasonography question?)",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 22 year old male.  For about a month I have had this heaviness (and sometimes a dull pain) feeling in my left testicle.  The veins feel swollen and the \"bag of worms\" appereance is evidence.  To me that sounds every bit like varicocele.  When I showed it to my doctor he felt something too and ordered an ultrasound to confirm.  However ultrasound came back showing everything to be normal.  My question is would it have mattered if the ultrasound was performed with me lying down?  I have read at a few places that ultrasound taken for varicocele is usually done with the patient standing so the collection of the fluid is detected easier.  Also roughly around the same time my sex drive had taken a dive.  Would it be possible for varicocele to have a impact on the sex drive?  It did return almost fully when the doctor prescribed anti-inflamatory (apo-neproxin) for a week and went away a couple days after I'm off the medication.  Thank you very much for any help provided in advance!  frik\n\n",

I was treated for a genital wart last week, and wonder if that has anything to do with it. I'm scheduled for an annual physical next week and was planning on having it looked at then. I'm curious, however, as to whether it might need more immediate attention. In case this information is relevant, I haven't been sexually active in the past six months.\n\n",

Sexually transmitted epididymitis among sexually active men less than 35 years of age is most often caused by chlamydia or gonorrhoea.

My only concern is that It's been a very long time since I was last sexually active, and the diseases associated with testicular discomfort (chlamydia and gonorrhea) generally manifest somewhat shortly after sexual contact with an infected person, correct? I was under the impression that genital warts has a much longer latency period, ranging from several weeks to several years, which is why I only learned of this condition recently. Nevertheless, I definitely do not live a \"high-risk\" lifestyle (as evidenced from my lack of recent sexual activity, unprotected or otherwise). That's why I was ruling out other STDs as a possible cause. Is my reasoning incorrect? Thanks again, it was very helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Here is an unedited version of an article I found published in 2002,  which answers your question.  Complications of lithotripsy (ESWL) may include the following:  The most common complication is blood in the urine, which lasts for a few days after treatment. To reduce the chances of bleeding, doctors usually tell patients to avoid taking aspirin and other NSAIDs, which can promote bleeding, for seven to 10 days before the treatment.  Bruising and minor discomfort due to the shock waves are common in the back or abdomen.  Sometimes the stone is not completely fragmented with one treatment, and additional treatments then may be required. Inability to pass stone fragments may also be a particular problem in patients who have cysts or other kidney abnormalities.  Its safety for small or abnormal kidneys is not fully known. For example, ESWL appears to be safe for children, although a 2001 study reported temporary damage in the kidney tubules after treatment. It is not known if this complication has any long-term consequences. Experts recommend minimizing as much as possible the impact and number of shocks in young people. If more than one treatment is needed, there should be a waiting period of at least 15 days between sessions.  I hope the information is helpful.

    "content": "I'm 19 and have been having a lot of discomfort in my scrotum and also my abdomen. The first thing I could think of was that I had cancer, so I went to my physician and she checked and found no lumps or anything. She wanted me to get a testicular sonogram just in case but I'm not insured at the moment and can't afford that.  It's like a heavy/dull, aching sensation in my scrotum and lower abdomen. Sometimes it gets so bad it feels like I've just been kicked in the groin.  There is no cancer running in my family, but my grandfather was recently diagnosed with it, but he also smoked for about 50 years.  I also recently found a small dent on the top of my penis that was never there before. It's like a small dimple about half an inch or more in diameter. It's not very noticable unless I'm erect, but I can still feel it.  I've also had a number of other symptoms that might be related:  Constipation Sometimes small, pellet-like bowel movements Cloudy urine Sharp pain in tip of penis (not very often) Slight burning sensation in tip of penis (not very often) Lower back pain and pain in pelvis which is pretty constant  I'd appreciate any help you might be able to give me.\n\n",

Most recent was a diagnosis of diverticulitus that lead to a couple days in hospital and transfuasion.  Prior to his hospital stay he had a kidney scan which revealed a cyst. He has since gone to the Moffit Cancer center here in Tampa and was told he should have a minimum of a laperoscopy to identify if the cyst is cancerous. The Dr. prefered to do a full operation to get to the kidney, but said a laperoscopy could be done delicately.   My question is: Is this the best thing to do to identify if cancer is present?  Is prolonged dehydration (he doesn't drink much and golfs in the heat) a catalyst for these cysts?  What are the option?  Thanks so much for your insights.\n\n",

The most common form of renal cysts is known as a simple cyst.  The cause is unknown and often, they disappear on their own.   Usually, renal cysts do not cause symptoms or harm the kidney. Sometimes however, they can cause pain, become enlarged, press on other organs, or become infected. Renal cysts are detected by a renal ultrasound or CAT scan of the kidneys.  When simple cysts are found and there is no pain or complications, no treatment is needed. If this is a simple cyst that does not affect your father\u2019s health in any way, it is unnecessary to subject him to an invasive procedure. Renal ultrasounds and CAT scans are usually diagnostic for renal cysts. Seek another opinion from a nephrologist, who is a specialist in kidney diseases.

I have finally received a report and now have more information that the cyst has been categorized as \"2.3 x 1.6cm rounded mass along the anterior aspect of the right mid renal pole.

Considerations include a hemorrhagic or proteinaceous cyst, or possibly a solid mass.\"  Our thoughts are to do a laporoscopy to try and identify if it is cancerous and then full operation if it is. Would this be a fair course of action? We seem comfortable with the Doctor, but I know my Dad is scared and reluctant, would you there be a chance an operation is not necessary?

Mild symptoms may be alleviated by snug fitting undershorts or scrotal support. One of the complications of a varicocele aside from the obvious pain is a problem with fertility because the blood flow isn't properly cooled and may cause damage to sperm. When symptoms become more than mild and there are issues regarding fertility varicoceles are surgically treated. I would suggest an evaluation by a urologist if one has not already been completed.

As we were both drunk, she threw up and drank water and after a while she started giving me a blow job again.. Everything was ok.. Im not sure if the above has to do with my problem at all but after a few days i noticed that everytime i get an erection and tense it upwards a little.. its kinda painful.  The erection itself isn't painful but only when it is tensed  upwards so it goes up a little.  The pain isnt very painful but it is painful enough to annoy me.  I'm not sure if it a sexually transmitted infection but it is not painful when i go to the toilet or discharge.    Please can someone help me with my problem and give me some advice and knowledge of what it actually is and how to deal with it.. it would be very much appreciated ..  Thank you!\n\n",

I understand your shyness about seeing a doctor, but if you are going to be sexually active, and have unprotected sex, you are at very high risk for all kinds of infections.  Your health isn't something to ignore.  Aren't there sexual health clinics in UK that are confidential?\n\n",

The lump seems almost flat and circular, like a thick disc, rather than round. In the past week, my testes had felt a little sore and sensitive, especially my left teste, then this morning I noticed that there was a hard, lump at the bottom of my left teste and I can't determine if it's actually on the teste itself or on a connecting tube or vein. I'm quite converned about it.   I have not had any major health problems; however, I've been a heavy consistent smoker for many years and I'm also a fairly heavy beer drinker.  The only real health problem I've had was several years ago when I was having chest pains and was informed by a doctor that if I didn't cut down on smoking I would be in danger of getting emphezema(sorry about the spelling!). That problem hasn't reccurred again, though I haven't cut down on the smoking!  If anyone has any advice or information about my problem, I would gratefully appreaciate it.

    "content": "Thanks so much for your care and expertise. I am suspecting now that this may be a case o fepidydimitis. However, I have never really experienced any pain, only a sensitivity. I also failed to mention that I had earlier experienced an itching, ticklish feeling that seemed to come within my penis and than later could only be faintly detected in the area between my scrotum and anus. I had first experienced that about two months ago, shortly after having unprotected sex with someone I know to be quite conservative, but who had a sexual relationship with someone about a year earlier before we met. Now, two months later, the itching is barely noticeable, only if I press the area between my scotum and anus, and then in the past week, especially this morning, I have detected the lump and sensitivity. Are all these symptoms of epidydimitis or testicular cancer?  I just wish to go armed with some probable scenarios to the doctor's office, as I have already had a tooth abcess misdiagnosed by a Chinese dentist here. (Not to suggest that Chinese medical practitioners are lacking in expertise - but more that I have difficulty distinguishing the wheat from the chaff here! )  As well, I should mention that I had once gone into a clinic two years earlier because I was feeling a rather solid feeling in my kidney or stomach area - literally something that  felt like a stone. I was alarmed that it could actually be a kidney stone caused by my drinking, but the doctor informed me that it was just built up acids, but not an actual kidney stone.  Thanks again you for your advice and expertise. -Victor\n\n",

    "title": "blood in urine due to fasting?",
    "content": "Today I received screening lab report results that had five areas flagged as abnormal: 1. Blood in urine (1+) 2. Ketones in urine (1+) 3. Proteins in urine (15 mg/dL) 4. Elevated HCT (48.5%) 5. Decreased monocytes (3.0) The nurse said that as long as I don't have symptoms of a urinary tract infection these results are problably due to having fasted 8 hours before the blood/urine  test. Are all these results \"normal\" for a fast? I thought the test reference ranges took into account fasting as it is required. Would any kind of follow up be needed?\n\n",

Sometimes, blood in the urine can be nonspecific, obviously the leukocytes weren't elevated on the dipstick test, so a urinary tract infection is unlikely.  Don't worry about it, I have seen this frequently.   Proteins can even be from working out, a 1+ is nothing to worry about.  Slight elevations of cells aren't anything to be alarmed about, either.  They don't mean anything unless more severe and with other abnormalities.  Also, the doctor reviewed your results before you spoke to the nurse.  It would be illegal for a nurse to give you results without the doctor's instruction first.\n\n",

    "title": "Difficulties regarding urinating and bowel movements.",
    "content": "Hello,  Please offer some advice.  I'll discuss the urinating first and the much more troubling problem: bowel movements later.  I'm a 21-year old male. For several years now urinating has become progressively more difficult for me.  Nothing drastic yet, but I sometimes have trouble starting urinating, and it often feels like I can't get the entire bladder empty. I also feel the need urinate quite often these days.  Much more so than few years back. I've found showering my penis with hot water helps starting the stream.  Is this normal?  About ten years ago I had a circumcision because my foreskin was too tight and urinating became extremely difficult.  I recall it felt about the same as the forementioned problems, althought of course much more extreme.  Starting from about the same point as these urinating problems, I've also started having difficulties with my bowel movements.  My bowels regularly move about once a day, but the process itself is starting to get awkward. I'm having difficulties getting the stool out. Unless the need to go disembowel is extremely powerful, I feel I can't do it at all.  It's very hard for me to \"push\" it out, and if I do try, the stool comes in very small pieces, as if the anus can't \"stretch\" enough, even though the intestine feels full and I feel there definitely is stuff there to get out.  It helps a great deal if I'm urinating at the same time, so I'd often drink lots of water, and then when I'm about to urinate I'd also try to disembowel and it'd feel a lot easier usually.  All these rituals are starting to severely take time each day.  About a year ago while in military service I told about these problems to a doctor there.  I  did not have nearly enough time to do the daily \"rituals\" I usually do with disemboweling, so I was suffering from constipation there.  I didn't tell him about it in nearly as much detail as described here though, and he said I might be suffering from Irritable Bowel Disease.  But as I've studied it more from the net, I'm not sure if he was correct - my stool is usually rather solid and I don't suffer from constipation per se. What do you think?  When I'm at home several hours a day, like I usually am, I have the time to take care of all these little things to make disemboweling every day possible, but travelling or staying at a friend's house has become troublesome.  I also only work part time and at home, so that helps.  It's starting to feel like it'd be impossible for me to maintain a full-time job or school, without life becoming extremely cumbersome.    Thank you for reading.\n\n",

    "content": "It would have been helpful if you had provided the results of your tests. The basic  screening test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is a urinalysis, microscopy and culture of a fresh, middle stream specimen of urine. If you were placed on \u201cBactrim\u201d and later changed to \u201cCipro\u201d, it is likely that the culture, if done, showed bacterial sensitivity to the latter drug. The culture result would not have been available at your first visit when you were prescribed \u201cBactrim\u201d.  If symptoms are persisting, as your post suggests, you will require an ultrasound scan of the renal tract as well as renal function tests, especially because of poor urinary output and loin pain. Renal ultrasound is usually performed to detect kidney diseases such as cysts, stones, renal scarring, tumours or obstruction. Are you drinking enough fluids? A fluid intake of at least 2 litres per day is helpful in UTI. What is unhelpful is the daily consumption of 1-2 packets of cigarettes, which you disclosed in your profile.  UTI may present as cystitis,  urethritis and acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis  presents with burning sensation, frequency, loin pain and fever. You have three of these symptoms. If further tests as advised show no abnormalities, you should be examined for urethritis and vaginitis.   In response to your question, yes, it is mandatory to go back to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve within 5 days of the medication and you should go earlier if urine output remains poor and loin pain increases.  I hope this information has been helpful. Thank you for contacting this website.  Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

Anyway:  General info: Age: 18 yold Height: 172 cm Weight: 70 kg History: - Anemia (when 4-8 years old)  First problem: - Feeling the urge to urinate everytime I lay in bed. (not necessarilly just at night, it happens in day-time as well)  - And when I get up to urinate, sometimes nothing comes out, and on other occasions, FEW DROPS come out. (although the urge to urinate that i feel is so strong, as if my bladder is full)  \"EDIT: that occurs up to 3 or 4 times everytime i lay in bed. Sometimes it occurs less frequently though\" - I don't feel pain. - The few drops of urine that come out needs a lot of tension to get out but also without pain. - Normally, when i get up or during the day, i urinate normally without the above mentioned criteria at all. - This problem started to happen 8 months ago.  Second problem: - Ejaculating after a very short time from continous stimulation ( Max. 1 min) - The ejaculate consists of 2 different parts: + A low viscous clear whitish fluid that comes out first. + A very high viscous turbid yellowish fluid with gelatinous globules (comes out afterwards). I feel those globules blocking the urethra, so i tend to try to pull them out by force (all this during ejaculation) - I always feel the urge to urinate after ejaculating or sometimes during the sexual activity itself. - When trying to urinate exactly after ejaculation, urine comes out with difficulty like symptoms of the 1st problem. - This problem started to happen 2 or 3 years ago.  I think the 2 problems have something to do with each other, that's why i posted them together. I appreciate your help.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

He is the chairman of the American Pelvic Pain Society and their site is on the net - so in a little bit, I'm going to tell you how to check them out. But for now - I'm going to tell you what he told me.  You see I have something called Interstitial Cystitis.  It tends to irritate your bladder a bit and make you go more than most people.  I didn't fit the general picture for this diagnosis, so I didn't think I had it.  But he ran through a questionaire with me and I did fit some of the questions and based on my pelvic pain before my hysterectomy - it was worth a check to see....Turns out I did have IC.  He said that Hysterectomies can really flare up IC in a person who has it...so its better to know beforehand if you do...but the sooner the better.  Ask your doctor about a test they can run to see if you have this.  If you do - High Acid foods and carbonated beverages are a big No-no!! They will really set you off!! Here are some links for you.

I was finally dx'ed with Pudendal nerve entrapment in Feb of 04. http://www.pudendal.info It's hard to believe that having a hysterectomy in this day and age can cause so many life changing problems. The sad part of having PN/PNE is so few doctors in the U.S. are even aware of the symptoms of it. (Pain while sitting, burning, urinary problems, constipation, etc.) There are many women who have thought that they had IC, and later found out it was PN/PNE! Mine was caused from my hysterectomy, but others, men and women alike,  have gotten it from childbirth, weight lifting, riding a bike, falls, lifting, etc...  It is a horrible condition to have.   Surgery is an option, but the healing time is measured in years, not weeks or months. The pain is unbearable at times. Anyway, thanks again for the tip. Tay\n\n",

I have had ultrasound and X-ray checks of bladder, kidney function, urine flow checks, flexible cystoscopy,PSA test (less than 1), DRE of prostate, and an IVU X-ray. Only things found - urine flow not brilliant, and slightly thickened muscle at neck (?) of my bladder. I get up perhaps twice a night for a pee, and have a sensation, can't really call it discomfort, in my bladder area when I've been lying down for a while. I have had lower back pain for years, but so have a few million others, so I live with it. I'm 49.  If I've just got 'leaky kidneys' then OK, so be it. But if anyone can offer any info I'd be glad to hear it.  Thanks,  Tops\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tops,  i see your doctor did a very good job up to the most invasive investigation to try and find out where the blood is coming from.   Blood without other abnormalities in the urinalysis usually points out to a problem in the urinary passages and not a kidney problem.  One thing i did not get from your story, i know you had a digital rectal exam but was a prostate massage done and a sample taken or not. Blood with the others symptoms that you have (back pain and nigth micturition) could mean that you have prostatitis (infection of the prostate).  These same symptoms could mean just plain enlarged prostate which could present with the same symptom of microscopic blood in the urine.  Microscopic hematuria could mean that there is cancer of the bladder which necessitated you to have a flexible cystoscopy which you did and turned out to be negative.  My recommendation is to follow-up with a urologist, i think the recommendations for microscopic hematuria at this time is to get a yearly flexible cystoscopy.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "okay...  this morning, my girlfriend found blood in her urine. she said it didn't hurt when she went, but that after she was done going to the bathroom she was limping a bit.   however, through out the rest of the day, she hasn't had blood in her urine since. it was only that -one- time today that it happened. then in my car she felt nautious. she said afterwards it was probably motion sickness.   i've read up on what it might be, and i'm thinking uti. the thing is that it only happened that one time and there was no burning sensation when it did happen, just the limping afterward.  the other thing i'm afriad of is pregnancy. we have not had vaginal intercourse, but we have fooled around. yesterday, my fingers went really deep, but not much deeper than usual. so i my have accidentally torn the hymen and that could have been what happened, but i heard that when the hymen is torn, it's almost instantaneous bleeding, or would the hymen just discharge when she urinated? and on that note, wouldn't the hymen come out of a different opening from urine?   i'm really confused here. she has had nausea before, maybe three or four times and had nausea yesterday afternoon. we figured it was the heat in my car (which i really need to do something about) because that is what caused her to be nauseous every time she's been nauseous around me. but nausea is also a sign of pregnancy and can you tell i'm really nervous here?   any possible diagnosis or advice would be helpful...\n\n",

Urinary tract infection is another possibility but as you stated when not accompanied by other urinary tract symptoms it becomes less likely. If this episode should recurr then you should bring it to medical attention asap.  I don't see from your story how she could be pregnant.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  PLEASE respond to this even if you are not sure what is going on, I am desperatley hoping for advice.   (Note: I have no pre-existing medical problems that I know of.)  My problems began for the most part when I started working at a day care in January. I was sick all of the time but that mostly went away after I left the center in June.  Going to the doctor often because of being sick so frequently, I was told I had a very low white blood cell count but nothing ever came of it. I was on antibiotics for upper respiratory infections.  The white blood cell count never went quite back to normal to my knowledge, but my doctor stopped being concerned when it went up enough to be considered almost normal. That doctor since left the office.  Shortly thereafter I began getting bladder infections. Well, I had one that was treated but some symptoms came back, including strange discomfort resembling being sexually turned-on (very strong, uncomfortable way) after urination. I was sent to a urologist who has put me on various antibiotics, did a cystoscope and ultrasound and CT scan and said everything looks normal, but I should get urodynamics done and see a OB-GYN. She also said it may be cystitis. I also have strange, unexplained pain on my left and right sides and have some discomfort during sexual activity. Doctor said kidneys looked fine and didn't explain sexual discomfort problems.  The CT scan showed free fluid in pelvis, the cause of which was unknown. Doctor says it may have been a cyst that ruptured, but did not say whether I may have additional cysts or say whether the fluid was a problem. I am concerned about this.  I will go ahead with these procedures but fear the doctor is not looking deep enough into the symptoms. Or, because I have been through so many different doctors, they may not be looking into my medical history such as the low white blood cell count. Also, was tested for lupas when I went in for arthritis-like pain in right hand, but doctor never called about results.  Again, PLEASE respond with ANY thoughts you may have. I will appreciate it so much!  Jessica   (Also, I have history of diabetes in my family, don't know if I have any symptoms of that. And I was tested for HIV recently, negative.)\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jessica,  Your symptoms and the ct scan findings might point to you having pelvic inflammatory disease which is an infection of the uterus, fallopian tubes and ovaries.  i did not get whether you have already seen the ob/gyn or not from the message. But i think the urologist was right about you seeing an ob/gyn.  Infections in themselves can cause a low white count, usually it is the opposite but sometimes they can cause a low white count. In normal people, there is a condition called cyclic neutropenia (low white count that comes and goes in cycles). There is nothing to worry about. A low white count usually trigers the person/s who take a look at the blood count under the microscope to take a look at the characteristics of the white and other cells and if there was something abnormal, it would have been reported. i think once this whole infection thing is dealth with, i would recommend you getting a couple of complete blood counts to follow up on your white count but so far i don't think that there is any thing serious.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm seeing the gynecologist about this on Thursday but I don't want to wait that long for answers. I seem to have an overly irritable/oversensitive/just plain messed up urethra. Maybe it's just not quite in the right place though. Anyway, these things irritate my urethra very much: alchohol, caffeine, and SEX! During sex, I feel a strong urgency to urinate even if I had just urinated shortly beforehand. Usually, I rush to the bathroom afterwards (sometimes even call a time-out to visit the bathroom) to find that hardly any urine comes out. Then I struggle for several hours with constant but false urgency. This happened several nights ago, and it died down apparently after I took some Detrol LA (I had a very similar problem about a year ago, Detrol was sort of useless, but I took two of the leftover capsules anyway). Now the constant urgency is back for no apparent reason other than that I drank a decaf latte a few hours ago but no normal urethra would freak out about that, right? What's going on there and how is it treated? How invasive are the treatments?\n\n",

    "title": "Pain in genital area and slight abdomen pain",
    "content": "Hi I have a question. This pertains to my wife. About two days ago she was complaining of pain between her vaginal opening and her anus which I believe is the perineum. Yesterday it started to swell in that area and has been causing her pain. She seems fine when shes walking around but seems worse after sitting for awhile. It is very tender to the touch. I have helped her examine it but can't seem to figure out what it might be. At first was thinking of hemorrhoids or hernia but I'm not real sure so if you have any idea what might be causing this or what it might be it would be greatly appreciated. She has also complained today that it hurts when she goes to the bathroom and some stomach discomfort too but she thinks the stomach discomfort might be because of her period being due in about 7 days. Please help. Thanks again.  Shane\n\n",

    "content": "Shane, There are many causes of perineal pain, Hernia as you mentioned which occurs when the local support tissues weaken, allowing loops of the bowel to slip from the abdomen into the groin. It usually, but not always, seen as a bulge when standing upright, coughing, or bearing down. Enlarged lymph glands  Kidney stone  Vulvovaginitis which is an infection of the vulva and/ or vagina leading to pain mainly. Superficial skin infection Skin nodules Pelvic tumors  It would be hard to tell without an examination. I advise you to take her to her gynecologist for a checkup.\n\n",

    "content": "Pain on urination is usually caused by an infection in your urethra (the water passage that your urine comes out of). Often this infection will be cause by a bacterium (germ) called chlamydia. Chlamydia is caught by having unprotected sex with someone who has a chlamydial infection. Chlamydia is very common in young people. Some estimates are that one in ten, or one in five, young people is infected. Many people don't know that they have an infection because they have no symptoms. Chlamydia can be a serious infection (it can also cause infertility). The good news is that it is easy for a sexual health doctor to test you for a chlamydial infection and it can be easily treated completely with antibiotics.   Other causes include:  Non-specific urethritis (NSU): a bacterial infection, which is caught by having sex with someone who is infectious.  Gonorrhoea: a bacterial infection, which is caught by having sex with an infected partner.  Genital herpes: a virus infection, which is caught by having sex or close genital contact with someone who is infectious.  Trichomonas vaginalis (TV): a protozoan infection, which is caught by having sex with someone who is infectious.  Bladder infection (cystitis): usually a bacterial infection, but this is quite uncommon in boys/men.\n\n",
