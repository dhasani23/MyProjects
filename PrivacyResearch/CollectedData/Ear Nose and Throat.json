    "content": "I have had this thumping in my right ear in sync with my pulse for some time now. It ONLY come when I exercise. If I am just watching tv or walking around it is not there. It is only in my right ear. I went to a doctor and they did a scan on my right carotid artery because there was a lump near it (found out it was a swollen lymph node(its smaller now)). It came back fine. I also had an ECHO of my heart and a stress test. Both came back fine. Now I am wondering. Is it possible the the left artery carotid is blocked? Causing more blood to flow through my right carotid artery which in turn is making that noise? Or would it be making that noise in my left ear if it was the case because of the blood flowing past a blocked section?  Basically my question is. If I hear a thumping in my right ear when I exercise would it be from my right carotid artery or my left if something was wrong?  P.S (I have TMJ and i notice when this happens if I move my jaw forward the noise stops)\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Sinus Infection Solutions",
    "content": "Hi, I am wondering what you can suggest for treatment of chronic sinus infection.  I have never had one before (I am in my 50s) and am generally in good health with some \"non-allergic rhinitis\", but at the end of May I came down with a sudden pneumonia.  They now think this was from H influenzae (sp?), which was cultured much later (first culture had been lost).  I did two rounds of Amoxicillin 10 days each, then off antibiotics one week, and then 20 solid days of Augmentin twice daily.  Each time, the antibiotics made me feel much better but when they ended, the coughing and congestion came back.  I do feel stronger and no longer have a fever since the first few weeks, and this last time I didn't get the sore throat back.  Chest Xray followup after 1 mo. was negative, but each time the antibiotics ended I have started coughing up some yellow stuff again.  The right sinus seems fairly blocked.  My problem is conflicting advice and information.  My primary doctor now says it is only \"post-infection inflammation\" and put me on a regimen of daily Claritin, Sudafed and frequent sinus cleansing with saltwater solution. An ENT specialist has felt that it's just a question of the right antibiotic, however, I have recently developed allergies (rash) with a couple including Zithromax and Doxycycline (sp?).  I also once got C-dif after taking Cipro for a stomach infection, so a lot of things are ruled out.  I also use steam inhalation, acupuncture, and have even tried chiropractic a couple of times but after 9 weeks (now one week again without antibiotics), I still have the coughing and congestion and am not sleeping enough.  I am also somewhat depressed and anxious after this long haul, not able to exercise, work completely full-time, and do lots of things.  Do you have any suggestions? I don't find the Claritin helps much and I can do Sudafed but it makes me cough a lot, and both seem to make me feel a little weird and nervous.  My doctor has scared me by saying I could get asthma or get the pneumonia back if I don't follow his regime (he is new to me).    Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Recently Allergic Fungal Sinusitis is getting recognized as one of the forms of chronic sinusitis.This is due to an allergy to environmental fungi. Thick mucin and fungal components develop in the sinus.This occurs in the immunocompetent,atopics ie with family history of allergy.  .Approximately 5% with chronic sinusitis may fall in this category of AFS.Presentation is similar to bacterial types.Severe types present with proptosis.One characteristic is production of semisolid.thick mucus from the nose.Coronal CT scans,MRI are useful in distinction from the commoner bacterial types.RAST skin response are done. Fungal-specific IgE is found elevated along with total igE.Surgery, Corticosteroids,and immuno therapy are the therapy modes. Diagnostic criteria have been suggested by Bent and Kuhn and include  (1) type I hypersensitivity confirmed by history, skin tests, or serology; (2) eosinophilic mucus without fungal invasion of sinus tissue;  (3) positive fungal stains of sinus contents removed during surgery. This is more common in adolescent and young adults. Though I am not giving this as a  diagnosis in your condition it is worthwhile to think of this as a differential diagnosis, in cases which are challenging in undiagnosed chronic sinusitis. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I can well understand your dilemma.You seem to be responding to only one drug (sudafed-that is, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride+ paracetamol) alone, and for all the other drugs, you are either developing some kind of a side effect or the other, or not responding at all. You seem to imply that your doctor has recommended that you should continue taking sudafed.   As you may well be aware, sale of formulations containing pseudoephedrine hydrochloride (as well as ephedrine) are very tightly regulated in many countries although they may be available OTC.  These measures have been put into place because, pseudoephedrine (and ephedrine) in substancial quantities were being diverted to the manufacture of methamphetamine (\"meth\"), a recreational drug. Also, non-medicinal use has caused concern about potential for abuse. I has been used for its ephedra-like effects for causing weight loss,and by atheletes to get 'pumped-up' prior to an event.There is a potential for unintentional overdose as well.   I am not aware of your country of residence.You have indicated that you are taking upto 4 tablets/day.  If you are taking the formulation containing 60 mg/tablet, then it will work out to 240 mg/day(thus, 7.2 Grams/month).    In the USA, pseudoephedrine is classified under the Schedule Listed Chemicals (SLC). Combat Methamphetamine Epidemic Act of 2005, has reduced the Federal pertransaction sales limit (daily sales limit)from 9 grams to 3.6 grams and  has restricted monthly sales to no more than 9.0 grams per purchaser.For procurement via Mail-service pharmacy, a 7.5 gram per 30-day sales limit. In the UK,formulation containing 60 mg of pseudoephedrine hydrochloride per tablet is available in packs of 12. Sale is preceded by a series of questions from the pharmacist to determine if it is safe.  In Australia,  up to 60 mg of pseudoephedrine/tablet is available OTC subject to a pharmacist matching the purchaser's identity to a computerized database to determine if the purchase history is consistent with personal use. In Canada, pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is available as a 120mg \"12 hour time release\" capsule.  Whether oral pseudoephedrine hydrochloride is really effective as a nasal decongestant is still a matter of debate. Under these circumstances, as in your case, it may become increasingly difficult and cumbersome to purchase this medication. You should discuss with your doctor regarding alternatives such as saline nasal drops/sprays, or phenylephrine nasal drops. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ear problems after a airplane flight",
    "content": "Hi, The Eustachian tubes which connect the middle ear cavities with the nasopharynx have two functions. The primary function of the eustachian tube is as a pressure-equalizing valve for the middle ear.  The middle ear space is filled with air, and this air needs to maintain pressure equal to the \u201coutside\u201d air pressure(atmospheric pressure).  The Eustachian tube is normally in a closed position.  Its opening is controlled by certain small muscles. It needs to open periodically to equalize the pressure to that of the atmosphere. Thus, it allows air into the middle ear to replace air that has been absorbed by the middle ear lining (mucous membrane), or to equalize pressure changes occurring during changes in the altitude.  Under normal circumstances, the Eustachian tube opens momentarily in response to swallowing or yawning.  Anything that interferes with this periodic opening and closing may result in a negative pressure in the middle ear as a result of which, the eardrum gets \u201csucked inward\u201d and becomes retracted.  In an adult, this is usually accompanied by some discomfort, such as fullness or pressure in the ear (ear popping), and may result in a mild hearing loss.  This type of temporary eustachian tube dysfuntion is commonly experienced during altitude changes during air travel, while climbing mountains or during scuba diving. Upper respiratory infections, allergies or narrow eustachian tubes may predispose to this dysfunction.  There are many options available to treat a poorly functioning Eustachian tubes.  Nasal steroid sprays are frequently tried, and in adults nasal and oral decongestants may be of help.  If an infection is thought to be present, then antibiotic therapy is appropriate.  If allergies are thought to be contributing to the Eustachian tube dysfunction, allergy testing and treatment may be indicated.  When Eustachian tube dysfunction persists despite maximal medical therapy, surgical procedures may be indicated.  Ventilation tube placement into the eardrum is indicated for persistent or frequently recurrent ear infections. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, About a month ago I got a basic flu. Had a fever for a night then had nasal congestion, sore throat. Just the usual. But a week afterwards I noticed my tongue turned yellow. So I told the doctor and he ordered me to take Nystatin and I took about 2/3rds ofit but it was clearly doing nothing. One night I used a flashlight to look inside my mouth clearly and realized that my left tonsil was really swollen. So I went to an ENT. He had me take a CBC, tongue culture and throat culture. All the results came back normal. Lymphocites were .3 below the normal range. Both tongue and throat cultures came back negative. Both my GP and ENT say not to worry but I am worried they are not putting 2 + 2 together. I still have a brownish orangish tongue, still a swollen left tonsil, and my throat hurts on and off. Sometimes just when I eat and sometimes when I swallow. But it isnt consisten. And I still have some mild nasal congestion and sneeze a few times a day. The thing that bothers me the most is the orangis color tongue as it is so odd. So any help I would really appreciate it. Many thanks :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There could be a number of differential diagnoses for the type of lesions that you describe.  Although the site of the lesions is suggestive of  Angina bullosa hemorrhagica (ABH), it is probably not the case, as they are not hemorrhagic.  Molluscum contagiosum is a benign tumor-like viral disease often seen in children. In adults it is sexually transmitted and frequently associated to HIV infection. Molluscum contagiosum virus, has two subtypes:  - MCV-1 and  - MCV-2.  Lesions caused by both subtypes are indistinguishable.  MCV-1 is very frequent and has a worldwide distribution, while MCV-2 occurs mainly in HIV male patients.  Oral lesions are rare and have been reported in HIV patients. They are very similar to the cutaneous lesions. They present as solitary to several 1-3 mm dome-shaped papules with a central umbilication (giant lesions, sometimes > 1cm, are exceptional). The tends to mainly affect the lips, but the buccal mucosa and tongue may also be occasionally affected.  Oral lesions are associated to HIV infection, decreased number and impaired function of T cells but, there are some reports on immunocompetent patients as well. Therefore, if one is immunocompetent, the chances of such lesions being molluscum contagiosum are extremely small indeed.  Pemphigus is a rare condition belonging to a group of blistering autoimmune diseases.There are several types of pemphigus, one of which is the paraneoplastic pemphigus (PNP). This disorder occurs as a complication of cancer, usually lymphoma and Castleman's disease. It may precede the diagnosis of the tumor. Painful sores appear on the mouth, lips, and the esophagus.This also may not fit the description in your case.  So, as a definitive diagnosis needs a thorough visualization of the morphology of the lesions, you must consult you doctor for the same. Good luck!\n\n",

Do consult an ENT surgeon and discuss the possibilities. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden hearing loss from an impact",
    "content": "Hello Tony,Hope you have recovered from the transient hearing loss and tinnitus.The commonest cause is age related, the next being exposure to recreational and occupational noise.The cause of this hearing loss is due to impact on the ciliary cells of the inner ear.High impact blasts like gunshot,jet takeoff,rock music all are of high decibels and can cause serious damage if not protected.One should remember that lesser decibels for a prolonged period also may result in damage even though we may find it bearable a sound.Temporary threshold shifts are common in persons exposed to excessive noise, and they represent transient hair cell dysfunction.Assuming that it is of this type you would recover with out any sequelae.However repeated such injuries could lead to progressive hearing loss culminating in  permanent loss of hearing. So do make sure that you protect your ears from this eminently preventable condition.If you have any doubt you can get an audiometry done to make sure. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Tinnitus is a common problem associated with ageing.This is not necessarily due to ageing process, but due to the number of times we get exposed to loud noise either at work,or at relaxing moments when music is full blast on!Right from wax in the ext ear canal,middle ear infections to the damage to the microscopic nerve endings of the inner ear,all can result in tinnitus.Most cases resolve but the severe types and rarer causes(Acoustic tumor) do cause concern.A CT scan may be indicated in doubtful cases. While there is no specific treatment prevention is most important.Keep ear plugs handy and use them when high decibel noise is being heard.Decrease salt intake, caffeine and nicotine.

    "content": "Hello, Cats are one of the most common animal allergies and you cannot depend on your father becoming immune.  Studies have indicated that having pets as a child decreases your risk of allergies and asthma as an adult, but I have not seen such information on adults.  You cannot depend on it and unless your father underwent allergy treatment for desensitization of particular allergies, it is a risk.  It depends to a large degree on just how allergic the person is.  Some people are able to tolerate a pet in spite of allergies with compulsive vacuuming of furniture, carpets (even the cat!) and keeping the cat confined to certain areas of the house - nowhere near the sleeping area.  It's a chance he would have to take if you choose to do this.  Then you must consider how disappointing it would be if you had to get rid of the cat after having it as a pet for a time.  I know this is difficult for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If in the affirmative, an implantation dermoid is possible.This arises out of the parts of skin that are carried underneath the skin in the process of piercing.Usually single. But you describe a cluster, which makes it less likely. Other posssibilities are an auricular appendage that arises on the lobule - some of which can be sessile.Again a cluster of appendages may be rare.  Neuromas of the lobule have been described(unilateral/bilateral).They can be multiple.This may need to be ruled out in your case. Best wishes!\n\n",

The only thing that can be done apart from surgery is preventive aspects.If you have such a tendency best is to avoid any body piercings. Intralesional steroids.lasers,cryotherapy and silicone sheets are other modalities if it would be keloid.Implantation dermoids would be treated by surgery. Best wishes.\n\n",

I can't stand any noises, not even cars driving past, etc. When I'm away from the home, although some noises irritate me, I don't feel the need to \"block out\" sound. I am now hearing wooshing noises while wearing earplugs, which is making sleep extremely difficult. I feel as though it will never be quiet enough. I wondered whether wax had build up due to the earplug use, causing tinnitus, and have used ear drops although they just gave me an earache. Does this sound as if I have some kind of a hearing problem? Psychological? Tinnitus? I'd love to learn how to cope with it and whether I should try ease off the earplugs, it's becoming such a problem and I feel crazy!\n\n",

Regarding the twitching in your ears, please refer to an earlier post about this exact symptom and my reply it. Do you or any member of your family suffer from any other conditions apart from those described? Do you know what type of diabetes you suffer from?  What is your occupation?   Regarding the white spots you describe in your vision, are they bright lights or white spots? Are they limited to one or both eyes? Do you suffer from headaches before or after they occur? Do you experience any other unusual symptoms around the time that the white spots appear? I ask these questions because a common symptom of a subtype of migraines is the appearance of halos in the vision with or without headaches. With this information we may be able to come closer to a diagnosis.   Kind Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

I strongly suggest, given your age and need to get back your quality of life, that you visit your family doctor who should perform a full neurological exam and consider referral to a neurologist if any concerns arise.

    "content": "My left ear feels clogged basically. I can gear out of it pretty well, maybe slightly less than normal but pretty unnoticable if at all.   Feels like preesure, I can hear myself breathe and when I talk I get the light echo in it. No dizzyness or vertigo or anything, just the pressure. But its very uncomfortable.  This has been going on for weeks maybe even a month now, and is about everyday almost all day. With very small windows where it seems to clear up.  I saw an ENT about this and they did multiple tests including a pressure test and it all cleared as normal (although it happeend to be on one of the days i wasnt experiencing symptoms, so maybe that had some effects?)  Anyway, all the doctor could suggest was that it was swelling because of sinuses and gave me prescription nasal spray for it. I want entirely statsified with this answer, but i used the spray semi regularly with varrying levels of effectiveness...it was hard to say if it did anything. As it worked sometimes and not others, but then again the symptoms came and went on their own as well.  I tried buying some OTC spray this week, Afrin, but it has had no effect whatsoever.   Trying to find out if this could be anythign else? do I need to go back to the doctor? Its very uncomfortable to breathe all day with a clogged ear, feels like its pulling on the ear all day. Trying to find a solution for this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your problem is a really common one, and is usually related to a sinus problem or allergy. The eustachian tube on the affected side is getting air trapped inside, which means the tube is pressed upon or swollen off and on. There is such a network of interconnected chambers, passages, etc., in this area that it's often difficult to visualize it, especially since it can be intermittent. Ideally you would go in to be seen when the problem is actually happening, but that's almost impossible to arrange.   The nasal spray seems to have worked up to a point, but it also may be working against you. If it is used for more than three days in a row, you run a risk of causing a rebound effect, wherein the tiny blood vessels stay engorged and the problem becomes more severe or even constant.   You should probably be put on a course of steroids to reduce the inflammation and congestion, and hopefully that will give the root cause time to correct itself. It's not a serious problem, but it can be awfully distracting.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It happens almost every day, but never in the morning. When it happens it is this way for hours and hours.   Once this happens even if it stops for a moment the next time I swallow (or even do something like bend over) it is back to feeling like it needs to pop.

I just happen to notice that I am no longer listening to myself breathe and talk...  I went to the doctor and he told me that he thought I had a sinus infection. He prescribed medrol and cipro. I have now taken two rounds of medrol and a z-pack in addition to the cipro... but still no relief!!  Is there anything else that can be done about this?? It is so annoying.

Here is a link to the neti pot remedy, which can be done at home or sometimes by some of the more holistically-oritented general practioners. It's so time consuming and awkward most GPs won't bother to do it anymore: http://www.ehow.com/how_4537025_cure-cl ... -tube.html If you're willing to subject yourself to this it might, repeat, might relieve your symptoms.   Usually this will resolve, eventually, on its own. A good, old school ear, nose and throat specialist may still perform unclogging procedures too, some of which may be simpler than the one described at the site linked above.  Good luck to you.

    "content": "For FoxHellion: While one of the potential side-effects of Zithromax is hearing loss, this is a nerve effect and not one caused by clogging of the eustachian tubes. You say you took \"a Zithromax\" so I'm assuming you took only one, perhaps one you had left or one given you by someone else? One might have helped, but the failure to take a full course of an antibiotic can often be a brief improvement followed by worsening of symptoms. The ear clogging is likely due to drainage and irritation caused by the original infection. It could have been a rebound effect due to only having taken the one antibiotic tablet, or it may have happened anyway, given the type of upper respiratory infection (this is a really common and annoying feature of them); it also could have been caused by your having stopped using the nasal sprays, since the ears, nose and throat are all directly connected at the inner end of the two eustachian tubes.   Hopefully this is getting better now. It can sometimes take a while to resolve, but it almost always does. Again, if it doesn't, a visit to an ENT specialist would be the best way to get it resolved. Good luck to you!\n\n",

I was kind of tired at the time so i might have picked up a new one and that might have had only one end on it but i thought I used it.  Anyways, she was poking through my ear and it hurt a little bit.  when I went to the doctor she said there was nothing in there.   She used something to blow air in my ear which felt weird but still nothing and she said i was good.  Problem is i feel like i am losing some hearing my left ear.  Is it possible that within the 5 days the q tip went past my ear drum and is causing an infection which she couldnt see?  It just feels really wierd and sometimes and I sometimes have pain.  Regardless of what she said i know there is something not right q tip or no q tip.  I read some of these posts and some seem a lot like my situation.  The main thing i want to know is can the end of a q tip somehow get passed my ear drum so my doctor couldnt see it?  The main reason im worried about that is because she said my ear canals were very straight so it might have fallen out.  But could it work the opposite and get deeper?  I really wish i was paying more attention.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, it is possible that you may have what are called \"vocal nodules\".These are relatively small nodules that form symmetrically on the vocal folds in the Voice box(larynx). They interfere with production of a normal speech.They may cause intermittent voice loss, hoarseness and also reduce the range of one's voice.  Mostly occur in persons who abuse voice in some way... such as, [excessive yelling, excessive coughing,having to talk loudly in an environment where the background noise levels are very high etc].Women are more likely to be affected than men.   Diagnosis is fairly straightforward.Treatment generally involves voice rehabilitation and rarely surgical removal may be needed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Throat abscess from smoking marijuana",
    "content": "Hi, Pot smokers also may be IV drug users. IV drug users are at a high risk for numerous serious infections because of their often poor psychosocial conditions, unpredictable immune status, and often less than optimal hygiene(including oral hygiene) and nutritional status.  Poor orodental hygiene is commonly found, risk factors being... - smoking regular cigarettes as  well as pot and - dryness of mouth induced by marihuana. Poor orodental hygiene leads to dento-gingival sepsis (un-protected oral sex also is known to increase the risk). This, in the background of possibly reduced immunity can lead to  - severe disseminated bacterial or often fungal infections including brain abscesses.  The timeline for this scenario can be(for the sake of your story) quite flexible (acute, sub-acute or chronic), depending on the organism, its virulence and the victim's immune status).  If one wants an acute to sub-acute scenario, one could use this line... Fungal spores(mold spores), are a normal component of Marijuana. They are present in Marijuana especially when damp. Smoking damp marijuana could cause fungal infections in many body locations including the brain.   If a very acute scenario is desired(for the story), one could start from gingivo-dental infections........ on to deep oral or oropharyngeal sepsis(higher risk in pot smokers).....\"Lemierre\u00b4s Syndrome\" which is characterized by thrombophlebitis of the internal jugular vein  believed to be due to direct extension from  deep oral or oropharyngeal sepsis. If  untreated, it may progress to systemic septic embolization with the most frequently affected organ being the lungs. Osteomyelitis, hepatic abscess, renal failure, and septic arthritis can result.The most common organism isolated is a gram-negative obligate anaerobe, 'Fusobacterium necrophorum'.  One other choice for an acute scenario would be infective endocarditis(especially if there is associated IV drug abuse).  Best wishes for your upcoming short story!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Many medications are said to have an adverse effect on the voice.Some of which are.... - certain diuretics,  - decongestants(ex, Pseudoephedrine),   - antihistamines,  - muscle relaxants, - medications for Parkinson\u2019s disease, - asthma medications (including inhaled steroids), - high doses of Vitamin C,,  - Antihypertensive drugs(calcium channel blockers,betablockers,    angiotensin-converting-enzyme (ACE) inhibitors),  - estrogen replacement therapy,  - oral contraceptives (can  cause vocal cord edema), &  - Adderall   Many of them are said to cause hoarseness of voice by producing what is popularly known as \"vocal cord dryness\". Dry vocal cords may be more prone to injuries and result in vocal nodules nodules that can cause hoarseness.  Apart from these drugs many other drugs may be capable of causing this problem.  As you are on hormones and diuretics, they are ofcourse, suspect. But, other causes also need to be excluded. Therefore you need to be examined by an ENT specialist.  Best wishes!\n\n",

This went on for a week and i took some decongesants and I currently do not have this problem anymore.   But along with this I started getting a constant noise in my left ear which still exists. When I sleep, there is some kind of a sound in my right ear. Otherwise its only the left ear. I do not have any pain or dizziness or hearing loss. I went to a doctor last month. There was a lot of wax build up and he cleaned it completely and said that my ear drum looks fine. The noise reduced a lot compared to what it was earlier but it has not gone completely. He said if the noise persists i need to take a test for high frequency hearing loss. Its been 20 days since I went to the doctor.   I do not know if I should go for this test and I am scared that the noise still exists. I do not currently have a primary physician. Please help me in deciding what I need to do next. Should I wait for a few more days or should I see a specialist?  Please help me.   Regards\n\n",

You say \"Over the past two days I noticed an irritating sensation in the back of my throat, as if there was something stuck. Upon looking in the mirror, I saw the leaf-like structure of my epiglottis was clearly visible \".  It so happened that you had this problem & you happened to look at the back of your throat. Epiglottis is visible in most normal people during this maneuver.  So, most probably what you saw was only a normal view of your epiglottis. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Based on your description of the symptoms  and the color and consistency of the mucus, it sounds as though you have a deep sinus infection that probably should be treated with antibiotics as well as symptomatic support (Mucinex or its generic equivalent should help somewhat with the postnasal drip and at least loosen secretions if not stop them). Using an antihistimine would likely dry the secretions but cause them to thicken and make them more difficult to drain, so this may not be the best idea.  I have no idea why occurrence of this would relate to pregnancy, but it could just be coincidental. At any rate you certainly have sinus congestion with postnasal drainage which will eventually cause an annoying cough and possible bronchitis. Due to the color of the drainage I'm guessing this has attracted bacteria and become infected. I'd see someone for this sooner than later, as it rarely resolves on its own, at least not without coming back soon as you think it's gone.   I hope this is helpful. Best of  luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past three years, Ive had three bad cases of post nasal drip. First, it starts out with a head cold then everything clears up except for the post nasal drip and the cough that comes with it. It lingers for months. In 2007 & 2008, the post nasal drip started in February and ended in July. This year, I got a cold in July and Im in my 5th month of post nasal drip. Its the most active when I climb out of bed and begin to move around. Its stops when Im laying down.  X-Ray was clear. I was first given Omeprazole because the doctor thought it might be due to Acid Reflex. No changes. Then I was given Benzonatate 200mg to help stop the coughing. It didn't work. Then I was asked to buy Zyrtec-D and flush my sinuses with saltwater and then use Fluticasone Propionate Nasal Spray. I still have a steady stream of mucus that runs down my throat. No sore throat. The only thing that helps my cough is to suck on cough drops, one right after the other. Ive spent a fortune on cough drops. My husband and I have asked to see an allergist but they keep wanting to pump me full of medications that don't work. In October, I spent a few days in New York and it seemed to subside a little so it may be something in the air down here in Florida. Whatever it is, Im tired of coughing and at 42 years old, Im beginning to have to wear pads because I sometimes tinkle myself when I cough.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I think, to get straight to the point, that you should next be seen by a neurologist. While the original treatment was reasonable, you're now descrbing new neurological symptoms that may or may not be secondary to a cervical/muscular problem, but they are more neurological in nature, and suggest some problem with one of the cranial nerves. This could  be due to any number of things, and may be as simple  as an anatomical anomaly that's been aggravated by sleeping in a position that puts pressure on it. Still, it's important to know for sure.   Meanwhile, for the dizziness (which sounds most like vertigo) can probably be minimized, when it occurs, by use of meclazine (either generic or as Dramamine Non-drowsy Formula) over the counter. But by all means get yourself referred to a neurologist, as things have definitely taken a turn in that direction and may have been coming from there all along.   I  hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The Jan. 6 post was put up after I'd replied to the original post, and the good news here is that this isn't due to a central cause but a viral one. It actually makes complete sense taken in context, and while Bell's palsy can be a huge annoyance/disruption, it's not serious in itself. There is no way of predicting how long it will take an individual to recover fully from this, and there's no clear clinical way to speed recovery, but virtually everyone does eventually regain full function of the affected muscles. There aren't too many useful facial exercises I'm aware of that one can attempt, and they'd only work as the nerves regain function, so it's probably most sensible to just let this correct. Steroids are about the only thing which might be helpful -- or not, but it's worth trying.  I would still absolutely follow up with a neurologist to be certain the diagnosis is correct and to make certain things are progressing as they should. I hope this resolves quickly for you (but be prepared for it to at least seem like it takes forever). Please keep us updated. Good luck to you with this. Hope it doesn't cause too much of a disruption.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: nasal passage odor",
    "content": "Hi, As your question contains few details, it is difficult to arrive at a set of likely diagnoses.  Therefore, let me list some of the conditions associated with abnormal nasal odours. Some of these may be associated with Halitosis.  - A frank nasal infection, such as sinusitis(Chronic purulent nasal sinusitis, esp, odontogenic maxillary sinusitis) is a fairly common cause of  nasal malodor. - problems causing airflow obstruction & obstruction to mucous secretions, such as polyps. - Foreign bodies -Tuberculosis of the nose  - Adenoiditis - A midline nasopharyngeal pouch(may be present either as a congenital defect  or, more commonly, as a result of adhesions in the adenoid furrows). - trauma to the nasal cavity, plastic surgical procedures can deform the nasal cavity, cause obstructions and can result in nasal malodor. - atrophic rhinitis, in which the person loses the sense of smell, but others can smell the malodor.  The discussion on this subject would be incomplete without mentioning certain non-somatic causes such as, - Olfactory hallucinations in various serious psychiatric disorders. The most extreme of these cases may be diagnosed as having a 'body dysmorphic disorder'.In this condition, the patient believes that he/she has a malodour and it is extremely difficult for others to convince that there is in fact no such odor! Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "About 5 days ago I had a cold and along with it my right lymph node on my neck, under my jaw, became swollen. I also had a sore throat and sinus pressure. I didn't do anything for it and it went away, or so I thought. Three days ago I became ill, vomiting and diahreha which lasted one day. I am type 1 diabetic on an insulin pump under tight control, I tested for Ketones which was negative. I figured it was just a stomach virus. Yesterday, at around 5 p.m. my left ear started to hum, I felt as though I was underwater. The humming got continuously worse and made it extremely difficult to sleep. I took two tylenol. Today my ear still feels uncomfortable, not painful, just the uncomfortable hum and it is difficult to hear on the left side. I do have the sniffles and my left side of my throat is a tiny bit sore. I do not get paid until Friday, it is Wednesday, and I am concerned about the hearing loss and the hum is wearing on my nerves. Last year I had severe vertigo and was hospitalized for a few days, I kept passing out even when sitting. After a few different antibiotics, it finally cleared up enough for me to walk. I tend to ignore things until they go too far and I do not want to have hearing loss. Will I be able to wait until Friday, when I get paid, to go to the doctor, or should I go sooner?\n\n",

Then one day the attack was so severe, the doc was called out to our home, the doctor said it was stomach flu.  The attacks are still happening with no warning, no change in the way the attack happen, but we still do not know what the cause of the attacks are or why they happen.  My husband and I would be grateful to know if anyone knows why this happens, or if anyone else has the same sudden attacks.  Many Thanks in Advance.....\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Although you mention the word 'Cluster' in passing, your description of your husband's symptoms somehow falls short of the  description of pain in cases of 'cluster headaches'(as far as the severity of pain is concerned).The cluster headaches are said to be one of the most severe forms pain(often described as 'piercing' or 'lancing').They are more common in men unlike migraines, which are more common in women.  It appears(in your husband's case) that it always starts as a block in the ear. This is also not described as a frequent occurence in cluster headaches.  Although, this could very well be a variant of cluster headaches,it may be better to exclude the possibility of headache due to 'Allergic rhinitis' first, followed by a migraine variant and if these are excluded, then to consider cluster headache as a diagnosis.

    "content": "Hi, Of late, there has been considerable evidence to suggest that a high percentage of so-called 'sinus headaches' are in reality, Migraines. In your case, you clearly indicate that you have migraine and that the pain of what you believe as sinusitis is different from your migraines. Your problem could well be chronic 'fronto-ethmoidal sinusitis' (obstruction of the ethmoid air cells often leads to frontal sinusitis). The causes of obstruction of the ethmoidal sinus could be manifold (septal deviation,trauma,mucosal swelling, nasal polyps,tumor,  or acute infections). As you suspect, infection is one of the posssibilities. But, as outlined above, obstructing causes should be ruled out. This will certainly need a consultation with an ENT specialist.

After spending the night there , having ekg, blood gas, stress test, my heart checked out ok. Had a CT scan to check out my head...it was fine.I was released sent home home on Antivert for Vertigo.  2 days later I visited my primary care doctor who told me that probaly didnt even need the Antivert that he's pretty sure I didnt have Vertigo. Just a sinus infection. So was sent home on Amoxicillin and a nasal spray.   My blood pressure seemed to be a lil elevated so he put me on a low dose Linsopril. I have checked my BP since the visit and my BP is normal to low (by medical standards) I couldnt get my BP meds for a couple days due to finances so I havent took any.  I am EXTREMELY sensitive to ANY kind of meds so I was scared to take the BP med if I am running low already.   Meanwhile the pressure in my head is unbearable (2 days already on amoxicillin) I am begining to think I may have some other problem.  Are these symptoms typical of a sinus infection? Please advise. Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Ringing in ears after concert",
    "content": "Hi, It is probable that you might have developed a Noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL) of which there are 2 principal types.  - gradually developing NIHL and  - NIHL caused by acoustic trauma   What is thought to happen,is 'high- intensity sound' induced damage to the cochlea (specifically damage to the hair cells).  NIHL caused by acoustic trauma mostly is caused by a solitary exposure to a very high intensity sound(ex; explosions etc).On the other hand, gradually developing NIHL is believed to be due to chronic,repeated exposure to loud noises.  Not only high pitched noises are dangerous, very low pitched noises emitted by Sub-woofers are also said to be harmful.  Are you perhaps, a regular concert enthusiast? I am unsure your problem fits into which of the two types of the NIHL.  Lots of care goes into the installation of 'acoustics' in dedicated concert halls and opera halls are nowadays,but the same can't be said of other venues. It is perhaps, where an unlucky person is seated in relation to the speaker systems and in which venue, finally matters!. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "what to expect after removal of mass from vocal cords",
    "content": "Good morning Dr,  One month ago, my mother visited her doctor because she was concerned about a burning sensation on her throat. That was the only complained she had. No voice changes were present at all. After assessing her, the doctor said, he has found a mass \u201cpolyp\u201d attached to her vocal cords. Apparently, the doctor immediately suggested her that before it gets worse, surgical removal of this mass is the best option. I would like to mention that during this first visit, the doctor only \u201cvisualized\u201d the mass. No biopsy of this polyp was preformed during this first visit. My mother went to surgery one month ago. According to the physician, during surgery he removed the mass sent it to pathology and the results showed to be a benign type of polyp.   Today, and after one month of surgery, my mother voice is totally different. Her voice is hoarsely, it gets worse when she cries, the hoarseness seems to be predominantly present when she pronounce specific letters \u201cO\u201d, \u201cA\u201d. She also reported to have some pain in her face and the burning sensation stills present.      My questions are:  It this voice changed to be an expected outcome after this kind of surgery? If so, for how long do you think she may have this changed on her voice? Is this reversible or this a permanent change?  Her doctor told her and keeps telling her that continue to do speech therapy. But he has not siad for how long!  Thank you very much for you time\n\n",

    "title": "Re: what to expect after removal of mass from vocal cords",
    "content": "Hi YGOG, A vocal polyp(Reinke's edema) is a growth that is similar to a vocal nodule but is softer. Different from a polyps elsewhere in the body, a vocal polyp is not  precancerous or cancerous.   It most often forms on only one vocal cord & almost always, occurs at the midpoint of the vocal fold.   A vocal polyp is often associated with long-term tobacco smoking but may also be linked to hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux(GERD), or chronic vocal misuse(phonotrauma).  Management usually includes voice rest, voice therapy and  microlaryngoscopic surgery.  The chances of a recurrence are extremely low after surgery and voice therapy.  If voice problems happen to continue following treatment,assessment by a speech-language pathologist may be of help.One should not overlook the importance of controlling the other associated factors(if any) such as tobacco smoking, hypothyroidism, gastroesophageal reflux(GERD).  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Eustachian Tube not in the correct position??",
    "content": "Hi, \"Eustachian tube dysfunction\" has been managed by various methods, including placement of a tympanostomy tube, medical management with estrogen nasal drops, and surgical correction.  Eustachian tube dysfunction results in the development of chronic otitis media with effusion and conductive hearing loss.Treatment options however,remain limited.    Aeration of the middle ear by a tube tympanostomy  has been the management of choice for chronic effusions that do not respond well to medical therapy.   Complications of long-term tube tympanostomy placement include persistent tympanic membrane perforations, otorrhea, and the inconvenience of adhering to dry-ear precautions.  I believe,the tympanostomy tubes generally remain in the eardrum for some period of time, (2 - 5 years), before spontaneously falling out of the tympanic membrane. The eardrum usually (but not always) closes without a residual opening at the site of the tube.    Unfortunately, the underlying patho-physiology usually (unfortunately) leads to a recurrence of symptoms when the tube is removed (or falls out) and the tympanic membrane is allowed to heal.  I sincerely hope that your dream to become SCUBA certified and to dive the great barrier reef turns into reality as newer management techniques become increasingly available with the phenomenal growth in technology that we see of late.Good luck!\n\n",

But, as you seek a common explanation for all these symptoms, it will be useful to have some further information from you -such as in which part of the world you reside.

It is a is a chronic granulomatous disease caused by Rhinosporidium seeberi(earlier thought to be a fungus, but now believed to be a prokaryotic cyanobacterium).

You don't mention any nasal symptoms.In fact, a sizable number of people with acute sinusitis may have some degree of \"Rhinitis\"(inflammation of the nasal cavity).  To the best of my knowledge, the term \"Pansinusitis\" is not very much preferred. Sinusitis is better classified as either acute/chronic or simple/complicated. Also,one may call the sinusitis according to the sinus that is involved.  What i presume, is that you seem to have suffered a fairly severe sinusitis.I do not know if it was a complicated sinusitis or not.Complicated sinusitis needs to be treated aggressively as well as followed up.

    "title": "Re: Swimmers ear from q tips",
    "content": "Hi, \"Swimmers ear\" as the fancy name implies, is generally associated with someone who swims a lot. This was presumably coined because of the increased incidence of this disease (otitis externa) which was commonly observed in individuals or occured in groups of people using certain community swimming pools during the not too distant past when pool hygiene had not been given the due prioity.  It should be noted that \"Swimmers ear\" may occur in people who don't swim at all!!  The foremost causes for the swimmers ear are:     Water trapped in external ear canal     Sanitation methods     Chemicals in water     Water purification materials. A narrow and short external auditory canal is a risk factor(water trapping).  Despite what many believe,\"Swimmers ear\" is not primarily caused by bacteria in the water: instead, it's triggered by the 'resident' bacteria normally found in your external ear canal. Water trapped in external ear canal makes the lining of the  external ear canal vulnerable to entry of the 'resident' bacteria. The bacteria thus gain entry into the deeper layers of this skin, initiating the infection.  Also, it is advisable to avoid inserting objects in the ear (e.g.cotton swabs, fingers) that may scratch the ear canal and provide an entry site for infection. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Sounds very much like \"Acute Dacryocystitis\".This is due to an acute inflammation of the lacrimal sac. Dacryocystitis has long been noted to occur more frequently on the left side than on the right side (although in your case the right side is affected).  It can be due a number of causes--  such as,  bacterial infections, viral infections, fungal infections,some lacrimal sac tumors,certain other tumors,sinusitis (ethmoidal,maxillary), certain nasal conditions, just to name a few.  The swelling in front of your ear could be parotid lymph nodes which have enlarged in response to this infection.  Going through your profile,i find that you had undergone Mohs' surgery for basal cell carcinoma in 2006 & 2008.If you gave us more details such as the location of the tumour,it may assist us in determining if there is a link to your present symptoms.  It is advisable that you should contact an ENT specialist as soon as feasible and get it sorted out. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bullous Myringitis And Upper Respiratory Infection !",
    "content": "Hi, Bullous myringitis is usually a viral  (occasionally bacterial) infection.Bullous myringitis produces vesicles on the tympanic membrane. Since it can be caused by mycoplasma, It is treated with erythroymycin.  It is believed to be a self-limiting disease without significant complications. Clinical evidence has shown it to be frequently accompanied by sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL).  Some studies on Bullous myringitis have demonstrated a significant incidence of SNHL (65% and 66% respectively) with complete resolution of the hearing loss in 57% to 60% of them.The exact mechanism of the hearing loss remains unclear.  The macrolide antibiotic erythromycin is associated on rare occasions with SNHL which is usually bilateral & reversible on discontinuation of the antibiotic.  This hearing loss is most likely at doses of at least 4g/day. Patients at higher risk of developing erythromycin-induced SNHL include patients with pre-existing hepatic or renal failure,  the elderly, and patients undergoing renal or liver transplants.  As you can appreciate, your doctor perhaps changed the antibiotic for this very reason.  As far as your grandmother's advise is concerned,i suggest that you should politely decline.

Pathologic parathyroid glands are palpable in only about 4% of cases. It has been observed that palpable parathyroids occur more often in people with severe, long-standing forms of primary hyperparathyroidism with severe bone disease and in patients with very high serum calcium/PTH levels.Now-a-days, as calcium abnormalities are identified early, a palpable parathyroid has become a rarity!  A palpable swelling in the vicinity of the thyroid gland is more likely to be a thyroid nodule rather than a Parathyroid mass.However, it is possible that your case   belongs to the rare instances.

    "content": "Hi, The most important first assessment in your case ought to be detailed phoniatric evaluation using several specific phonic times and measuring vocal frequencies.This will help to ascertain your voice range and hopefully give a clue as to the etiology of your complaint. Other modalities such as Laryngeal videostrobolaryngoscopy, electromyography and spectrography may also be useful.  There are a number of causes for voice problems which may affect the upper end of the voice.... - laryngeal trauma (including blunt traumas) - post surgical - post anesthetic - certain drugs (ex.testosterone),and substance abuse (ex.alcohol) etc. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Central to the management of Menier's disease is sodium restriction. Diuretics are used only as an adjunct.  When a strict low sodium diet is adhered to and a diuretic is taken reliably, the disease in the majority of patients would be expected to come under satisfactory control.   After 6 - 12 months, the body becomes sufficiently adapted to the low sodium diet so that the diuretic can be withdrawn. Strict adherence to the diet is necessary to keep the disease under control.  It is an year since you were diagnosed to have been diagnosed with Meniere's disease.  So, the results of withdrawing the diuretic now sill almost certainly hinge upon how serious you had been about your diet.  Good day!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swollen lymph node and lump on lower palat of mouth",
    "content": "Hi, Recurrent enlargement of the cervical lymph node raises suspicion of a possible source (focus) of infection in its drainage area (which includes the oral cavity).  You mention about the lump on the gum which becomes tender every now and then. A lump over the gum has a wide range of differential diagnoses(ranging from benign to malignant).  From the history you have provided, one would tend to start with the possibility of this being a \"Pyogenic granuloma\". This is usually  smooth or lobulated,red or purple.This is entirely benign and can be surgically removed fairly easily.  Other swellings which may need to be considered are fibromas, peripheral giant cell granulomas, swellings arising from the sublingual salivary glands etc.  The best course of action should be to consult your GP, then perhaps, a dental consult and evaluation of the lymph node as well (FNA/Biopsy). Best wishes!\n\n",

Well it has been tormenting me for the last 9 years, and I have not done anything about it.  So I finally went to the clinic that did the ct scan and the mri, to get the images of the scans.  If there are any sinus specialists in here who would like to check the images out, I can send them to you, and maybe you can see something.  Thanks..  sam\n\n",

I had to swallow to stop it. Then it would start again. It presisted for ages and I just lived with it. I didnt take any medication. The doctor said it would recover. He said if it didnt that I would have to have my tonsils removed. But he said they could bleed. Not sure if it has fully recovered. It still feels like there is still something crawling up my throat but its at the top of my throat and then I have still have to swallow to stop it. If I don't swallow it gets uncomfortable. But eventually I have to swallow. Sometimes its bad and sometimes its okay. Its fine after I eat or drink something. I sometimes get infections and its real bad. Could it be something else other than my tonsils. Its annoying and I just live with it. But I would like it to stop. Do I need to have my tonsils removed?\n\n",

Smoking is an irritant to your respiratory tract which in turn can cause sinus and nasal inflammation, narrowing the airway thus not helping the thick mucus problem you are having not to mention other respiratory issues.  Consult with your physician about smoking cessation.  Secondly, after exhausting all non-invasive measures recommended by your physician, perhaps you can discuss with him/her about possibly having the tonsils removed, uvula trimmed or removed and sinuses trimmed to open you narrowed airway.    I am not familar with the injections you had mentioned in regards to treatment.    Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a lump on the back of my neck on the right side.  It is sore.  I was in to the doc a couple months ago for continues headaches witch started on the left side of my neck and would migrate through my head.  He did blood work and and x-ray and decided I needed to try PT.  I did 4 weeks of PT and the headaches got slightly better...they didnt start in my neck anymore but still have them.  My calcium level was high on my blood work but he said he was not concerned about it. Now about 3 weeks ago I got a pea sized lump on the right side of my neck and I still have the headaches also Im starting to have pain on the left side again.  Could this have something to do with the calcium or do you think there is something else?  Thanks Wendy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ihave2taks, Pea size lumps would not be too disconcerting unless the area continues to enlarge despite treatment with a course of antibiotic therapy, however I am a little concerned that you stated you have an elevated calcium level on your blood work. How elevated is your calcium level? Are you taking any supplements? Are you post-menopausal? Has there been any mention of any additional diagnostic studies? My apologies for so many questions but elevations in calcium levels can be caused by a number of other disorders for example, an overactive parathyroid gland. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Carol;  I trust that you have continued to seek care from your primary care physician. Many times when a diagnosis is not initially identified, it is because a bit of a longer observation period is required to allow the symptoms to make it apparent what may be going on. The first step is to make sure nothing critical is going on, which you ruled out with an absence of signs of infection.  The ears are an uncommon site for what is often called 'radicular pain' or pain resulting from a pinched nerve. Otalgia or ear pain can result from a pinched nerve that may be resulting from anything from a stiff neck to cervical disc problems that may be pinching the nerves.  Also don't discount the contribution of your dentist to help you solve this question. They are intimately familiar with the complicated interworkings of muscle, nerves, skin and connective tissue in the face.  A good regimen of gentle stretching may be very helpful, http://www.dcdoctor.com/pages/rightpage ... _neck.html and certainly your fibromyalgia will make this a bit harder for you. For more information about the different causes of ear pain, check out this website info. It relates to children, but is still appropriate. http://www.wrongdiagnosis.com/symptoms/ ... ses-3a.htm  Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "The ringing started a little over a year ago.  It wasn't too bad in the beginning and I could mask it with a fan at night.  Now, most nights the fan doesn't mask it and it takes me a long while to fall asleep.  Some days it's so loud, I'm unable to concentrate on my school work.  I'm a full-time college student.  No serious hearing loss, though I can no longer hear the mosquito ring tone.  At my age I wasn't supposed to be able to hear it anyway so it's no loss.  Here's a list of everything I could think of that might be helpful:  *female, age 51 *no allergies *yawning increases ringing dramatically *ringing varies - sometimes louder in one ear or the other or equal in both *ringing varies in sound and in time with my pulse *volume ranges from barely noticeable to very loud *blood pressure was high at last two doctor visits *I am anemic (taking 325 mg iron daily for about 8 years) *I began having sinus and ear infections while living in East Texas.  The ringing started after one of the infections.  I've been in Arkansas now for a year and have only had one infection. *Occasionally wake up with fluid draining from one or both of my ears *Ears itch almost daily.  I relieve the itch by pushing and messaging the tragus.    It will be at least another 6 months before I have insurance so I would greatly appreciate any advice you can offer to help me better manage the ringing until then.  Can you also suggest where I might find more information on the possible causes?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

Tinnitus can be caused by many different factors.  Do you take aspirin or aspirin products?  Too much aspirin can cuase the ringing in the ears.  Also some antibiotics can do this as well as other medications.  Or, it may not be med related at all.  What concerns me more though is the drainage you have described.  You could have some kind of infection. Please go to the ER if nothing else.  You need medical attention on this matter.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "title": "Bloody Nasal Discharge",
    "content": "Hi Dear Doctor,  As the sinus CT scan that order by my primary doctor on 02/09/2009, the result shows:  Findings: The frontal sinuses are hypoplastic. There is mild degree of mucoperiosteal thickening in the ethmoid sinuses, left greater than right. There is extensive opacification of the left maxillary sinus with partial obstruction of the left osteomeatal complex. There is deviation of the nasal septum from left to right.  Impression: Extensive chronic left maxillary sinusitis with obstruction of the osteomeatal complex.  In case my primary doctor recommended me to start using NASONEX and sinus rinse kit to wash my noses.  From 03/12/2009, white & thick & sticky nasal mucus drainage went out from my left nostril with a little bit bright & flash blood-streak.   After the discussion with my primary doctor on 03/24/2009, I stopped using NASONEX and sinus rinse kit because my primary doctor thought Nasonex was a steroid and it could cause thinning of mucosa sometimes to result nose bleed.  However brown & thick & sticky nasal mucus still kept happened with a little bit bright & flash blood-streak from my left nostril after stopped using NASONEX and sinus rinse kit. Also I felt headache & toothache & facial pain on the left side.  On 04/17/2009 (Friday morning), I saw the ENT and he did a nasal endoscopy. He said the nasal structures look normal and there is no sign of inflammation or pus. It was really surprised to me because I found blood-streak in the left nostril with Qtips Thursday night. It is really confused to me why the ENT doctor can\u2019t seeno evidence in the nose of anything going on by endoscopy.  So my question is:  As the result from the previous sinus CT, it shows the left maxillary sinusitis with obstruction only. However as the information from the web site, usually sinusitis won't cause any bloody discharge.  Am Iright? Also from the check by routine nasal endoscopy, the ENT doctor didn't see any blood inside nose/nostrils.   Since brown & thick & sticky nasal mucus with a little blood-streak is still present till now and I felt headache & upper toothache & facial pain & nose bridge on the left side, I am afraid whether there was any tumors or other growths happened inside my nose/sinus after my CT scan on on 02/09/2009. Where does this blood-streak come from? Shall I request new CT scan again? How can I do now?  Please give me your suggestion. Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bloody Nasal Discharge",
    "content": "Hello --  I would, first, place greater weight on the positive CT, which will not show something that is not there,  rather than the negative nasal endoscopy, which could very easily be fooled. Further, the sort of symptoms and findings you report do, in fact, have bloody discharge quite often as a feature, although it's not generally a sign of anything more serious than the underlying infection and anatomical abnormalities which help make this possible. The website you found which states this isn't a normal feature of sinusitius is absolutely incorrect. The use of Nasonex also can help aggravate this problem, and often does little to help resolve the infection, although it can sometimes help with short term management of symptoms and also sometimes aid in drainage which can on occasion help resolve the infection. The ethmoids, however, are difficult to treat medically and often require vigorous and expert irrigation as well as antibiotic flush (and sometimes surgery to correct anatomic anomalies) to set the situation right.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bloody Nasal Discharge",
    "content": "Dear Doctor,   Thank you so much for your time to give me so detail suggestion.  Here is my update and I do need your help again.  As the last visit to my ENT on 04/30/2009, he recommended me to re-start using NASONEX with 2 puffs in to each nostril every morning and take one AMOXICILLIN 500MG capsules by mouth three times daily.   After I took two weeks medicines with NASONEX and AMOXICILLIN 500MG, nasal discharge with blood-streak still kept happened every one/two days when I blew out from my left nostril. As the recent visit with my ENT on 05/12/2009, he recommended doing functional endoscopic sinuses surgery with Entrak CT scan for me.   It is really hard for me to decide whether I do need to go with this sinuses surgery because I have no idea totally. Since my ENT is on vacation now, I must make the decision about this surgery before he come back around the middle of June.   Here are my questions:   Q1: As you mentioned before, blood-tinged mucous is quite common because the nasal mucosa is very vascular and it doesn't take much of an incident, just inflammation, to cause it to bleed slightly. However my bloody nasal discharge kept happened from my left nostril more than 3 months, is it still common in sinusitis? Please give me your comments again since I still worry about it so much.   Q2: What's the major purpose of this functional endoscopic sinuses surgery? Is it going to resolve my sinusitis only, or resolve my sinusitis and bloody nasal discharge both?   Q3: From my previous sinus CT scan result, it indicates extensive chronic left maxillary sinusitis with obstruction of the osteomeatal complex. However recently I suffered the pain around left orbital cavity. As I heard, maxillary sinusitis wouldn't cause orbital cavity pain. Please share me your comments about it.   Q4: Since I did sinus CT scan on 02/09/2009, its name is 2.5mm direct coronal images through the paranasal sinuses with axial reformations. As the recommendation by my ENT this time, it requests me to do Entrak CT scan before doing functional endoscopic sinuses surgery. I don't know what's the difference between my last sinus CT scan and Entrak CT scan. Which one is more accuracy to exam my current symptom, Entrak CT scan or my last sinus CT scan to exam my current symptom?   Q5: If I don't decide to go with functional endoscopic sinuses surgery but I do like to one CT san to verify inside my nose/sinus, shall I go with this Entrak CT scan or sinus CT scan as I did in the last time?   Q6: Is there other option to treat my sinusitis since I am afraid to go with this surgery? As I heard, it may be much more difficult for the ENT doctor to treat you if you have already had surgery before and get sinusitis again. Is it true? Will this surgery resolve my sinusitis completely? Is there any risk by this kind of surgery?   Please give me your suggestion since it is very important for me to make the decision. Thanks so much for your time.   Best Regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I had a deviated septum procedure done on my nose in March 2008. After the surgery I noticed most of my tip cartlidge was gone, I was hoping to be able to breath better, but in reality I feel I breath exactly the same way I did before the surgery. After I visited the specialist he told me it's a result of the balloons that fill the nasal passage and that they inflate and deflate during the day. Well I feel as though I have not benefitted at all what so ever from the surgery. My nose still feels congested, the congestion alternates between both nostrils, blocking the nostril almost completely, yet when I blow my nose no mucus comes out. I feel this is having a real impact on my quality of life. I frequently yawn and feel tired. Should I consider seeing another doctor for a second opinion, would a second procedure carry more complications?\n\n",

While these surgeries do have a rather mixed outcome, sometimes it requires a do-over to get things right -- and sometimes it  doesn't help all that much, but sometimes it does. This is why the second opinion sounds especially right to me. The original doctor seems pleased with the results but he doesn't have to live with them, you do.

    "content": "YES!  Go for the second opinion.  I had surgery for my deviated septum 5 years ago.  After the surgery, I actually felt worse.  In addition to constant fatigue, I had chunks of crystalized mucus coming down the back of my throat every two to three weeks.    I recently went to another ENT who suggested surgery on my left sinus to clean it out due to a chronic infection I was having.  This second surgery completely changed my life.  The fatigue, which I had for at least 15 years, immediately disappeared....and I can now breathe easily.  I have never felt better.  Trust me, get the second opinion...and hopefully a second surgery!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  First of all I want to thank the people who make this website possible.  Thank you to the doctors who are able to help others and hopefully myself...  I personally appreciate any ideas and suggestions.  I have googled my situation many times and haven't found a lasting solution.  Hopefully with your help I can get through this issue...   I will try to keep this as short as possible while still mentioning the most important dates and experiences.   In December 2007 I got some water trapped inside my right ear while taking a shower.  I was already feeling a little worn down and proceeded to go out for a 'night on the town'.  Within a couple of days I had a head cold and took it easy while recovering.  Within the next few days I blew my nose too hard and got a clogged / stuffy feeling in that same right ear.  I figured it would go away as long as I continued to take it easy.  After about 10 days I experienced a loud and sudden ringing in the same right ear.  I figured that my ear cleared and the stuffy feeling was gone.  However after a few minutes I noticed it was still there.  I slept on my left side for days, hoping that gravity would help drain the ear.  I did, but I then noticed that stuffy feeling in my left ear, almost like it switched sides...  At some point during that winter I came down with a week long cold, possibly the flu.  I took some medicine from the doctor and proceeded to rest.  During my cold, both ears felt stuffed up and very uncomfortable.  Eventually after 10 days or so I felt physically normal, however my ears felt different.  With a concentrated swallow I could make both ears \"pop\" or \"crackle\".  After a few trips to the doctor over the next two months they suggested I take a decongestant to clear my ears.  When that didn't work, I took a decongestant along with a mild steroid (from the doctor) to try and clear my ears.  To this day - about 16 months later - I still can \"pop\" my ears by swallowing.  I have been taking an allergy medicine with a decongestant for almost the entire time.  When I stop taking it, my health is impacted.  About 3-5 days after stopping the decongestant I will notice my ears feel much more full or very congested to the point where I can't even \"pop\" them by swallowing.  I will also start to feel run-down, possibly because an infection is brewing in those ear canals.  Back I go onto the decongestant and they feel much better within a week.  I am 23 years old and very healthy.  I get 8+ hours of sleep each night, exercise 4-6 times per week, eat very healthy, drink green tea in the morning, and take vitamins.  I don't know why I can't kick this ear thing.  Once in a while I will get a sudden ringing in one of my ears and I will think I am making progress, but still, same situation.  I have done a ton of google searching but have not found any great ideas.  I don't have health insurance and I am not so excited about going to the doctor and pay $200 + just to have a look in my ears.  I had my doctor in college do that for free many times and still not find a cure.  I am wondering if getting tubes in my ears is the only long term solution.  I assume that with tubes, the ears will get much better ventalation and the Eustachian tube will better be able to drain out.  Once again, your help is so greatly appreciated.  I don't know what else to do.  Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Clogged Eustachian tube leading to glue ear?",
    "content": "Hello --  You most likely have one or more deep sinuses infected. These can sometimes be very difficult to resolve with antibiotics because they're usually far removed from significant blood supply,  so the antibiotics don't reach them in adequate amounts. For this reason  there is the possibility of clinical irrigation and/or tube placements, although probably tubes won't be necessary.  There is a home remedy that goes back a long way, and which is often effective. It is complex to explain, but I can link you here to a site with a very detailed description and suffestions on what products to use. It's just as well to simply purchase the supplies recommended, although almost anything similar will work.   Here's a link to a detailed outline of the remedy. It can be repeated several times at least. If it doesn't work then you'll need to have an ENT do a careful clinical irrigation with packing and some medications not available over the counter. First try this, though: http://www.ehow.com/how_4537025_cure-cl ... -tube.html  I hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for responding with that link and advice.   I tried the home remedy irrigation technique a couple of weeks ago.  I irrigated both ears multiple times during that session.  The last irrigation was actually very painful as I tried forcing water into the ear area using the valsalva technique.  Here are the results I experienced:  I did the irrigation in the morning, and the for the next few hours my ears felt completely filled with water.  I chewed gum throughout the day to help them pop and clear up.  Later in the afternoon I finally felt some decompression and my ears starting to feel the way they did that morning.  I slept with my head elevated that night to try and help them drain.  A couple of days later I felt like all of the water had gotten out, and my ears felt pretty good.  I was optimistic that this would solve me previous problem.  During the next 3-4 days I experienced some periodic ringing in each ear which I took to mean they were opening up.  However after a week or so my ears basically felt the same as they did before the irrigation.  I am still able to pop them.  The feeling / sound is more like a click than a pop.  I workout multiple times per week in addition to 40+ hours at work.  I notice that when I do not get adequate sleep for a couple of days, my ears feel more congested and the popping is more noticable.  This seems to back up your theory that I have some sort of deep infection that could possibly be gaining strength when I don't get enough rest.  Would you reccomend that I repeat the irrigation of my ears, and if so, how frequently?  Would a clinical irrigation be any different, and should that be my next step?  Could impacted ear wax be playing any role with my ear issues and possibly not allowing my ears to drain properly?  I also wear ear plugs each night.  Could these be preventing my ears from draining / venting?  Your help is GREATLY appreciated.  Thank you so much for your time and expertise.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent Nosebleeds",
    "content": "Hello --  There are a lot of potential reasons for this, but since it seems very limited in its focus of origin I suspect it to be fairly benign. It could be due to a natural weak capilary of good size, or it could be due to something happening to the mucosa where this vessel is located. It is probably the same one each time, so may be amenable to simple correction, but should be examined carefully to rule out any systemic cause as well as any local disease of the mucosa itself, such as a tumor or superficial cancer. These are unlikely but not worth ignoring as possibilities. The nosebleeds like this are quite often just due to an anatomical anomaly and can be cauterized or otherwise repaired in the office. Just be sure to rule out any remote possibility of some other, more serious cause.  My best to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all-  After reading your posts I felt like you knew exactly what I was feeling!  The first doctor I saw tested me for strep and sent me on my way.  She completely disregarded that I said there was a clicking and popping in my throat when I swallowed.  Like most of you it happened more after drinking liquids and only if my head was in certain positions.  It was very painful!  I went to see an ENT after reading some of your posts and reading about a potential correlation with thyroid cartiledge.  When I mentioned this to the doctor he sent me up for a CT scan.  The scan showed that I had a thyroglossal cyst on my hyoid bone.  The hyoid bone is located near the base of the tongue.  Everyone has this tract in their throat before they're bone but they are supposed to close up.  Some don't close properly and create a pocket where the cyst can form.  After meeting with the surgeon, he admit he had never heard of my symptoms before and couldn't guarantee removing it would solve them.  Since there's a very large possibility of the cyst becomming infected, I opted for the Sistrunk Procedure (the surgical removal of the cyst).  The doctor was surprised to find that the cyst was actually the size of a quarter and located directly in the location of my pain.  I am now almost 3 weeks out of surgery and I have not felt the popping and clicking once!  I have a very small, hardley noticeable incision across my neck and only stayed in the hospital 1 night.    I can't guarantee that this is what's causing all of your pain, but it's definitely something to look into.  I know how painful it was and how frustrating it was when I felt like the doctors either didn't believe me or didn't think it was important enough to spend their time trying to fix.  Keep insisting!  It was well worth the struggle because I am now pain free!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: clicking noise in throat.. help !!!",
    "content": "Hello, I agree that the hyoid bone could be causing the clicking sensation.  Small muscles (e.g. genio-hyo-glossus) adjoin the tongue, the hyoid, and chin.  So moving the head and swallowing would affect the hyoid.    Endoscopy would not see the hyoid.  However the bone can be palpated under the chin.    If clicking is associated with pain and/or difficulty swallowing, an evaluation of the esophagus is prudent (eg. scope or barium swallowing).  A CT scan of the neck would help rule out cysts or tumors.  An ENT or gastroenterologist may be consulted as well.    I agree that what seems like an obscure symptom may be fairly common.  However, most folks probably do not visit their physician unless it is causing problems other than the clicking sound.    Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: clicking noise in throat.. help !!!",
    "content": "Hi, Im new to this. I also have been experiencing  this clicking/popping noise and feeling in my throat, along with a lot of other symptoms. About 6 weeks ago I had to go to hospital because I felt like something was stuck in my throat, really uncomfortable, waited seven hours to see an ENT doctor who then told me to go home and arranged an appointment for the ENT clinic the next day. So I went the next day to get endoscopy, it came back clear and the doctor told me I may have cut my throat and sent me home. I was relieved that nothing was stuck and glad that it would go away with time. So in the next week or so I visited my doctor who was baffled at what it was and put me on ranitidine for acid reflux.   After the first two week course I went back with the same problem now worse and the doctor put me on another 2 week course of the same medication. After this time I visited the doctors I started having difficulty breathing and was dizzy. Through all this time I wasn't eating properly and I am now currently only eating liquids and bread. I told my doctor about my breathing difficulties and she told me I was having anxiety attacks, now Im thinking maybe this throat thing that I am experiencing is associated with my anxiety and is psychosomatic.   I have recently picked up a virus so don't know if the symptoms have gone as I have sore throat, but I am having a really hard time swallowing solid food.  Any suggestions that might help?  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Adverse Reaction to Clindamycin",
    "content": "I was prescribed 300mg of Clindamycin 4 times a day for 10 days because my Dr. stated I had a horrific abscess on my right tonsil. The next day, I want to an ENT specialist and he indicated no abscess, but commented on the strength and type of antibiotic I was taking.  My Dr instructed me to continue the Clinamycin as prescribed.  The following day, I started having horrific chest pain in my right chest, which would shoot up my neck like fire, going into my throat, up my face, affecting the lower part of my right ear and going as high as my right eye, as I could feel my eye drooping.  I didn't associate all of this with the Clindamycin at the time, but kept going back to my doctor loudly complaining about these symptoms. They were sure it was this abscessed right tonsil and that my ENT just couldn't see it for whatever reason. I was instructed to continue with this medication and they hoped that everything would get better.  Day 7 of my medication, I couldn't take the pain (joint pain, muscle soreness, heartburn, lathargic, chest/neck/face pain) any longer and went back to my doctors. They were still sure it was an abscess and were insisting I get a $900 CT Scan. Being that my insurance doesn't cover that, I couldn't afford it and told them.  They did blood work and it all came back \"in range\".  Day 8 of my medication, after taking my morning dose, within 20 minutes, I was curled up on the floor with my knees pulled to my chest. If my heart was on the right side, I would swear I was having a heart attack. This intense pain lasted for 3 and 1/2 hours and because I thought I was actually on the verge of dying, I called my doctor and agreed to the CT Scan (versus going to the ER), as I was sure there was something horribly wrong. This was the first time I associate this horrific pain with the Clindamycin and I told myself that was the last pill of that, that I would put into my system. CT Scan came back just great.  There was no abscess and my doctor just simply said \"well, we should stop the Clindamycin immediately\". For whatever reason, stopping the medication was the last thing for them to try, instead of being one of the first.  Now, almost 48 hours after taking my last dose, every time I swallow when I'm eating or drinking soda, I have this unbelievable pain in my right chest that goes through to my back.  In order to get the food down, I have to hold my chest real tight and just get through the pain. Not sure if I should go back to my ENT, or who I should see, as I refuse to go back to my GP at this point.  Would the Clindamycin have damaged something deep in my esophagus or lung?  Any information that you may be able to provide would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Adverse Reaction to Clindamycin",
    "content": "Hello --  For follow up for the tonsil problem I would certainly go back to the ENT. I would also consider a change of primary, since the diagnosis was clearly wrong or at least exaggerated in its findings, and the treatment was inappropriate due to recognizable GI reactions to the drug prescribed. This could have been corrected most likely by a change of drug. While all antibiotics can cause GI disturbances clindimycin is especially notable for this, and what seems to have happened is that the phrenic nerve was irritated secondary to GI upset, perhaps severely (due to anatomic coincidence most likely) and this could well explain the continued chest pain on drinking carbonated beverages. Your ENT won't likely be able to address this, and a GI specialist or perhaps ultimately even a neurologist (pain management specialist in this case) may wind up getting involved, but only because your PCP doesn't seem familiar with the syndrome often caused by Clinidmyacin and likely wouldn't treat it in a way that might well resolve the problem. (Quite possibly a short trial run of a nerve pain blocker such as gabapentin or pregabalin might be required to shut down this response, although it certainly should eventually resolve on its own).   I hope this is helpful tyo you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can sinus trouble be causing my bad breath?",
    "content": "HI there --  This is often a puzzle, because there are several potential causes of this phenomenon and sometimes they don't follow the obvious trail. While your sinuses definitely could be causing this -- especially a deep ethmoid sinus infection with blockage, which is difficult to reach with both narrow spectrum antibiotics and even home irrigation remedies, and sometimes requires expert chemical irrigation by an ENT specialist. However,  even if this were to fail to correct the  problem, given we are allowed to have more than one thing going on at the same time, there is a  third possibility,  and  that is often something as simple as a mild gastritis, which can cause symptoms almost identical to dental hygeine issues and severe deep sinusitus.  For this reason,  if the sinus theory shouldn't pan out, your next stop would have to be a GI specialist and possibly an endoscopy to be  certain you don't have a mild erosive gastritis. You've eliminated dental hygeine as a likely cause, and sinus problems would definitely come ahead of GI problems in the heirarchy of causes, but that would be the next possibility after sinusitus has been ruled out -- or in.  ENT next,  and hopefully that would be the last consult you'd need.  From your description of the attending symptoms it does sound more like sinus than GI, but you never really know til it's been explored thoroughly.  I hope this helps. Good luck t you with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a constant odour in my right-hand sinus with associated bad taste; my normal smell and taste of food etc is not effected. It is a bitter taste/smell not very pleasant, although I\u2019m getting used to it, but some days it seems worse than others. It started over 18 months ago and my GP prescribed various antibiotics and nasal sprays all to no effect. I was then sent to the hospital and the consultant tried more powerful antibiotics, still with no positive results so I then had a CT scan, which showed an infection deep in the sinus near to the nerve from the eye. Therefore surgery took place to open up the airways by removing some bone and they scraped away as much of the infection as possible, the idea being that the extra passage of air would heal the remaining infection. Eight months later there has been no real improvement, I still have this odour and horrible taste, if I only breathe through the LH side there is no smell, so it definitely comes from the right sinus. At my last visit to the hospital in February I was told that there was no more help that they could offer and that I would just have to live with it, which is a bit depressing. Can anyone suggest any help for this condition? I do take \u2018Simvastatin\u2019 and \u2018Micardis Plus\u2019 daily, but as far as I\u2019m aware they are not the cause.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sinus Odour and bad taste",
    "content": "Hello --  First,  there certainly should be further investigation of the problem, as it sounds as though you may have developed an ostial infection at the surgery site in the deep sinus. Sometimes this does happen or swelling causes new blockage with the same or worse symptoms and requires subsequent interventions. The very fact you can readily locate and detect the source or location of the smell and taste (classic for both  sinusitus and osteomyelitis secondary to sinus surgery) tells us there is something more going on, and I would not accept a \"get used to it\" answer. This is a deep sinus and  so difficult to treat with narrow-spectrum antibiotics and may require further surgical intervention or at least high-powered, broad-spectrum antibiotic treatment. I would by no means accept the last answer as acceptable. You still have a significant problem that in most cases could be resolved by a resolute ENT specialist.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pure Yellow Liquid From Nose",
    "content": "Hi there --  You would seem to have a severe infection of one of the frontal sinuses, which are above the  eyes, essentially behind the forehead and nearest the temple area. Sometimes  this very thing you describe happens, instead of the usual thick, viscous sort of discharge. This thin, bright yellow discharge contains more lymph and less mucous, and will literally pour when the head is tipped. The treatment is the same as for other sinus infections,but this is a little different,  as you've discovered, in terms of how its managed and controlled.   The fact you struck your head earlier may or may not be related to this, as sometimes a blow to the skull can help initiate or aggravate a latent infection. In any case this will need treatment,  probably with antibiotics and an antihistimine -- the latter not always that helpful with sinus infections, but which will help dry and  thicken the secretions,  which in your case might actually be helpful in terms of controlling the  discharge.   A CT scan of the head would probably be a good idea simply because this follows a blow to the head, but likely won't disclose anything, and with the free, thin discharge, my not even show up the congestion.  Still, it wouldn't hurt and might just be helpful.   I hope this is useful to you. Good luck to you and  please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Loud ringing in ear for weeks",
    "content": "Hello --  While you say you have no sinus infection, this is one of the potential causes and is often due to a deep sinus blockage which can cause no other symptoms. This is especially suspect because you mentioned a sensation like water in the ear,  and because it started when you were lying on your right side, but later became constant. Also this could be due to an inner ear infection which would of course likely show no other symptoms with the  possible exception of pain, which is not always present.  I've gone toward infective agents here because while there are literally dozens of potential causes of tinnitus (including something as simple as taking aspirin), the way yours started does sound most like the result of an infection. It could of course be something else, and all causes should be ruled out. I'd strongly suggest a consult with an otolaryngologist or ENT specialist to try and determine the cause so that it can be eliminated or treated. Tinnitus often is part of several syndromes that can result in hearing loss, and if this can be avoided it's always good to avoid it.   I hope this is helpful.

Everyone's different with regard to what may set it off, and it could be something as simple as dust mites or as complex as foods in certain combination, but it definitely sounds allergic.  You should be tested for all the common allergies,  needless to say, which would be a huge help,  but also need to be treated for the symptoms. A good non-drowsy antihistimine (and there are many) should be prescribed to subdue or eliminate the symptoms. This seems like a really simple thing and I'm amazed your doctors haven't even tried to isolate the cause nor treat the symptoms. I'd suggest you start with a good over-the-counter antihistimine such as Claritin or even Zyrtec, to see if either of these works for you. Benedryl is also good, but will make most people quite drowsy.   If any of these works for you it's an even better indicator that you're suffering from allergies and need to be tested to see what may be causing this, so that you might be able to eliminate it from your environment or at least know what to avoid if possible. Oh, and yes, year round allergies definitely are common, so don't let anyone tell you it would only occur during certain seasons.  I hope this is helfpul. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.... My history is that 12 days ago I started taking scuba lessons in the 14 foot pool....when I attempted to clear my ears, I had some problems but eventually cleared them but ended up with both ears becoming clogged and the left one never clearing.  After 4 nights of this and no relief I had one of my coworkers ...a doctor look in my left ear since it was hurting.  My right ear ended up being ruptured and the left was....sucked down.  I went into see an ENT doctor and they gave me affrin and told me to vagal all weekend and take decongestants to open it up....after 3 days of this....I went in this past monday and they performed a myringotomy.  I felt a little pressure relieve as they were cutting with the blade, but it immediately clogged back up.......two days later I went to be seen again.  They did an audiogram which showed a 20 decibel hearing loss on the left and significant pressure.  When the doctor looked in my left ear he said it was closed again/sucked down.  They decided to do another myringotomy and tube placement.  I have had no relief of pressure and my ear is still clogged.  My question is...is there any way to relief the pressure?  Should I be able to hear and not clogged with the tube in?  How long till I should be able to hear......and how miserable will I be when I fly in 5 days?  Sorry to ask so many questions....just tired of being able to hear my own voice in my head and just want to get back to normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Normally I'd have a pretty ready answer for you as to how you might unclog your ears, but since the doctors haven't done this (irrigate your sinuses) and you have tubes placed, doing yourself could just make it worse. I  would, though, ask the doctor if it might be helpful to irrigate your sinuses, since this is usually the bottom line reason this happens (clogged ears). Air pressure can't equalize in the eucstachian tubes that lead to the eardrums, and things get sucked in, clogged up, etc. You're suffering a pretty severe hearing diminution right now, so something more should be done anyway.  As for the potential pain or discomfort while flying, you'd need to talk to your doctor about this. Taking deongestants may help, but sometimes this is an unpredictable thing and often nothing happens, while other times it can be pretty painful. This can happen even in someone with no current ear problems, so it really is hard to say.   Again, sinus irrigation might help, but I don't honestly know if that can be done while tubes are in place, so you should ask your doctor about this as well as what might be most helpful for the flight. Also, were you warned to not use Afrin for more than three days in a row? Doing it more often or longer can actually make the problem worse as it causes a rebound effect, and this also may be part of your problem right now. Again, something to ask your doctor.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us.\n\n",

I have had a perforated eardrum that healed on its own by the time I finally got an appointment with a surgeon. Does the nasal septum heal on its own like the eardrum?   I do not know if I even have a perforated septum. Are there any key signs? I have never had a nosebleed, but sometimes there is a bit of blood in my Kleenex after cleaning out my nose.  I should probably make an appointment with my ENT...I am just wondering if I should be alarmed right now.  Thanks,   A\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Your situation is not unusual, and it can be diffcult  for the patient to determine if there is a perforation or not. While these may sometimes heal themselves (as eardrums will), more often they will not, because the nature of the mucosa is somewhat different, and traumatic injury will be repeated more often than not. An ENT specialist can do a thorough history and physical and clear off the crusting and use instruments to visualize the septum and determine if it is perforated or not. If it is, he can then set up a treatment plan based on the individual case. This is important because some will heal on their own if allowed, while others require either medical or sometimes minor surgical treatment.  No particular need to be alarmed, but it would be very prudent to go ahead and make the appointment and get this resolved now, so you can then work on the underlying problem as well as the impulse to poke around in there.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I assume you have access to my posted medical history.  In short, I have just started taking Singulair with wonderful results.  I have been taking Allegra for decades, mainly to decrease runny nose and miscl allergy symptoms.  Should I continue to take the Allegra along with the Singulair? Or quit the Allegra?  In case you find it helpful, recent history detail follows:  Recent history: For nearly a week I had extended - as long as 1 -2 hours non-stop - bouts of uncontrolable coughing, more often than not from tickle high up in back of throat which was seriously disrupting my sleep as well as my ability to perform tasks/work while awake.  Mucinex with benadryl helped some but I still could not get a night's sleep or work without beginning to cough and choke mid-telephone calls.  I did not \"feel bad\" except for loss of sleep & tiredness from all the coughing which I just had to put an end to.  Went to PCP. PCP told me I had significant inflamation and congestion in nose, ears and throat but clear lungs.  He gave me a prescription narcotic cough syrup and Singulair samples and, while aluding that he thought I might get worse before I got better, he gave me an antibiotic Rx to fill if I decided this was developing into an infection.   Cough Syrup, with the Mucinex & benadryl enabled me to get a couple of nights' sleep but really did not \"fix\" things.   I took Singulair for 1st time Friday night - like a miracle:  No uncontrolable runny nose, I slept thru the night without other mentioned meds.  I now have only an occasional very congested, deep, productive cough - not bouts of coughing.  Taking the Singulair is like I am in a different world - a normal one.  I take so, so many meds.  Should I try stopping the Allegra?    Thank you in advance for any feedback.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I have just been Rx'd Singulair, should I continue Allegra?",
    "content": "Hi there --  Singulair is unique and has properties that for some reason are much more effective in preventing not only post nasal drainage (PND) but also laryngeal spasm resulting from PND irritation. Allegra is a more conventional antihistimine and so mostly causes drying. You can -- and probably should -- discontinue it now, since there's usually no benefit from taking both, and the combined drying effect could actually cause problems, as conventional antihistimines often contribute to sinus and bronchial infections because of thickening mucous. Singulair works differently and often has very good results in patients with trachiobronchial spasm. If it's working as well as you say, this is wonderful, and if you can manage without the Allegra you'll be all to the good. If, however, after a few days things seem to have worked best with both, there's also no huge reason to not restart it. I'd definitely try going without first, because of the drying issue, as well as because of your very reasonable concern about having so many routine meds to manage. Anything you can get rid of is only going to make life easier.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us and let us know how this all goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While this symptoms is often benign and sometimes is only an intermittent annoyance, it also can be a sign of something more serious, and this really needs to be examined more closely, as a look into the ear would likely not expose a new growth, cyst, tumor, aneurysm, etc., even though the pulsing is heard in there. Usually this, when it is a matter for concern, is due to something either growing or pushed out of place and placing pressure on the carotid artery near the ear's apparatus so that the sound is transmitted and becomes audible and annoying. However, while  it's annoying, it's the potential later problems that are of concern, which would result from pressure on the carotid artery. For this reason an ultrasound study, possibly followed by a CT or MRI should be done to rule out any neoplasm or cyst (or even something as simple as a displaced hyoid bone) can be ruled out or handled appropriately. It may not be anything, but this is often not as simple as it would appear, and if it's constant and can be attenuated by head movement something mechanical is causing it and needs to be recognized and handled accordingly.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

He wasn\u2019t sure as to why but guessed that the one side was trying to compensate for what the other side couldn\u2019t do because of the muscle pressing down. The ENT wanted to refer me to another hospital but was confident that there was nothing to be done for the muscle.    This was over 6 months ago.  I have since then am having new symptoms.  I get light headed when standing up and have fainted 2 times.  The muscle never really \"hurts\" but once in a while it feels to get bigger during the day and will ache.  Also, at night it is \"tighter\" and I feel as if I turn my head one way or the other that it makes me light headed...possibly due to constricting the artery?  The last symptom I\u2019ve noticed is a reoccurring painful lymph node above the muscle that is large and under my jaw.  It is enlarged and painful to the touch but goes away after a day but will also come back. Any thoughts?!?!  Should I go in for another CT or see a different ENT?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Diseases which can cause localized hypertrophy of large, stabilizing muscle groups such as you describe are rare, but can occur. Otherwise I'd suspect some sort of spasm or neoplasm inside the muscle; however, you seem to have had neoplasms and cysts ruled out, and since the carotids are unequal in diameter, this will need to be corrected, perhaps surgically, to prevent eventualy injury to the brain. The fact that you suffer lightheadedness and fainting spells will force the issue, but it would be good to get ahead of it if possible. I'm not sure your ENT is sufficiently conversant in physiology of the neck to deal with this, so you may need to see either an orthopedic surgeon and/or a vascular surgeon (the latter may be your best bet, since the artery is really the concern here, the muscle secondary) to formulate a treatment plan.   I hope this is helpful to you. The situation is definitely odd, so you may need referral  to a highly specialized center if you can't find someone who can figure this out in a timely way.   Good luck to you with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: blocked ears after using sodium bicarbonate",
    "content": "Hello --  Sodium bicarb is sometimes used to help kill off fungal infections, but as far as earwax goes I wouldn't think it would be especially helpful. I'm not sure why it's apparently staying in your ears, but your doctor should do a regular in-office ear irrigation followed by either prescription or over-the-counter drops (such as those made by Murine) which are intended to dissolve wax. Even with this, sometimes the fluid will stay in the ear for a day or so, usually draining during sleep. Murine drops can be used without a doctor's help, as well, and is generally effective. If your ears don't drain properly fairly soon you'll need to go back and have them irrigated, which should have been done the first time, in order to prevent otitis media (inflammation of the ear canal, as \"swimmer's ear\").   Hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sphenoid sinus inflammatory change?",
    "content": "Hi there --  Your CT results have a pretty narrow and relatively benign interpretation consistent with your symptoms: \"inspissated\" means congealed or impacted, and \"secretions\"  refers to mucus that is secreted by the sinuses. Polyps formation is common and often is the cause of the original blockage and subsequent inflammation. The sphenoid sinuses are deep sinuses located behind the nose and eyes, so are rather isolated from rich blood vessel supply, a mixed thing at best. Because they aren't convenient to significant blood supply they are less likely to allow local infection to more sensitive areas; by the same token, narrow-spectrum antibiotics are often lost in the works before they are able to reach the location of the infection, so this is sometimes difficult to clear up without manual irrigation or possibly even in some cases surgery. Broad spectrum antibiotics are more likely to help, but in the meantime expectorants (such as guaifenesin as in Mucinex) and pain medication (ibuprofin, naproxyn) to treat the headachces and help encourage drainage are helpful. While not usually serious these deep sinus infections can be quite painful and even make a person feel pretty sick at times. Your doctor, when he returns, should provide a treatment plan to resolve this, as well as supportive care for the symtoms. Hopefully this will resolve with conservative care.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "While my otolaryngologist is excellent (he's rated as one of the best in the country), there is one issue of mine he's been unable to solve.  I have one spot in my nasopharynx that produces excess mucous chronically, and is prone to frequent infection.  It had been hoped that removing my adenoids (and tonsils) would eliminate the problem, but it hasn't.  I have been unable to find much information on this condition in my medical texts, on pubmed, and elsewhere online.  The rest of my ENT history is unremarkable.  There is a single spot where my adenoids had been that is producing excess, very thick, ropey mucous.  This postnasal drainage leads to a chronic sore throat.  The thick mucous tends to build up over that spot, and when it is infected, every couple of days or so it will dry out and detach, going down my airway, causing me to cough it up.  What is coughed up is a very large, sticky, green and yellow gob of stuff, somewhat flattened like a scab, and can be up to an inch in diameter.    My doctor has told me that there is little that can be done if it continues after the adenoids have been removed... that existing treatments generally do not alleviate the problem, and that the best we can do is nasal rinses, and treat infections as they occur.  What little I've found tends to corroborate this, but the information appears fairly old and scanty.  I would really like to know if there is anything new that might be done to eliminate this problem.  I sing in a choir, and this condition frequently interferes with my ability to perform.  Also, whenever I get a cold, I automatically go into a bacterial bronchitis (and for the most part, the remainder of my respiratory system is healthy.. I am an athlete as well), and I have to wonder of this could be setting me up for that.    Additional things we have tried are proton pump inhibitors and antacids (even though I have no signs of gastroesophageal reflux), and  various nasal rinses and gargles.  These have included mupirocin in them.  I just want that spot to stop producing this crud and getting infected all the time.  This has been going on for years.  I expect your answers will be the same as his, but I thought I'd post here, just in case someone here knows something he doesn't.   --  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- \"I'll Never Let my Schooling Interfere with my Education.\" -Mark Twain, a.k.a.

    "title": "Re: Chronic nasopharyngitis",
    "content": "Hello --  While your doctor apparently comes highly recommended, it seems he is stumped and has no great desire to find a solution to the problem. This is understandable when there is something that seemingly makes no sense, but I think there are some possible avenues that haven't been explored, and that a second opinion/consult might be in order. Your problem sounds fairly unremarkable, really. Chronic nasopharyngitis generally has an underlying cause, and your description of the mucus/phlegm that is brought up (and how it moves down) strongly suggests a chronic infection, possibly rooted in a cyst-like business where your adenoids were formerly attached. Many people who have adenoids removed have short-term improvement followed by unexpected problems such as you describe.   It is difficult to evaluate this at a distance and without appropriate studies, and even if that were possible,  I am not a doctor and certainly not an ENT specialist. I can only draw on what I know from my work with doctors who, for the most part, have not been specialists in this area either, but there is enough personal experience for me to be able to relate to the complaint, and to suggest that it may well be possible to improve or correct this, assuming proper diagnosis and especially location of the tissue which seems to remain chronically inflamed and probaly infected.   I hope you'll pursue a second opinion,  and even though your ENT is highly regarded, once a doctor had exhausted his ideas on a specific problem, it's often best seen through a new pair of eyes. This is my suggestion to you, and I highly recommend it.  Best of luck to you, and please do follow up with us as needed. Update us if anything changes, also.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  There's no direct connection between Hashimoto's and Menier's (or your symptoms), but both Hashimoto's and Menier's can be caused by a common link, which is autoimmune response to something. Usually steroids are the therapy of choice for Menier's, while Hashimoto's seems to cause actual damage that steroids don't improve. The fact that your ear symptoms haven't improved with steroid therapy doesn't disallow Menier's, but is odd anyway. There are, however, other treatments for that and similar syndromes, and one of the most significant and effective ones is dietary restriction of salt. This sometimes brings about remarkable improvements. Also there has been some experimentation with streptomycin (which is toxic to nerve tissue in the inner ear in normal  doses). It's something  worth a second look.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, the heart disease link, which has yet  to be adequately explained, involved having bilateral, vertical creases in the earlobes. This seems to have gone out  of fashion now, and never did enjoy any sort of cause-and-effect explanation. So you can set that one aside.  This swelling in your ear may have turned out to be providential, since it caused your doctor to find and treat an infection in the opposite ear, even though he didn't address the painful swelling. That is probably not actually the cartilage that is swollen and  painful, but a sebaceous gland in the skin. These often form unexpectedly and can be quite uncomfortable. Generally they either resorb or come to a head and drain on their own.  They can be quite uncomfortable, especially when you sleep on  the affected side. Application of moist, warm compresses (not hot) can sometimes help them to go away, and the antibiotic you're taking may also help with it, but they generally tend to run a benign if somewhat painful course, then  slowly go away.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While an actual lump on the carotid artery is unlikely, it is a place where a slightly misplaced lymph node could appear to be a lump in the carotid channel. I'm sure it feels as though  you can trace the artery manually and feel this lump as originating on the artery, and you of course may be right, but it seems highly unlikely. An ultrasound would clear this up, however, yes.   Meanwhile, two things must be noted: first, anything pressing on the carotid or up under the baroreceptor below your ear could be responsible for the ear symptoms and dizziness. Second, I notice you have a history of Hodgkins' disease, which means this lump definitely could be a lymph node. Either way it could be, since they are notorious for swelling, and there are others upstream from this location as well, and you could have an infection or this could indicate some recurrence of the earlier disease. Either way it needs to be checked. An ultrasound of the carotids would certainly not be out of order, and could clarify that impression one way or the other. If it's not a carotid lump (as I suspect it's not) then it would be appropriate to have a workup for both localized infection and possible recurrence of Hodgkins.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Ringing ear after cleaning",
    "content": "About three months ago, when I flew back up to where I go to school after summer vacation ended, I woke up with clogged ears, and it was a problem for me since then. I was told it was just earwax clogging my ear, making it difficult for me to hear properly in the morning, as the clog would open on its own after a few minutes in the morning.  Since then I've tried two different kinds of earwax solvent to get rid of the earwax, and today I went to my doctor and he flushed it out with a huge syringe-like aparate, and my ear felt completely fine for the first time in months and I was happy with that.  But now, about twelve hours later, I'm having a loud ringing noice in my ear, the same ear that was cleaned earlier this morning. My question is: Can you get permanent hearing damage/tinnitus after having a doctor clean your ear. To be honest, I'd pick the earwax over the ringing. It also hurts a little bit, but not consistant. I did have slight ringing in my ear for the last week or so, so it might not be the cleaning, but what could have caused this if not that?  Please do answer, as I'm getting desperate already. I just want this noise to stop!  Best regards, Vyse\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Irrigating an ear canal with a healthy eardrum should cause no problems with ringing.  In fact, if the cerumen impaction caused the ringing, it should improve with irrigation.  If the ringing persists, an audiologist can test the ear for hearing loss and if progressively worsens over a month's time then you may consider an MRI to rule out acoustic neuroma (a brain tumor that compromises the acoustic nerve).    But a trip to your family physician for re evaluation is the first step.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is a common and  often difficult problem. It can be something as simple  as globus sensation, which is often ultimately unexplained but is sometimes psychogenic in origin, and associated with anxiety or sadness most often. It can also be due to nasopharyngeal exudate, which one might think would respond well to antihistimines, but of course since they dry secretions, this is not especially helpful. An expectorant such as guaifenisen (as Mucinex or its generic equivalent) may be helpful, along with making certain you're properly hydrated. You  might even try an atomizer to help moisten your throat (which was long ago a common practice among singers). You may also have mild asthma, which can, via a number of mechanisms, cause this problem. You mention the wheeze when you laugh, and this could be  suggestive of high bronchial constriction related to mild pharyngeal constriction as well. Asthma is often caused by gastroesophogeal reflux (GERD) which you apparently already have, so you are a candidate for asthma as well.  I would suggest a consult with an ear, nose and throat specialist who might be able to sort out these possibilities and help you find some relief. Short of that, hydration and  an expectorant are probably the simplest and handiest possible remedies.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you with this, and please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cure for tinnitus.",
    "content": "Hello -  Tinnitus is an extremely common problem, but it can have many causes,  and so should be evaluated on an individual basis to be certain there isn't a more serious and/or treatable underlying condition. While tinnitus is generally seen as an inevitable part of aging (really long-term exposure to noise most often), you're far too young for that explanation to apply. You may have been exposed to loud noise anyway, and this sometimes happens to younger people due to industrial or musical overexposure to noise, but it also can be due to a number of treatable disorders -- or to nothing in particular. When it is the latter, sometimes niacin has been tried and supposedly sometimes helps, although there's no hard medical evidence for this. It can't hurt and might help. Of course if you're someone who uses common aspiring routinely (again, probably too young for that  to apply) this is another common and ofte-overlooked cause that can be removed in many cases.  It would be very helpful for you to be evaluated by an audiologist or neurologist to rule out any of the more serious causes (unless you know you've been exposed to high decibel levels for prolonged periods, and even then it would still be wise to try and save your hearing).   There is no \"cure\" out there, other than curing an underlying cause, despite what's advertised on line. As you suspect there are a lot of scam \"cures\" available, but they mostly do nothing and can sometimes cause other problems.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

If I don\u2019t get enough sleep, even half an hour less than usual (nine hours) I feel sick. I\u2019m constantly tired, just mildly, but constantly. I\u2019ve had blood work done (I believe for my thyroid, and b12 vitamin deficiency).   I\u2019m just wondering why I\u2019m constantly tired, and why I am constantly sick.   Other common complaints are: Abdominal issues, sensitivity to light, sensitivity to perfumes, dizzy when I get up, tmj, anxiety, under armpit sensitive.  While some people tell me I\u2019m a hypochondriac, I know what I\u2019m feeling. I know that these are more than normal and I\u2019m not making them up.

    "content": "Hello, Actually, these symptoms tend to be quite common however the exact cause often remains elusive.  Thyroid disease and anemia can cause fatigue so looking at thyroid hormone level (TSH and free T4) and complete blood count (CBC) are important. For chronic sinus infections, we often get a CT scan specifically of the frontal and maxillary sinuses.  Many migraine headache sufferers complain of all these symptoms. Watch migraine triggers including foods (eg caffeine, chocolate, MSG, nitrites,nuts,cheese) and avoiding frequent use (more than two days per month) of abortive migraine medicine (eg Fiorinal and triptans).  See your family physician for more definite diagnosis and help you to work through this.    Let us know how it goes.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thick, Gluey Saliva; Dry mouth; excess phlegm;......",
    "content": "Hello -  This must be really frustrating for you. I can think, just off hand, of a couple reasons why this may be happening. The most simple (and therefore most likely) one is local (or even general) dehydration, which will first dry up the more watery-type saliva which contains digestive enzymes (yes, the process starts soon as the food is in your mouth) while thickening the other type of saliva (these are produced by different sets of salivary glands) which is what you appear to be left with, the thick, serous type which is meant to aid in swallowing the bolus of food.   If you're doing a lot of singing practice you may be locally dehydrating your mouth. If you do, this eventually leads to loss of fluid generally, so increased fluid intake (and sometimes also using an atomizer to help hydrate the mouth and throat before practice sessions) may be necessary.  There are also some rather obscure conditons that can cause this sort of thing, but most of them are discovered early, in infancy, and are associated, usually, with some degree of developmental delay. However, there are variations on each end of the spectrum, so this is something you may want to bring to the attention of a doctor if increasing fluid intake doesn't help. You may be mouth-breathing more, simply because of your singing, or because of some faulty breathing habit or even a nasal blockage which dries up your oral mucosa during the night and leaves it that way during the day. Mouth breathing does cause loss of fluids, as does breathing in a dry environment. Winter or living in arid areas usually makes this worse, but also usually is compensated habitually from early on, unless one moves to a dry area from an area of more balanced humidity.  So the most likely cause is dryness itself, either due to your singing, due to a dry environment (which may be relatively new to you) or because of a failure of the parotid glands to produce enough of the more watery saliva which usually dilutes the thicker stuff.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with this and with your singing. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The sensation of soreness at the back of the tongue  (where it starts to curve down into the pharynx) is often an illusion, and is freqeuently actually caused by irritation of the back of the throat (pharyngitis), which in turn is often caused by strep.   This could be a tongue-based soreness due to allergy (and  especially given where you live), but given your recent history it's more likely due to a recurrence of the strep,  which may have grown resistant to Pen-VK, which has been used so much for so long  that a lot of bacteria tend to laugh at it.   Regardless of your doctor's skepticism you deserve (and need) to have any potential strep infection cleared up. It may mean a  change of antibiotic. You should  at least have your throat looked at and cultured again. Sometimes this bug can be really obstinate.  Hope this helps.

    "content": "Thanks so much for always trying to reply to all of us!   It is truly appreciated.  The morning after I wrote my question, my tongue felt almost completely normal, and by the end of that day, it was fine.  Not sure if it was just sore, or if my throat was just just irritated from my constant \"hacking\" to clear post nasal allergy drip.  I work in an elementary school and the nurse that looked at it said my throat looked irritated on both sides and of course she said \"just like everyone else, probably allergies.\"  I wrote another post here asking about the safety of claritin and other antihistimines because i just HAVE to take something.  Of course w/ my PACs/PVCs I am afraid of instigating them with a medicine, so I have just suffered with the red eyes, sniffles and constant throat clearing.  Any advice? Please feel free to delete my other post in which I asked this question.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm glad to hear the tongue/throat soreness cleared up so quickly. That sort of sensation usually does, but your throat is probably chronically irritated by the allergens.  If you have a lot of PVCs and PACs it can be pretty annoying (and anxiety-producing too, for a lot of people), but the newer antihistimines (such as Claritin -- generic is loratadine -- in particular) are pretty \"safe\" in terms of aggravating premature beats and arrhythmias. Just make certain you don't pick up Claritin-D, which contains psuedoephedrine (Sudafed), as this and other decongestants will definitely raise the blood pressure, increase cardiac output and produce more PVCs and PACs in those prone to them. The older antihistimines had a greater tendency to provoke these things, and pseudoephedrine definitely does (it's a lot like drinking a couple cups of coffee). Claritin/loratadine, Clarinex and Allegra( the latter two are still prescription, but there's a generic for Allegra now) are the least  likely to produce annoying side effects including premature heartbeats, drowsiness, etc. They will, of course, cause dry mouth because their purpose is to dry things out. They're you're best bet, however, for tackling these allergies without having too much else get stirred up in exchange. Oh, and also try to remember that although premature beats are annoying and feel weird, they are absolutely harmless (except emotionally, for those who get anxious when they start up).   I hope this is helpful too, and good luck to you with living in an area with such a potent airborne allergen. I've been there and discovered I'm affected as well. Not fun. Hang in there.\n\n",

    "title": "Samter's Triad - Nasal Polyps",
    "content": "Over the past 30 years, I have had 6 polypectomies and one Caldwell Luc (1986).  I have Samter's Triad with mild asthma and aspirin sensitivity.  After the first surgery in the 1970's, I did the skin testing and received the allergy shots for a couple of years with no improvement.  I have used a wide variety of antihistimanes and nasal inhalers and on occasion the bronchial inhalers.  The allergy doctor that I am seeing, took me off antihistamines and prescribed Zyflo CR which I take with Singulair, Advair 250 and Nasarel.  The polyps are back again and I have scheduled an appointment (next month) with a new ENT ( I recently moved).   I also developed a serious sinus infection from the polyps and I believe a fistula above a problem tooth.  I have read that there are theories that nasal polyps may be triggered by infections.   I went to urgent care and as prescribed predisone and amoxicillin for a short duration.  I have used this before through the years and I get better almost immediately and slowly worsen after the medication ends.  My question that I will take up with the ENT is it less \"risky\" to take the Predisone and possibly a low dose antibiotic every two months instead of the combination of drugs that seem to have a lesser affect on my disease.  I have annual liver function tests for the Zyflo, so I know there is a risk to that medication that is taken daily (600 mg tabs 2x2).  I have experimented with not taking the other medication when I am on the steroid and antibiotic and do not notice any affect.  I would utilize Advair and Nasarel daily.  I did start using the Zyflo about a year after my last polypectomy and some of the growth had returned so I don't know if the number of polyps is less this time but something triggers the reaction and they swell and get the resulting sinus infection.  The initial reaction and infection is always on the side with problem tooth (which I will have extracted after seeing the ENT).  Additional risk factor is the surgery which is now done with general anesthesia and proximate to the brain cavity and facial nerves which are a concern to me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Samter's Triad - Nasal Polyps",
    "content": "Hello -  This does pose a number of problems that tend to cascade. Your idea of taking the steroids  pre-emptively and the antibiotic occasionally to tackle infections as they arise makes the most  sense to me. Taking them both at the same time is problematic because the steroids  tend to mask the symptoms  of infections until they've progressed quite a bit, but in your case if you can prevent the infections by discouraging the irritation that provokes the growth of polyps (and so creates new breeding ground for infection that otherwise wouldn't happen) you should be ahead of the game.  I'd present the idea to your doctor. Be  prepared for some resistance, as many doctors don't take  kindly to the patient trying  to \"help\" with the treatment plan, but this is a trend that is slowly turning around. I'd encourage you to ask for this option. It  can't be worse than what you already have to work with and might  well be a better approach. As I said, it makes sense -- it at least looks good on paper.  I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you with this. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "im 43, male.  about two weeks ago i contracted what i thought was a cold in my sinuses.  the drainage became yellow after a couple days but i assumed it was viral so i just treated with OTC drugs that usually work for me to manage symptoms.  they didnt work and i was constantly congested in my head (not chest) and could get only minor temporary relief from steam.  i was blowing my nose constantly, lots of drainage and had horrible sleep for 3 nights in a row because i could only breathe through my mouth and was up regularly blowing brownish/yellow crud out.  because of the repeated blowing (with resistance from mucus membrane swelling near shut), i started getting some ear popping when i was blowing and then my left ear started to feel irritated and became blocked from sound.  i suspected ear infection (never had one before) so i went to my PCP (internal med) and he said the drum was red and swollen \"classic ear infection presentation\".  he prescribe amoxicillin for 10 days.  the sinus pressure relieved almost immediately (the day after) and today (one week later) my sinuses feel back to normal and clear.  however, my ear tube is completely blocked and i still blow that sticky yellow gunk out of my nose at least once every hour or so - more when i'm bending over and active (i'm doing some inside house painting).  the more concerning thing is that every time i swallow or blow (even lightly) my ear pops.  the ear canal feels a bit more irritated than when I started the antibiotics and probably a little more pressure.  since i'm 7 days into my the amoxicillin, should i be concerned if nothing changes when i'm through with it in 3 more days (still plugged, irritated and blowing out yellow crud)?  i do have a high frequency hearing loss in this ear and for the past several years have had strange intermittant periods (a day or a few days) of feeling deaf in that ear and then it clears up and is normal (just high pitch and low volume hearing loss - wispers and crickets are inaudible)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, 1. Some foods like chocolate, alcohol, peppermint, caffeine, and fatty food may decrease the tone of the lower esophageal sphincter and contribute to gastric reflux.  I do not know which component of chocolate does this... so not much help on the Swiss Miss.  2. Yes. Asthma and GERD can be related.  The basic idea is that some gastric secretions may work their way up the esophagus and toward the bronchial tree causing a bronchial response ie asthma.  This occurs more at night in the recumbent position.   3.  Yes, these drugs (proton pump inhibitors) can cause constipation and abdominal pain. 4. A hiatal hernia is named for the occurence when the stomach (a pouch) works its way up through the diaphragm.  Normally, the esophagus alone is supposed to occupy this particular opening.  When the stomach herniates (literally: to protrude through an abnormal body opening) more secretions are likely to enter the esophagus and to the back of throat causing a brackish taste.  Pregnancy and obesity both add more abdominal pressure on the stomach pushing it upward against the diaphragm and increases the chance of hiatal hernia.  Hope this helps.  Keep us posted on how things work out.\n\n",

    "title": "Sneezed out a chunk of flesh.",
    "content": "Male 39. I had been in bed for 4 days with a bad cold and strep throat(which i get much to often). Taking 500 mg of Amoxicillin (6hr periods) since 2nd day.  Yesterday,(day 5) I was seeming to clear up and feel better. I was blowing my nose, rather agressively i admit, to try to remove meucus.  A few times it was quite a lot and VERY thick. Suddenly while blowing very hard a chunk of flesh came out(right side). I am positive it is flesh and NOT meucus. It did not hurt at all and i did not bleed afterwards. My right nasal passage feels \"more than just clear\". Needles to say this freaked me out. I cleaned the piece and took some photos and noticed there were blood vessels in it. I called my sister who is an RN and she said if i was not bleeding and not in pain I would probably be ok. After sleeping through last night, I am still in no pain and there is still no blood. Im just wondering what this is and why this happened. I have never had ANY health issues to speak of other than the unusual frequency of strep. Am i going to start having Sinus issues?  Did I just sneeze out important parts of my Sinus because i was blowing to hard? should i be afraid to sneeze now? Basically, What the hell just happened?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I think your sister is right, and I strongly suspect that what came out was probably a peduncular polyp which had a very slim (and possibly dead) stalk. These things cause a lot of sinus problems and if one is removed, there is often a sudden sense of the passage being \"more than clear.\" It had probably been in there for a long time and may have either torn loose or, as I suggested earlier, may have lost its blood supply due to the stalk having been twisted or just too slim.   I'd mention it to a doctor and maybe even (if you still have the evidence) show it to a doctor, but given where it came from and the subsequent open-ness, I'm pretty sure you blew out a pendulous polyp. If so,  that's all to the good and may have solved some future problems and even saved you some money.   Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I work in a Supported Living Services environment for mentally disabled adults, my client (moderate-severe mental retarded) suffered from a head injury 5 days ago, she fell on her head board which produced a deep laceration across her forehead which required 8 staples. She went to the emergency room right after this incident and got the staples in place. Its been five days now, and since the initial impact, she's been having nose bleeds each night for the past 3 nights. These nose bleeds would just occur spontaneously with no provocation of the nose.   I was reading a bit online and came across possibility of a \" skull fractures\" in her frontal lobe, and or maybe high blood pressure.  Should I bring her to the hospital? Is there anything I can do to help the situation?  Because of her disability, it is hard to determine whether her symptoms are natural or in an effort to gain attention.   However, I have been observing her lately, and she seems like she is more off balanced, she seems more confused and she is restless, she has trouble sleeping at night, she wakes up a lot throughout the night.   Do you have any advice of what I should do in this situation?   Thank You for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While your patient's behavior could, in part, be due to a wish for attention, this could be warranted, since she may be having symptoms she's unable to communicate to you directly. That said, I don't think spontaneous nosebleeds are a deliberate attempt to communicate, and since they follow a head injury, they are very  possibly related to that injury and should be evaluated on an urgent basis. She could have a concussion at least, and possibly a fracture or other injury below the superficial one.   I think there are enough apparent neurological symptoms, in addition to the nosebleeds, to warrent taking her to the emergency room ASAP. Please either do this or have her taken there by ambulance for evaluation, since it appears there was no in-depth neurological eval done at the time the injury was treated.  Hope this is  helpful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

When my patient went to the hospital for her staples, she went through Xray and MRI which showed no sign of fractures or breaks, and just a day ago, she stopped having those nose bleeds. I think due to the heater being on in this dry climate, it could have been a factor in the cause of her nose bleeds. A day ago, I turned the heater off during the night and she didn't have another episode.   Could something else have been responsible? Should we still get her checked out?   Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Nose bleeds following Head Injury",
    "content": "Hello and you're very welcome.  If x-ray and MRI studies revealed no fractures or other underlying injuries, then that pretty well rules out those possibilities. The fact that your patient has been in a room with an auxilliary heater (and this is something a lot of us are suffering from now), that is a very likely cause of the nosebleeds, as it dries the nasal mucus membranes and the capilaries break at random.   So long as there are no behavioral signs that something is wrong (and it is difficult, I'm sure, to infer from this patient when that may be happening), she's probably fine. The two other (cardinal) signs you should watch for, and which should have passed by this point, would be unusual periods of sleeping and unexpected vomiting. The farther from the time of the injury, the less likely these are to be indicative of any intracranial problem.  I think you've solved your riddle regarding the nosebleeds. I hope everything else is well. Good luck with this and please keep us updated.\n\n",

I am thinking that perhaps this injury has caused internal physiological damage, could this be possible too?  Also, she scratched off 2 of the 8 staples that were on her forehead covering the suture, and is now bleeding, should I recommend that she just gets those staples off? or do you think stitches would be a better alternative?

    "content": "Hi again -  Well it was a good idea anyway. Now that dry air has been pretty much eliminated as the cause I think it would be very wise to have her checked to be sure there's no internal injury.   As for the staples, stitches probably would stay put better although it may be a little more of an ordeal getting it done. I think it would be worthwhile from a healing standpoint as well as a cosmetic one. An even better alternative, if it's workable with this wound, would be to glue it (the surgical equivalent of Super Glue), which is least likely to be picked apart and which leaves generally the least scarring.  Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

Went to the doctor and got a Z-pack and some shot to clear the symptoms (can't remember what it was). Symptoms somewhat subsided for a couple weeks, and then came right back. Went back to the doctor and got Augementin and steriods.

I am also having a lot of trouble at night. Can't fall asleep, wake shortly after and just toss and turn. I'm not waking because of any symptoms, just waking and very restless....these are very unlike me.   After 2 antibiotics, shots, and steriods, I'm worried something else may be wrong. I have allergies, but am on Allegra-D which has kept them under control (and I have no sneezing or allergy like symptoms). I have had a CT scan of my sinuses several months ago and they have not shown anything irregular. Please help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic Sinus Problems after Antibiotics",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is a fairly common course by which chronic sinus problems start, after an acute infection. There is often a blocked sinus involved, although not always. A CT of the sinuses can often be helpful in determining if there is something preventing proper drainage (and so giving bacteria a place to keep regrowing). Since you had one months ago,  a followup one would certainly be reasonable now.  Also, and only in my own humble opinion (although it is supported by many doctors as well), using steroids to treat an infection in order to mitigate symptoms is not generally a good idea, even though I'm seeing it and hearing about it being done more and more often. Many times the results are the same as you experienced: soon  as the steroids are withdrawn the symptoms return with a vengeance, because the steroids compromise the immune system somewhat, while not actually killing any microbes. Just a thought.  Again, a followup CT of the sinuses would be in order, and definitely a referral to an ENT specialist for consult and possibly creative treatment to clear this up once and for all. I'm guessing the end of the course of steroids would have been a couple weeks ago, so between that (which could have disrupted your sleep cycle even this far along) and the residual annoying symptoms, so these are probably the reasons for your difficulies with sleep. Then again it may just be coincidental.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  This is not normal, but it is relatively common. It can be caused by either a nasal polyp or a deviated septum. If this has been a lifelong problem it could be a septum deviated since birth. If there have been lots of colds and sinus infections over the years it could be a polyp, as these are often created by unequal pressures and hard blowing of the nose. It can be determined easily enough by an ENT  specialist and a handy little light to look up in there and see what's in the way.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

These symptoms went away after 4-5 days. 2-3 days latter I started geting a dull ache in my left ear and it hurt to touch. I thought it was a common ear infection. Then something weird happened 4 days ago. I was having sex with my wife and upon ejaculation i experienced SEVER pain at the base of my head and neck, both ear canals started throbing, my molars hurt as if I had a cavity and I had sever pain behind my eyes. My mouth tasted bitter. The pain lasted for about 4 hours, subsiding slowly. the pain was so bad I vomited. the pain or discomfort to remain was to my ear canals. So I thought it was a ear infection...but today the ear pain was gone, the ear was just sensitive tot he touch. so I wanted to test out ummm how do you say, my ability to have sex. so I tried to masturbate, with in minutes the pain came back, this time with a pressure in my head. I am not sure what this is, and I am a little scared. I want to go see the doctor but I am living in malaysia (I am an American) and i have found the level of care not that good. Plus I only know of ONE ENT in all of Malaysia, even though I am sure there are more. If I could get some advice on this so that when I go into see the doctor I am armed with some knowledge.

    "content": "Hello -  Given your relatively isoloated situation (medically at least) you first probably don't want to aggravate whatever this is any more. Secondly, when you see some doctor (and an ENT may not be what you're needing at this point) you're going to want to rule out (or in) the most serious possibilites first. Since sexual activity produces a number of physical consequences (unrelated to one's enjoyment) which are normally unremarkable, this could become a problem.  First, the symptoms you describe could involve the temporary increase in intracranial pressure (ICP), the increase in blood pressure (BP), or the postural  pressure on cervical and cranial nerves. The possibilities are listed in descending order of potential seriousness. The first two usually go hand-in-hand.  If  something has happened inside your head which is affected by increased BP or ICP, this could be a serious problem. If what's going on  is related to postural stresses and is  causing nerve irritation (you do state the ear was sensitive to the touch and had probably been involved in the recent upper respiratory infection) this may be just a very \"raw\" nerve irritated by some residual effects of the infection, which seems to have now cleared up. If this is so then the problem may not be as potentially serious, but the effects suggest something more, such as an inflammation of a cranial nerve (perhaps, most worrisome, the oropharyngeal nerve). It is of course impossible to be remotely certain at such a distance, but since this seems to be a new  and possibly emergent problem,  I'd suggest you find yourself at least a competent MD to do as comprehensive a neurological check on you as is possible. An ENT exam by a general practitioner should be adequate by now if this is, in fact, an ENT issue, since the problem  should be readily visible or palpable by now. What we want to make certain is that it isn't more central.  Hope  this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 8 month long cough",
    "content": "Hi there -  This sort of cough can become chronic if the mucus membranes of the sinuses and nasal passages are chronically irritated, which can be due to allergies, dust and mold, or just dry air (as from forced air heat, etc.). All these situations provoke the mucus membranes to produce thin, clear mucus which drains post-nasally during the night when one is lying horizontal, and in the morning there is often a tickling, dry, unproductive cough that can be quite irritating. Trying one of the \"non-drowsy\" antihistamines for a while prior to bedtime might help a good deal.   This problem also can sometimes be caused by mild gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), which is also most active during sleep. If an antihistimine trial doesn't help you might want to have this evaluated, as it may be due to GERD, which can sometimes actually eventually produce a form of asthma.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have been having constant headaches since the beginning of October.  The pain was mainly in the back and sides of my heads (more towards the back).  I have been through 3 doctors, 1 hospital, 1 MRI and about 8 or 9 different medications.  The first doctor put me on Epidrin and Prednisone 2.5mg for migraines.  A few days later those didn't help, so I called back the doctor and he wrote me for Prochlorperazine, which caused me to have no control over my tongue or jaw muscles after 3 days of taking it.    All the rest of the medications proved no help at all.  I have taken lortab 7.5mg, 10mg, and Percocet 10mg because the pain has been so intense.  It has gotten to the point where the pain is so high that I wake up in the middle of the night from it.  I got the MRI on December 4th of this year and was told that I have:  FINDINGS: \"4.  The visualized paranasal sinuses demonstrate partial opacification of the left maxillary sinus which appears to be a mucus retention cyst rather than an acute inflammatory process.  A small area of partial opacification of the left sphenoid sinus is seen.  minimal mucosal thickening of the right ethmoid air cell is seen.\"  Ever since Sunday, December 13, I have been getting sicker.  It started out with a sore throat and moved on to coughing up phlegm about 20 times a day.  Also my nose has been stuffy and runny all the time and have been blowing out a lot of clear snot.  The phlegm started out as a medium-dark green but is now basically clear.  Is it possible that the mucus retention cyst could be the cause of me being sick?  I have been going crazy for the past 2 and a half months because I don't know what's wrong.  I've been told that the cyst couldn't be causing my headaches and that it was just stress, but I believe there is something more to my headaches and my symptoms.  I Appreciate your time for reading this.  All thanks,    TheKeg\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it's rare for a mucus retention cyst to become infected, they can, and they also can also can cause secondary sinus infections by way of blocking the drainage of the sinus cavity involved. Its sounds as though this is what's happened in your case, although blood work (a CBC) would be helpful in ascertaining you have a bacterial infection up in there. While the location of the headache pain is  off base for this sort of problem, it still is very likely, given the other symptoms, that this is the root cause at least.   Have you been running a fever at all? This would also be highly suggestive of a sinus infection or infected cyst.   It's pretty clear you're not having migraines, so it's hard to understand why any of these doctors wouldn't at least go for the next most logical explanation and try treating this as an infection, especially now that you have these symptoms. The colorful discharge you had at first is pretty obviously due to an infection. Now that it's clear it's a little more difficult to know based just on the description, but I strongly suspect you have a blocked sinus due to this cyst and it's causing global headaches at this  point.   I hope this helps. Best of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed, and update us if anything new comes to light.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  I have only checked my temperature once when I felt like I had a fever (99.8).  The other times I was in school, but I was pretty sure I had one.  I also have had some random chest pains.  I believe one time it was caused by medicine, but about a week later it started with a stomach ache then everytime my heart would beat, my chest would hurt.  The pain went away the next day, but was hell the day before.  I have an appointment today for an ENT doctor.  I'm really hoping they can get rid of the pain, because all I want for Christmas is just to be pain free.  I really do appreciate your time, John Kenyon.  All Thanks,   TheKeg\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TheKeg -  You're very welcome. It certainly does sound like an infection, and with probably an intermittent low-grade fever it almost has to be. That's odd about your chest hurting along with your heartbeat. You might want to mention that to the doctor as well, just to be thorough (I can't think of any serious reason why that would happen, but it's at least \"interesting\").   Good luck at the ENT and let us know how that goes. If we don't hear from you before, have a great holiday.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,  I just got back from the ENT, he took a look with a scope into my nose to see if I had any infection.  He told me that everything was clear and that I had a little bit of mucus, but it shouldn't be a problem.  He said that it was possible that I have a low sinusitis problem or something of that nature.  The doctor prescribed me 40 Amoxicillin 875mg (twice daily until infection is gone).  He said that if it was an infection that I would be feeling better in a couple of days.  He took a look at the MRI and said that the cyst looked pretty normal.  I have done my research about cysts and I found out that 10% of healthy people have a cyst and they aren't something to worry about.  My doctor referred me to a pediatric neurologist because of the headaches (he's a pediatric ENT).  I asked him to prescribe me something for pain, but he didn't so I'm still in major pain.  I'm not sure when I'll be able to get an appointment for the Neurologist because of the Holidays being right around the corner.  I'll most likely continue to post my updates here for informational purposes and to possibly get more insight by everyone else here.  All Thanks,    TheKeg\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I was admitted into a hospital on the 29th (2 days ago).  I had a spinal tap done to try and find out if the pressure in my head was normal, and it was.  I then had another MRI done on my brain and it showed up clean as well.  I was visited by a Neurologist, Ophthalmologist, and a Physical Therapist to try to find out what is going on, while I was in the hospital.  The Ophthalmologist said that my optic nerves looked fine in my eyes, so that shouldn't be causing the headaches.  The Neurologist tried putting me on Depacon/Depacoat to see if it would help the pain at all and it didn't.  I was given something called Toradol for pain and it didn't help at all.  I was discharged last night and since then my headaches have worsened twice as much.  The pain is so excruciating that if I sit up straight I can only stay in that position (even standing up straight) for at the most 5 minutes without being in so much pain that I have to lay back down.  Also, my upper back has started to hurt right in the middle where my spine is.  I'm not sure if the increase in pain in my headaches and back pain were caused because of the spinal tap or not.  When I am sitting up straight and the pain starts to come, I can lean my head straight forward/downward and the pain will be less than when it is if I have my head straight up.  If anyone has any ideas on what could be causing more pain I would really appreciate it.   Happy New Years   -TheKeg\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Coming from a strictly clinical point of view, my answer, also intended to keep your girlfriend from getting hurt, is that while it might not cause an allergic reaction or only a mild one, allergic reactions are utterly unpredictable (especially first-time ones), and I can't in good conscience tell you your girlfriend could not have a serious anaphylactic reaction, because she could. She well might not, but she could. Marijuana is relatively benign as a substance, but allergies change everything.   My advice to her (or to you, to pass along) is that the risk of anaphylaxis would be tantamount to playing Russian roulette. Since marijuana isn't necessary to life  but breathing is, I'd not try it if I were her.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Well, I have waited a week having these symptoms, but this is starting to get annoying and does not seem to be getting better.  Maybe you can shed some light on this...  Last week I had a pretty bad cold, to the point where I felt physically sick and had to miss work.  Usually with a cold I am able to function, but last week it was intense.  I had massive discharge from my sinuses, coughing, etc.  I lived on Nyquil as I could not sleep without it.  So midway last week as the symptoms were lessening, I woke up in the morning with what felt like a sore throat.  I thought it was post-nasal drip as it had the same feeling.  I shrugged it off as nothing.  The \"feeling\" lessened during the day.  The next day I woke up with the same feeling.  A very dry mouth/throat and pain from the same spot.  This time, it felt like there was something kind of stuck there.  I went to the mirror and looked in to find a dime or smaller sized white spot.  It is like a very large cancer sore (which I am prone too) almost crater like and nearly perfectly round.    So, I thought it was a cancer sore.  I have dealt with it since last week and it has not gotten any better.  I have this white spot, red on the edges located on the back of my mouth near my throat.  I can feel it with the VERY back of my tongue, as my tongue rubs it when I move it upwards.  It is not really in the throat, but the VERY back of my mouth.  It does not hurt \"badly\" when I swallow, but did when it first appeared.  There is really only pain when I wake up in the morning otherwise, it is just annoying.    It just does not seem like it is getting better.  I have no other symptoms (re: cold) now and am just wondering if this is a big annoying cancer sore or some sort of infection that I should worry about.  Oh, it does not hurt when I eat or swallow.  Strangely, the only thing that really \"hurts\" (like a 2 -3 on a scale of 10) is if I drink water or very cold things.    Anyways, please let me know.  I have no insurance and really cannot afford going to a Dr. during the holiday season unless it is super-necessary.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  What you're describing does sound like an outsized canker sore (apthout stomatitis) and the size concerns me a little, but they can get pretty large sometimes. It may also be candida albicans (a fungal infection) however. Try gargling with salt water or hydrogen peroxide (and, if you can find it, apply Gly-Oxide directly to the sore). If this doesn't resolve within a few days you'll need to have it looked at, as if it is candida it can possibly get into the bloodstream and cause more serious problems. Hopefully this will resolve shortly on its own or maybe a little sooner with the suggestions above.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Randy -  First, let me just salute a fellow FFII/EMT (although I'm no longer on the NR and after 40 years don't do much with hose and ladders anymore).   Now then: what you describe is a very common problem, and there's no generally recognized way to speed up the process. However, it's also true that people who work in the fire/EMS business (and certain other fields) are often exposed to both noxious atmospheres and dry air (from SCBA) so we are more prone to suffer noticeable olfactory deficits when we come down with respiratory infections.   Probably the most effective maintainance for the olfactory process is to maintain humidification (nebulizer with pure water is sometimes helpful and would also help break up bronchial congestion).  Wish I could tell you something better. Good luck to you and keep up the great work.\n\n",

Her mouth is so streched, she barely can talk! The lump is rock-hard and is very painful and she has fever.  I brought her to ER and they treated her for acute parotidis with antibiotics and told me it is very rare and should not come back...just to see that exactly 4 weeks after it comes back again!  We have seen a ENT that tols us it was probably Reccurent parotidis of childhood and it would go away when she grows (around 12-13 years)  But in the meanwhile, to treat each infections with antibiotics.  The fact that she already had it 6 times + the fact that we might have to face this for the next 10 years, I am very worried that she will develop antibiotic resistance.  The last episode needed 3 times 10 day treatment with different antibiotics.  Is there anything else we could do to prevent this?  (Also, I noticed it comes every 4 weeks...is that typical?)

    "title": "Re: parotide gland infection",
    "content": "Hi there -  This  is something that seems to have been more common in the past than it is now, but I don't know why that is. Sometimes a child may have an anatomical anomaly that causes the parotid gland or glands (as the case may be) to not be able to drain properly, or there may be some infection above the site (an abcessed tooth, in some cases) which causes this to become chronic. They do seem to outgrow it eventually, but this is now. It would be helpful if the primary cause of this could be located and corrected.  As for the concerns about antibiotics,  the greatest problem there is simply that bacteria becomes resistant to certain antibiotics and then get into the general population. It's not so much a problem of a given patient becoming vulnerable to the bacteria involved, which are always present anyway. For these reasons it's important to rotate antibiotics or at least alternate them when there's a chronic or recurrent infection.   Meanwhile, if the infections continue to recur you may want  to look for a second opinion, since a fresh pair of eyes may help isolate the underlying cause of the infections (and there usually is one but it may be difficult to isolate).  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and your little girl. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, im 15 and i've had a persistant pain in my right ear for 4 days. After a day the pain intensified and then decreased. It started leaking a mixture of pus, blood and yellow liquid and i cannot hear much in it. I think this could be related to a cold i recently had and it may have infected my eustatian tube and caused it to block. I went to the doctor on the third day and she examined it but she was unclear with the diagnosis. She said she expects it is a ruptured eardrum, but it is too inflamed and full of pus to see the tear. She also said the ear canal was inflamed and prescribed me antibiotics and some ear drops containing gentamicin and hydrocortisone acetate. I am confused because on the ear drops it stated \"do not use if the affected ear is or could be ruptured\". Also, i am meant to go to the doctors in a week after my course of amoxicilin has finished. I thought it would be best to wait until the antibiotics have cleared up the infection, as then the doctor may be able to see the possible tear. Do you think i should go ahead and use the ear drops, or wait for a week and see the doctor again?\n\n",

If it  doesn't, any irrigation (which may, of course, actually be what caused the problem to begin with) should be done in a doctor's office. If this  doesn't clear up within a few days of the initial insult (water getting in the ear from swimming, in this instance), then an ear exam should  be done by an MD. Sometimes this can devolve into an outer ear infection, something you really don't want if it can be avoided.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 5 years old and has seen her PCP reguarly since she was born. She has never had any medical problems other than the common cold and once having an ear infection.  In late Sept. 08 she began this hard sniffing through her nose. It is like when someone doesn't blow the nose they sniff it back up instead. The sniffing sounded very dry and when I had her attempt to blow her nose nothing would come out. The \"sniffing\" got louder and harder over a few days. One day she explained to me that there was a constant buzzing noise in both her ears and by \"sniffing\" it gives her some relief from the buzzing.   Took her to her PCP on Oct. 2 and he checked her ears, throat, nose, and eyes. He then said she has Allergies and this is causing the Tinnitus. He said she will have to learn to cope. She was prescribed Zyrtec and Nasonex to take once daily. He also said we will do a follow up in 6 months to determine whether the Zyrtec would be continued at that time, but for now she must take it once a day.  On Oct.17 she came home from school running a low fever, the fever stuck with her throughout the weekend and on mon. Oct 20 we were at the doctor's office. She was diagnosed with a sinus infection and prescribed an antibiotic (cefdinir) to take for ten days. She completed the cycle yesterday. The fever is gone, which it has been for awhile now.   Since her first appointment the ear noise has gotten louder and she is having lots of trouble coping with it. She calls her ears ugly and thinks that when she speaks others hear what she hears, which makes her call her voice ugly. I have also caught her hitting her ears so the noise would stop.   I am at a loss, I am unsure whether to get a second opinion from a specialist or to stick it out for the 6 months and hope that the Zyrtec will provide the relief she needs.   Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Youth Tinnitus and Allergies",
    "content": "Hello -  A second opinion probably wouldn't be a bad idea. While the prescriptions were appropriate, they obviously haven't resolved the entire problem, and one Catch-22 involved in treating sinus infections with antihistimines is that while they suppress the production of secretions,they also have a drying effect, so that what secretions are produced don't flow easily, resulting in thick pooling in the sinuses, which in many patients only serves to provide a breeding ground for the next infection. It also leaves the head feeling stuffy and can cause problems with the inner ear, including tinnitus and vertigo. So while they work, they sometimes also work against themselves.   At this point your daughter seems quite uncomfortable with some of the rather typical annoying symptoms that sometimes come with chronic sinus problems, and a fresh pair of eyes might be a good idea. An ENT specialist would be a very appropriate choice at this point. Perhaps the PCP will even be willing to provide a referral, since a young child won't  tolerate this sort of aggravation for six months, and it seems to not be improving much if at all,even  though the infection, for now at least, seems to be  knocked down.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and your daughter.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic sinusitis and fatigue",
    "content": "Hello. I am an 18-yr-old male and I have been recently experiencing unusual symptoms. I went to my doctor about a week ago because of lightheadedness, dizziness, headache (isolated to right side of the head, temple area), and eye-twitching (all of which had started about two weeks prior to my doctor visit). I of course assumed the worst, was expecting a neurological problem especially because my mother passed away two years ago from brain cancer. Well, I had an EKG, normal; bloodwork, normal (slightly high potassium but was retested in different lab and results were perfectly fine); and MRI without contrast, normal EXCEPT for inflamed sinuses. Doctor diagnosed sinusitis. I looked up acute and chronic sinusitis and my symptoms actually seemed to fit very well, even the eye-twitching (because of nerves that run through/around the sinuses and, if irritated, can produce muscle spasms). I was put on a 10-day regimen of Augmentin (which I am due to finish this weekend). The lightheadedness has pretty much subsided, but I still don't feel right. My biggest problem now is fatigue, almost as if my head is so heavy I just want to drop it and sleep all day- I am getting plenty of rest, usually at least 9 hours a night but I wake up in the morning, then, three hours later, am ready to sleep again. I took a three-hour nap yesterday after having slept for 10 hours and still felt so drowsy. Oddly though, it seems to get better in the evening, perhaps because that's when I'm \"supposed\" to feel tired and so I don't notice the fatigue as much. I also have random muscle twitching throughout my body (I've had this for a while though, and am not overly concerned because I understand benign muscle twitching is actually quite common and it seems like the more I think about it the more anxiety I will get [and the more often it will occur]). However, what I have also noticed is that I often feel like my whole body is vibrating or tingling, in a way, especially when I am relaxing or about to sleep [again, more noticable when I am thinking about it, but I am sure it isn't psychological]. Sometimes I will wake up suddenly in the night and feel like I'm trembling [this is a recent symptom], but it isn't actually outwardly visible. Sometimes I almost feel like my brain is vibrating, as weird as it sounds, and I feel like my head is pounding, like I am suddenly VERY aware of the blood pumping through my head. My headaches are less frequent and not that painful, but when I get them, they are still only on the right side and often radiate down to my neck (sometimes I feel like they may be starting from the neck). I find myself cracking my neck a lot to try to relieve tension/pain, also cracking/popping my jaw seems to help temporarily. Also, and I don't know if this is just because of anxiety over my symptoms and/or my medication, but my feces has been VERY loose, sometimes diarreah, for the past two weeks, and very frequent [4-5 times a day]. Appetite has also been a little less than usual, but still ok, and I've been trying to stay well-hydrated.  My biggest concerns right now are whether or not this could still be neurological and, if it is only sinusitis, how to manage fatigue. I have been doing some research on chronic sinusitis and have read that often aniobiotics work poorly or not at all, and oftentimes it is either viral or fungal. I even read multiple articles published a few years back about how chronic fatigue may be one of the biggest indicators of an undiagnosed sinus issue (this seems plausible to me because I have had allergies my whole life and a stuffy-nose feeling for many years, but no discharge) I have all sorts of crazy worries, like MS, fibromyalgia, some sort of brain infection (can sinus infection spread there?), chronic fatigue syndrome....I just don't know what to do especially because my symptoms seem to fit chronic sinustis very well but also a multitiude of other things. Should I also look into Chiari malformation (there has been a case of spina bifida in my family, grandma on mother's side lost a child to severe spina bifida upon birth)? Or would that have been very evident on an MRI? Also I noticed for a few days a couple weeks ago I kept smelling this kind of grape smell, but that has just randomly stopped happening. If anything, I am having problems smelling because my nose feels perpetually clogged or narrowed.   I would appreciate any input you have! I am especially anxious about this because I am leaving for college this weekend and do not want to have to deal with these symptoms. I am strongly considering having an appointment with an ENT, but, until then, would like any suggestions. Thanks!  ~Jason\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic sinusitis and fatigue",
    "content": "Hi Jason -  From your description of the symptoms I'd say you sound like someone who is essentially healthy, somewhat anxious (probably in no small part due to the untimely passing of your mother), and probably have a blocked deep sinus which may well  be infected. You've done your research well, and it's true that sometimes a sinus infection  can cause most (but not all) the symptoms that concern you and that antibiotics are sometimes not especially effective (particularly in cases of deep sinus infections and where there is a blockage due to enlarged turbinate or polyp formation). Sometimes these things need to be corrected surgically and sometimes a rotation through several different antibiotics will do it. There is also sinus irrigation, which can  be done at home but is best (and most effectively) done by an ENT specialist.   The various subtle sensations you describe are most likely a combination of normal-but-usually-not-noticed events, and some of them may be  due to (or at least noticed because of) anxiety.   The symptoms you describe, especially the fatigue and need to sleep a lot, are completely consistent with a chronic, unresolved sinus problem, whether infectious or not.  Failure not only to drain properly but to permit smooth pressure changes inside the head (sinuses) can cause feelings of fatigue,  malaise and even a sort of \"stupid\" feeling, where it is difficult to think simple problems  through clearly. Balance can be affected also, as can hearing.   I don't thing anything suggests Budd-Chiari, and it would have shown up on MRI. Even the olfactory hallucination (smelling the scent of grapes) is common with this sort of problem. Some very unusual smells are frequently reported, and usually they are not unpleasant.   If this should be caused by an allergic reaction (possible also), it will be more difficult to diagnose, but would respond well to antihistimines. The  only problem with this is that antihistimines dry and thicken the secretions, their use, without something to keep the secretions thinned, can often lead to recurrent infections. So if antihistimines are used, they should probably be used in combination with something like  guaifenesin (long-acting brand name: Mucinex) to keep the secretions moving, but less of them produced. This helps avoid  perpetuating the infection if there is one.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The cough could be due to any number of things: chronic sinus drainage, gastroesophageal reflux, even just a normal phenomenon. If it's a dry cough antihistimines are less likely to help, but were certainly worth a try. More likely to be effective would be either an expectorant (guaifenisen, brand name Mucinex), or a cough suppressant (dextromethorphan, the \"DM\" in many over-the-counter cough remedies); There's even a combination, Mucinex DM, which contains both.   It may also be something that will resolve in time. I assume it's especially bothersome, and since there appears to be no obvious respiratory reason for it, suppressing it may be the best bet.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have had recurring symptoms that I don't understand for several years. Because the problems I am having are intermittent and rather vague, I don't know how to broach them with my family doctor. I hope that you might at least give me some idea of what this might be so that I can approach my doctor with a bit more confidence. Here goes:  I seem to have sore throats that make it difficult to talk which develop into full blown illness frequently throughout the year - maybe 3 or 4 times a year. After a week or two of this throat irritation,I develop a bit of laboured breathing, some headache in the forehead, and extreme fatigue that makes it hard to stay out of bed during the day. I can easily stay asleep almost the entire day and night for a week straight (though I force myself to work and drag myself through the week).  Sometimes after a couple of weeks I get some more traditional cold symptoms (running nose, coughing). The pattern seems to be moderate discomfort ( ~2 weeks)  where I feel as though I am fighting something but am more or less ok,  then the terrible fatigue (~ 1 to 2 weeks) at which point I start to feel normal again with a great deal of relief. Here's the catch, it often seems to go right back to the feeling of fighting something. Eventually (close to a month) I seem to get to a fairly normal level again for a few months until it all repeats itself. The fatigue aspect seems to be getting worse in the past two years.   I've had a fairly standard set of blood tests done but nothing has come up from that. I get very worried about it until it goes away and then I don't want to think about it until it comes back. Then I get through it again. Thus I haven't pursued this with my doctor as much as I wish I had. Does this fit any known patterns?\n\n",

You may have something as \"simple\" as a chronic sinus infection (deep sinus, often without the usual headache and fever). You could also have a compromised immune system, which happens more often than one might think, and often is due to something relatively innocent or at least easily managed (though not always).   My suggestion to you would be to copy and paste what you've written here into a document and print it out (or else hand-write the same details if you prefer) and take that with you to the doctor, who should be able to interpret the information and do the appropriate tests and examinations to get to the bottom of this.

    "content": "Hi. I'm 24 and I have really big tonsills. When I was younger (in my teens) my doctor said that if I had one more strep throat infection, after a series of strep throat infections, and then they stopped. Since then, every time a doctor or nurse sees my throat- they remark on how huge they are.  Right now, I would say that I'm getting sick. But in reality it just feels like I have two boulders in my throat. I looked at my tonsills and they are so big that they are touching. Last night, I couldn't breathe in bed and in the last couple months, I have had a lot of trouble swallowing. I just put the two together and wonder if it is just my tonsills? Can I have them removed?  My mom looked at my throat and she said she saw white puss/muccus spots on my tonsills.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  The sheer size of your tonsils should warrant at least some sort of medical treatment if not removal. While adult tonsilectomy is more complex than that in young children, it still can be done and sometimes needs to be. Yours sound as though they likely are infected now, and if they are obstructing your airway (even if only when lying down) it's a far from ideal situation. They should be examined and at least treated, in some appropriate way, to get them shrunk down to a proper size.  If this isn't possible they may have to be removed, which, given your history, doesn't seem unreasonable.   I hope this helps. Please  follow up with us as needed or update us when you've been seen again.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is Nasonex safe?",
    "content": "Hi there -  Nasonex is a nasal spray steroid medication that is primarily topical. Very little of it manages to get into the bloodstream. The reason for the warning about recent vaccinations is that some are made  with live viruses rather than killed (as with your flu shot), and steroids can suppress inflammatory responses (in fact, that's its job), which can mask reactions to vaccines. As a rule this isn't a big deal anyway, but with live virus vaccines it is remotely possible to actually \"catch\" what you were vaccinated for,  at least in theory. This isn't the case with the flu vaccine currently in use, so no problem  there.   Also, with PACs and  PVCs,  while  they are benign, they are annoying and disturbing, so you don't want to ingest things that might aggravate them or increase their frequency, but, again, Nasonex is a topical drug (barely any gets into the bloodstream, it is applied to the surface of nasal passages), so should not have any effect on an irritable heart muscle, although oral or injected steroids may sometimes cause an increase in PACs and PVCs. Nasonex shouldn't affect that  problem at all, and even if it could,  it wouldn't be catastrophic,  just annoying. But it shouldn't at all. Some decongestant nasal sprays (like Afrin, etc., that are not steroid-based) can aggravate these arrhythmias, so Nasonex is actually a much better bet all the way around.   Fish oil (or omega-3 fatty acids) will not have any affect on PACs/PVCs at all and are very beneficial in many ways besides.   I hope this answers your concerns. Please feel free to follow up here as needed.\n\n",

For example, whenever I brush my teeth, wash my face or chew, it gets moved out of place and I have to push my nose upward to \"click\" it back in to place.  The place where it clicks is right above my left nostril, toward the front.  It's a real annoyance for me because throughout the day I feel like something is in my nose at the spot where it clicks.  Is there any way to know what is causing the clicking (broken cartilage?) and can it somehow be fixed?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While there's no way to know exactly what's causing this without a direct exam, it's a fairly common complaint, and sometimes it is broken cartilage, but it can also be due to an anatomical anomaly involving the structure of the nose cartilage and may just require an adjustment. If there's a break or a congenital separation, it may benefit from minor surgery or, if you know what it is, you can at least make an informed decision as to whether to put up with it or have it repaired. Again, it could just be something that needs an adjustment or other non-surgical treatment.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I had my tonsils out in June due to frequent and increasingly more severe cases of Strep throat.  Since then I have not been sick once until yesterday morning.  I woke up with a sore throat that if I hadn't had my tonsils out would have been sure was Strep.  But I had no fever yesterday or today, and there is not any white on my throat.  However, this morning I woke up and my uvula was swollen to three times its normal size.  When I get a cold, I usually start with sneezing and a nose that is stuffed with clear stuff, and a very mild sore throat.  Eventually it progresses to a cough.  I do not have any of that this morning.  I have been sneezing, but only occationally and not like when I have a cold.  Also, I can still breathe through my nose which never happens with a cold, although this morning I did have a small amount of green discharge.  No cough whatsoever, but my throat is so sore that I am finding it hard to swallow.  Also, I feel fine other than my throat, no body aches or fatigue.  Again, no fever, but a few of the cases of Strep that I contracted I did not have fever either.  Could this be Strep again, or could it be just a cold?  If it is not either, what could it be, and is it something I should go and see my doctor for tomorrow?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This is not due to a cold. You most likely have strep again -- and it can be recurrent. The swollen uvula isn't something you want, either, as it can interfere with swallowing and sometimes even with breathing, so you need to have this looked at and treated, probably with another course of antibiotics. I wouldn't let something like this go too long,either, since recurrent strep infections can lead to involvement of other organ systems.   Go see a doctor.   Hope this helps.

    "content": "Hello -  If there is no pain or discomfort associated with this, there is a chance this is angioneurotic edema, a potential serious allergic response to something. The reaction is swelling in the upper airway, and doesn't hurt, but can make swallowing difficult and can sometimes make breathing difficult as well. For this reason it needs to be evaluated at once. There is a small but discrete risk of this becoming dangerous. In the meantime, if you happen to have Benadryl handy, I'd take one, in hopes it will help control a possible  allergic reaction in progress.  Best of luck to you.

    "content": "Hello, This white headed bump on the throat is more likely to be due to throat infection. Most common cause of throat infection that give this picture are streptococcal infections (bacterial) and infectious mononucleosis (virus-EBV).  These condition are usually associated with fever, throat pain, difficult swallowing with or without lymphadenopathy. Viral infections are usually more mild. The only way to confirm diagnosis is through throat swab and culture.  The other possibility is the presence of tonsillar remnants that may get infected and give clinical picture similar to tonsillitis.  Having white headed bump in the tonsil without signs of inflammation may indicate tonsillar stone which usually gives bad odor and chronic irritant cough.  However, it is not expected to have this problem after tonsillectomy unless complete removal of the tonsil was not done and remnants are there. They usually result from postnasal secretions, recurrent infection and irritation. Dead bacteria and debris forms the stone.  Other causes of white patches in the throat include oral thrush (candida).  ENT examination is essential. I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lymph nodes enlargement can occur due to many causes: of them infections and inflammation in the area drained by them.  Following infection or inflammation lymph nodes become enlarged, painful, and tender. When recovery occurs, they then regress in size but never disappear and remain palpable. They are known as non specific lymph nodes and are of less than 1cm size, soft and mobile.  Infections and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract and the upper digestive tract result in enlarged lymph nodes mainly those felt on both sides of the neck (the submandibular and the cervical group of lymph nodes).  Lymph nodes that continue to grow in serial clinical examination are alarming and should be properly investigated. The same is applied to nodes with abnormal characters like being hard, fixed or of considerably large size as well as those of uncommonly involved site. So, if it is true, the enlarged lymph node is that big (about 4cm), further investigations are needed to exclude serious causes.  Supraclavicular lymph node enlargement is not commonly seen to be enlarged after infection in these areas although possible.  What you felt might be a lower cervical lymph node. The supraclavicular nodes are felt just above the inner part of the clavicle in the supraclavicular fossa. Its enlargement is commonly seen in problems (mostly cancer) in the lung or upper GIT, and breast. So, its enlargement mandates proper investigations for exclusion of serious causes.  A contracted muscles may be mistaken for a swelling so a thorough history and direct clinical examination are essential.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. He might recommend CT Scan to exclude other swellings in the body. And if suspicious lymph node is seen by examination or radiological a biopsy is mandatory. CBC and other blood tests like LDH, and ESR may be helpful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

When I do the \"plug your nose and blow\" maneuver to clear my eustachian tubes, and my eardrums pop out, i notice a VERY, very dramatic change in my hearing.  It is mainly in the high frequencies say above 8khz.  Things like cymbals come through very  crisp and detailed. I can hear so much more clearly I almost want to cry to think that's how I'm supposed to hear.  I'm not holding the eustachian tubes open, as I can tell what that sounds like too.  I just pop them out once.  My hearing will stay amazing but as soon as I swallow, my ears pop back again and the high frequency detail goes away immediately . It stays that way until I pop my ears again.  I had previously been diagnosed with eustachian tube dysfunction and my doctor told me my eardrums were sucked in.  Whatever treatment (antibiotics i think)  did not solve anything.  It has been many years now.  I am 27. Could the structures of my inner ear be damaged?    This will affect my career so it's pretty important I figure out why my hearing changes when I do this.   In a normal state without popping my ears, I pass all hearing tests with flying colors.  I do not have any measurable hearing loss for my age. However, popping my ears yields such a dramatic difference in the high frequencies that I'm sure there is something wrong.  What could be going on and how do I keep my hearing 'better' as it is when I pop my ears?  Does this happen to everyone?  Is it a temporary pressure increase that puts more pressure on the chochlea and activates different nerve cells?  I'm really interested to figure out why this is and which way i am supposed to hear.  The difference is night and day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Proaudiohd,  Likely, what is happening is that your ear drums are normally retracted (sucked in) due to the Eustachian tube dysfunction not letting the air inside the middle ear equalize pressures with the outside atmosphere.  When this happens, the pressure differences keep the ear drum tighter than it should be, causing its ability to move with sound to be diminished.  When you clear your tubes you are likely freeing the ear drum and allowing it to move normally until the pressures are again returned to unequal.  I would suggest you see an ear, nose, and throat specialist to have this evaluated.  I do not think that this is some permanent structural damage since your hearing gets better when you clear your Eustachian tubes.  There may be a treatment that can help resolve this situation for you.  One possible treatment you may want to talk to your doctor about is using a nasal steroid for a little while.  Sometimes the Eustachian tubes become inflamed (from allergies or various other reasons).  Using the nasal steroids helps relieve the inflammation and resulting swelling allowing the tubes to function normally.  This may help in your case and has very minimal side effects so it is not likely to be dangerous even if it doesn't help.  I've done this with a few of my patients with similar issues and it has helped dramatically.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks, I will try that.    Since my eardrums have been sucked inwards for many years and their movement restricted somewhat.. Could you say that my ears have endured less intense movement than someone my age with normal eustachian tube function?    Theoretically could this have been providing a layer of protection against noise related hearing loss (concerts, loud machinery etc) versus if my eardrums were free to move as they should have?  That would be pretty nice.   I will try the nasal steroid and see if it helps open things up.\n\n",

    "content": "Just an update..   I have tried nasal steroids.  It has improved the function of my eustachian tubes..They now equalize much more readily.  However, I still have the issue of my hearing improving vastly when i forcibly pressurize my inner ear.  The improvement is very dramatic, and it goes away as soon as the artificially high pressure equalizes back to normal..which now happens much faster thanks to the steroids and the freely flowing eustachian tubes.    I am starting to think there is some kind of obstruction that I am 'lifting' my eardrums off when I pressurize them, allowing them to move freely all of a sudden.  When the pressure goes back down via the eustachian tubes, it seems as though the eardrums are returning to rest against whatever it is, and the movement is dampened again.   I've been reading about the long term effects of retracted eardrums such as pockets of dead skin forming on and behind the eardrum, preventing proper movement.  See also Cholesteatoma.   I think its time to see an ENT !\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Why does my hearing get better when I pop my ears?",
    "content": "I went and saw an ENT specialist.  I had a hearing test both normally, and with myself artificially pressurizing my inner ear. Both tests showed completely normal hearing.  However, the difference I notice is in the higher frequencies and their test only went up to 8k.    The ENT determined that I have no hearing loss in the frequencies they could test, and everything appears fine physically.   She told me that everyone's frequency response will change slightly as a result of over or under-pressurization of the inner ear.  Her suggestion was that my sound job just led me to be more aware of these changes that other people would ignore.  She also suggested I take an antihistamine to reduce any possible inflammation of my eustachian tube tissues.    I am not convinced though.  When in noisy situations such as a loud resturaunt or bar, I cannot understand conversations at the same distances that other people can.  However, if I pop my ears and hold the pressure artificially high, I can hear everything very, very clearly.  Sounds immediately localize better and they are more detailed.  I can discern one person talking against all the other people in the room very readily.  But as soon as I swallow and the pressure equalizes back out, my high frequency detail goes away and I can't hear the people close to me as well.  The same is true for music, falling water, or rushing air.  The difference is very very strong, and focused entirely in the high frequencies.  I am only a human, so I cannot have superhuman hearing when I hold high pressure behind my ears.. Therefore I must have reduced hearing at a normal state.  Perhaps from noise damage?  If that is true, how can those frequencies suddenly come alive with a shift in eardrum position? I'm still searching for an answer..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello my name is Austin and im 16. Last year i had my tonsils removed because they were infected pretty severely. I mention this in regards to the lumps i now have in my throat. I remember having my lymph nodes swollen in my neck due to my infectious tonsils, but what i most recently remember is that they were sore. So back to my problem, i noticed some hard lumps in my upper neck/under jaw(hard to describe where) about 2-3 months ago. I thought i must be getting sick again. But i never really got a cold or anything. And i never really noticed until now that these lumps are not that sore at all. I have one lump that was the first i ever found that seems like it may have grown a little smack dab in the middle of my jaw/upper throat that if i tilt my head up you can see it pretrude a little out of the skin. I have recently noticed a couple smaller lumps forming around the region. What concerns me the most is i have been chewing tobacco for two years, maybe a can a week, not sure how much this could play in affect. So I am increasingly concerned as i find more little bumps, but i am not sick. I stopped chewing for a few weeks but could not kick it and i am still chewing today. I am hoping that someone may have some answers about what these lumps could be?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hard Lumps under my jaw/neck for 2-3 months",
    "content": "It is good that you are concerned and are watching these areas. Of course, a primary concern should be for occult cancerous process especially w the history of chewing tobacco. These could just be acne type though they don't sound it, or saliva glands that are working extra hard to make saliva especially to clear the toxic tobacco juices from your mouth and throat. These glands are under your chin, lower sides of both cheeks above and below the jawline and they drain inot the cheek mucosal surface on the inside where your molars are. Sometimes massaging these areas where the glnds are will relieve some of the pressure built up in these glands from extra saliva and will make them empty some of the saliva into your mouth or at the very least help w the discomfort. Most importantly they could be lymph nodes totally unrelated to the saliva but much more to the job that they are supposed to be doing and that is to drain and localize all the infectious materials from our blood, skin in the region from which they drain, or they could be enlarged lymph nodes from a more serious cancerous source but much less likely hopefully given the tobacco history and the chewing history. Make sure there are no skin or mucous surface ulcers or sores in the gums, ,inner chheeks everywhere as these may be cancerous or precancerous or certainly at least adding to the lymph nodes being swollen to try to control the infectious drainage from these areas. Most importantly, get to your main primary care doctor asap and get an exam of these swollen areas, your mouth where the practitioner should use gloved hand to examine and use pressure also to feel for any hidden lumps in the inside of the cheeks and thruough the walls of the cheeks, gums, etc. Also, the practitioner will most likely also want to lab testing such as cell blood count (cbc) w differential and serum chemistry labs as well as liver lab tests possibly a monotest  though very unlikely given your history. These tests should help us decide if we wnat to do more expansive deeper testing and exams to illict the cause of your lumps and determine the treatment if any is needed. Antibiotics for 10-14 days might also be a good trial treatment while awaiting followup of the tests just to be sure we are eliminating the possibilty of some type of skin, neck, gum, gland infection. These are just suggestions and very thorough workup which may even include chest xary, Cat Scan (CT) of your sinuses but again these are just suggestions and points to consider. DONOT, I repeat DONOT be panicked that I mention cancer as a potential cause because that is something that we must always keep in the back of our mind not the first thing and as such nothing that we cannot face and even overcome sometimes even w very little treatment.  So, keep your chin up and get to your doctor soon, get to a immediate med/urgentcare setting in between if you're truly panicked but just remember that they are just a reassurance and you realy need a complete exam by a doctor who knows your whole history and is skilled in the diagnosis and treatment of this what appears to be actually a common symptom and finding that usually has a benign or very simple, safe cause and can be easily treated and the treatment can even begin in the urgent care if you desire w antibitotics even before your primary care doctor appt. Hope this helps set you off on the right road to addressing your problem and I commend you for being so observant and concerned a person and best of wishes!\n\n",

The area directly in front of my ear is puffed out and I cannot lay on it or touch it as it hurts just way too much. The pressure in my ear is just unbelievable. I have been taking Aleve and it is helping with my fever but not the pain or swelling. I have a high tolerance for pain and this is starting to really worry me.

    "title": "Re: ear infection is getting worse with antibiotics & drops",
    "content": "Hello -  The infection may not actually be in your ear since the swelling in your face is actually over the temporomandibular joint by now. This could be extended from an ear infection but seems more likely caused by either a cystic gland near the ear, or perhaps even an abcessed tooth. It's difficult to tell without being able to see the site, inside your ear, etc. I think a whole area exam is warranted at this point, as the antibiotic you're on  doesn't appear to be making much headway, and you may require something stronger, or even some slightly invasive procedure to drain this infection. These can often be confused between the ear, a tooth, a sinus or a gland, since so much is contained in such a small yet deep area of the head.   I'd definitely call or go back and let the doctor know this isn't improving but is, in fact getting significantly worse. You can't afford to let something like this just go and hope it will improve on its own. Hopefully a change in antibiotic will do the trick, at least in the short run. Later you may require some minor surgery to keep this from happening again, depending upon where the source of the problem actually lies.  I hope this is helpful. Best of  luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I'm not sure if I'm in the right forum but this is where my symptoms started 3 months ago. I'm 36 year-old female, previously healthy who has been taking preventative antibiotics (for recurrent UTIs) for 6 months.  About 3 months ago I started getting sharp stabbing pains in my neck. Shortly afterwards the glands in my neck became swollen and I had frequent sore throats and fatigue. I then developed what I can describe as ear pain/ear fullness which makes me feel slightly deaf. I went to see my GP who thought it might be an infection in the eustachian tube and prescribed antibiotics. I did not get any better and in fact started feeling slightly worse.  I went back to see my GP and he said it might be glandular fever so sent me off for a few blood tests. All came back fine apart from slight anaemia and advised me to take some iron tablets.  A few weeks later I had awful pains at the back of my neck/head which referred needle-like pains all over my head. I went to casualty but as I didn't have a temperature or unusual blood pressure sent me home with painkillers.  The headaches/neck pains persisted and I then developed burning stinging pains in my elbows that has left me with aching heavy arms. I also have this in my knees (heavy legs when walking up stairs).  I went back to my GP (who is baffled by my symptoms and is now tired of seeing me) who had no idea who to refer me to for further diagnostic tests - an ENT? neurologist? rheumatologist? orthopedics?   I'm seeing a chiropractor to help relieve my symptoms but her opinion is that my nervous system is not working well.  My lymph glands in my neck are so swollen that I think this is causing ear pain and problems swallowing? They have been swollen for 3 months.  Can you help me please? I'd appreciate any advice you can give. Many thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swollen lymph nodes, ear pain, swallowing problems, headache",
    "content": "Hello -  Naturally my first thought was mononucleosis (glandular fever), but since that was ruled out, given the precise description of your symptoms, I'm concerned you may have either a walled-off glandular infection or possibly viral meningitis. Either could persist without a fever, espcecially a trapped infection encapsulated in a parotid gland. However, with the addition of the newer neurological symptoms it brings us back to possible meningitis, probably viral (if it's that at all). Something is certainly infected, and it is begining to infiltrate tissues beyond the original site. Since the neurological symptoms have progressed along with the local symptoms I can't help but suspect an abcess-like  infection or viral meningitis. The latter would likely have run a more rapid course; an abcess may only have local heat and discomfort, but could eventually spread and turn into meningitis.   Someone needs to do some really thorough lab work to diagnose this. It may require an MRI of the local site and maybe the brain as well. This can't be allowed to simply continue, and the argument for infection as at least the underlying cause is pretty strong, I think.  I hope this is helpful. Best  of luck to you and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Lingering Swollen Throat w/ White Spots",
    "content": "OK, so sorry if this is long winded.  Week one: I went to the clinic for a swollen throat - after the initial examination, the Dr. diagnosed me w/ strep (although he did not do a culture).  He put me on Cefaclor (?).  After three days my symptoms got worse and I developed white spots on the back of my throat.  Other than being extremely tired, I really had no other symptoms (no fever).   After a week, I went back to the Dr.  Based on the lingering throat that did not respond to medication and the constant fatigue, he thought I had mono so he did a blood test.  To be sure it wasn't baterial related, he put me on Levaquin until the mono test results came back.  I got the test results back, no mono.  After four more days (and a week an a half into this), there was no change in fatigue or the swollen thoat w/ white spots.  I went back to the Dr.  By this time, I had small bumps on one side of my stomach which was diagnosed as Shingles.  The Dr. decided to retest me for mono thinking the virus hadn't developed enough from at the point I was tested the first time.  So he ran more blood work for mono and diagnosed me with shingles.  I was prescibed Valtrex for the shingles.  A day later, the second mono test was negative.(and other cell count levels were normal)   Its been another week and I'm part in to week three of this fiasco. The shingles bumps are gone, however, my throat is still still swollen and the white spots are still there.  I went back to the Dr. for the fourth time today and he is clueless.  He has referred me to a Ear, Nose & Throat Specialist, who can not see me for six weeks.  My primary care Dr. has told me to continue another 15 days of Valtrex and take Levaquin for another week and see what happens until I can get in to the specialist.  I'm frustrated.  Any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lingering Swollen Throat w/ White Spots",
    "content": "Hi there-  Your frustration is understandable. You've been subjected to the \"shotgun\" approach to treating something that wasn't diagnosed properly the first time. You very likely do have shingles, and since this lives in your body even when dormant, it can manifest in almost any area. The throat lesions are probably related to it, which means the Levaquin won't do any good (and wouldn't against shingles anyway). However, shingles is not only painful where there are lesions, but can make a person feel pretty lousy in general at times, and these outbreaks can last a long time. Valtrex should help push this into submission if it is one of the more common types, but since it was already well underway by the time that was started, it could take a while for it to become effective. It can help suppress future outbreaks, but it's not as effective with outbreaks that have already gotten a good start.  It's a shame the ENT wasn't able to see you for such a long time,  as it's fairly likely the throat lesions will have resolved by that time. At least I hope they do. If they don't you may have something else going on, but it certainly does seem to be viral.   My best suggestion (which you may have already done on your own) would be to ask the ENT's front office people if they would notify you if an earlier appointment becomes available, as once the throat problem goes away it will be very difficult to tell what it may have been -- unless it recurs sometime in the future.  I hope this is of some help to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Why does my nose smell... toxic? Eww...",
    "content": "I am a 25 year old female.  I DO have asthma (diagnosed in 2007-ish)  I take the following medications (I am a walking pharmacy) : Inderal 60 mg WellbutrinXL 300mg Seroquel 100-400mg Biotin 5000mg Hair/skin/Nails vitamins Phentermine 37mg (45 lbs and still losing!) Singulair 10mg Xoponex inhaler (I can't ever remember to use this) Symbicort Inhaler (I can't ever remember to use this, either) Orthotricyclen (I stopped taking this about 2 months ago)  For the past 3 or so months, I've had this really horrible smell in my nose. I don't know how to describe it, except to say it's sort of infection-smelling. It's a strong, sharp smell... kind of ferment-ish, or like... rot (I know that's gross, but I don't know how else to describe it). It's so bad at times that I stay paranoid that other people smell me, and it turns my stomach (I've gotten more used to it, though, lately, since it's decided not to go away). My mother swears that she can't smell it, but it doesn't make me feel better. It started about 3 months ago. It just sort of showed up and hung around for a few weeks. It went away for a few weeks, and then came back every 2 or 3 days. For the past month or so, it's been there pretty constantly. About 3 or 4 weeks ago, I went to my physician and told her that I thought perhaps I had a sinus infection due to the yucky smell in my nose (but I didn't feel bad, or have pressure on my face or headaches or anything). She prescribed an antibiotic, which I took as prescribed. The smell didn't go away, though. It's still here, and it's just awful.   The last couple of weeks, I've had some minor sinus drainage, but it's not bad (it doesn't cause me to cough or clear my throat constantly or bother me or choke me, etc... I really don't notice it).  If it helps any (and this may be more info than you need), I've also had other weird things going on, too. For example, for the past 2 or 3 years, my nose runs when I eat (almost 90% of the time). It's funny... like clockwork, when I start eating, my nose will run and I usually spend most of my meals wiping and dapping and rubbing my nose with a napkin or kleenex (which also bothers me, because there are a lot of people who think blowing your nose at the table is rude...) I told my physician this a while back, and she just sort of laughed. I really think she thought I was just joking or something... so I didn't mention it again. I figured maybe it wasn't anything bad... just me being paranoid or something. AND- quite often when I lean over, water comes rushing out of my nose, even if my nose hasn't been running or anything. If I reach down to pick something up off the ground or on a low shelf or such, it's like a faucet has  been turned on in my head and it just pours out of my nose. It doesn't look (for lack of better words) snot-ish or phlegm-ish. It is clear and has the same texture consistency of water. It makes me feel super gross, though...  What in the world could this smell in my nose be, and what do I need to do to get rid of it? I'm tired of worrying that other people smell me and think I stink... and it's rather unnerving when you have a infection/rot smell in your nose (I know that sounds gross, but I don't know how else to describe it... sorry).  Thanks in advance for any help :)\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Why does my nose smell... toxic? Eww...",
    "content": "Hi there -  You need to have a CT scan of your sinuses and a consult with an ENT specialist. It sounds very much as though you have a blocked deep sinus, probably infected as well. The smell you describe is fairly typical of this, as is the \"pouring\" of fairly clear, watery mucus in certain circumstances (and especially when the head is tipped forward). By the way, for those who feel blowing one's nose at the table is rude, I wonder what they would think if you didn't blow your nose at the table  when it was appropriate. I know, it's pretty much a no-win for you.   You may need to have your sinuses irrigated, may require antibiotics prescribed, and may even (possibly) require surgery, eventually, to correct this problem if none of the simpler measures work.   Everything you describe actually does fit with a deep sinus blockage. These often don't present the same way the more superficial sinus infections do (often no pain when pressing on the face, no headaches, often even no fever). This is what makes these so problematic. People assume there's no sinus involvement. There may, in fact, not be, but I'd be willing to bet that's exactly what's going on.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us and  keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   This is more likely to be an enlarged lymph node but direct clinical examination is essential for confirmation.  Following ear, throat, gum, dental or sinus inflammation or infection, the draining lymph nodes especially those in the upper side of the neck become enlarged, painful and tender.   When inflammation subsides, or after adequate course of antibiotics, they should regress in size but never to normal size. Thus when you have another attack of infection or inflammation they regrow and become painful again.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor after proper examination, he may prescribe you an antibiotic treatment accordingly.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Feeling hot all the time & excessive sweating - tonsils?",
    "content": "Hello -  While I doubt your tonsillectomy had any bearing on your symptoms (you were having this before and still have it afterward), there are plenty of other things to be ruled out. You could have a form of autonomic nervous dystem dysfunction which is causing your body to keep itself warmer than necessary (dysautonomia), then there is that matter of the thyroid exam which did show something abnormal but was dismissed as not significant. This puzzles me, since the first thing one would think of, on reading of your symptoms, is to rule out hyperthyroidism. If there are nodules on the thyroid and/or swelling of this gland, it is entirely possible you're suffering from an excess of thyroxin. I don't understand how this set of symptoms along with thyroid nodules can be seen as \"not significant.\" It may not be the case, but this does need to be ruled out first.   Dysautonomia is a more difficult thing to diagnose, often becoming a default diagnosis once organic disease has been eliminated. Raynaud's phenomenon can also cause this sort of derangement, although it usually manifests as cold, blanched extremities (fingers, toes, tip of the nose, etc.), followed later by flushing and warmth in those areas.   All these things need to be considered in a differential diagnosis. If your doctor doesn't grasp the degree of your discomfort, it may be time for a second opinion. I would definitely persue this, as it's obviously not normal and is causing you a great deal of distress, both social and physical.   I hope this is of some help to you. If you have any other information to add, please do. Otherwise, stay in touch and let us know how things unfold, at least.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While  tinnitus is frequently treated as a \"natural\" annoyance and the patient told \"get used to it\", it is, in reality, a symptom, not a condition, and  if the underlying cause can be found and eliminated or treated, it often can be relieved or at least managed successfully.   While the  pitch problem is one I haven't heard specifically before, I am familiar with cases of tinnitus associated with various sorts of perversions  of normal hearing, so this one isn't especially surprising. The important thing is to get to the bottom of the cause (and the potential causes are far too many to list here) and treat it. This is espcially important  given your chosen  area of profession.   Some of the more simple causes are use of aspirin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, caffeine, nicotine, excessive salt in the diet, a number of prescription drugs, etc. There are a lot more of these, as well as many more physical (medical) causes.   Seeing an otolaryngologist would probably be the best starting point for you. While the MRI certainly ruled out certain things, there are plenty of others that wouldn't show up via that route. It could be something very simple.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female, I was diagnosed with Hypothyroidism approximately 3 weeks after I was born in 1980. I have managed it well throughout my life by taking Synthroid or the generic, Levothyroxin daily and have never had any issues. About 3 months ago I found a lump about the size of a dime on the left side of my neck, about where the submandibular node is located (I found a chart of the nodes on another website to give you a more accurate location). It does not seem to have gotten bigger but throughout the day it does become sore and by nighttime, it starts to throb. If you push against it it does move around a little, but not much. Sometimes it does make it harder to swallow food but not to the point where it is effecting what or how much I can eat. I should also mention that since I have found this lump, I have experienced more headaches than I normally have. They seem to start in my face and then work their way up to my forehead and the top half of my head.  I have done some research on the web over the past few weeks hoping it would go away and I would not have to see a doctor because I do not have insurance but it has not. I've found different diagnoses such as lymphoma or thyroid cancer but I'm REALLY hoping that it is something simpler. I should add that my mother passed away in 2005 from complications of Multiple Sclerosis but I have not had any symptoms that would point to that. I would really like a medical opinion and if you think I should go to my GP or an endocrinologist. Your help is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

However, it also could be an inflamed lymph node or nodal cyst. Either a cyst or some sort of parathyroid growth could account for the symptoms, although I am inclined to lean toward the likelihood of an inflamed or congested lymph node.   There is nothing here to suggest any remote relation to MS.   I would strongly suggest you see either your GP or an internist first, with possible referral to an endocrinologist, but this latter probably won't be necessary, especially if the lump can be identified as a lymph node or cyst.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us advised of what you find out.\n\n",

    "content": "About two years ago I went to an ENT doctor because I had a chronic sore throat and loss of voice.  He diagnosed me with a vocal polyp, which I was able to treat through a year of voice therapy.  The voice therapy reduced the size of the polyp to the point the doctor said surgery was unnecessary.  All was fine for about 6 months then I started having sore throats again.  I went back and was told they could not see anything wrong, which I confirmed with a second doctor.  They told me it was due to acid reflex which was one of the causes for my polyp in the first place.  So I changed my diet, stopped eating before bed, starting taking Zantax (over the counter acid reflex medicine), and did a 2 week cycle of Prilosec.  But I still wake up every night because my throat hurts so much and then it lingers until I go to bed.  It's definitely worse in the mornings and then gradually gets better as the day progresses.  It is also extremely painful when I exercise and start breathing heavily.  I drink water to try and keep my throat lubricated, but nothing seems to be helping.  I have had the same sore throat on and off at varying degrees of intensity for about a year.  Is there a possible cause for this besides acid reflex?  Could this be cause be stress or a sign of a bigger problem?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic sore throat & Vocal Polyp",
    "content": "Hello -  The problem is probably still acid reflux (this is always worse at night because the patient is horizontal and stomach contents can move up into the esophagus and over the glottis, where it gets aspirated and can damage the vocal cords and can also cause exercise-induced asthma). While any more serious cause of the symtpoms also needs to be ruled out, the greatest likelihood is this is secondary to reflux. Quite often over-the-counter (OTC) medication will work, but the problem has to be evaluated over time, and it may require a more potent,  prescription medication if this is what's causing this. You'll probably do best seeing an ENT specialist who can confirm the cause, which could well rule out anything more serious (and this is serious enough, but I understand what you mean). It already sounds as though you've got the stage set for exercise-induced asthma,  or at least a very serious  exercise-related reflux problem. There is now a remarkable little device that can be placed in the esophagus to measure the amount of acid and the conditions  under which it comes up, which can be very helpful in coming up with a treatment plan. The problem usually is due to the lower esophageal sphincter (ring of muscle around  the  bottom of the esophagus where it empties into the stomach) doesn't work, and there are new, non-invasive ways of fixing this if it's extreme.   The best way to rule out anything more serious would be  to have a complete upper GI workup for GERD (gastric espohpageal reflux disease) and have it treated professionally instead of on your own using OTC medications. The complcations can be serious, so you don't want to let this go, hoping it may fix itself. It won't.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to an urgent care center last week because i was feeling dizzy (more along the lines of disorientation, rather than spinning, etc). the nurse practitioner diagnosed me with swimmers ear and prescribed otic ear drops for 7 days, twice a day. although, the nurse practitioner did not that my ears were very red and irritated, but not necessarily infected (no swelling, or puss leakage). anyway, i recently finished up the 7 days of ear drops, and now it seems like the disorientation feeling (things seeming like they are off or not normal) is back. i felt fine when i was still doing the drops twice a day.   I am worried that the infection isn't getting better, or that it might be something more serious. i did have an ear infection a couple of years ago and went through the same process of taking drops, and it seemed to have cleared up. not sure what is going on this time around though.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your ear infection sounds as though it is still active and of course this can affect balance and cause dizziness as well as a full feeling in the head with associated \"weird\" sensations including derealization. Since this has happened before and is not really getting better this time, you may need to see an otolaryngologist (ear, nose and throat specialist, ENT), in order to get this properly cleared up.   In the meantime, have you tried any of the over-the-counter anti-dizziness and nausea medications such as Dramamine (Non-drowsy Formula -- generic name meclizine)? If this works it would not only pin down the focus of the problem, but would also manage it for you til the problem can be addressed medically.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It may last a few minutes or up to a couple of hours. I have not been eating anything different or taking any other medications. Nothing has changed that I can think of. We have had the air in our home checked and all is normal. A couple of months ago I spent 5 days in the hospital with what was finally determined a viral infection. I ran a low grade fever for nearly 3 weeks. However, there was no dizziness involved at that time. A full body catscan showed nothing as well as numerous blood tests. The last dizzy spell was today-severe. I could hardly walk and sweating heavily.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sporadic dizzy spells",
    "content": "Hello -  I am going to assume the dizziness you describe is just that, and not lightheadedness nor faintness, but more like a disabling spinning sensation. Please correct me if I'm wrong.  Assuming the above is correct, it would seem you're having frequent bouts of what's known as benign positional vertigo (BPV). While it is benign (not life-threatening) it can be very disabling while it's happening. Movement of the head (turning or looking  upward), bending down, and  other changes of position can all trigger the episodes, and it frequently happens upon waking and trying to get out of bed.   There are over-the-counter medications which can often manage this if it is chronic, usually caused by an inner ear problem (inflammation, usually viral in  origin, of the labyrinth). Because of the frequency and severity of the episodes, I'd suggest you be seen by a doctor to be certain this is garden variety BPV, and if so, meclizine (as Dramamine -- Non-drowsy Formula or its generic) can be very effective. This can also be prescribed (as Antivert or the generic). The drug has very few side-effects and works well in most cases.   I hope this is helpful to you. If my assumption about dizziness vs. faintness is not correct, please let me know.  I'd definitely have a doctor do a quick exam to be certain this is BPV, and if  so, it should be fairly easy to manage. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Many people are extremely sensitive to such environmental insults and there may not be a known condition such as documented allergy, but your body is trying to tell you something and the best thing for you to do is avoid the offender.  I know of a man who must avoid all such odors, aerosols and pollutants and it is difficult for him.    Explain to those around you that you are very sensitive to these things and that you need to avoid them.  People who care about you will try to accommodate I'm sure.    If your doctor feels a tonsillectomy is in order, there is probably a good reason - perhaps they are inflamed or infected (thus, antibiotic treatment).  If he believes you might benefit from this it is probably worth it and while there area always risks associated with any surgery, it is a small risk and the benefits are likely to outweigh the risks.  Don't be afraid to ask the doctor whatever questions you have to be confident this is the right course.  Ask what he hopes to accomplish with the surgery, how it might be aggravating your condition and what alternative treatments he would suggest.  Then make your decision with confidence.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As a result my neck and throat was incredibly sore, i was barely able to talk later that night i was whispering for the most part. I went to see my doctor about a week after, my voice I would say is normal for the most part except when I sing and try to hit a high note, my voice would start to give out. The doctor said he did not see anything wrong with my throat and that I had just bruised my vocal cords and that I should be fine. My throat still does hurt though when I tilt my head upwards and swallow. It hasn't gotten worse but it doesn't seem like it has gotten better. I am just wondering how long throat trauma usually takes to heal, so that when i swallow i shouldnt be feeling any pain.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Retenton cysts, Haller Cells and Marked deviated septum",
    "content": "Hello -  Not to worry, at least no more than you would about the known proclivity for sinus infections. The cyst is formed by mucus trapped in a sinus cavity (in this case one resting upon the maxillary structure); Haller cells are just abnormal (but benign) cells that form beneath the orbit of the eye, usually due to repeated sinus infections. These all tend to worsen sinus ventilation and drainage, which only contributes, as you unfortunately know, to more and more severe sinus infections which, in turn, creates more likelihood of cysts and cells and symptoms which sprng from blocked sinuses.   The deviated septum, often present from birth, just as often due to trauma, only adds to the impeded flow and drainage. All of these things (or as many as are appropriate) can be corrected by surgery or treated symptomatically, depending on the individual patient.   Again, nothing new to worry about, just all things which help to explain why you have such severe and frequent sinus infections. Hopefully this can now be corrected to some degree.   Best of luck to you. I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi 39 yo suffered allergies and asthma entire life. Parents left me untreated for both. At age 30 1998 had severe infection ( frontal sinus) surgery 18 months later.Until this point I grew up thinking my constant runny nose etc was \"normal\". Recovery after surgery, sensitive sinus for approx 1 year post op. 2002 I was feeling great.... Oct 2007 ( In Australia) instead of usual spring/summer sneezes it turned constant, severe post nasal drip, vertigo, deafness in my \"bad side\"/right side. Feeling like constant flu, head cold burning and runny nose like water. By Jan 2008 developed swelling below right maxilliary I thought was a tooth abcess....two sets of xrays revealed nothing but whatever this is puts pressure on an upper tooth ( like nerve pain) below my right sinus area. CT scan in Jan and March this year show nothing except thickening of the lining on the right side ( bottom) sinus area which I was told is normal. Swelling continued to swell and can feel it above my tooh extending across the bottom of my cheek and on the maxilliary bone ( bottom end). This was not visible to the doctor but feels predominantly swollen to me. April started to develop what appeared to be a blister on that same location above my upper tooth and what appeared to be coming from under the maxilliary area. this blister appears to fill with fluid on and off through the day. It DID disappear for approximately 2 months this year but has now returned....making my face ache afwully on the right side and my sinus area not to mention pain and right side headache. The Doctor says it's not in the sinus area on the CT and face scan. The dentist says it's up way too high to even show up on my teeth xrays. Numerous thorough blood tests show nothing. Recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia and Chronic Fatigue I am certain these effects are closely related to how awful my sinus is. Please need some advice on how I should attack this \"blister\" and swelling if it's not on a CT scan, xray or blood tests....It's like...nobody wants to \"own it\"...and i'm left feeling miserable. I wonder why the blister and swelling temporarily appeared to go away. We are in our first part of spring here, thought maybe it's entirely related to my sinus regardles of what the CT says...my right side sinus feels very BAD....often have to sleep it off.

    "content": "Hello Jen -  Clearly there is something bad going on in the maxillofacial area. It's amazing no one can visualize it, but the signs and symptoms  should speak for themselves. I strongly suspect you have, perhaps as a result of the old surgery, something on the order of a fistula between one of your sinuses and the root canal of a tooth. It does happen, usually because of some trauma to the facial bones, and would explain both the nasal and periodontal/dental complaints. I can't imagine why this wouldn't show up on CT, but since it hasn't I feel fairly certain an MRI of the affected area would show up what a CT has been unable to.   Have you been treated with antibiotics? The signs and symptoms, as I said before, should guide the therapy, since these things can be observed if not clinically proven.   I hope this is of some help, although it isn't much. Best of luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope someone can shed some light.  June 9 2008 - I had a sore throat, I thought I caught something from my recent plane ride. The walk-in doctor checked my throat and noticed a lump on my uvula. They took blood (CBC, Ferritin, THC?) & throat swab-all came back normal. But they still prescribed Azithromyacin. Sore throat went away.  June 13 2008 - Noticed my left ear was blocked and I couldn't release the pressure, I was feeling my neck and noticed the swollen lymph node. Went back to walk-in and they said its a reactive node. However they were concerned that the node didn't hurt or wasn't painful to the touch. They looked in my left ear and couldn't see anything wrong. They told me to come back if other nodes pop up. July 31 2008 - Lymph node still enlarged, went to my family doctor. was sent for Ultrasound which showed slight enlargment but not large enough to be concerned about. Family doc made appointment for ENT. Appointment is at end of Sept. Aug 26 2008 - in the a.m. I had an allergy attack began sneezing like crazy and then i blew my nose, right after my right ear was blocked. Every sound from my right ear sounded tinny/robotic. Went to bed and awoke to a high-pitched tone in my head that sounded like a t.v. station that had gone off the air. The sound has not subsided in 4 days. I notice it more at night when trying to sleep. My questions are... 1. Is it normal for a lymph node to stay enlarged for 3 months? 2. Is it possible that the lump on my uvula is cancerous and that is why the lymphnode on the left side only is swollen and because my lymph node is swollen its pushing against my eustacian tube and creating the pressure problem? 3. Can an ultrasound tell if a lymph node is cancerous? 4. What can I do to stop the ear noise on the right side? 5. After hearing about my issues what tests should I make sure to ask the ENT for?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Having read your post, I'll try to answer your questions in order. Here goes:  1) Yes, once a lymph node is enlarged it can sometimes remain that way for a good long time. I don't know what accounts for this, but it does happen. It may shrink some, then stop while  still larger than it was.   2) It is highly unlikely the lump on your uvula is malignant. I don't know what it might be, but it was associated with a sore throat which responded to a potent antibiotic (never mind it was odd that your doctor prescribed it even though all the cultures were negative -- still, it seems to have worked).   3) An ultrasound cannot detect malignancies, but can only visualize abnormal growths, masses, formations, etc.   4) Tinnitus is  sometimes a very stubborn symptom. It is poorly understood and there is usually little that can be done to make it go away, but it usually will in time, especially if it is set off by a pharyngeal infection or allergic reaction, which seems to be the case this time.  5) The only thing I can think of you might want to ask the ENT for other than to suggest you might benefit from an allergy test to rule out some chronic irritant.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

While it would seem, on the face of it, to be simple tonsillitis, the fact that it's recurring this way after antibiotic therapy may mean it is atypical thrush or Vincent's angina (again, atypical), and in either case would require a different  kind of medication most likely. Then again, if it is simply a very stubborn tonsillitis, a change of antibiotic would probably be in order.  In any case, you really should get it re-checked and definitely it should be cultured.

    "content": "Doc,  Last week I started a sore throat, I thought it was very usual since I had, had this happen before. It started to hurt when I swallowed food, or even water. I felt my neck and my lymph nods were swollen. I still have had this before and figured it would be gone in a day or two. Well, two days later, I started to get head aches and  my ears are a little sore. When I went to sleep that night, I woke up with a Blazing fever, I was sweating everywhere but at the same time I was freezing. I decided to try and sleep with a bag of ice on my forehead. Couple hours went by with no sleep and I had to run to the restroom, with diarrhea. Next night, same thing happened but this time I woke up got some water and threw it all up, it just wouldn't stay down. SO here I am the morning of and feeling terrible. I have been taking Multi Vitamins, Chloraseptic Spray, Emergen-c, gargling with salt water, all of which just numbs the pain, but no help on fighting the virus. Im guessing the next step is the doctors office..?  BL\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  If it were me I guarantee my next stop would be the doctor's office. It sounds as though you have either an enterovirus (in which case you can only treat the symptoms) or an acute bacterial infection which has cascaded down into your digestive system. If this is the case antibiotics might help and in either case a doctor is best able to determine which and how to best treat it. If this is a viral infection it will run its course and your best bet is to find out what will most effectively treat the symptoms so you can rest and recover. If it turns out to be bacterial, your doctor will need to prescribe the appropriate antibiotic in order to make sure it clears up. In either case you must make sure you remain adquately hydrated and get plenty of rest, but by all means yes, do see a doctor at once.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have multiple hard lumps spread out over my head, all on the right side though. They are not painful and do not worry me. However I do have one small, pea-sized bump on my head, about half way between my right ear the the center of the back of my head that hurts. I noticed it first about 2 years ago, and it wasn't a lump at that time, it was just a spot where if I touched it, sent a shooting pain up to the top of my head. over the past two years though it has grown. I've been to a couple doctors, one ENT and one Neurologist. The ENT said that maybe it's my muscle. The Neurologist couldn't really feel it (it is not hard like a rock, but moveable) and said that since it wasn't on my brain he isn't worried. Sometimes it causes a dull pain without my touching it, but if I touch it, it causes a shooting pain up to the top of my head. I don't know who else to talk to, or what it could be. Any ideas? Is it something I should stop worrying about? Like I said, I have other, much bigger, harder bumps, but they aren't painful, so they odn't worry me, this only worries me because of how much it hurts when touched. Thank You.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Painful lump on head",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sound like cysts, either sebaceous ones (a dermatological problem) or ganglion cysts (a less problematic but more mysterious thing). Neither is serious, but if the bumps are due to sebaceous glands getting stopped up this  will eventually cause problems. Ganglions  are most common on the  wrist, but can also form on or near other joints and on the scalp as well. They don't usually require any treatment, unless, of course, one winds up resing on a nerve, which is what it sounds like  has happened with one of the bumps on your head, the painful one.   I'd see a dermatologist to try and find out what's  causing these, if it is sufficiently bothersome.  If not, and you can live with them, these bumps seem to be doing very little harm except for the one that's  painful to the touch. (Maybe don't touch it?).  I hopw this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dizzy after \"Follow my fingure test\" by Hearing Dr.",
    "content": "Hello -  I find it extremely odd and probably annoying (for you, at least) that a doctor performing this simple and common test would not explain why he did it or what it was for. When one suffers from vertigo it is most often what is known as benign positional vertigo (BPV), which causes a characteristic eyeball \"bounce\" to one side or the other, when the eyes follow the examiner's finger. This bounce (the eyeballs do literally seem to bounce like  rubber balls when they reach the far left or right reach) is considered good news as a rule. It is called nystagmus and also goes with nausea sometimes, as well as other disturbances of equilibrium. It is usually rooted in a temporary thickening of the fluid in the inner ear's labyrinth (labyrinthitis), generally caused by a viral infection but sometimes for other equally benign reasons as well (ie: poor hydration). The  \"follow my finger\" test is a great way to ascertain the patient is most likely suffering from benign vertigo and can then be prescribed a medication to help offset the vertigo til the problem resolves on its own.   There can be also primary, intrinsic causes of vertigo in some individuals, but usually it is just an occasional occurrence which (as you no doubt know) can be temporarily disabling at times. Still, it is  most often harmless (so long as one doesn't fall and sustain an injury on the way down).   I hope this helps and that your future VA experiences involve better communication. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Never recovered 100% from it. One eye smaller, numbness in nose and lip area since bells palsy.   I had extreme pain in the bone behind ear, but this is like the eustacian tube area not the bone AS IN THE BELLS PALSY.

    "title": "Re: EAR/NECK SPASMS",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe sounds very much like neuralgia involving one of the cranial nerves, probably the 8th, 9th or 10th, which serve, at least in part, the area you describe as affected. The pain of neuralgia of any of the cranial nerves (usually the 5th, or trigeminal nerve is cited as causing most common pain such as you've experienced, but that nerve runs from the scalp down into the face) is often very sudden and quite severe, often brought on by pressure or even touch, and, depending on which one is actually involved, movement or maneuvers (including sneezing). Because of the things you list which can trigger the pains, I suspect it is either the vagus (10th) or glossopharyngeal (9th) nerve which is irritated.   What causes this is often unclear, but since you have a history of Bells Palsy there is quite possibly a relationship in  this case. Since Bell's Palsy affects the 7th cranial nerve (facial nerve) it would be unsurprising that a neighboring nerve could be inflamed or otherwise irritated as well.   I would bring this to the attention of an internist if it doesn't go away in short order, for two reasons: one, pain is unpleasant in it's own right, and two, pain that is sustained is telling us something is wrong. There are so many potential causes of irritation of the cranial nerves, and often neuralgia goes away in a matter of days. If it doesn't, especially if the vagus or glossopharyngeal nerves are involved there is a small potential for more serious complications in rare cases. Better to have a doctor involved, if only to find a reasonable way to relieve the pain.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

There has been no change in teh size since then. and 2-3 swollen nodes on that mass(There were no nodes on the mas on the right side). After 2-3 months the pain subsided but swelling did not. Then after 1 year i again had some pain. which subsided again after 1-2 months. Now after 2 more years i have pain, n pressure kind of feeling.       I have had an ENT check up who says there might have been an infection n there is nothing to worry unles the swelling increases.

If you've had it medically evaluated then it is probably a safe bet it's fine. The lymph system sometimes has to put up with a  lot of insults, some of which pass unnoticed thanks to the lymph nodes, which take the brunt of a lot of infections. It could have been any one of a number of things, and yes, you could have had mono  without knowing it. A period of just feeling out of sorts is the best case scenario for this infection, which often does affect lymph nodes in various areas,  but especially where you describe.   Hope this is helpful.

You can do a few things to help, in addition to not picking the scab off.  You can use a saline nasal spray or drops two or three times a day.  You can also use a mild water-based lubricant gel (not Vaseline).  Apply with the end of a cotton swab, inserted gently into the nostril.  Do not insert the swab further than the cotton tip.  A humidifier at night can help keep it from becoming too dry.  If this does not help, you should have a doctor check to see if there is some infection causing the sore.  This does not sound like something that needs to be cauterized but only a doctor could determine that.  Best wishes\n\n",

It is a common cause of dizziness, especially in older people.  Unlike most other conditions that cause vertigo this one does not only happen when you stand.  People can get this problem with various movements or positions of the body.    Since yours occurs in bed, try sleeping with two pillows, instead of one and avoid lying flat.  Or, sleep in a recliner.  Change positions cautiously.  You may choose to wait it out and see if it disappears or see a doctor.  There are some exercises that are helpful.  Some people get this intermittently where it comes and goes at times.    Aside from this I don't know what else might cause your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning!  Last night I enjoyed a hot bowl of clam chowder.  It was a little too hot as I burned my throat after one spoonful, my uvula in particular.  A bit of a burned throat doesn't concern me overly much.  However, I looked at my throat in the mirror and was suprised to see that my uvula wasn't shaped like it always was.  The tip of it looks \"pinched\", similar to a raindrop hanging off the tip of the uvula.  My throat so sore as to inhibit swallowing or speaking, but it is definately irritated.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello MatthewC,  You may be seeing some swelling of the uvula following the burn.  The swelling can cause chances in appearance since the uvula is not tethered down and held in shape.    If your pain is improving there isn't much to worry about with this.  If the pain is severe enough that you cannot swallow I would suggest you be seen since this can lead to dehydration.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a similar set of symptoms a few times now - one of the holes in the back of my throat that's part of the Eustachian tube system gets swollen (the right one) and it's accompanied by a sore throat.  The pain is also localized around that swollen hole.  (the hole becomes much smaller than the corresponding one on the left side).    What could cause this?  Why is it usually just one hole - and the right one at that?  Are there any steps to take to treat it differently than a standard cold/sore throat?    Thanks,  Brett\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Brettswanson,  The hole that you are seeing is very unlikely to be connected to the eustachian tube.  This is a commonly held belief that the Eustachian tubes connect to the back of the mouth but they actually connect to the nose.  The hole you are seeing may actually be more of a depression than a true hole.  There are a few areas on the top of the mouth that can appear this way.  These areas, when swollen, may appear to close off the hole as the overlying tissue swells.  The sore throat is likely an indication of an infection (most commonly with a virus).  If your sore throats persist I would recommend you see your doctor.  If a specialist is needed/desired, an ear/nose/throat specialist would be the place to go.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have 2/3 swollen lyphnodes just below my left ear lobe.i also feel some swelling in the mass that is between the jaw and the neck(below the earlobe, i can feel the mass on both sides but the one of left is slightly swollen).   I got these lymph nodes swollen 3 years back with some pain, but no cold/cough, but in 2 months the pain subsided but the swelling did not. After 6 months i again had some pain, my ENT told me this is due to tonsils and left tonsil needs to be removed. i did not get it done and the pain subsided again.  Now after 2 years i again feel  pain and discomfort, though the size has not increased. i have no weight loss or anyother issues.  My concern is that although my ETN doc had said i need to remove the tonsil, i have never seen any swelling or redness or anything on my left tonsil that is different from the right. I did not have any cold/cough etc. Do i still not worry about this and it is possible to have swollen lymphnodes even without the classic symptoms like redness/swelling of tonsils , cough colds.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ent,  Sometimes, lymph nodes will remain enlarged after they have become swollen due to infection.  These nodes still function properly but remain enlarged, often about a centimeter in size.  This may be what is going on in your case.  However, enlarged lymph nodes that begin to enlarge further should be evaluated to be sure nothing bad is happening.    In your case, if they haven't changed in 3 years there is unlikely to be anything bad.  If your ENT doctor recommended a tonsillectomy there may be a different reason.  You may want to discuss this with your primary care doctor or seek a second opinion if you are concerned.  You may also want to talk with your ENT doctor about his rational for doing the tonsillectomy.  This way you have all the information you need to make an informed decision.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I intend to know considering that the swollen nodes are just below my left ear lobe and are basically between the jaw and the neck jst below the ear lobe can these be looked at by sonography or i need an MRI as i am not very comfortable with MRI.   Also i noticed the left tonsil(the side where the nodes are enlarged) is slightly (marginally but deifinitely) bigger than right. its slightly more red too. But my GP and ENT insist they have seen bigger tonsils and mine are pretty flat and hence do not consider it a reason for these swollen node.    Do you think that even a slight enlargement can lead to it or u agree with the analysis of my ENT and GP.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some people do lose their sense of smell to a degree and nothing can really be done about it, but because you have other symptoms you really should check this out with an ENT (Ear, Nose, Throat specialist) or allergist since it could be a hypersensitivity.  Even if you have never had allergies before, you can develop them.   You may need to rearrange priorities to see a doctor or just suffer it out I'm afraid.  If you have taken decongestants and not found relief, it would be good to rule out anything else before deciding you just have to live with the deficit.  Good luck.\n\n",

You've had quite an extensive work up.  I'm surprised no cause has been found yet.    My only thought are that there may be some reflux going on, especially with your hiatal hernia.  A 24 hour pH probe can help assess for this.  Also, you may want to see a pulmonologist (lung specialist) since this really is about the only part of the system that has not yet been evaluated (further down in the lungs rather than just the upper airway).

I stuck a cotton swab in and tilted my head to the side to check if it would drain and experienced mild pain in my ear when I moved my head, but no blood drainage.

    "title": "Re: Ear pain/muffled",
    "content": "Hi Lesnemo,  I suspect your problem may actually be behind your ear drum rather than in your ear canal.  It sounds like you may have a condition called eustachian tube dysfunction.  Basically, this is when the eustachian tube fails to pen and close properly causing a pressure difference to form between the middle ear (behind the ear drum) and the outside air.  When this happens, the pressure difference causes the ear drum to be sucked in and unable to move properly.  Hearing depends on the ear drum moving to transmit sound.  If it is impeded a muffled sound occurs.  You may want to try using a decongestant for a day or two to see if this helps.  If it does not I would recommend you see your doctor to have your ear examined.  It may also be that there is some fluid behind the ear drum, basically causing the same problem as an air pressure difference.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Helen20,  I suspect the sinus that your ENT doctor is referring to is not the typical sinus one thinks of with conditions like sinusitis.  A sinus also refers to a connection from the skin to a deeper structure or cyst.  In the area you are describing, this may be a condition called a branchial sinus.  During development of the embryo there are a series of branchial arches and sinuses that develop into various structures of the body.  Occasionally, these may not fully close leaving a sinus tract that can become infected or cause other problems.  The surgical removal of these sinuses is often fairly simple and straight forward.  It does depend a little on how deep the sinus goes, if it is near any major structures (such as the facial nerve), and if there are any other complicating structures or issues present.  Most likely, this will be a quick surgery, possibly even an outpatient surgery.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kevtm1974,  Spinning and ringing ears may be due to a number of things involving the inner ear.  You may want to see an Ear/Nose/Throat specialist if this continues.  There are several viral infections that can cause this.  An otolith (a stone in the balance center of the ear) can cause dizziness although ringing is not a prominent part of this, typically.  If your condition does not get better over the next few days I would recommend you see your primary care doctor.  There isn't a good over-the-counter medicine to try that I am aware of.  There may be a clinic in your area that can see patients on a free or reduced fee basis for those without insurance.  Your local health department can help you locate these clinics if necessary.

    "content": "Recurring swollen cheekbone, under eyes, temples.  Thank you for your help.   For the last three months, the following happens for about 4 days with a roughly 5 day break until the next occurrence.  50% of my time right now is spent hiding my face.  --Day 1: It starts with one swollen cheekbone which usually only I can see. --Day 2: The next day it is a swollen cheekbone and swollen eye bag. The skin is red and shiny from being stretched. Face looks deformed. People ask if I have fallen and hit my eye. Or joke that someone has hit me. The swelling then extends to the temple. It is sore.  --Day 3: The swelling extends down to my jowls, giving a chipmunk look. The skin feels hot. Lately, slightly enlarged glands in the neck. ---Day 4: Swelling starts to go down, and stays that way for a 3-8 days before starting up again. This happens on the right and left side of the face.  I don't have a stuffy nose or congestion.  I don't  have a cold. But I do have a headache   I am on no medication, except for when the swelling starts. I have been taking 2 Advil twice a day and a Claritin once a day. Neither seems to provide any relief, but I continue to take these anyway while symptoms persist.  Could it be: A new allergy? Sinusitis? A delayed reaction to Restalyn injected into the cheeks 6 months ago?   History: 33 years old, female. Family History: both parents deceased. Mum from kidney cancer at age 56. Father from scleroderma at age 64 My History: great blood pressure, great cholesterol.  No current conditions. Previous conditions were anemia from heavy periods, and folliculitus. I had a full set of teeth x-rays done at my last cleaning 1 month ago. It showed healthy, cavity free teeth. We were not looking for anything else at the time. I have a known allergy to seafood and penicillin. I do not smoke. I drink two to three glasses of wine a day. I am a vegetarian. I have a healthy appetite. I have had a pet cat for 1 year. I work in an office and in minor construction sites: concrete, plumbing, carpentry, tile jobs. I spend most of the day walking from one site to the next to inspect them. I had Restalyn injections in my cheeks 6 months ago I had my first ear infection 3 months ago after sweating heavily from tennis then going into cold a/c. I treated the infection with hydrogen peroxide.   Thank you so much for donating your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: why wont the swollen glands go away and what is ?the lump",
    "content": "Hi Molly,  The swollen glands you are feeling are likely lymph nodes.  Lymph nodes can become enlarged during infections and subsequently reduce in size.  They may become enlarged again with another infection, even if the infection isn't causing other symptoms.  It may be that you are again fighting off a viral cold that is causing the enlargement.  Also, sometimes after lymph nodes have become enlarged they may not shrink back down to their original size.  In this case, they often remain about the size of a pea.  They still function normally.    The lump below your Adam's apple may be the thyroid gland.  It may simply be that you had not noticed its presence before.    Based on what you've described I think cancer is very unlikely.  If the lumps begin to get bigger or become painful I would recommend you have them re-evaluated by your doctor.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on lymph nodes that you may find helpful.  It can be found here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It would not be expected to travel to the other ear, though.  What you may be feeling with these sensations is changes in the middle ear pressure due to some Eustachian tube dysfunction.  Basically this is when the Eustachian tubes don't open and close at the proper times resulting in pressure mismatches between the middle ear (behind the ear drum) and the outside air.  This can occur sometimes due to inflammation of the eustachian tube with a viral infection, allergies, or any number of other causes.  If this continues I would recommend you see  your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

There are many infections, mostly viruses, that can cause bumps and blister-like things but they would not be expected to come and go with eating.    With eating being the onset, perhaps these spots are forming due to friction from food rubbing against the mouth basically causing a blister.  There are a few conditions that can cause this but the are either congenital (i.e. present from birth) or related to an infection that would be expected to continue to get worse.  I would recommend you see your doctor for a direct evaluation.  This may actually give you an answer because the spots may look classic for something simple.  If not, you may need to see an ear/nose/throat specialist for further evaluation.  Sorry I can't be of more help to you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Quick background. Im 23 and I was born with a moderate to severe loss in my left ear. All the docs that I've seen said it was just nerve damage and I've managed to survive.  About 10 days ago I started to feel real clogged in my left ear and with that was a major hearing loss on top of my preexisting condition. I could tell that it made me nearly totally deaf.  This may or may not have something to do with it but  I was suckerpunched on my right jaw a slightly prior to the symptoms occurring.  I figured I'd wait a few days and see what happens. I had mild ringing but nothing too severe. Over the week I had no change.  Of course I decided to go to the doctor over the weekend but Monday was Xmas eve and Tuesday was Xmas so I only got to the ENT today.  The audiologist confirmed that my hearing in my left took a big dump (i had a test from a few months prior to compare). He said it may be viral but didn't really say much at all.  I saw the ENT and he also didn't say much. Looked in my ear and up my nose. He said I should get a MRI but he made it seem like if it was expensive due to my insurance that it wasn't necessary. But he never really said what happened, although he did say there were some fluid behind my ear drum. Can this combined with my past loss cause this?  If I tap the back of the left side of my head it feels very funny(on the level of my ear but right my head begins to curve). It kind of feels very full and fluidy and makes me slightly dizzy for a split second. Actually the best way to describe it is it feels loud. But if touch the same spot on my right side it feels normal.  He prescribed prednisone and amoxiclav. Although I am worried bc I thought I should have gotten some anti-viral medication. Should I be okay with the combo I have now?  I am also debating if I should take some decongesitant just in case that coul be the cause..any recommendations?  Also what are my realistic outlook? Right now my left ear is unaidable, and I just want it to be good enough to get a hearing aid. The doctor didn't really say much (audiologist said possible viral, ENT said possible nerve damage and fluid behind my ear drum). I just want a reasonable outlook. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden severe hearing loss. Clogged? Permanent?",
    "content": "Hi Matthan07,  Hearing loss can basically be divided into two categories: conductive problems and neurological problems.  Conductive problems include things that are preventing the ear drum/ear bones from moving and conducting sound properly to the nerves.  Neurological problems are those that receive the signal from the ear but do not carry it to the brain.  Conductive problems include fluid behind the ear drum causing the drum to be less mobile.  This often gives a muffled sound, as if the person were underwater.  Given your recent trauma, a broken bone in the middle ear is a possibility although it takes a fair amount of force and the area you got hit is less likely to do this.  Using a decongestant for a few days may help if there is fluid behind the ear.    The amoxicillin/clavulonate will help if there is a bacterial infection causing puss to collect somewhere along the path (usually the middle ear) or if the infection is causing inflammation and not letting things work properly.  This will only help with bacterial infections.  The prednisone will help if there is inflammation from something, including an infection although it will not help get rid of the infection.    Unfortunately, at this point there really isn't a good antiviral medicine.  We have a few that are targeted at specific viruses if the virus is known.  Even these don't work that great and they have some nasty side effects.  This is most likely why you weren't given an antiviral medicine.  I cannot comment on whether or not this is permanent without knowing what the underlying cause is.  If it is viral it will most likely improve as the body fights off the infection.  If this is not improving an MRI may be helpful to get a better look at the middle/inner ear and see if there is any evidence of inflammation that may account for your hearing loss.  I would definitely defer to the ENT specialist about whether this is an appropriate test or not at this point.  Follow up with your ENT doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Boobear,  Tonsils can be large enough to obstruct the nasal passage (not really the tonsils but the adenoids can do this).  This can give the hyponasal voice.  I am less familiar with enlarged tonsils/adenoids causing dental malocclusion.  You may want to talk with your son's dentist about this.  It would also be reasonable to have your son evaluated by an ear/nose/throat specialist.  Typically, tonsils/adenoids will shrink in size with age but if they are particularly large they may not shrink enough to alleviate symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

So, I went to the local pharmacy and a pharmacist recommended an over-the-counter cough medicine. I bought it, consumed it for 4 days, but it did not have any effect whatsoever.  I then saw my family physician a week ago and he prescribed Novahistex DH. It still does not seem to have any effect on my persistent dry coughs (no phlegm, and no sounds). I live in Canada and my coughs usually occur at night and on colder days.  Also, I have allergies to several substances. In the past, I usually have this same problem (dry coughing) in the spring.  What do you think the problem may be? Is Novahistex DH still not an adequately strong antitussive?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

This usually does not have other allergy syptoms such as an itching nose or throat.  This may cause your nose to run while eating or after eating.  Drinking alcoholic beverages may cause your nose to be stuffed up.  If this is bothersome you can see your doctor and have allergy testing done.  Even if the tests come back negative they may have you try an antihistimine to see if this alleviates the symptoms.  Sometimes oral antihistimines are ineffective in treating nonallergic rhinitis and you may need a prescription nasal spray.  I hope this is helpful and thanks for writing in. Sandy RN\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pistachio Allergy?",
    "content": "Hi there, A person can develop an allergy at any time - even to substances which have never before been a problem, as in your case.  In fact, most allergies are to something you have had in the past because the nature of allergies is that they are a hypersensitive response to a foreign substance in your body that the system perceives as a threat.  Once you have been exposed to a substance, your body can begin to rebel against it. You may notice this soon after exposure or on a subsequent exposure.  Your system is unable to recognize it as safe for you and has put out barriers against it.  In order to create the \"allergy\" your body must have been exposed to it once, then it develops the antibody reaction which on another occasion is a problem and you experience the reaction with histamine, etc.    It has to do with your personal immune system which may be weakened for some reason or oversensitive even though in the past it was not.  It is believed that factors such as poor nutrition may contribute to allergies because of the weakened state of your body and immune system.    Nut allergies can be especially dangerous so if you are certain it is the pistachios you reacted to, I would recommend you stay away from them in the future.  If you ever experience breathing difficulties with this allergic reaction you should get to medical help right away.  Some doctors even prescribe a device to be kept with you for such emergencies so you can have instant medication to counteract what could be a serious reaction.   I hope this information is helpful.  Thank you for your question.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Debbie, for your detailed description of allergic reactions. It was helpful and informative!  I did experience tightness in my throat, right after eating about 10 pistachios. The tightness was followed with itching starting in my mouth, then my lips, then my face, then my entire body. I started to get sores on my tongue, inside of my cheeks and my throat.  When I told my sister that I was having trouble swallowing....she ran for the Benadryl, which I tool immediately. In about 5 minutes the swelling in my throat went down, but it was much later that the itching stopped.   I do intend to stop eating pistachios, and am going to use caution when eating any type of a nut.  I also am scheduled for a physical in about 4 weeks, so I will address it with my doctor then.

    "title": "Tinnitis, headache and visual disturbances",
    "content": "I'm a 21 year old female.  No serious past diagnoses or past surgeries.  I have had my tonsils taken out however.  I am obese, as is my mother who has high blood pressure, heart problems, and diabetes.  Both my grandmothers have diabetes as well.  I'm not currently on any medications though I'm supposed to be on birth control to regulate my menstrual cycles, but the prescription ran out a couple months ago.  Another thing to note is that I'm on the computer constantly.  I've been plagued by the most annoying thing since last May or so.  Pulsatile tinnitus.  It whooshes in my right ear constantly, though I've learned to ignore it of late.  I had started to feel a bit of a tinge of pain deep in my ear last April, but the doctor I went to at the time said he saw nothing wrong.  The tinnitus developed a month or so later.  I spent the summer doing basically pretty much lazing around so I didn't think hard enough to notice much, except some minor peripheral vision dimming, but when I came back to the university, I noticed that I'm having difficulties concentrating lately.  I've also noticed that I have developed difficulties speaking for extended periods of time, such as when telling a joke or a story.  Strangely, I've noticed that lately I occasionally spell words backwards or invert letters...like typing big as gib.  I also frequently start to do something and forget what I had intended to say or do, but that could just be me being ditzy.  Same goes for occasional dizziness or loss of balance.  I've been sleeping an abnormally long amount of time lately, sometimes twelve to sixteen hours, and no matter what I do I always feel fatigued.  I've been getting headaches often, which isn't unusual for me, but they generally come out of nowhere and lately they've been increasingly on the right side of my forehead in the area around and including the eye.  I usually wait it out since I hate taking medicine, but if it gets to the point where it's debilitating, I take tylenol or ibuprofen and it slowly goes away.  Lately my vision has been what most bothers me.  I have astigmatism and am very nearsighted.  For as long as I remember, I've had visual snow.  I haven't been to the eye doctor in a while, but I can see pretty well with my current prescription.  Lately, however, I will be looking at something and my peripheral vision will dim or seem to swim.  Also, lately changes in light have been throwing me for a loop, or no changes in light actually do the same.  I'll be sitting there doing nothing and all of a sudden my vision will be whitewashed as if someone turned a bright light on.  I've also seen occasional flashes of light when nothing's there.  Occasionally if I walk through a well-lit hallway and lights are shining off of glossy walls or tiles it makes me feel lightheaded as I walk.  Mostly fed up with these vision problems which occur increasingly frequently, I went to the local campus health clinic last Friday and got the same doctor who told me last April that the pain in my ears was nothing.  I proceeded to recount my symptoms to the nurse and then to the doctor when he came in.  He looking in my mouth, eyes, and ears and saw nothing wrong, but gave me Neomycin, Polymyxin B, and Hydrocortisone eardrops anyway and sent me on my merry little way.  I've been using these drops, but nothing has really changed.  Besides feeling absolutely awful tonight.  My head feels \"fuzzy\"...my eyes are still whitewashing occasionally...and my tinnitus that's usually a soft whoosh was making strange sounds...like a rough rasping sound.  Along with this was a general sense of illness...something just felt...wrong.  As I type this I feel a slight twinge of nausea.  Anyway, should I seek a second opinion or stick with the drops and see if by some miracle they miraculously cure my eyes too?  My insurance is crappy and money is an issue...the health center doctors are free, but if I choose to go elsewhere or am referred to a specialist, there may be bill issues...\n\n",

    "content": "I would return to the clinic.  Often when a doctor prescribes, he/she is going on a hunch based on symptoms (medicine is a combination of art and science).  Not every condition is clear cut or even verified by labwork, etc. so there is a bit of trial and error involved. Often they start with the least risky or most likely solution.  If that does not help, they must rely on the patient to let them know so they can move to the next step.  They usually have to treat one symptom at a time, when there are multiples, and use one treatment at a time.  That is the only way to know what made the difference.    If you do not return, the doctor will never know that you weren't adequately treated or even cured.  If this does not satisfy you, a second opinion might be worth it.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I may as well reply to this to update it.  I returned to that same doctor to no avail.  A week or so later I suddenly developed a headache and a stiff neck.  I again returned to that same doctor several times, and he kept giving me medicines without even running any tests.  At one point he gave me antibiotics even though the one test he did showed no traces of bacteria in my blood.  A week after that, the pain was enough to make me go to the emergency room in my very small town.  They ran lots of test and nothing seemed wrong.  They also did a CT scan, but they said I only had mild chronic sinusitis.  I then asked the doctor if it was possible that I had increased pressure in the brain.  I happen to have a friend who is an assistant to a neurosurgeon, and he suggested that increased ICP was likely what was causing my problems--the headaches, slight fevers, ringing in my ears, visual disturbances, lethargy, etc, etc.  The doctor said that the CT technicians would have seen that if that was the issue, so they just gave me some darvocet and flexeril and sent me on my way.  At this point I could barely sleep because my head felt so...full...and the back of my head was really sore.  Even the slight pressure of the pillow against my head hurt.  Then a couple of days later, I noticed my vision was blurry.  I thought it was a side effect from the medicines they gave me at the emergency room at first, but when my vision continued to grow steadily worse each day despite stopping those medicines, I went back to the doctor once more.  This time he said he wasn't worried since I had had a CT scan the weekend before and suggested I go to a psychologist, thinking I was imagining things.  I asked him what exactly it was that he thought a psychologist could do about my vision and had him send me to an eye doctor to have things checked out.  Turns out, I had papilledema due to increased pressure in the brain, the very thing I asked about in the emergency room.  The eye doctor sent me to a neurologist, but the earliest appointment was four days away, so I continued to lose more and more sight as my vision got blurrier and double.  At the neurologist, I was told that I had something called pseudotumor cerebri and after extensive MRI scans, that I had a blood clot in the back of my brain.  I was sent to an optic nerve eye specialist, at which point I could not even see the chart on the wall due to a large blindspot in my central vision.  Anything I looked at was blotted out by gray, and my field vision test results showed that I could barely see.  It was recommended that I have surgery and get a shunt put into my spine to drain out excess fluid continuously.  It was considered an emergency procedure in order to save what little was left of my sight.  I was told it was possible I wouldn't get any vision improvement, and that it would never be as good as it used to be.  Luckily I've gotten back most of it, though small print/thin fonts are difficult to see.  In addition I believe I have lost a small amount of color perception.  Some colors are hard to distinguish from one another...blue, teal, and green for example, though they were easy to tell apart before.  I go to the eye doctor December 27th and I guess I'll find out how extensive the permanent damage has been.  I've been getting slight high pressure headaches again, so I'll have my neurologist adjust my shunt net time I see her.  Well, there it is.  The long, exhausting ordeal finally ended, and I was able to be diagnosed and my problem dealt with.  I was told my opening pressure when they did a lumbar puncture was very, very high.  I was barely conscious at the time, but I felt much better once they drained off two or three tubes of fluid.\n\n",

My concern is reoccuring ear pain (and throat soreness as well).  Usually this occurs every morning when I wake up.  According to my ENT this is related to allergies.  However, I tend to get ear pain at other times as well which comes and goes and can be quite painful.  In addition I have noticed within the last year that I no longer am able to hear as well.  I need the tv up very loud and have to have people continuously repeat things to me to be able to hear them.  THe ENT did a visual exam and didn't see anything noticeably wrong with me ears.  Could these problems all be associated with the allergies?  And if so are there things to help them?  I am on allergy medicines already but it doesnt seem to clear up the pain in the ears and the pain when I swallow.  I have tried ear drops but they end up burning.  Any advice is appreciated?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic Ear Pain",
    "content": "Hi Dacubster,  It is possible that your pain is related to allergies.  Since the ENT doctor did not see any problems visually it makes an infection or fluid behind the ear drum much less likely.  It may be that you have Eustachian tube dysfunction that is causing pressure differences between your middle ear (behind the ear drum) and the outside air pressure.  This can cause significant pain at times but more often causes a pressure feeling (like taking off in an airplane).    Allergies relate to this because allergies can cause inflammation of the Eustachian tube causing the tube to swell.  This, in turn, worsens the pressure problems.  Normally, the Eustachian tube will open and close as needed to balance the pressure.  With the inflammation, the tube is swollen and can't function properly.  You may want to talk with your ENT doctor about this possibility.  Sometimes, using a nasal steroid can help reduce inflammation of the Eustachian tube.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Problems101,  Even though you don't have fluid behind the ear there may be some pressure issues in the ear that are preventing the ear drum from moving properly.  This can occur when the eustachian tube doesn't open and close properly.  Sometimes this is from inflammation of the tube.  There may also be other reasons such as problems with the bony structures of the ear.  I'd recommend you see your ENT doctor again to have this checked out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Right now it is mostly while he is eating.  He has been seen by 2 different ENT's about other issues and I feel like his doctor isn't listening to me about this issue.  He has always had large tonsils, and has had a few problems with tonsillitis and strep but he also has a high pain tolerance and it could be more.  Has been treated with antibiotics for fluid behind the ear drums for a few months.  I guess what I'm trying to get at is, should I seek another opinion from a different doctor or is it not that big of a deal?  I've always wondered if a tonsillectomy would benefit him in ways of speech as well, as he is a chronic mouth breather which could be due to the largeness of the tonsils. Any advice would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Boobear,  There are few possible things that could be causing this.  First, commonly with disorders in the autism spectrum, such as PDD-NOS, there can be tics that include muscular and vocal tics (such as coughs or throat clearing).  It may also be due to some gastroesophageal reflux irritating the throat.  You may want to discuss trying an anti-reflux medicine to see if this helps.  It may also be helpful to have your son evaluated by a developmental pediatrician if he hasn't been and to discuss the possibilities of this being a tic with them.  If two ENT's feel it isn't related to his throat it is probably not going to be very helpful to see another ENT.  The breathing through his mouth and the need for a tonsillectomy is probably a separate issue that the ENT's would be able to help you develop.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The 2 ENT's that have seen him weren't aware of the throat clearing.  They were just aware of his mouth breathing, big tonsils, and fluid behind the ears.  I'm just not sure that doctors around here are aware of the relation between speech and the tonsils since from what I've read it's just been linked fairly recently (but not sure if this info is correct....).  My best bet I guess is to check it out with the doctor he sees that I actually like and go from there.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 23 year old male from Wisconsin. I have been a smoker for four years, roughly a pack a day. Approximately a year and a half ago I noticed a red, painless lesion in the back of my throat. I went to see a doctor and he wrote it off as nothing, but didn't do any sort of testing. Since then, the single lump got bigger and now there are more like it. I went to see a doctor two weeks ago for a lung infection and to get the lesions re-examined. She wasn't sure what the cause would be, and prescribed me amoxacillin and prednisone, in hope the condition would clear up. Today I took the last of my medication, and there hasn't been any change in the size or number of lesions. The doctor told me if the medications she gave me didn't work, I would be referred to an ENT specialist. I have a picture, albeit a relatively poor one, but it gives an idea what's going on.    From the information I've provided, I guess I have two major questions. One, if I have symptoms like these and medication doesn't help, what could it possibly be? And two, does it seem like I should be worried about cancer?\n\n",

Medicines such as pseudoephedrine and phenylephrine are decongestants (common brand names Sudafed and Sudafed PE, respectively).  The decongestants may help you but keep in mind that sinusitis causes thick mucous production in the sinuses so it will take a little while (even weeks) for this to resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Have another appt with another ENT on 12/21, but this is driving me nuts.  Any ideas?  I also have neurofibromatosis but its no big deal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Medic6613,  There are a few possibilities off hand.  Sometimes ear pain/pressure is due to an occluded eustachian tube.  Occasionally, using an intranasal steroid (like the ones used for allergy symptoms) for a short period of time can reduce the inflammation in the eustachian tube and decrease the swelling allowing the tube to open properly.  You may want to discuss this possibility with your ENT doctor.    I am uncertain what the significance of the findings on the CT are but think it less likely to be causing your ear pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Thunderdome,  Your symptoms may be from a few things.  You may have an enlarged lymph node causing the pressure.  The lymph nodes can be a bit painful when pressed on if they are enlarged.  There are a few other things that would be a bit less likely but still possible.  One possibility is a cyst from a branchial cleft remnant.  Basically, this is an area present in a baby before they are born that subsequently dissappears.  Occasionally it remains and can cause symptoms such as you are describing.  Most of these will resolve on their own but if one of them gets infected it may need antibiotics to improve.  If your symptoms don't improve I would recommend you see your doctor to have some of these things evaluated for.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Additionally if I sing or amplify my voice my tonsils itch and the coughing spell starts again.  I've noticed that my tonsils have a hole in it and sometimes food particles get trapped in them. This irritates my tonsils even more and sometimes causes them to bleed. Last night I coughed up blood and noticed that my left tonsil was bleeding a little. Fortunately, I've never had swollen tonsil nor a sore throat from this problem. What are the possible causes of my symptoms and what can I do to encourage healing?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Anara,  The tonsils normally have some holes in them (called crypts).  This part probably is normal in your case.  The itching part and bleeding may be due to an infection or possibly allergies.  You may want to try an over-the-counter allergy medicine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratidine (Claritin).  If this helps it is likely allergies.    If this doesn't help you may want to see your doctor to have your tonsils examined for any evidence of infection.  If it appears you have a bacterial infection you may need antibiotics to help clear it up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is my first infection for 20yrs as I had infections when I was 4 or 5. I am already scheduled to see an ENT about a 2 year old enlarged lymph node on my neck (right side). My ear infection is on the left. The enlarged lymph node has been growing the past 2 years, but has been doing a waxing and waning effect. Right now it is at it's largest 1.5-2cm and it is not painful. I can also feel new small lymph nodes on the same chain (on the right) and some on the left that I could not feel before. My GP told me he has run out of options and that if this course of antibiotics does not work we will just have to wait to see the ENT in January. If the largest 2yr old lymph node was already present and I have had 4 courses of antibiotics what is the likelyhood that it could be because of an infection? Would be be feasible for me to not know I had an ear infection for 2yrs? I know I have a higher chance of getting lymphoma because I have Celiac Disease, but I guess the ENT will have to do a biopsy for sure.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Neala,  A persistent ear infection could certainly cause a swollen lymph node.  I think it is unlikely that you've had an ear infection for 2 years.  More likely, you had some enlargement of the node at some point due to an infection then the node simply never quite shrunk back down.  This is extremely common.    With antibiotic resistant ear infections, the recommendation for antibiotics is three consecutive days of an injected antibiotic called ceftriaxone.  This antibiotic is able to get very high concentrations in the middle ear and is very effective at clearing the infection.  If this is ineffective, evaluation by an ENT specialist is appropriate.  It may be that you have some inflammation of your eustachian tube causing the fluid in your ear to be trapped.  The ENT specialist can help recommend treatments to help this improve and evaluate the lymph node at the same time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Add some humidity to your air - get a good, quiet humidifier and use it at night.  This should help loosen the secretions a bit.  Also, raise your head a bit on the bed by using several pillows.  Use a saline nose spray.  It doesn't need any active ingredients.  Also be sure you get adequate hydration.  If you're not drinking lots of water, this can make it harder too.  Sometimes the medications are drying to the passages and you need that moisture.  If you don't get any relief this way, along with all the drugs you have, you should return to your doctor.

But i do not feel any redness or scar on my tonsils. 2.If i hold on to my neck tight then i feel strangled on the exact side where i have the swelling and i need to release the hold immediately. 3. Now more starngely i feel a very slight nigle in my ear if i tunr my neck to the acute left where the node is.  Please suggest what may be the reason.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ent,  The area you are describing does fit a lymph node.  Usually, lymph nodes do not cause the tingling feelings you are describing.  It may be that the lymph nodes is a bit scarred causing it not to reduce fully in size (a common occurrence) and is now pressing on a nerve some.  Turning your head may cause more pressure on the nerve increasing the tingling feeling.  I'd recommend you see an ENT doctor to have this checked out.  It may be that the invovled lymph node needs to be removed to help resolve your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a 15 month old son who had his adenoids removed at 10 months due to severe hypertrophy (they were completely blocking his airway).  He has had a severe case of GERD since birth (taking both Prevacid and Zantac), as well as numerous other health problems before surgery and since.  My question is simple:  Is it possible for adenoids to come back after only 5 months in a child so young?  The ENT that removed them said the chances were about 50/50 that they would grow back.  We've since moved and saw another ENT who seemed dismissive as that being a cause of his current illnesses/sleeping issues.  Thanks for your reply.\n\n",

If your son is having breathing issues it may also be helpful to see a pulmonologist along with the ENT doctor.  If there is uncertainty about what is causing the problems a small camera can be inserted through the nose or mouth to directly look at the upper and lower parts of the airway.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past few months I have been hearing my heartbeat in my left. I've notice the sound appears mostly when I wake up in the morning or when I'm sitting down sometimes.  I can silence the noise by slighty pressing the left side of my neck about an inch and half below my ear.  I also notice, sometime when I go from sitting to a standing position I can feel slight pressure on the left side of my neck and the back of my head near the left ear. I went to the ENT specialist and several test were done. the doctor check my ear drum by looking thru some microscope device; eardrum normal. He also ran a special test to see if fluid was behind the eardrum, that was normal too.  He also check to see if I had hearing loss, that too was ok.  He concluded that I may have a blood vessel running very close to my ear drum therefore causing me to hear pulsating noises. No treatment have been done.  Should I be concerned or will this problem eventually go away? Thanks for you time!  Sincerely, Tasha\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Your symptoms are odd, however there may be some possible explanations. First of all we need to establish your overall medical condition. How old are you?  Do you or have you suffered from any medical or surgical problems? Are you experiencing any other symptoms apart from those described? The most important causes to rule out are cardiovascular. If the arteries that exit your heart and run up the left side of your neck are under pressure due to narrowing or stiffness you may experience abnormal pulsations or waveforms into the arterial circulation on that side. This may translate into audible sounds in the left ear due to transmission of pulsations into arteries supplying that area. However it is important to note that your symptoms may be entirely benign and therefore you should not worry too much about it as you will find yourself focusing on it and feeling worse. I suggest you visit your doctor for a full cardiovascular examination and if needs be either he or your ENT surgeon may decide to arrange imaging of the arteries, normally carried out in the form of a MRA(Magnetic Resonance Angiogram) which carries no risk of radiation exposure and allows identification of any vascular malformation. I am not familiar with a case like yours but ruling out any pathological causes will be reassuring. Please let me know of any progress.  Kind Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

How long have these been present?    Another reason can be diet.  If your diet is lacking roughage (fruits and vegetables).  This can be managed by lifestyle changes.  Try increasing the amount of fresh fruits and raw vegetables (celery,apples and carrots) and increasing water intake.    Smoking can also be the cause of the problem.  I encourage you to see a dentist or Healthcare provider to be sure of the cause.  Good Luck Sandy RN\n\n",

    "title": "Throat pain,  help",
    "content": "Hello Every1  About a month ago , I had a severe sinus problem , cold and sore throat.But I recovered in a week.But since then I have this throat pain.It is l 1 cm left to the tip of my Adam's Apple ,  about 1 cm below the line which joins my jaw to the neck.It is on the inside of my throat, i.e I can touch it by putting my finger in.  Most likely it is a swollen lymph node.  I have had a history of common cold , sinus problems and sore throats , occurring like twice a year.But usually I have never had this specific pain , after I have recovered.  My pain is not continuous ; it occurs only when I specifically move that area of my throat , or when I swallow something.And the pain isn't much. Also i had exactly the same problem about a year ago(I had a bad cold , sore throat and for over 2 weeks after recovery I had this same pain , at exactly the same location)My doc gave me Cetrizine Hydrochloride tablets and in a few days the pain went away.  I have been reading a lot about swollen lymph nodes.  I cant say if my lymph nodes are hard or not , cuz I cant see them and don't feel anything if I don't do anything to \"disturb\" them.And they don't feel hard.And I don't feel as if they are enlarged or anything.Its like having an ulcer/wart of some kind , which pains if you touch it or if something goes over it.The pain is quite localized and doesn't seem to grow or anything.Nor are any of my lymph nodes growing.Infact the pain and the condition of my lymph nodes has been constant.  Right now , I don't have a severe cold or anything , just some nasal discharge( transparent and very little quantities) after every hr(quite normal for me). Also I do have some amount of post nasal drip every little while.I do get an irritated throat if I my throat gets dry or if I remain in an AC room for a while.  I tend to worry a lot and this is driving me nuts.It'd be nice if someone could answer these qns:  1)Could this be Cancer?Like from what i know , Cetrizine only removes the swelling , but could it have been a cancer deep within ?  2)I have been doing saline gargling but that spot doesn't seem to get better.What should I do?  3)Could this be anything other than a swollen lymph node?About a month ago(when I was sick) , I had been advised to do antiseptic gargling which I did properly.So I don't think so it could have been a bacterial/fungal infection .  Although I don't have a major sinusitis problem right now, I still feel a kind of heaviness behind my eyes.And there is mild pain when I face the ground(same pain is much larger when I have cold ).But that has been there for quite a while and I am on Ayurvedic Medication for my sinus problems.  Also I am a 20 year old , male engineering student , and am overweight(I am 6ft tall and weigh 80kgs).I am quite active , as in I walk a lot and practice deep breathing.I don't smoke , drink etc and live in very unpolluted environment. please help me out. Thank in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I\u2019m a 64 year old male and in good health. I take 12.5mg hrdrochlorot daily, 20mg omeprozole every other day and 325mg aspirin daily.  I used to have normal brown earwax in my ear canals. Now the normal wax has disappeared and I got a clear sticky liquid discharge, not in the ear canal but in the outer ear. This liquid dries to a waxy substance that really sticks to the ear. I use hot water and a wash towel to remove it. However, it always returns, sometimes right away or later in the day or at night when I sleep. Occasionally I go 2 or 3 days before it reappeared.   About 6 weeks ago, I had an asthma attack and my doctor put me on a 16-day regimen of prednisone. On the 10th day, my ears went back to normal, brown earwax in the ear canals and no more of the sticky discharge in the outer ears. However, on the 25th day, 9 days after stopping the prednisone, the brown earwax disappeared and the sticky discharge started again.  My doctor examined my ears and seemed puzzled. She thought perhaps it was some type of skin condition, like psoriasis, and had me use 1% hydrocortisone cream. However, this hasn\u2019t helped.  Should I be concerned or just ignore it as I have no other symptoms? Should I see a specialist and, if so, a dermatologist or ENT?\n\n",

    "title": "Olfactory Halucinations",
    "content": "Hello,  Hello,  Ok, so for the past 6 months or so I have been having olfactory hallucinations. When I began having them I was confused (and slightly ammused) by this. I usually have about 7 a day or so, and they last anywhere from 5 seconds to 30 seconds. 99% of the time, its something plesent that I smell. Sometimes there very pertucular. Like, I would smell something like a cross between cedar, hot choclate powder, and rain. Like something you would not normally be able to imagine. The majorty of the time though its something normal (sorta). Certian smells I will taste weakly simoltainously, usually a fruit or something citrus. I can usually tell if they are a halucination, but not always. The best way to describe it would be remembering a smell, but its 50x more powerful, and you actually smell it. There really seems to be no rhyme or reason to this. They are always completly random, and have nothing to do with what I am doing or thinking about.  I informed my dad about this and he was concerned. So one thing led to another and I went to several doctors to see what was wrong. At first they thought I had a brain tumor, I had my head scanned and found that I did not have one (thankgod). So after that, they noticed that my (I think its my temporal lobes or somewhere near it) were very asymetrical. So, the doctors hooked me up to an EEG machine to see if I had a form of epilepsy. Turns out I don't, at least they think. The doctor said that nothing might have shown up because I did not have an olfactory halucination durring the test. After talking to me he said I COULD have temporal lobe seziures, but there extremely small. I decided not to take the test over 3 days to find out if I really did because I was leaving for college very soon.  I have not been to an ear, nose, and throat doctor. My dad subjested that I go to it before I left but since it didnt appear to be anything serious, I decided not to. The reason is, because it came up through talking to doctors that I eat very spicy foods, and alot of wasabi. Since I was 10 or so, I loved wasabi and whenever I do eat it with food, I eat it raw, and alot of it. (By the end of dinner I usually will have gone through a tablespoon or more). My dad thinks I \"burnt out the inside of my nose\" because of this. The doctors I went to said it could be this, but they didnt think so completly.  *Phew* ok, so in a nutshell, what is causing these olfactory hallucinations. Is it brain related, nerve related, or nose related? And generally if someone has some insite to this.  Thanks! Pieter (18 year old male)   Here are some other things: -Asbergers syndrome (It seems to have diminished) -Severe Depression (age 11-12) -Never had sergery (of any kind) -Family history of depression and agoraphobia, general hypersensitivity -Not currentlly medicated (Used to be on citalopram years ago and it exasperated mental problems)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pieter,  Olfactory hallucinations are actually quite interesting.  There are several possible causes.  They are also referred to as dysosmias.  Sinus or nasal infections can cause these.  Even after the infection clears it may take a little while for them to resolve.  Seizures or head trauma can also cause them.  Having the EEG was very appropriate and an normal EEG makes seizures less likely but does not rule them out.    Depression and a few other psychological disorders can also cause these hallucinations.  I would suggest you see a neurologist if this issue is not improving.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Bad Sinus Pain and Pressure Causing Headaches",
    "content": "Three and a half weeks ago, after my bout with IBS  was slowly getting better, I got this weird numbness in the center of my forehead, particularly between my eyes, and sometimes right on the bridge of my nose. There was also pressure around my eyes, and everyday one of my nostrils was stuffed, but there was no mucus. I have no cough and I sneeze once or twice a week at most. For the next two weeks, it just got worse and worse, sparking bad headaches (possibly migraines), until I finally decided to see a doctor.  According to my doctor, I have allergies. She put me on Allegra 180 mg and told me to use a saline solution. She told me nothing else. So I assumed all this pain and pressure is from irritated sinuses behind and between my eyes and above my eyebrows.  I've been on Allegra 180 mg for a week now and it has done absolutely nothing. I still have the identical face and forehead pressure, occasional pain, and general malaise and debilitation from it. The pressure around my eyes is making my vision worse, so I have to wear my glasses more often now than I had to, just adding to the pressure on my face.   Note: I have no nasal discharge and to my knowledge, only occasional post-nasal drip.  It's getting very very annoying and starting to concern me. Can anyone confirm what exactly I have (a possible sinusitis?) and suggest some drug or treatment that might actually help stop this inflammation or irritation (if thats what it is). I will suggest it to my doctor on my follow-up visit.\n\n",

Using the allergy medicine can help.  You may also want to take a decongestant (such as sudafed) to see if this will help drain your sinuses.  If your symptoms are not improving I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They often become enlarged during infections.  Occasionally they may remain somewhat enlarged-about the size you are describing.    My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on lymph nodes that you may find informative.  It can be found here.  If the lump begins to get bigger I would recommend you have your doctor evaluate it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My family members have been diagnosed with high blood pressure, which I have never had, high Cholestorol, which I have never had, cancers (breast, brain, lung, skin, throat), and heart disease. I take 225 milligrams of Effexor a day. I have been on this med for about 2 months.    About 3 or 4 days ago I started noticing that everytime I ate or drank something, no matter what it is, including pepto-bismol that the bottom of my throat burned.  I dismissed it the first couple of days as heartburn, but it hasn't went away and yesterday, my stomach ached all day.  Then this morning I woke up trembling.  My legs felt unsteady when I went down the stairs and when I moved my hand to pick something up, I noticed my hand trembling too.  What could this be?\n\n",

    "title": "reoccuring strep",
    "content": "Hi.  I've tried researching strep throat online, but everything seems to be related to children or often refers to penicillian which I don't take becuase I had an allergic reactions to amoxicillin/ampicillian when I was a kid.  I am a 23 year old female elementary teacher.  Since Feb. of 2007 I have had 6 positive strep cultures.  I've also noticed a significant increase in the number of migranes I've been getting (prior condition), which I think is linked to the strep.   Before this year, I have not had strep throat since I was 8.  I had symptoms (SEVERE sore throat, fever, etc.) in Feb. (#1)  Then May/June (#2, 3, and 4).  That time the strep came back immediatley after the final drug.  It  took all of June for my lymph nodes in the neck to go back down.  Then in Sept. I got it again (#5).  I went to the ENT doctor the other day and left feeling like we had accomplished nothing.   I took another rapid strep test- this time with no symptoms and it came up positive again!  I am on another antibiotic to \"flush out\" the bacteria and am going to insisit on being retested when they're done.  The new drug is:  Levaquin.  In the others instances I've taken:  azithromycin, cephalexin, cefuroxime.  Each time I've done everything I could think of to prevent getting it again, washed all sheets and blankets, jackets, bleached glasses, washed counter-tops and changed my tooth brush many times!   My boyfriend has not gotten strep through this whole time period. . .  nor has he had any symptoms.  I told the ENT doctor this and he didn't say anything.  Should my boyfriend be tested too?  Could he be giving it back to me. The doctor suggested getting my tonsils out, I may end up doing this, but I'd like to figure out why I keep getting it in the first place.  The ENT's response was that it was my 1st and 2nd year teaching and I was stressed etc.  However my stress level is much lower than when I was in college and student teaching, so that just doesn't seem to be it to me.  If I do get my tonsils out, I likely won't be able to do it until spring break or this summer, so I need to figure out how to prevent it in the meantime.  I hope this isn't too much information at once.  Any new suggestions would be helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Meganeventer,  Strep is a confusing bug, especially strep throat.  There are a few things to consider.  1st is that strep really gets a bad rap in that many times when people have a sore throat they get treated for strep throat without the strep actually causing the infection.  There are many viruses that can do this as well.  Symptoms classically are a severe sore throat, fever and NO cough.  Most viruses cause a cough.  It sounds like your first episode certainly had symptoms consistent with strep and it is certainly important to be treated for it.  The biggest reason to treat strep throat is to prevent rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease.  In your case, it sounds like you also have tested positive for strep when you were not having symptoms.  This make me think you are a carrier of strep in your throat.  There is a small percentage of people that have the strep bug living in their throat normally without causing infection.  This makes it difficult to tell when the strep is causing the infection and when it is simply there without causing the infection when symptoms are present.  It is important to let your doctors know that you are a strep carrier so that they can decide if strep may be causing your symptoms or if they really don't fit and you don't need treatment.  Given your repeated infections you may want to talk to your doctor about using an antibiotic called clindamycin for a 10 day course to see if you can irradicate the carrier state in your throat.  This is occasionally effective and may prevent the need for a tonsillectomy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sop22,  This actually is possible in one situation.  Normally, the eardrum separates the outer ear from the middle ear.  The middle ear drains to the nose via the eustachian tube.  In most situation the eardrum would keep the ear drops out of the middle ear and thus out of the nose.  However, if there were a hole in the eardrum (which can happen occasionally from infections or trauma) the drops could enter the middle ear then run down the eustachian tube into the nose.  It may be that you have small hole in your eardrum.  Your doctor can look for this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

First, the drain from the eye also goes to the nose so the drops may have been running through the ear into the nose and then back into the eye.  This is unlikely but theoretically possible.  More likely, the drops are getting into the nose as previously mentioned then irritating the nose making your eyes water and burn.  If it persists you may want to consider seeing an ophthalmologist or an ear, nose and throat doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I went to the walk in clinic and the doctor there told me that I probably have an inner ear infection and i'm going to the ENT doctor tomorrow. I can understand how the dizziness can result from an inner ear infection, but I can't understand how the other things that is happening can be from an inner ear infection. I guess I'll find out tomorrow, but since these doctors always seem to be in a hurry (because I live in Canada) I just want to know if an inner ear infection can cause vision and numbness problems.

I blew several times, but the tingling did not stop and there was no mucus on the tissue. I looked up my nose in a mirror and could not see anything. Finally I covered the opposite nostril and blew as hard as I could and a little brownish/yellowish spider shot out on to the floor.  I'm in Colorado Springs, CO and I was sleeping in a bedroom in a finished basement. The room has a large window well, and we're having the first snow of the season. I think the spider was just trying to find a warm place.  I've cleaned out that nostril with saline nasal spray and I've since covered the floor around the bed and window well in insecticide.  The two things I'm concerned about are eggs and bites. It's been 8 hours or so since the incident. My nose feels normal (apart from some minor irritation around the opening of the nostril, I think from all of the itching, blowing, & scratching I've done since the incident.)  I think if he had bit me I would know it by now (some symptoms would have manifested and they haven't), and if he had laid eggs or dropped an eggsack I'd be able to feel them or they would have washed out one of the 20 or so times I've rinsed my nose with nasal spray since then.  Do I have anything to worry about?\n\n",

    "title": "pressure headaches",
    "content": "I'm a 21 year old female. Last february I got a really bad cold. Ever since then I've been having what I guess are sinus problems. I got laryngitis in may and the doctor prescribed antibiotics because I told him about my sinus problems. When I started taking them, I got the worst sinus headaches of my life! I'm not sure if that's normal or not? I finished them and the symptoms got a little better. However, I still always have pressure and headaches between and behind my eyes and nose. I also constantly have phlegm in the back of my throat. I don't have any nasal drainage but I always feel stuffed up and can only breath through one nostril at night. It gets a lot worse if I don't get enough sleep or if I'm stressed. Lately, I've also been getting really lightheaded if I stand up too quickly. I'm beginning to get frustrated. Any ideas of what the problem might be?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You are right to suspect that your headaches are a manifestation of a possible sinusitis. However, when sinus type headache has been going on for some time (typically more than 14 days), you may have developed what is known as chronic sinusitis. This has to be confirmed by a CT scan but you may also need to determine what the infective organism is in order to treat it with the proper antibiotic. This is done by performing culture and sensitivity tests on sinus fluid aspirate.  If repeated antibiotic courses fail to treat your condition, other options include nasal glucocorticoid treatment, irrigation or sinus surgery in refractory and severe cases.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old female and for the past two months my left tonsil has been swollen and I have a gland in my neck that is also swollen. The gland is located on top of the muscle on the left side of neck and  I would say it is about the size of a pea mayble slightly larger than that. I can move it off the muscle and it is a little painful but not enough to really hurt. My throat on that side will sometimes be sore. I have always had problems with my tonsil on that side and I was mainly just wondering if the gland could be swollen because of my tonsil or if it could mean something else. My first thought after feeling the swollen gland was cancer and it really scared me. I was tested for mono and strep and both tests were negative. The gland has not grown in size and has pretty much stayed the same or some days it feels like it has gotten smaller but then another day it will be back to the size it was. I would feel much better if i knew whether or not it had to do with my tonsil and what signs i could look for to make sure it is not cancer. I am just really worried about why it has not gone back down to normal size.\n\n",

Cancerous lymph nodes are typically fixed (non-mobile), hard and painless.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on lymph nodes that you may find helpful.  It is located here.  The lymph node may be enlarged due to some ongoing inflammation in the tonsil.  It may also be that you have a chronic sinusitis that may be causing your lymph node to be enlarged.  I would suggest you follow up with your doctor to explore the possibility of something like chronic sinusitis.  This condition can be treated with antibiotics to help it resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 26 yo female with hypothyroidism and a nonsmoker.  In the past year I have had several cases of pharyngitis/tonsillitis that were treated with abx.  In the past month or so I have had tonsillitis and have been treated with 3 rounds of abx (keflex, cipro, and augmentin ..in this order).  I saw the best relief with augmentin.  The first 2 abx were given by my provider and the 3rd after I went to an ENT.  At my ENT appointment he took a culture (which was later negative...but to no surprise since I've been on abx).(They also advised me that I should remove my tonsils whenever was best for me.) After a week or so off Augmentin, my symptoms came back: pain upon swallowing, right side nodes under my chin tender/painful and swollen, and slightly swollen tonsil.  I notified my ENT and since the culture was negative they didn't prescribe another abx; instead prescribed methylprednisolone.  I haven't began the steroids because I'm afraid if I do have an infection that it will make it worse by taking a steroid since it might prevent me from fighting it.  My symptoms are getting a little worse as each day passes, but are tolerable so far.  Should I start the steroids? Thanks for listening :)  Tina\n\n",

    "title": "Recurring oro-antral fistula",
    "content": "Dear Doctor:  Six months ago an endodontist drilled a 10mm hole through my sinus and into the mucosa during an apico on number 14. I went first to an oral surgeon who ordered decongestant spray and antibiotics. He did not know that two weeks on the spray would result in a rebound effect that eventually got me to an ENT, where I complained of ear pain (I had blown my nose while congested and felt material enter the ear). The ENT took a CT scan that confirmed the hole but since sinuses were clear there was no treatment beyond steroids for the rebound. A few months later, with pain at the site of the now extracted tooth, both sinuses and horrible pain in the ear, I saw the same ENT. He entered the room having apparently decided nothing was wrong (I fear in an effort to protect the endodontist, since he and the oral surgeon who referred are friends). Still, he identified white drainage from the gum. Even so, he said my ear pain was likely TMJ and was very dismissive.  Three days later I saw a family physician about the now intolerable ear pain and his sinus x-ray revealed a white mass in the floor of the sinus. A new oral surgeon (in the same office as the first) saw the x-ray and decided to go in, suspecting a growth. He found an oro-antral fistula and performed a collagen-bone graft on one of the two smaller holes, not the 10mm at the apico site. I enjoyed a reduction in sinus pain for a couple of weeks but since ear pain and congestion--especially in eustachian tubes-- increased and I developed a perforated eardrum I had another CT scan with a different ENT, also close to the oral surgeon's office. After using the spray required prior to the scan I felt something small, flat and fairly rigid slide down that side of my throat. I thought it might be part of the bone graft as soon afterward the pain where the fistula had been began to increase and the pain at the floor of the sinus returned. The ENT says there is nothing on the CT scan, not even a hole. He said, \"If there was a hole there I would see it.\" I have all the signs of sinusitis, including two x-rays, but both doctors say the CT is definitive. Both the ENT and the oral surgeon deny any ear problem and perforation as they were diagnosed by a non-ENT.  I'm sorry this is so long but it's been a long event and we're unsure as to next steps. The oral surgeon says an ENT must find something and the ENT says to have the oral surgeon fix the fistula. I've read a review online of 27 articles on the treatment of oral-antral fistula and it does not mention a bone graft. The oral surgeon is considered he best in our area yet he told me not to get my information online. I'm stopping antibiotics today (with oral surgeon's approval) to let symptoms progress to the point that they're undeniable, but I'm unsure where to present them. Is bone graft an accepted treatment for oro-antral fistula? If not, should I see an oral surgeon or an ENT to determine if one of the other treatments are needed? Thanks so much for your kind consideration.\n\n",

I would add that your ear pain may actually be referred pain from a sinus or dental problem.  This is a very common cause of severe ear pain when the ear itself appears normal.  A perforation of the tympanic membrane is signaled by fluid leaking from the ear.  If you had this you almost certainly had a perforation.  These can heal spontaneously and may no longer be evident.  I would think that seeing an ENT doctor would be the best place for you although an oral surgeon is likely just as qualified.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 15 year old female, and my throat has been driving me crazy for almost half a year!  It almost feels like there's a dry, yet slimy lump in my throat. I'll often find myself gagging on it, or choking up little particles of food or phlegm.  It gets worse after I eat, because I feel like the food sticks in the back of my throat, and I'll be spitting up little globs of my meal afterwards.  This also causes me to feel like I have excessive saliva. I have to either swallow it constantly (it doesn't seem to go down naturally like it should), or spit into tissues. Because I can't open my mouth to have a conversation with it full of saliva, or it literally pours out!  I have gone to the doctor about this, but I keep getting   the responses of either \"it's anxiety\" or \"it's just allergies.\" I've been on medication for my anxiety and depression (Effexor) for about two months now, and I was taking Zyrtec for the longest time, but the problem still persisted as strong as ever!  I wake up in the middle of the night, spitting and coughing because of the excessive saliva and lump in my throat, and it's a feeling that drives me so insane I can't concentrate!  I'm upset because no one seems to take me seriously. I've looked on the internet for possible solutions, and the symptoms of a swallowing disorder (can't swallow saliva, lump in throat, food won't go down easily) seem to match me. Could this be it?  I just want to feel better. ): should I go to another doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 21yo female. I have had my bottom wisdom teeth surgically removed before they had erupted and my top back molars extracted so the top wisdoms can grow in their place. The right wisdom tooth has already erupted with no problems and the left one is just starting to erupt but I have noticed a werid taste that seems to come from the back of my throat when I exhale through my nose. Is it possible that the wisdom tooth could be causing this taste and possible bad breath even though there is no pain or inflammation associated with it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wazzagal,  It is possible that the wisdom teeth are responsible for this but I think it is unlikely.  I would recommend you see your dentist for an evaluation.  Sometimes these types of things are due to a dental infection.    A frequent cause of this is accumulation of bacteria and plaque on the back of the tongue.  Using a strong mouthwash consistently can help prevent/treat this.  Your dentist will likely be able to examine you and help determine what may be the cause of your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I've taken this drug for a month with no results)    Hello, I've been having some throat symptoms for over a month now and I'm beginning to get very concerned about them. The back of my throat is visibly redder than the front; there is a visible end to the redness where my normal throat color is present, closer to my mouth. I have what looks like a red vein going vertically down the back of my throat, and then branching off towards the bottom. Also on the back of my throat, slightly to the right of my uvula, there is a small bump, slightly smaller than a pea. I've had this small bump for almost 3 weeks now.   I was just wondering what these symptoms could possibly be a result of. I've seen my Doctor and he gave me an anti-inflammatory, MethylPREDNIsolone, which SLIGHTLY reduced the redness and inflammation, but did not make the small bump or pronounced \"vein\" go away. Also, after the drug reduced the swelling in my right tonsil, the bottom of the tonsil appears more bulbous than the rest of it.  I really want to know what is wrong with me. I know you can't diagnose me over the internet, but could you please give me some possibilities of what this could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kwikness,  There are a few possibilities that I can think of off hand.  First is that you may have a viral infection that is carrying a prolonged course (such as EBV).  Also, you may have reflux although I think, based on your description, this is probably less likely.    Another possibility is that your throat is irritated from the dry air.  This may especially be true if you breath through your mouth at night.  You may want to discuss with your doctor about having some tests done for the common viruses that may cause this.  If your problem persists, seeing and ear, nose and throat specialist may be necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 20 year old male.  For the past few days I have had some mild lightheadedness and intermittent headaches, which have also been fairly mild.  They haven't kept me from work or anything, so it hasn't been too bad.    I saw a doctor yesterday, and upon examining my ears she mentioned that the right one looked a little bloodshot, but not infected, although she said to be aware of it. Today I have noticed slight pain in that ear.  My question is: Are the symptoms I am having characteristic of an ear infection?  I thought perhaps she spotted one in its early stages and that might explain the lightheadedness as well.  Thanks for the help!\n\n",

But now it is about once or twice an hour and even then I constantly have to keep the mucus out of the very top of my throat (I can't explain how I do this but it is like blowing your nose but not following through.)   When I  Wake up on mornings, my throat feels slightly sore, I guess because the mucus is irritating it. This usually goes away after breakfast. The mucus is usually clear and thick (but not very thick).  Other than the runny nose, I don't feel sick, and have no pain. I am a 29 years old male.

    "content": "Hi Wg125,  There are a few possible things that may be causing your ongoing runny nose.  It may be that you now have a chronic sinusitis that needs some antibiotics for about 3 weeks to help clear up.  It may also be that you have some allergies contributing to the runny nose.  Usually a good physical examination and history can help distinguish between the two.  A simple home test for allergies is to try taking an over-the-counter allergy medicine such as diphenhydramine (Benadryl) or loratidine (Claritin).  If this helps a lot it is probably allergies.  If it doesn't help at all it is less likely to be allergies.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For about a month and a half now, when I lay down to sleep, doesnt matter whether im on my side, or back, and their is sound (quiet, but not whispering, either from tv or radio) on my left side, I get a crackling in my right ear. The crackling is associated with the noise, and if the volume increases, the speed of the cracking increases. This doesnt happen unless Im lying down, I've only noticed at night when I lay down. There is no pain involved, just a slight stuffy feeling, not to uncomfortable. I've noticed it off and on most of my life, but recently it has been every night. Any Idea on what this could be from??

This mostly cleared up in about 9 days. During recovering from the headaches, I developed a sore throat and have had it for about 2.5 wks now. It does not feel raw so much as inflamed and swollen. There is no puss on my tonsils, just a red throat. The back on my tongue is also sore, particularly the sides right at the back when I move my tongue. I have had a course of antibiotics (roxithromyicin) which did not touch the sore throat and have just had blood test to check for glandular fever (EBV & CMV) which my doctor does not seem to think I have. The sore throat will occasionally subside during the middle of the day and is much worse through the afternoon, night and morning.  It is also painful to swallow.  When my throat is very sore, there is also a dull ache in my ears I cough at night, though this is not consistent every night. The skin on my back tingles and is getting more painful. I have often had tingly skin on my back when fighting off a virus. My doctor seems at a bit of a loss at this point. Blood test results are due back in about 5 days. I currently take paracetemol to relieve the pain and am taking olive leaf extract and echinacea supplements. If you can help, that would be great! B\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 22-year-old white female in the midwestern US.  I was living in southern Japan over the summer (very hot and humid) and recently moved back to the Great Lakes area.  Soon after moving back, I developed a very tight throat near the back of my mouth(back of tongue and/or tonsil area), and post-nasal drip.  I started to lose my voice and had the sniffles and went to an urgent care center, where they diagnosed me with hay fever.  The doctor gave me Rhinocort Aqua and Claritin-D 24.  I took the Claritin for 2 days then stopped because it dried me out so much, took the Rhinocort for about 5 days and started feeling better, so I stopped taking it.  About 4-5 days after stopping it, the throat tightness and post-nasal drip came back, so I started taking it again.  I've now been taking it for about 12 days, and while the post-nasal drip has disappeared, my throat still feels tight.  Is this a normal symptom of hay fever?  I took some Benadryl Allergy and it seemed to help a bit, but the OTC allergy meds I see don't describe \"tight/swollen throat\" as an allergy symptom.  Is there anything else I can do to relieve this?  It gets so bad that I don't feel like doing anything.  It used to go away a bit when I ate, but now not as much (although it's not as severe now as before).  Is it really a symptom of hay fever, or something else?  It really worries me.  Both of my parents have hay fever/seasonal allergies, as does my brother.  However, none of them get the tight throat feeling like me.  I never had my tonsils out, but my doctor said they had pretty much disappeared just with age.  I know that I am sensitive to cigarette smoke and heavy dust (such as being near a cat box that has just been changed), but other than that I have never had seasonal allergies.  I usually spend a lot of time camping and being outdoors, so I really would like to clear this up or find out more about it as it has changed my lifestyle drastically :(    I'd really appreciate any insight.\n\n",

I recently was diagnosed with kidney stones and was put on Flowmax, oxycoton, and Nitrofur to pass the stones, the pain, and infection respectively. During the middle of taking these medications I had developed the feeling of a very swollen neck in which it was not really painful but just very hard to swallow and felt very unnormal.  I seem to think the problems went away for a while because I don't really think I suffered the feelings for the middle of august but now the feeling has returned and I am not on my medication anymore which I thought might have been causing it since it developed half way through my treatment.  I'm not on anything anymore and haven't been since the first week in August when the feeling developed. Sometimes it is very sore while other times I can hardly feel it. It is very hard to deal with since I did just have kidney stones and am supposed to be taking in a lot of fluids which I am not doing because of the feeling I have swallowing so much so quickly.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KJ8742,  There are a few reasons people develop these types of feelings.  It may be that you have some swollen tissue in the throat giving this sensation.  This can occur with an infection (viral or bacterial) or with an allergic reaction.  Reflux can also cause this feeling by inflaming the esophagus.  Less commonly, it may actually be a stuck portion of food that is causing the symptoms.  I would recommend you see your doctor about this for an evaluation.  You may need to see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for further evaluation if your primary doctor feels it is necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Worried Wife,  My first thought was reflux; however, it sounds as if he has had an appropriate treatment for this without response.  If reflux is still being considered a study called a 24 hour pH probe may be helpful.  This is where a pH probe is placed in the esophagus for 24 hours.  During this time it measures how often the pH drops indicating stomach acid has refluxed into the esophagus.  Occasionally, severe reflux does not fully respond to medications and a surgery called a fundoplication can be very helpful.  A bronchoscopy is probably also appropriate to get a better look at what is going on in the airway. The bronch can also give good information about reflux and many other things.  Persistence is key.  Usually, the answer is finally found.  I cannot link the groin, neck and back pain together with the cough.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lauren Belle,  The surgery you had is called a fundoplication.  It is when part of the stomach is wrapped around the esophagus to tighten the lower esophageal sphincter and reduce or prevent reflux.  This surgery is generally quite effective but it can come loose occasionally.  If you still have the inability to vomit it is likely still intact but it may be worth investigating this.  It may be worth trying an antacid medication for a little while to see if this improves your symptoms.  Reflux is certainly a common cause of an irritated throat and cough.  If your symptoms persist you may want to see a GI specialist.  There are a few other conditions that can cause these feelings, such as eosinophilic esophagitis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lilonething,  Fluid in the (middle) ear can come from the nasal cavity or be secreted by the lining of the ear canal.  The Eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nose allowing pressure to equalize.  If it becomes inflamed it can begin to not open well and cause fluid to be unable to drain properly.  Chronic fluid in the ear is termed a middle ear effusion.  This fluid may be infected causing an acute ear infection or may not be infected and just sitting there.  In this case, sometimes it can be enough to cause some pressure changes that can cause pain.  This pain is usually more like the pain one would get when taking off or landing in an airplane (due to pressure differences on the two sides of the ear drum).  Occasionally, using a nasal steroid (such as an allergy medicine like nasal fluticasone (Flonase)) can help open the Eustachian tube and drain the fluid.  If the fluid is persistent you may want to see an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.  The sudden, sharp pain seems less likely to be from the fluid in your ear or pressure differences.  I think you are probably right that the pain may actually be referred pain from a jaw or tooth problem.  This is a very common cause of sudden onset ear pain.  In this case, seeing your doctor or dentist about your jaw issues can help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When I go to eat I choke at least three times during a meal or whenever I am drinking water or anything. I almost choked to death at my parents house.  My food was chewed well, but got lodged in my throat some how, I couldn't breath and I had all these red spots on my face. I started choking on my food a year before that and it's six months after that  incident happened and I am still choking. I eat carefully and it's not something I am anticipating.   Sometimes when I try to swallow it burns and goes down other times when I try to swallow it burns and it keeps pushing the food up. It's really kind of embarrassing eating in front of people, because of this.  When I am not eating or drinking I sometimes get this acid taste that comes up...  Can anyone tell me what's going on??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nescrew,  There are a few possible reasons for difficulty swallowing food.  There is a condition called acholasia where the muscles of the esophagus do not contract properly.  This can cause the symptoms you are experiencing.  Another condition, that is becoming more well known, is eosinophilic esophagitis.  This is a condition that is thought to arise from a food allergy.  I would recommend that you see a GI specialist for further evaluation.  There are generally clinics in town that will see patients on a free or reduced fee basis for those without insurance or reduced finances.  Your local health department can point you to these if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My food was chewed well, but got lodged in my throat some how, I couldn't breath  The probabilites are already very well explained by Dr Lowe.   There are couple of more conditions I can think of -   TOF i.e Tracheo-esophageal fistula - Something (infection, trauma etc) must have lead to formation of a tract between esophagus (food passage) and trachea (airway passage). So a part of eaten food ends up landing in trachea giving rise to chocking.  Palatal palsy can cause similar symptoms in some people.  You need a clinical examination and couple of investigations including xray(barium) to rule out TOF.  TOF can be surgically corrected.\n\n",

You said far too little to narrow it down to what is likely.  How old are you?  Any medications?  Why do you spit in the morning?  Any taste in your mouth?  Smoke or chew tobacco or use drugs?  Possibilities include tuberculosis, cancer, various lung diseases.  Are you sure that you are not bleeding from somewhere in your mouth, nose or throat?  Don't wait for online advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Umbrellachch,  It may be that you have a functional eustachian tube dysfuction where it does not open and close properly.  This sometimes is caused by inflammation of the eustachian tube.    Swallowing often causes the tube to open allowing the air pressure in the middle ear to equalize with the outside air.  It may be that if you have fluid trapped behind the ear drum (in the middle ear) it may be amplifying the sound causing the popping sound you are hearing.  The eustachian tube connects to the nose not the mouth  so it is unlikely that you are drawing fluid out of the eustachian tube into the mouth by sucking.  You may want to see an Ear, Nose and Throat (ENT) doctor for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They are the same shape, color and size, but they are not the same texture.  When you squeeze them, they smear instead of crumble.  I usually get one or two a week, mostly in the mornings.  This has never really bothered me as it\u2019s happened for so long and it doesn\u2019t seem to hurt me. Also, occasionally I have really bad breath.  I mean bad enough to make riding in a car with me a horrible experience.  I can never explain it though, because I have good dental hygiene and everything. This morning, right after I finished brushing my teeth, I coughed up one of those little things \u2013 this one was a little larger than normal.  I hadn\u2019t eaten anything smelly and just brushed, so I had good breath.  I noticed when I was examining the little thing I just coughed up that I smelled that infamous bad breath smell.  Now I think the occasion bad breath and the little things might be related. Any ideas what this could be?\n\n",

The \"crushed peanut\" like stuff is pus from the tonsil(s) this pus smells VERY fowl, and when the pus builds up [in] my tonsil or both sometimes my breath is terrible. My throat feels smaller, I have a hard time swallowing. This started when I was young, I used to call the pus \"brains\" because that is what they usually look like.  I bought a water pick a few years ago after making my tonsils blead from trying to dig the pus out with a folded out bobbipin, I thought if I stuck the water pick in the hole where the pus comes out it would be easier that digging. It has now gotten to the point where I think the holes have grown becasue I can now get alot of it out by pushing around the tonsil with my finger. I am so sick of this, will an ENT doctor remove my tonsils if ask and tell him what I just posted??\n\n",

Does this sound like a serious issue or is there nothing I can do about it?  Thank you so much for your time.  -Lizzer\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 year old female and have not really been given a clear diagnosis.  I have had peritonsilitis (diagnosed by a specialist) twice in the past but have had no problems for over a year until now.  My throat has now been full of mucus and not painful but very uncomfortable for a few weeks.  I kept watching it because I now know what peritonsilitis look like.  I was tired but not sick really for the last couple of weeks.  Several days ago, the pus pockets finally showed themselves.  Only this time they are actually on my tonsil, not on the arches surrounding the tonsils.  My right tonsil was enlarged.  I went to the doctor.  I did have a fever but didn't even realize it.  She put me on high doses of amoxicillin because I told her that last time, the first round of it didn't kill it last time i had peritonsilitis.  I eventually had to go on megadoses.  So she upped the dose just to be sure.  I fell okay and my tonsil is less enlarged.  However, the sores continue to appear and there is also a blister on the tonsil.  They don't get better even though I have been on amoxicillin for since friday afternoon.  It is getting more painful to swallow because of the blister.  Nobody in my family has had a tonsillectomy although there was some discussion about doing so on my brother several years back.  Basically, I just want to know if I should go see a specialist or just hope that the antibiotics eventually do the job.  I don't think I actually have an abscess because I have not gotten sicker and my tonsil does seem to be getting smaller.  But I did want to know if there was a chance that I still might have one or am at risk of developing one if the blisters and pus pockets are not drained.  When I went to the doctor, she did not drain or culture them.\n\n",

She seems to agree but all she did is put me on a stronger antibiotic.  I am still worried because all the sources I consulted said that draining the abscess is usually best.  But she doesn't want to do that for some reason.  Opinions would be greatly appreciated.  I am trying to avoid it but if I should go and see an ENT, then I will.  The pus pockets continue to appear and get larger and are now covering my tonsil to the point that I can't tell if it is enlarged or just covered in blisters and sores.  The peritonsillar area continues to get reader and larger.  It has already bee going on for a couple of weeks.  So I am uneasy about just sitting back and waiting on the antibiotics.  Anyone agree with the doc that that is the best thing to do?\n\n",

I have also had xrays & they found nothing.   2) Lately I have started to get headaches on the LEFT side of my head.   3) Latley I am getting RECURRING nosebleeds (about 1-2 times per week) ONLY in my LEFT nasal.

Current Medications: None  I am generally a healthy person. I don't remember when I got fever last time. I get headaches sometimes and I know the reasons. Most of the times on empty stomach or under heated sun. Other than that I haven't had any health problems.   I think I am a little overweight. I weigh around 210 pounds and my height is 6 feet 1 inch.  I have been having this issue since six months. I don't know when it started, it started with general cough that lasted for 4 days. From then on, it has been occasional. I never coughed until then in my whole 34 years of life.  I consulted doctor and took medicines but with no respite. He gave medicines related to gas, plegm etc.,. I even took a chest x-ray that revealed nothing.  I don't have it all the time. All of a sudden it comes and lasts until I take some cough syrup. It subsides gradually. Most of the times it is before I sleep in the night. I feel like some discomfort in my chest, so I squeeze and throw sputum after I cough. I feel relaxed for sometime and then it happens again. I seem to certainly get it when I eat food that contained milk, yogurt/curd. Even if I eat sugar, I get it.  Please note the following  1. Chest Xray revealed nothing when I was having the cough. 2. I feel like something blocking (sputum) in my chest when I cough. It gets cleared once I throw it. 3. It's not continuous. I normally get it before I sleep. Everything looks normal until I get it.   My doctor has no clue about it. He says everything is alright probably I am allergic to certain foods. But I didn't have this problem earlier, until 6-7 months back.  Your help or further directions can be of great respite to me.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sick Sue,  Hearing deficits can come from 2 different mechanisms.  It can be a decrease in air conduction/bone conduction of sounds in the ear or a decrease in recognition/transmission of sounds by the nerve system.    I have a few thoughts.  One would be that you may want to see an audiologist to get a formal hearing test done to distinguish between the conduction vs. nerve hearing loss.  If it is of the nerve variety I would recommend you see a neurologist.    If it is of the conduction variety, following up with the ENT doctor is the way to go.  If you do have conduction hearing loss it may be due to increased pressure in the middle ear, either from fluid or air.  In this case, it may be due to eustachian tube dysfunction.  The Allegra is aimed at reducing allergies and nasal clogging to help open the eustachian tube up.  It may also be helpful to try a nasal steroid spray to reduce any inflammation of the eustachian tube.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I've noticed that the raised area behind my right ear (the mastoid process, yes?) is swollen in comparison to the one on the left; after touching it for a period of time, it feels mildly uncomfortable, sensitive, and feels 'enlarged' (even without touching it) - it becomes slightly pink and aches a bit, after being touched.  On its own, it isn't pink- just swollen a bit it seems.  While not visible, It feels as though, under the skin, there is a small, soft, fleshy raised area, on top of the mastoid process here, which is absent on the other ear. I have no other symptoms.  I'm a 29-yr old woman, in good health, and have only ever had one ear infection, if you can call it that.....  I can't remember which ear it was in, but: it was a painless blocking of the ear that impaired hearing in that one ear, usually for a day at a time - it would clear up overnight, and then return a couple of days later.  I had no other symptoms, and didn't seek treatment -- and it took several weeks to go away, but it finally did - this ended about four months ago.  My question is -- rather than being some kind of rare mastoiditis, is it likely that my lymph node in this area is swollen?  I've looked up the retroauricular nodes, and can't seem to figure out if they're ever underneath the mastoid process (thus pushing it up?), or can swell beside or on top of it.... or where they are! (If it were mastoiditis, wouldn't I have more symptoms than this?)  Thanks so much, Eirys\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Eirys,  You are correct that this is very unlikely to be mastoiditis.  Mastoiditis almost always occurs in conjunction with an ear infection.  It causes the mastoid to be painful to touch (not just a little sore).  As you have thought, you are likely feeling a retroauricular lymph node.  These lymph nodes are on top of the mastoid bone area and can be felt through the skin.  It may be that you have been exposed to an infection and are fighting it off.  If it begins to become painful or is getting larger you may want to have your doctor take a look at it.  Generally, these lymph nodes will resolve on their own, although they may remain large enough to feel.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Can anyone help me out as to what it may be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nikei3ball,  There are a few causes including chronic sinusitis or obstructions in the nose such as may occur from a deviated nasal septum or other areas of narrowing.  Seeing an ENT (ear, nose and throat) doctor may be beneficial to figure out what is going on.  If needed, they can use a very small rope-like camera to look inside the nasal passages for any obstructions or other causes of problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,in October, I had the flu and I had prescription drugs to take so I could recover, it wasn't a very bad flu but it was bad I guess you could say. Anyway after I stopped taking the prescription pills I got this lump on my right tonsil. It doesn't hurt, and I've been told cancer lumps are hard, and this lump in actually soft, it sort of gets bigger one day and smaller the next day. But lately its been smaller then usual. So I'm wondering if my tonsils some how had a reaction to the prescribtion pills, and they are trying to heal themselves.  I also am a singer so I am wndering if by opening my mouth and sucking in all the bacteria if that is not helping at all and if I should do something to help heal them.  1, I'm 18.  2. I'm female.  3. Never had any major surgeries. Only 40 stitches to the head.  5. Family history: the only known record is diabietes, no signs of cancer.  6.

There may be an infection in them or they may simply be reacting to a pathogen that they are helping the body fight off to prevent infection.  If you are not having any pain or problems from this it is probably fine to watch and see if it goes back to normal on its own.  If you are having problems or pain, or if the lump is getting bigger/not going away you should probably have it checked out just to be sure all is well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "hoarseness and tingling/tight feeling very low in throat?",
    "content": "I am a 37 year old female. 6 weeks ago I noticed my voice cracking a bit and getting hoarse on and off. It has continued but then 3 weeks ago I started having this burny/tingling/tight almost choky type feeling very low in throat, like right above my collar bone. I notice it bothers me most if I breathe in and out via mouth,especially on the exhale. Same with if I speak for extended times,especially on the exhale of a word or the ending of a word, like sometimes I can't complete the last syllable or something. It does not feel like a typical sore throat and I am not sick w/ a cold or fever,etc. Saw my primary doc. He looked it over and asked if I was under stress and said he felt it was just stress related but if it didnt go away in 1 wk to see ENT. So I then saw ENT. He used tube down my nose to see throat,said esophagus was irritated and it was silent reflux.Told me to take mylanta 4x per day (I am nursing baby so he said that he didnt want to prescribe a stronger med). I followed that,maybe felt a bit improved but not too much so I again saw doc,but different one in practice. She said I had fluid behind my ears and believed I had allergies causing this so she put me on Allegra and told me to take saline nose drops. That was a few days ago. Again maybe a bit improvement but still there.  I guess I would like to know if something is being missed and is there a test I should be asking for. Or do you agree with one of these docs ?It is a very irritating feeling. And now I am worrying about a more serious disease like a throat cancer or lung cancer (my mom has lung cancer,non smoker, so that concerns me, but would this even be a symptom, I am a never smoker). Also would the ENT have ruled out a larynx or throat cancer based on what he can see using that tube??The feeling does seem worse some times of day and not as annoying other times. I am also noticing now that I do feel some drip from my back of nose to throat.  Thank you for any advice.\n\n",

    "content": "I would tend to think that your ENT doctor is correct about your symptoms.  If he saw what looks like reflux using the camera this is very likely to be the case.  Reflux also nicely explains your symptoms.  The other options really don't expalin them that well.  Unfortunately, for reflux to the degree that it is causing symptoms such as yours, it is less likely that a simple over the counter antacid will help much.  Both pepcid and zantac are safe during breastfeeding.  If you need something stronger prilosec is also probably safe.  Prevacid has less studies on it so the official classification is unknown about safety.  A cancer is much less likely if he is seeing reflux associated inflammation.  I would recommend follow up with your ENT doctor and trying a stronger antacid.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I got worried and was not sure if that is related to this then being something more serious or is that likely unrelated and is that common? I asked my OB who is a friend of mine b/c I was unable to reach this original doc. He said that anything from having a glass of wine (I never drink BUT that night before bloodwork I did drink a glass of wine) to some medications could cause that. I was also taking the Mylanta right before I went to appointment and I took the Claritan. Would you know whether any of those could give liver function results like that or can you tell me if you think it is related to the symptoms I described? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Many things can cause a slight amount of elevation in the liver enzymes.  I don't suspect it was a high elevation since they want to to simply repeat them in a month.  As your OB has suggested, drinking alcohol can cause them to raise a little (though I would not expect a single glass of wine to do much).  Medications can also affect the liver.  Additionally, there are many viruses that can cause liver enzyme elevation.  These are typically harmless and may only make you feel as if you have a slight cold (or you may feel nothing at all).  I would not be too concerned about this.  I don't think it is likely to be related to your initial symptoms.  Having them checked again in a month is a very reasonable approach.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I just wondered if in anyone's opinion here if it could be from the buildup of wax,or if any other members with the same problem experience this feeling?   Last nite I also started not feeling good at the movies. Maybe it was the way I was sitting-sitting up for awhile or something that triggered it,I don't know. But when I got home,I experienced a tight or heavy feeling in my chest,back,etc... and I was having some numb/tingly feelings in my hands-I've mainly felt that way in my left hand and I felt a heaviness in my right arm. I felt a heaviness-pressure in my head too. I've had some ear pain too-mainly my right ear,and last nite I noticed that my neck hurt on that side when I touched it. I feel like it's from my ear. Anyway,I just wanted to post this here for opinions and feedback. Thanks.  Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Dear hippiewitch, It seems to me that you may have more than one issue to contend with. I would like to address your concern about your ear, and the pain on the right side of your neck.  If you have been fighting the buildup of excess ear wax for some time, I would be interested in knowing if you had taken measures on your own to get rid of it before your doctor prescribed the drops you now put in your ear.  Many people use cotton swabs to \"clean out their ears\" not realizing that there are dangers to doing so. Cotton swabs have been known to puncture ear drums, and to leave pieces of the swab cotton behind in the ear canal.  Most of us were taught at some time during childhood to never put anything smaller into your ear than your elbow!  We may laugh about it, but the dangers of causing damage to the ear is very real.  Ear infections in the middle ear can lead to eustacian tube infections both of which can cause pain and discomfort from the ear all the way down the neck. The drops your doctor prescribed probably are designed to soften the inner ear wax so it can be gently flushed away.  If an infection was already brewing behind the ear wax buildup, now getting worse and causing discomfort in your ear and neck, then you may need antibiotic drops as well.  Please let your doctor know of your current symptoms so he/she can prescribe the best treatment to help you heal.\n\n",

A friend of mine informed me that you're not supposed to use cotton swabs though after doing ear candling. I most definitely didn't leave anything in my ears.   My doctor instructed me to use debrox eardrops and I already had some. That is what I used.

The purpose of the drops is to gently soften the wax so the the irrigation at the Doctor's office would be the most effective possible.  If you also have an infection in the middle or inner ear, the blockages from the wax plus an infective process could account for the strange feelings, you were complaining about.  When the Doctor flushes out the wax on Monday, she will be able to better see the inner part of your ear and discuss any other concerns you may have at that time.  Consider staying away from milk until seen on Monday.\n\n",

    "content": "Hx: hiatal hernia, acid reflux x 4 years, tonsillectomy ('93), C4/5-C6/7 bulging disc/fusion/degeneration  The pain I am having is in the larynx/upper tracheal area.  It aches at about a 1/10 on a pain scale all the time.  The pain increases to 4/10 at the end of inhalation and the beginning of exhalation.  The back of my throat has a moderate collection of mucous.  I more often than not wake up hoarse and with a soar throat from my acid reflux. My voice is continuing to be mildly hoarse throughout the day.  I do have episodes of eathing something starchy or dry and it hurts down the top third of my sternum.  I'm not sure it's related, but it thought it best to include it.  Thank you for taking the time to read this and give me your input!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ryann, Has there ever been any discussion, when talking to your ENT (Ear/Nose/Throat) Specialist or Gastroenterologist about your acid reflux about:  Laryngospasms or Esophageal spasms?  Sometimes an injury to the larynx or esphagus (such as you have experienced and continue to experience as a result of the acid reflux) can result in hypersensitive nerve endings. These can cause a spasm when the body interprets a foreign matter (perhaps even the phlegm you mention) as a threat, and it practically shuts off the larynx and esophageal areas protectively.  This can be felt in any number of ways - and you list several as those you have experienced.  Sometimes very hot, very cold or even very \"dry\" can cause spasms. The treatments for this can be simple or complex depending on the severity of your symptoms.  You may wish to call your Doctor and see if it is a good idea to have this evaluated in person.\n\n",

At first they thought it was parotitis but it wasn't. I keep getting infection  and swelling on my left side of my neck where the mass is and this time it was the worst infection. When the swelling and infection is not there you can still feel the mass and I told them its not normal. I always had told them to take it out since I keep getting swelling and infection and also find out what that mass is. Can this also be a stone or some sort of blockage? I went for ct scan and just waiting for result and surgery date to remove the gland. He wants to remove the gland due to frequent infection and mass.\n\n",

Another is that you are feeling an enlarged lymph node that has scarred and now will not reduce in size.  Given your recurrent infections it seems reasonable to proceed with the CT and surgery to remove the mass.  I think, given that it has been present for 2 years, the likelihood of cancer is quite low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have continued to suffer from headaches since then and only yesterdqay I was chatting to my new GP and she asked if the swelling in my right maxillary was investigated also i noticed the word ''polyp'' and ''unknown'' on the report.This visit came about to my GP due to persisant pain in all parts of my body and an anal fissure and a general feeling of unwellness I had a blood test came back fine except somthing to do with creatinine which she said was nothing of concern and a secondary blood test would be just mandatory.Another symptom is my right eye twiches alot and hurts alot behind the eye every now and then this has really got worse in the last 4 weeks she has reffered me to ENT Specialist.  I guess my question is should i be worried about this?? can this swelling go into my brain? can i go blind if untreated? I would really appreciate any answers that would at leat put my mind to rest as the sensations my body are giving me are really uncomftable to say the least ...thank you\n\n",

    "content": "The condition you are referring to with the herpes virus is known as Ramsay-Hunt syndrome when it involves the nerve that supplies hearing to the ear.  This same nerve is also associated with the balance center of the ear.  It's possible that you have this but I think it is less likely.  Given that it started rapidly, I think it is more likely that you have an otolith or small stone that is lodged in the canals of the inner ear.  The stone then continues to stimulate the balance center causing the dizziness.  This generally will resolve on its own but a doctor can do some maneuvers to try to dislodge it.  Also, rapid onset does not necessarily exclude infection.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a question about swollen lymph node. I get swollen lymph nodes on my left side 2 to 3 times a year. My entire neck gets swollen and have a lump that feels hard as a rock. It will get hard like this when it swells up. When it swells severely it's hard to move my neck because it feels like the skin is streching. The last time this happen my doc gave me meds and if it get red and hot go to er,the next day it happen,the er gave me 2 shots of antibotics and predisone and finish the round of anitbotic and predisone. I had very bad case of infection. The following day went back to er because it was very swollen and could not move my neck side to side so I was given another shot of antibotic and see ENT for follow up. This was last year. Now again I going thru same thing starting to swell and have very hard lump near lymph node on the left side. My ENT in the past told me if it happens again that he will remove the lymph node on my left side due to getting recurring bad infections. He did not want to do surgery last year because of scarring,he didn't like young women having scars on the neck. I see my pcp tomorrow for a new referral to ENT being that I have infection again and the other does not want to do surgery due to his fear of leaving a scar on a young women. I don't care about scars, I just want this to stop. I am tired of getting shots on my rear side every time it gets bad because I can't take oral antibotics and tired of it getting infected. My right side is normal. Will this help if I get this remove? What causes infections in the left side of lymph node? This is been going on for aleast 3 or 4 years or more. Is there some sort of test to figure out why this infection appears? I am going for round of antibotic shots tomorrow afternoon and know more what my pcp will say.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  I agree with your doctor I don't think you should have it removed so readily. In your post you seem to have asked all the right questions. Removing a lymph node is not the answer to a recurring infection. The lymph nodes are actually a line of defence against the infection. You should establish the cause of the recurring enlargement before you go any further. If you suffer from a repeated infection it is important to know why. Some questions that should be answered first: are you at risk of developing a certain type of infection?  Unless the cause of your infection is obvious I think you should discuss the options available for further evaluation of your case. This may include ultrasonography or CT scan.  Good luck and best regards.\n\n",

I tried augmentin orally due to gastroparesis I am not suppose to take oral antibotic because it flares it up. I told my pcp being that I havn't had a flare up in a year that I would try orally big mistake because I wind up in the ER. I couldn't stop vomiting,so I was given zofran to hold me off until Monday when I can call ent and pcp. My white cell count is high and the only way to bring it down and get rid of infection is iv antibotics thru outpatient. I need to see ent to see why this contiue to happen and prevent this from occuring due to my gastroparesis problem. We need to prevent further infection being that infection and meds can flare up my gastroparesis to a point of hospitalization. I am trying to avoid hospitalization as much as possible but if this infection does not go away and gastroparesis keeps up then hospitalization is the only results. Question: I work in a hospital and in contact with ill patient and not so ill patient being that I have problems with my inmunne system right now is ok to go into isolation rooms and is it ok to clean off their tables and set them up to eat without gloves? The one thing that gets to me is the glove part of cleaning off table for them so they can eat and my supervisors does not want us to be wearing glove because it wastes too much time and we have to see patients for consult for nutrition. I do wash my hands every time I clean a table with some sort of alcohol base product and soap and water. I am aways washing my hands. Can this mode of (cleaning off patients tables) be introduction for infection? Is there anything else I can do besides asking for CT scan?\n\n",

My heart rate went crazy yesterday,had fever,headches,swelling,and sinus infection but the er doc told me I have no infection anywhere and that I am fine but have parotitis infection and want to give me oral antibotic but can not handle any oral antibotics and gave me iv antibotic before discharge and for me to figure out the rest. The er doc was not happy about giving me iv antibotic he wanted me to take oral and if I get sick from it then I can come back he said. The reason for my heart rate is because of the infection but he still claims I don't have infection because it didn't show up on my blood test he said. So now I am confused to whether I have infection or not. My pcp and the er doc from Saturday said that I do have bacteria infection and this one said no infection.

Though it could be just a mouth sore (canker) which will heal on its own in about 10 days, there is always the possibility you could have a strep infection which would require antibiotics.  Most people will have a fever but some do not so if the pain is great you may want to go to a clinic to have this tested.  You may get some relief with a salt water gargle.  Just mix a little salt with some warm water, swish and spit.  Repeat this a few times.  You can also take pain relievers such as acetaminophen.  Good luck.\n\n",

Then it got longer and lasted for an hour. After that, it would last for hours and eventually it would last for days. I was miserable.  I went to my PCP. He looked into my ears and then recommended an ENT.  I went to an ENT and he said I needed a septoplasty. I knew that my nasal passages had always been blocked but I asked about my ears especially since he looked into them. He only said that I should stop using Q-tips and that was it!!!  Months later I called up that ENT to talk more about the septoplasty and I found out that he retired.  I went back to my PCP about the clogged up ears. He looked into my ears again and then recommended me another ENT that was actually in the same practice.   This time, this new ENT looked into my ears and the first thing she said was that I had ear wax build up. She then put a solution into my ears and then vacuumed it out.  That instantaneously fixed my my clogged ears problem and I hear fine and I can even sleep any way I want to (putting my head down in a certain way would immediately clog up a ear).  But what I was really pissed about was my PCP and the first ENT. They both examined my ears and they both listened to my explanation on what was wrong but they didn't have a clue what it was. And I lived through this misery for almost two years.  And then my brother tells me that he had the same problem except a nurse at his university immediately identified it and did the exact same thing to fix it.  I guess that I am just pissed that a doctor and a specialist couldn't identify something that was really simple.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several causes of the \"need to pop\" sensation in the ears.  It may be related to clogged ear canals increasing the pressure on the outside fo the drum as in your case but generally it is a mixed issue.  The external ear canal can play a large role in this but generally the eustachian tube is also involved.  It may be worthwhile discussing using a nasal steroid (commonly used to treat allergies) to see if any inflammation in the eustachian tube can be reduced allowing the middle ear (behind the ear drum) to drain better and more properly regulate the ear pressure.  Also, there are some home wax removal solutions that can be purchased over-the-counter that you can try if your symptoms begin to return.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Generally, excessive nose bleeding is due to inhalation of dry air leading to drying of the nasal mucosa.  This causes the mucosa to be very brittle and bleed easily.  There are several nasal moisturizers available over-the-counter that range from saline nasal sprays to gels.  All are fairly effective.  Another, less likely possibility is a condition called Von Willebrand's syndrome.  This condition causes the platelets to not be able to work as well due to a deficiency of Von Willebrand's factor.  Generally, this condition presents with frequent mucosal bleeding such as nosebleeds.  It is one of the most common bleeding disorders so it may be worthwhile to check for.  It can be tested for with a blood test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The answer to your first question is dependent upon the degree of blockage you have in your nasal passages due to the deviated septum.  Repairing the septum will likely open the nasal passages up and make it easier to keep the pasage ways clear of congestion.    If this was the main reason for your mouth breathing and the surgery opens the nasal passages enough it will very likely help your breathing at night.  There is also a possibility that it may not be enough to help but I suspect you'll be pleased with the results.  Regarding your second question, the surgical team is quite familiar with people being anxious about surgery.  If your anxiety is severe you may want to discuss this with your anesthesiologist.  You may be able to take a mild anxiolytic before the surgery to help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In fact, I barely remember anything about it.  As for the septoplasty, I haven't gotten the improved results yet. In fact, I felt more congested than ever. I got Claritin D and it helped clear up the congestion a bit. In fact, that night I finally blew my nose and like a thick ten inch blood snot came out of my nose.  I have been spitting so much blood snot since the surgery that it has made it difficult for me to sleep.  But now I am starting to feel that there is a tremendous more air flow through my nose.  So here is another question. How do I become a nose breather instead of a mouth breather. I have lived 38 years as a mouth breather so even with the the septoplasty, is becoming a nose breather something that I have to learn?\n\n",

Today I was sitting in class and I swallowed my saliva and heard a kind of cracking or popping sound and now, since that point, any time I try to swallow anything, I get this sharp near-unbearable pain in my left ear area and end up choking on whatever I was trying to swallow.   Up until this point, there had been some slight discomfort in that area when I swallowed for the past week or so and I just let it be thinking that it was related to the toothache I have on the upper part of that side of my mouth. After today though, I'm convinced that it's something in my ear.  Any idea what this could be?\n\n",

    "content": "You may have a middle ear infection.  The eustachian tube connects the middle ear to the nose.  Swallowing causes pressure changes in the ear via this tube.  With an infection this can be quite painful.    Tooth pain may be related to an ear infection also.  Commonly pain from the ear is referred to the teeth.  If it has been going on for more than a few days, the likelihood of spontaneous resolution is less and you may require antibiotics.    Decongestant medicines may help clear the eustachian tube if it is clogged but given your pain I think this is less likely.  A clogged eustachian tube often gives the feeling of an ear that needs to \"pop\" but can't.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Often ear infections follow an upper respiratory infection.  Typically what happens is first the nose gets congested, then the eustachian tube is not as able to drain fluid.  This fluid then becomes a media for bacteria to grow in causing the infection.  Colds are not required for ear infections, though.  They can arise spontaneously.  This is less common but does happen.  Unfortunately, I am not familiar with the details of the Canadian health system so I can't give you any advice about how to proceed.  One note for you.  Typically, ear infections will improve on their own.  Much less commonly, they can proceed into an infection of the bony area behind the ear (termed mastoiditis).  This can be a severe complication so if you begin to develop tenderness behind your ear you really need to be evaluated.  Tylenol and ibuprofen can be helpful for pain control until it resolves.

I cannot fully explain it but perhaps when you turn your head a certain direction it causes the pressure in the artery near your ear to increase making the pulsing audible.  If this were the case it is likely to be annoying but not dangerous.  The cervical bruit is a little more concerning as it may indicate a narrowing of your carotid artery.  If you have not had a doppler ultrasound I would recommend you have this performed.  The MRA would likely have picked this up but if it were lower than the MRA scanned it may have been missed.

For example, if you have only bone problems with no nerve problems, the surgeons may be able to help fix this problem.  Cochlear implants are relatively new and are a possible treatment for those that don't have nerve hearing problems.  The implant bypasses the damaged part of the ear and directly stimulates the cochlea to transmit sound.  I'm a little uncertain as to why your hearing aids would be causing you to have balance problems.  I would recommend you discuss this with your audiologist.

As far as post op instructions, I was advised to irrigate 3 times daily; Morning noon and night. I am irrigating more than that because I can feel the discharge building up and want to clear it out. This is why I asked about irrigating too much.  I'll call my Surgeon first thing in the morning though, and thanks agin.\n\n",

I drove myself to the closest EMS station, and they insisted on transport to the ER  Doc thinks he sees the bleed from a turbinate and uses Silver Nitrate to cartorize (sp)  Still bleeds.  45 minutes after the bleed starts, the Doc \"SHOVES\" what feels like a large tongue depressor into my right nostril, then starts dripping saline onto it. Felt like the thing was touching the back of my throat.  Now, I have packing in my nose, again.  Placed on more Levaquin 500mg (7day prescrip), and was told to get to my ENT Surgeon first thing Tues.  Just when I thought I was finally improving.... this happens. Kind of reinforces my opinion that the surgery that was supposed improve my quality of life, has only deteriorated it.  Any opinion as to why the turbinate would bleed so profusely, so long after the surgery? There was no trauma to my nose that could have caused it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  You've been through quite an awful time these past few weeks. Your symptoms may have been as a result of an infection in the sinuses post-op or simply a concurrent flu or cold virus. However it is important to consider the possibility that your symptoms are simply your original chronic sinusitis symptoms returning. Unfortunately the type of surgery you had, despite being the best option is not always curative and in many cases symptoms return. The nasal bleeding may have been due to irritation from constant irrigation or dry air creating a friable nasal mucosa, in other words the skin on the inside of the nose is delicate and the combination of recent surgery, local friction and possible infection may have broken down the skin. You describe what sounds like a nasal pack in your nose. This is the standard initial treatment for uncontrollable nose bleeds. It is placed up one or two nostrils and expands on contact with liquids such as the saline you were given. Do not worry too much about this, but I recommend you go back to your surgeon and explain to him what happened so that he can thoroughly examine the wound sites and perhaps suggest alternative symptom control.  Kind Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

After several minutes of poking and prodding, the Doc stated that it must have come out.  I, after seeing the one that was removed, think that I would have noticed that coming out. But, he did try to find it. Some bleeding involved as he attempted.  CT scan done a few days later revealed that the stent indeed was still intact. CT also revealed more polyps. I go back to my Surgeon on the 19th hopefully to remove the remaining stent and seek advice on the new Polyps.  Frustated as hell now.\n\n",

Occasionally allergic reactions such as this can persist for several days of mild symptoms.  Also, given your swollen lymph nodes, you may have had a viral infection.  Some viruses can causes hives and allergic \"appearing\" rashes.    I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor for reevaluation if your symptoms persist or worsen.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "This reply may no longer be relevant since it has been almost a month since you posted. However, the following could be used for future reference.  Studies have shown that garlic may strengthen the immune system. Fresh garlic is better than taking garlic pills because the antibiotic \"allicin\" is released when fresh garlic is crushed.   Studies have also shown that high levels of vitamin C taken every two hours throughout the day can reduce the 'sick time' with a cold. However, use with caution because high levels of vitamin C may cause GI upset in some individuals.  You can try zinc lonzenges and also gargle with warm, salt water at least every four hours for a sore throat.   Echinacea is purported as having antibiotic effects. Elderberry has been shown to prevent and/or decrease sick time in several strains of flu. Studies have shown that elderberry inhibits cell duplication in these flu strains.  Drink plenty of fluids and rest.  Though herbal and natural remedies have been shown to be helpful, you should not rely on them when your symptoms are serious. You should consult your physician if you have a fever of 101 degrees or if you have persistent sore throat lasting more than a few days.  The following preventive measures are of utmost importance during the cold/flu season:  *Get a flu vaccine and pneumonia vaccine, especially if you are at high risk *Avoid contact with people who obviously have a respiratory infection (actively coughing/sneezing) *Wash hands after going out in public, before meals, after using the restroom, and after contact with anyone that is sick *Good nutrition *Regular exercise *Keep hands away from face  If you still have the symptoms that you described when you posted (Jan. 24th), then you need to see a physician now.\n\n",

    "title": "Unbearable Sinus Problems",
    "content": "Hello!  I am a 14 year old female, and as of lately, I've been feeling unbearably terrible.  For the last two years, I've had trouble with frequent sinus infections and \"vasomotor rhinitis,\" as described by my doctor. In October, I was put on three consecutive antibiotics for a double ear infection and a sinus infection, since it just wouldn't clear up!  However, after a second round of my third antibiotic, my doctor said the infection had cleared up. I never felt any different, though. And now, five months later, I still feel terribly sick.  My nose is constantly stuffy. When I wipe my nose in the morning, I notice that a lot of green mucus is sitting in there. Most of the time, though, it's white when I blow it.  My face is under a lot of pressure all the time. It feels like all of that mucus is crammed into the very back of my nose. I have a lot of headaches, and I'm drowsy to the point where I can barely function anymore.  And, as of two months ago, I've developed a strange lump in my throat. I feel sick whenever I try to swallow, and I have to spit into kleenex a lot. I feel like there's a bunch of stuff sitting at the top of my throat, strangling me. I've thrown up because of it, and I always have bad breath. Why?  I went to an ENT a year and a half ago, and I had a CT of my sinuses. It came out fine. But a year and a half ago, I wasn't feeling so nasty. Should I go back to the ENT?  I've also seen the allergist, and gotten tested. I'm not even allergic to anything! Not pollen, not dogs, not dust mites. Nothing. I was put on Rhinocort nose spray and Zyrtec, which never noticably helped the problem. I also do an over-the-counter product called 'NeilMed Sinus Rinse.' It helps short term, but after an hour, the sinus pressure comes back.  On my bad days, I noticed that I can barely get SInus Rinse or the nose spray in my nose in the first place. It feels like there's some sort of wall there.  The ENT pointed out that I had a deviated septum when I last went, but he said it wasn't bad, so it's nothing to worry about.  I'm so confused. Nobody knows what to do, and I don't even want to go to school anymore because of it. I already have a severe anxiety problem, and this sickness makes me feel even more racey.  Can somebody point me in the right direction?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Stuffed nose causes can be identified when other symptoms exist.  Common causes of chronic stuffy nose include:  - Allergic rhinitis: there is sneezing, nasal discharge,  or blocked nose (excluded) - Chronic sinusitis: there is nasal discharge which is usually dark and of bad odor, sneezing, runny (you have) - Adenoid conditions there is mainly blocked nose and nasal discharge - Adenoiditis nasal discharge may be of bad odor - Vasomotor rhinitis sneezing, , profuse watery nasal discharge, recurrent inflammation - Nasal polyp causes :dysphonia, nasal discharge,and anosmia  -  A deviated nasal septum results in chronic sinusitis.  All causes that result in chronic irritation of the nasal mucosa can produce bloody mixed discharge due to mucosa damage.   If all conservative measures fail to prevent recurrent sinusitis and Stuffed nose, surgery may be needed either to drain the sinuses or to repair the deviated septum or nasal obstruction.  CT scan of the sinus gives a good idea about the current situation  , so your Doctor may recommend a new CT if your condition is worsening.  Hope you find this information useful.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

The radiological assessment in any condition gives a suggestion for possible cause, together with other clinical data including the clinical picture(especially the complaint and the examination results), the possible diagnosis is reached since there is always a list of differential diagnosis.

    "content": "This has been happening for approx. 7 years.  Hx. of TMJ disorder (I have a splint that I wear at night.  My TMJ doctor couldn't identify why this happens), C5-C6 fusion w/ current C6-C7 degeneration.  I am in P.T. for pain, muscle spasms, and lots of soft tissue tightness in the neck.    I have a hard lump in front of my left ear, slightly below and anterior to my TM joint.  I also have a pea sized lump on my left mastoid, hard/fixed.  My left ear is always full, & I have tinnitus.  I feel like I can pop it open by opening my mouth, but it just makes a low pop noise and feels the same.  When I lay on my left for sleeping, I wake up and it feels really full, and my hearing is affected.  This resolves approx.  30 minutes after waking.  This is driving me crazy!  Please, any advice would be helpful.  If it something that can be diagnosed and treated, who should I see?  ENT, primary, etc...  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your symptoms are very suggestive of  Temporomandibuilar Joints dysfunction: In this conditions symptoms include: Click, pop, and snap, sounds usually occur with pain in TMD Headaches  Neck, shoulder, or back pain  Ear aches  Clenching  teeth  Pain behind the eyes  Dizziness  Parasthesia of the fingers   Asymmetry, muscle hypertrophy on the affected side van be easily seen. This could be why you think you have swellings in this area. Also depressions in the joint may make asymmetry looking.  The causes of TMD is multifactorial. Stress and psychological factors are involved.   The most common cause related to joint or bone problems is anterior disc displacement. Disease that affect joints like RA, ankylosis, OA, should be excluded.  TMJ-related pain is usually cyclic and recurrent.  Why you have symptoms when you sleep on the affected side could be a nighttime clenching.   You have to use good posture although a sleeping behavior is hard to control.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

The symptoms he is experiencing are classical of this condition. The lumps you describe are almost certainly lymph nodes which enlarge in response to an infection. They are not the cause of the pain. As this condition can be due to either a bacteria or a virus, it is advisable to visit your local physician to have a look at the throat and suggest symptomatic treatment, or antibiotics if bacterial infection is likely.  For future reference, please do not post questions within other patients postings as this can be distressing for those concerned and may be distracting for the doctors. Always post new questions in a new thread.   Kind regards,   Dr. Tino Solomon  BSc(Hons) MBBS  Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "I think I posted in the wrong forum before - so apologies if this appears somewhere else...  I developed sore throat on the left hand side about 2 months ago after a cold.  The pain is only there when I swallow - also a feeling of something stuck inside, as well as dry tongue and mouth.  My lymph nodes were a little swollen, now the swelling has gone down and there is no apparent lump anywhere.  I've seen the doctor who couldn't find anything (after 2 rounds of antibiotics, a throat culture which is clear and a blood test which is also clear), and an ENT specialist who looked down my throat briefly with a mirror but also couldn't find anything.  I'm getting desperate as the feeling is nearly always there and there seems to be no reason for it (no reflux, no stress, etc). I'm 38 and used to smoke occasionally (2-3 a day for a few years) and a glass/two of wine with meals. My grandmother died of a cancer of the esophagus in her 80's so I'm terrified I've something nasty. Please help, this is making my life miserable and noone is able to offer any advice or help (other than to gargle and to drink warm liquids and wait for it to go away eventually).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Based on your age and description of your symptoms, it sounds like you have developed an inflammation of the pharynx or tonsils (pharyngitis or tonsillitis) secondary to an infection. This can be caused by either bacteria or viruses and sometimes both, to add confusion to the matter. Bacterial infections are usually but not exclusively due to Streptococcus microbes of the 'Group A' type. Viral infections in your age group can often be attributed to Epstein Barr Virus and when this is the case, it is referred to as Glandular Fever. Whilst bacterial infections can be treated successfully with antibiotics, if a virus is the causative factor then you would find no improvement until your own body recovers. Fortunately, help is available with diagnostic tests in the form of throat swabs and blood antibody tests for viruses. In the case of the Epstein Barr virus, this would be the monospot test. As the appearance of the throat can be similar in bacterial and viral infections, laboratory testing is the definitive way to establish the cause. I do not think at this moment that your mother\u2019s condition is related to yours although autoimmune conditions, such as Sjorgens syndrome, can run in families. I suggest you visit your family doctor to examine your throat and take swabs before treatment can be considered. Your doctor may also suggest an anti-inflammatory gargle  which helps to relieve the pain and discomfort. I would hold off the singing until your symptoms have settled as your voice box may be mildly inflamed as well and you may not perform to your best ability.  Kind regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

Demographic details such as your age, sex and current occupation would be helpful to begin to piece the jigsaw together. Do you suffer from any other medical conditions? When exactly did you sustain these head injuries and did you have CAT scans after any of them? What was the duration from the injuries to the onset of your hearing loss? Did you have or do you have any discharge coming from the affected side? Is your hearing loss associated with pain? Has your ear been looked at with an otoscope, an instrument used to examine the external canal of the ear up to the eardrum?  Do you have any other symptoms that appear alongside these, such as change in sensation over your face, change in taste, loss of balance, nausea, difficulty in moving certain areas of your face, like unequal smiling on one side?   If you can answer these questions, it would be of great help to us to attempt to establish a cause. I look forward to receiving your reply.

I had a hearing test done, listen to a series of beeps etc. Anyways he determined that the hair/nerves? in my middle ear are damaged, siginficant damage and suggested a hearing aid. Loud noises I can hear well, low frequency I have trouble with.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Thank you for providing us with further details about your history. You descriptions and subsequent findings are in line with middle ear hearing organ damage due to the trauma. The organs such as the cochlea of the middle ear control balance and hearing. Damage to these can result in permanent hearing loss on the affected side. The hair cells your doctor is referring to are situated with the cochlea and sway from side to side when sound waves are detected. Other hair cells also provide their function of sensing your position in relation to balance.   Unfortunately if your hearing tests confirm a degree of hearing loss then this is likely to be permanent due to the nature of the cause and the area damged. A hearing aid would be a sensible option if this were to be the case as it would restore some quality of life associated with regaining the sense of hearing. As your job involves day to day communication with other people, hearing is an essential sense required and thus partial restoration of this should be a priority. I suggest you visit your doctor for a follow-up appointment to confirm the diagnosis, determine the exact extent of the damage to the hearing organs and perhaps arrange an appointment with an audiologist or hearing specialist who will manage the next phase of your treatment.   Kind Regards,  Dr Tino Solomon BSc(Hons) MBBS Senior House Officer in Surgery\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Patrick,  Have you been recovering from any health problems? Do you have pain, difficlu swallowing?  White spots are usually of purulent exudate (pus).  White lesions on the tonsil or on the  throat , are most probably due to either an infection with a bacteria named group A streptococci  or a virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV).  These conditions are usually associated with fever, and in the case of the bacterial infection, obviously a coarse of antibiotic would help in treating the condition. In the case of streptococcal infection, a simple throat swab and culture would define the causative agent.   Exudative pharyngitis due to  EBV is usually confusing with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, to add more difficulty in the diagnosis concomitant infection of both agents occurs in 30% of people. Sore throat, perhaps a strep throat that doesn't get better with antibiotics is due to EBV infection.  However other physical and clinical signs are characteristic to EBV infection would help the physician to differentiate between these two causes. Moreover, specific serological tests,(detection of antigens and or antibodies to a specific antigen from the infecting agent  like as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests can help in the diagnosis of CMV infections.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Best regards,\n\n",

It's not quite like the eyelid because I can only feel it inside my head.  What is this?  Should I go to the doctor?  It comes and goes.  It's been about 4 days since I first noticed it.  It's hard to explain, but like I said, it's like an eyelid twitch, but inside my ear - where I can't touch.  Is this just a muscle spasm?  Any advice would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  It\u2019s hard to speculate what is going on, but with more detail we may be able to offer possible causes of you symptoms. Please provide us with more details about yourself and your overall health condition. For example your age, medical history including any muscular disorder, surgical history, drug history and any conditions that run in the family. These snips of information can be put together to narrow down the list of possible diagnoses and rule out any sinister causes.  Based on what you have described two possibilities exist. First, you may be experiencing a spasm or \u2018myclonus\u2019 of the small muscle(s) of the inner ear causing you to feel a twitching sensation. This may be localised or associated with motor tics or spasms throughout your body, if you have experienced any. For those who have been diagnosed by ENT surgeons with this treatment has consisted of muscle relaxants or paralysis of the offending muscle. Alternatively you may be feeling the sensation of your heartbeat in your ear, which is a relatively common complaint. Audiological studies may be able to determine an abnormal pattern of conduction and transmission in the affected ear. I would suggest you visit your family physician if your quality of life is suffering as a result and he may refer you on to a specialist for further investigation.

    "content": "Dear Lil Kis,  The nose is is very rich in blood vessels (vascular) and is highly exposed to trauma resulting in bleeding of various severity.   Bloody discharge can occur spontaneously when the nasal mucosa is dry out, crust,  most commonly due to local causes.   The condition tends to be more in susceptible with higher bleeding tendency due to e.g. medications like some analgesics. Other who are liable for repeated infections, allergic and non-allergic rhinitis, and alcoholics.  In all chronic cases hypertension and bleeding disorders should be excluded. Wegener's granulomatosis is not a common disorder due to inflammation of small arteries and veins (vasculitis), can also cause nasal bleeding.  Stuffed nose causes can be identified when other symptoms exist. Common causes of chronic stuffy nose include:  - Allergic rhinitis: there is sneezing, nasal discharge,  or blocked nose - Chronic sinusitis: there is nasal discharge which is usually dark and of bad odor, sneezing, runny  - Adenoid conditions there is mainly blocked nose and nasal discharge - Adenoiditis nasal discharge may be of bad odor - Vasomotor rhinitis sneezing, , profuse watery nasal discharge, recurrent inflammation - Nasal polyp causes :dysphonia, nasal discharge,and anosmia   All causes that result in chronic irritation of the nasal mucosa can produce bloody mixed discharge due to mucosa damage. ENT examination is essential.  Hope you find this information useful, Keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lil Kis,  Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e. g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases.   Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent. Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake.   Bacterial infections (group A streptococci is the commonest) causing sore throat need to be treated with Antibiotics. Infectious Mononucleosis is a type of virus EBV induced sore throat that lead to recurrent sore throat with swollen tonsils and Lymph nodes in addition to other specific symptoms and signs.   Streptococcal pharyngitis and EBV infection are usually difficult to be differentiated.   If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that  your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.   Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems.   Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat.   A sore throat that doesn\u2019t improve or repeated with a short period of time should be investigated properly. By complete history and proper examination your physician can evaluate the cause of this recurrent sore throat and recommend treatment.   Recurrent pharyngitis is the most frequent indication for tonsillectomy. The goals of surgery include amelioration of symptoms, avoidance of sick days and reduction of complications such as peritonsillar abscess, streptococcal cervical adenitis and the immunologic sequel of streptococcal infections.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Today at lunch while drinking some water (no food - still waiting on the plate), I swallowed and heard a 'click' or maybe a 'tick' and felt an \"odd sensation\" in the left side of my throat. I swallowed again and the left side of my throat hurt rather significantly.  Now, it's over 3 hours later and it still hurts to swallow, and probably just as bad.  Even if I don't swallow, there is a slight ache at times. It doesn't seem to matter if I turn my head and swallow; the pain is always there. The site  is a small area in line with the adam's apple and about 1.5 inches to the right. It feels as if it's at  the tip of a small bony formation (they line the outside of the throat it feels like).  Applying slight pressure  to the area causes a slight ache at the site. Applying pressure to the opposite side of the throat causes a small ache in the region in question on the left side. I don't feel any abnormal swelling anywhere ... then again I'm not in the habit of feeling my throat so I don't think anything feels abnormal.  Otherwise, I don't have any other throat pain (like what is typical with  colds, sinus drainage, etc).   Anything come to mind?\n\n",

The condition can be a sequence of sore throat or (viral, bacteria) infection that subsides gradually after recovering from infections or as a motility disorder in the esophagus.   GERD  The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux). Acid reflux causes severe pain and discomfort in the chest in the morning. Others may experience a feeling like the food stuck in their throat or tightness in the throat, dry Cough and Shortness of breath similar to Asthma.   Stress and smoking can increase these symptoms. Certain foods as well are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them.   Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.   Diagnosis is made by complete history taking, physical examination, investigations like Upper Endoscopy, Manometric studies, and other lab tests that can be recommended by the doctor accordingly.

    "content": "Hi, since last year i have been having problems with my right ear. Although some days/weeks its worse than others, it usually feels plugged, like it needs to be poped, but as much as i try it never will. Ive been to so many doctors and they all say they see nothing wrong. Also, when I go into higher altitutes it usually gets worse, and also, the other night I went to a concert and by the time I left it felt so clogged that I felt like I could barely hear out of it. there has to be something wrong! I really don't know how much longer I can deal with this. there is deffinatly something wrong. Sometimes i also think it has leaked when I sleep on my right ear some times. Today I got very concerned though because I got very dizzy. What could this be?! Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "title": "RE: clogged right ear for a year",
    "content": "Have you seen an ear, nose and throat doctor (ENT)?  I would definitely suggest visiting an ENT to check out your ear.  Blocked ears can have numerous causes, such as impacted ear wax, a disorder of the eustachean tubes (the canals that connect the ear and throat), or infections/disorders of the middle or inner ears.  It's especially interesting that you mentioned getting dizzy, as this would seem to indicate some kind of vestibular issue involving your middle or inner ear.  Both the middle and inner ears  contain systems that regulate your body's balance, as well as hearing.  Even the most minor disruption in that area can cause dizzyness, blocked ears, and hearing loss.    The ENT is a good place to start.  Depending on what s/he finds, you may be referred to a neurotologist or oto-neurologist for further testing or treatment.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I have almost the same problem...  My right ear feels clogged like it needs to pop but doesn't. However, for the past several weeks, it would pop first thing in the morning and I would be fine the rest of the day.  I almost feel like I want to take a plane trip so it can pop. Something else, I don't know if there is any correlation but when I drink a heavily carbonated drink like Coke or Dr. Pepper, I think the carbonation gives me like small burps and once in a great while, the burp helps my ear pop and then I am fine.  But the way that I think it happens is that when I sleep on my right side of my body, it doesn't take long for it to get clogged. As a result, it happens every time I go to sleep or lay down on my right side. It sometimes happens when I get really sleepy but it is rare for it to happen that way. It just feels that there is a lot of pressure in my head.  I know that I have a deviated septum and I am constantly congested. I am going to have a surgery on that. In fact, I mentioned to the ENT that was seeing for the deviated septum and all he recommended is that I stop using Q-tips to clean my ear.  Which I stopped and there was immediate improvement but it never really went away. And for the past three days, it has stayed completely clogged so I have constant headaches and it is just frustrating.  Anyway, I am going to try to see that ENT again (and I still got to get my surgery in the near future). However, since it was clogged the first time he saw it and didn't really recommend anything for treatment, I am wondering if that will happen again...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Amanda,              Hi, you seem to be suffering from secretory otitis media,. Here the patient has a feeling of fluid in the ear and blockage of ear.This occurs due to upper respiratory tract infection in a person with impaired functioning of eustachian tube. Some people are more prone to it. The treatment consists of taking antihistaminics with systemic decongestants like combination of cetrizine with pseudoephidrine,nasal decongestants like Otrivine nasal drops, systemic antibiotics for 3 to 4 weeks. you also have to do exercises in the form of valsalva manouvre where after deep inspiration you blow out with nose pinched and mouth closed for 4-5 times in a day as this opens the eustachian tube and helps in drainage of accumulated fluid. All this is done after proper investigations like pure tone audiometry and impedance audiometry. GO to an ENT specialist.

    "content": "Dr Rajesh Prabhakar (or anyone else...)  I was wondering that since I have been having similar symptoms, if it is also the same thing with me... That is, my right ear feels clogged like it needs to be popped but it won't..  There is something else I noticed. Right now, I have awful sleep and an overnight trip to a sleep diagnostic clinic confirmed what I already knew. I also have lots of other bad habits that contribute to that, like deviated septum, bad diet, no exercise, snoring, etc...  Sometimes when I am very sleepy at work and I am getting groggier, all of a sudden, the ear clogs up and won't pop. When I feel like I am getting tired, I try to drink sodas to prevent that groggy feeling...  Right now, I have been to my doctor and ENT and both looked into my ear when it was clogged but didn't really say anything about it. I know that I should have pressed each one of them about it because it bothers me so much but I guess I was afraid of what kind of test they would give my ear...  I need to see my doctor and ENT again since I still haven't gotten the surgery to fix the deviated septum although the ENT just retired so I have to go through the process to find another one.  Are there any home remedies that are \"safe\" to make my ear pop. I know I want to be careful because I don't want to do anything dangerous to my ear...\n\n",

    "content": "Dear transcribeit2,  Swallowing difficulties are common (in about 50%) complications during the first 3-4 Weeks postoperative. Patients are usually advised to start with semi liquid foods and avoid any type of food that might cause indigestion. Some physicians prescribe antacids for a month after the fundoplication.   The  swallowed air due to in adjusted motility, causes bloating and abdominal cramps due to accumulated gas. Flatulence may be permanent.   Any symptom that is persistent for more than month should be discussed with the surgeon. So I advise you to keep on follow up with your surgeon since he can delineate expected postoperative complication from others that need surgical interference.  Best regards,\n\n",

But it lingered for several weeks. About 3 weeks ago it finally went away, and in it's place....a sore throat!  I never ran fever, and as long as I took ibuprofen, it was fine. This has gone on for about 2 weeks, and for the last few days, my throat has barely hurt and I quit taking anything for pain. Then this afternoon I was noticing that it hurt again, but in a totally different place. the other sore throat was in the normal place, this one is down in my throat farther, I can point to the pain on my neck, and the outside of my neck is slightly tender there also. It feels as though something is in my throat, something hard or swollen, I'm not sure. I've been told by some people to gargle with saltwater, but I don't think I could get the gargle down that far in my throat. Please help me....I guess I should go see a doctor. I hope you have some advice.....Thanks.............Dawn\n\n",

When I walk in dress shoes, every step causes a pain in the throat area.  8. No congestion. No nasal drips. No coughing. No phlegm.    What could it be? Is it the thyroid gland?

    "content": "Dear bcantrel, Discomfort, pain, or scratchiness in the throat are all symptoms of sore throat. Mild difficulty in breathing is usually due to swelling in the throat or nasal congestion. Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e.g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.  Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake.   Experts says that a sore throat that lasts for longer than a week is often caused by allergies, or exposure to humidity, smoking, irritation from heating and cooling systems.Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies and in this case usually the allergic individual wake up early in the morning with sore throat. In some cases it is believed to be due to a postnasal discharge. If a person suffers from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that his toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection after recovers from his first attack.   He better avoids exposing himself to any precipitating factor like cold drinks, smoking etc. A sore throat that does not improve or repeated with a short period of time should be investigated properly. By complete history and proper examination the physician can evaluate the cause of this recurrent sore throat and recommend treatment. Keep on follow up with your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "chronic mild sore throat, dull ear pain",
    "content": "About 7 weeks ago I began with a moderate fever (101) and severe back and neck pain.  The following day the pain and fever were gone but I had a severe sore throat.  I lost my voice completly for 11 days.  About three days after loosing my voice, I visited the local primary care doctor who gave me antiobiotics.  My inability to speak got worse - my lower throat felt swollen and I had trouble swallowing.  About 3 days after starting antiobiotics, my voice began to come back.  After about 3.5 weeks, my voice was normal again.  The sore throat was no longer severe but very mild.  Since then, I have had a chronic mild sore throat that is worse in the mornings.  I re-visited the doctor who mentioned that perhaps I have a post nasal drip at night, for which he gave me another week's worth of medicine.  The medicine has not helped at all. I have been done with the medicine for 2 weeks now. My ears feel clogged and I have dull pain behind my ears.   I have also had slight nausea lately.  I don't have any white abcesses or swollen glands that I have noticed.  I no longer have fever.  Do I need to visit a doctor again?  What could this be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I had several unfortunate events of flu earlier this year.  I don't know if it is related, but about 2 month ago, I start to get pain on one side of my throat.  ENT doc saw it several times.  He couldn't see anything but a red throat.  I took anti-biotics three times.  The pain lasted a couple of weeks.  After that, I feel slight itchiness at that spot.  More importantly, it irritates sometimes when I drink cold soda or when I talk.  It feels like there is a spot down my throat that is very sensitive.  Again, all the doctor can see from naked eye is a red throat.  And the throat has been red for a couple of month.  Is this anything serious?  I had a swab and blood count.  Nothing bad in the report.    Thanks.\n\n",

Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.  Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake. Bacterial infections (group A streptococci is the commonest) causing sore throat need to be treated with antibiotics.  Infectious mononucleosis is a type of virus EBV induced sore throat that lead to recurrent sore throat with swollen tonsils and lymph nodes in addition to other specific symptoms and signs. Streptococcal pharyngitis and EBV infection are usually difficult to be differentiated. If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's also possible that your toothbrush needs to be changed as it may transmit the infection for you after you have recovered from your first attack.

    "content": "I frequently get severe sore throats. My glands sometimes swell and oftentimes, I have white spots in my throat. A fever usually accompanies it along with a loss in energy. 9 years ago, my primary physician noticed growth in my throat and sent me to a ENT to have it checked out. The ENT reccomended removal. Because of a car accident the night before I was scheduled to have it removed, I didn't make it to my appointment. I never got around to scheduling the removal again and no other doctor has ever commented on it when I go in for the many strep tests that come out negative. They all say the sore throat is just a virus and to get some rest and drink plenty of fluids. Could this be a bigger problem? Could it be allergies? (As far as I know, I'm not allergic to anything.)\n\n",

    "content": "You said that when you got the infection you have had white patches on the tonsils, this is most probably due to either an infection with a bacteria named group A streptococci  or a virus Epstein-Barr virus (EBV). \u2022These conditions are usually associated with fever, and in the case of the bacterial infection, obviously a coarse of antibiotic would help in treating the condition. In the case of streptococcal infection, a simple throat swab and culture would define the causative agent and your results were negative as you said. Exudative pharyngitis due to  EBV is usually confusing with group A streptococcal pharyngitis, to add more difficulty in the diagnosis concomitant infection of both agents occurs in 30% of people. Sore throat, that doesn't get better with antibiotics is usually due to viral infection like EBV. However other physical and clinical signs are characteristic to EBV infection would help the physician to differentiate between these two causes. Moreover, specific serological tests,(detection of antigens and or antibodies to a specific antigen from the infecting agent  like as the monospot and heterophile antibody tests can help in the diagnosis of EBV infections.  The reason of why it is repeated is that fact that your tonsils are one of the first defenses (BARRIER) that try to eliminate the spread of the infection that is transmitted though the upper aerodigestive tract. Other common causes of pharyngitis include, a cold or flu virus. If you suffer from recurring sore throats, it's possible also that your toothbrush might be a source of infection and should be changed regulary especially after an attack of throat infection. Repeated pharyngitis can also happen seasonally or all year long most commonly due to allergies, and in this case usually the allergic indi vidual wake up early in the morning with sore throat . Recurrent pharyngitis is the most frequent indication for tonsillectomy. The goals of surgery include amelioration of symptoms, avoidance of sick days and reduction of complications such as peritonsillar abscess. if the condition is frequent you can discuss with your doctor the possibility of surgical removal, and it is possible advantages and disadvantages.

    "title": "Help! Lump feeling in throat for over 3 months!",
    "content": "I am a 23 year old male, I've had no past history of medical problems but recently (or not so recently, about 3 months ago) I developed a lump feeling in my throat.  I went to see a doctor twice and they really didn't do anything for me, gave me some antibiotics for strep-throat and than the second time just told me to take some motrin.  I did both and I still have that lump feeling.  Here are some details that may ring a bell to someone that may have seen or heard of something similar. 1.  I'm a smoker, less than a pack a day and a light drinker (3-4 beers a week) 2.  College student so I don't get much sleep and I do snore at night (dry throat) 3.  I do have a small amount of drainage in my throat with yellow mucus. 4. My lympth nodes are not swollen and I rarely have a \"sore throat\" 5.  The lump feel almost feels like someone is \"squeezing\" the top of my throat (right below the tonsals) but it is not hard to swallow, I do choke alot due to the lump feeling but usually don't cough up and mucus, maybe 40% of the time I cough do I cough up any mucus.  What I have tried: Loranadine for allergies, Ranadine for possible acid reflux, taking honey at night to ease my throat, motrin, antibiotics  If there is are any other suggestions I'd greatly appreciate it, I'd go see another docter but the last time I went she accused me of making it up since she couldn't find the problem and than took $300 from me.  So after losing $300 and being called a liar I'm going back the doctor for awhile.\n\n",

It almost felt like I had on a turtleneck or necklace that was too tight, or as if someone was applying pressure to the base of my throat. It didn't affect my breathing, but was really an uncomfortable feeling lasting 6-8 hours.  I had had thyroid surgery in the past, and at first thought that perhaps my thyroid medication needed to be adjusted (overdosage had caused \"lump\" feeling in the past) When it was determined that my medication was in fact correct....I experimented with several different remedies.  By a chance conversation with a relative,  I discovered that an allergy to NSAID's (ibuprofen, aleve, excedrin etc...) ran in the family.  The allergic reactions ranged from severe swelling of the throat and eyes, to mild \"lump\" feelings in the throat.  The reactions seemed to last as long as the medication was still working in the person's system.  After learning this, I discontinued use of all over the counter pain medications (except for Tylenol) and have not had the feeling since.  I hope that my experience and remedy might be helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I know exactly what you mean.  I feel like I've had a lump in my throat for over 3 months now.  If feels as if there is a lump sitting in my throat, and, at times, like someone is squeezing my throat or there is a spasm there.  I've been to countless physicians, from ENTs to GI doctors, and they can't figure out what it is.  From doing my own research, and talking to a slew of doctors, I've learned that symptoms like to ones we are all experiencing can be explained by the following:  1. Gatroesophageal reflux disease (GERD).  Stelmate, you've already mentioned trying remedies for this, as I have, without success.  But Joy, have you investigated this avenue?  My ENT and GI doctors both mentioned that that lump-in-the-throat feeling, called a \"globus sensation,\" is a common symptom of GERD.  It is possible to have GERD, even though you've never experienced heartburn.  GERD treatments did not work in my case, but it may explain your symptoms.  Ask your ENT.  2.  Post-nasal drip.  Apparently, this is very common after a cold, and among smokers.  I always thought that a PND mean that you actually feel something \"dripping\" in the back of your throat, but that's not always the case.  Medication like Flonase can usually help with a PND.  Again, I did not have a PND, but it's worth investigating with your doctors.  3. Cricopharyngeal spasm.  This is a spasm of the cricopharyngeus muscle, which sits just below your Adam's apple inside your throat.  Not many doctors know about cricopharyngeal spasms, and no one really knows what's causes the condition.  There's no cure, but apparently, it goes away on its own after a few weeks or months.  You can find an extremely informative article about it here: http://www.voicedoctor.net/therapy/cps.html  I think that this may be what I have, since the doctors have pretty much ruled everything else out.  Hopefully, you guys can find doctors that are open to discussing all of your symptoms and really investigate a cure.  Don't let them be too hasty to write your symptoms off as anxiety-related just because they are not easily explained.    Good luck!  stelmate wrote:I am a 23 year old male, I've had no past history of medical problems but recently (or not so recently, about 3 months ago) I developed a lump feeling in my throat...

Here the patient has a feeling of foreign body in the throat which is more of a psychosomatic cause where we give anxiolytics ,antacids, and psychotherapy.Sometimes Barium meal study of the oesophagus is done  and if the need be oesophagoscopy is done. 5Mouth breathing can lead to early morning feeling of raw throat.   Since you are a mouth breather get investigated for the cause of mouth breathing. The post nasal drip you have suggests an infection in the paranasal sinuses. Get an X-Ray of the paranasal sinuses. Go to a good ENT surgeon.                                                          Sincerely                                                         Dr Rajesh Prabhakar\n\n",

    "content": "Hi stumpedNSJ, I did read some of the other posts that you have written. A viral etiology (HIV) can be essentially ruled out since the testing was negative. Your work doesn't involve exposure to toxic chemicals does it? Keep in mind that some people do have abnormal lab results without an underlying disorder. However, in my opinion, taking into consideration that this is a long standing problem and the fact that you have physical symptoms and feel generally unwell, a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy would be at least an approachable topic with your physician. This would identify if an underlying dysfunction or malignancy is present. I would strongly suggest that you either discuss this with your current physician or obtain a second opinion. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  stumped,                            Well chronic sinusitis and lymphocytosis are not related to each other except for tubercular sinusitis which can lead to systemic lymphocytosis.If it is a allergic condition leading to sinusitis then there can be blood eosinophilia but not lymphocytosis. Complete blood examination is required followed by bonemarrow cytology if required.Since peripheral blood film can tell us about immature cells present in blood which are indicators of malignancy so bonemarrow aspiration depends upon the picture of PBF. Antral lavage can be done from the area of sinusitis followed by culture and senstivity to know the exact cause of sinusitis.

    "title": "Severe Allergies and Sinus problems",
    "content": "I am a 23 y/o female, and I've had allergies and sinus problems all my life, but now they are getting uncontrollable.  My allergy problems affect me year round, and I have one or two sinus infections a year. As far as I know I'm allergic to everything (dust, pollen, mold, grass, pet dander, etc.).  Up until about a year ago, the only thing that would really provide any relief from my symptoms was 24 hr Claritin D (tried Allegra, Zyrtec, OTC), and Nasonex nasal spray.  Back in October of last year I went to the doctor with a severe headache that I had never experienced before (worse than sinus infection headache). At the time the doctor gave me a prescription for guafinex/pse, and it worked.  A couple weeks later, I was back and diagnosed with allergy related conjunctivitis, and I was told to take Clairitin until the first frost and things would clear up.  To make a long story short, I did what the doctor said and although the conjunctivitis cleared up, my allergy (itchy/dry eyes, and throat, runny nose, sneezing) symptoms seem to be getting worse. I don't know how common it is, but although my nose is stuffy and I can't breathe out of it, it's runny also. Most of the time it's one nostril at a time. If I try to blow my nose, my sinuses close up, making it even harder for me to breathe.  At night, I have to make little balls of toilet paper to stick in my nose to keep my sinuses open, and to catch the runs from my nose so I can get a few hours of sleep.  It has gotten so bad and even though I know I shouldn't, I've been taking Claritin D and Sudafed (total of 240 mg pseudophedrine) in order to try to clear my sinuses, and it is still not working.  I was just wondering what are my alternatives?  Should I try allergy shots, and if so, willl they help with my sinus problems? Right now, the allergy symptoms I can deal with, but the severe congestion is really affecting me. Thanks for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "My best friend has huge tonsils.  They are at the point to where they touch and she can't swollow food without choking every few minutes. On one of them she has this soft bump that has seemed to grow over the past few months into larger than pea size.  She has gone to her doctor at the community clinic, but they keep saying that she has tonsilitis, and give her antibiotics.  She is a student with only a part time job, so she can't keep affording to go to the doctor for this problem if the treatment isn't helping. She has no pain, no fever, and she snores so loud at night she wakes herself up.  When she stays at my house I notice that it seems like she quits breathing when she sleeps.  Her speach also seems muffled and slurred when she talks.  I also notice that she gags a lot as well.  The last time I went with her to the doctor and suggested to him that he refer her to specialist so she can get state assistance to pay for the medical bills. He said that referral does not seem neccessary, and feels her sleep problems are due to the fact that she is overweight.  He also stated that removal of tonsils is not usually recommended anymore.    She is 19 years old and weighs 360 lbs.  She has lost 45 lbs by diet and exercise over the past 2 and 1/2 months, and still has not improved in her sleeping or her problems that I feel stem from her tonsils.  She has given up. I also feel that her weight loss is due to not being able to eat meals without choking.  Do you agree with the doctor, or should she get a specialist to look at her tonsils?  Any advice will help.  Thank you\n\n",

If she is snoring loudly and having episodes of interrupted breathing when she is sleeping it certainly may be related to the enlarged tonsils causing obstructive sleep apnea. I would again suggest an evaluation by the above mentioned specialist and there are programs in most states that provide free or reduced cost health care to those eligible (usually based on income).

She is suffering from obstructive sleep apnoea syndromeThere are various causes for it,obesity and enlarged tonsils being 2 of the many causes.sleep apnoea is the term used when the patient stops breathing for few seconds during sleep as in case of your friend. sleep apnoea can have various short and long term effects on the body like hypertension, day time sleepiness which can make a person more prone to accidents,decrease in sex desire, certain heart rythm disorders, headaches etc. Ideally your friend requires invetigations in a sleep lab overnight where all the body parameters are monitored while sleeping.Then there are some medical measures and assistive devices for countering this problem, but i think your friend will  require surgery in the form of uvulo palato pharyngo plasty which includes removal of tonsils.

I KNOW that it has not always been this way.  4- i am finding it increasingly more uncomfortable to eat as it feels almost as if after the first few mouthfuls the food stays in my throat for a time before gradually sliding down.  sometimes it feels like i imagine a snake feels when it has eaten a large mammal and it is visable in the body of the snake until its digested. 5- i am unsure if this is significant but- the veins in both my left and right arm regulaly throughout the day swell unconfortably, i look like a bodybuilders veins! though other times they disappear and leave dents where they were. 6- a recent visit to the dentist to rule out any mouth problems resulted in the dentist commenting that he could see a little further back past my protruding epiglottis and he said he saw a ball like mass in my throat, he also said he was surprised i was manging to swallow.     i have only set up my internet purely to see if i can find anything out for myself as the gp made no suggestions on what could have caused this strange thing.  i have looked through many sites and all i have so far found is evidence of cases where the only visual evidence is pictures taken during throat surgery, i cannot find anything where the epiglottis can be seen without the aid of surgical instruments.  PLEASE could somebody offer any suggestions???PLEASE????  my gp has at last made a referral for me to the ENT specialist, only the letter says the waiting list is at least 17 weeks, i am hungry!! i am eating for survival rather than for any pleasure. to swallow is a battle between satisfying hunger and not gagging the food out.   please help me,it is becoming unbearable by the day\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  The ENT is the way to go, but meanwhile, if you find it painful to be swallowing, you may try analgesics available over the counter. Tylenol may be begun for a start, and if not responding, advil may be begun.   If the problem has gone to the extent that you're unable to eat, you may visit the ED for care.  Enalrged epiglottis have been part of epiglottitis in children. But in your case, you are dealing with a ?mass too.  For symptomatic relief you may try gargling with lidocaine/cetacaine.  Hope this helps till your ENT visit, and hope things are not bad enough to warrant any anxiety.  bill  .\n\n",

He has arranged for me to go on a waitning list for a barium swallow and also arranged for me to go on another waiting list to see a neurologlist.A few years ago i visited a specialist because i was experienceing numbness in the top of my thigh, i also had recieved odd readings for a routine eye check up, my field of vision was wrong in some way. anyway ill keep you informed to what happens at the next appts, thanks again. Oh and while i remember, i have no pain in swallowing whatsoever, just major discomfort because i feel like gaggin on the food, but no pain though.\n\n",

    "content": "My son had something like this this past week.  He's 18 soon to be 19.  He was complaining that he felt like a pill was stuck in his throat.  I looked in his throat with a flashlight and saw this tiny miniature looking tonque thing sticking sraight up in the back of his tonque.  I never saw anything like it.  I called the doctor on the phone since it was after hours and he said it could be the epiglottis but of course couldn't say over the phone, but that if he had trouble breathing to go to the ER.  He didn't have trouble breathing or pain, just very bothersome.  We let it go for the night at my son's request.  I looked in his throat the next day and I could see it was still there but appeared lower down but still visible in the throat.  He said it was bothering him after eating something spicy that day.  By day 3 he said he didn't feel anything anymore, but I looked anyway and I could just see the tip of it.  It seems to me if it's the epiglottis, which when I looked on the internet, that's what it looked like, but I think it is too high up in the throat.  Since he's not complaining anymore, I will still take look again and also ask if he has the saliva thing that you complained of and also I'll look for any enlargment of the neck.  He didn't complain of having trouble swallowing.  I did feel around for swollen glands, seemed fine. If I still see that thing, I'll take him in to the GP doc at least, maybe an ENT.  He has had sinus problems in the past and he has Atypical CF, maybe it has something to do with it.  Good luck with your situation.  I think an ENT is the best route.  They can look right in the office with a tiny scope.  I have had it done and so has my son but in the sinuses.  It doesn't hurt or anything.  I'm curious to see what they come up with you.  pottyglotty wrote::shock:  PLEASE can somebody help??

    "content": "Hello,  This happened to me last year and it's happening again this year.  I'm starting to wonder if I have to go through this every year.  I had the flu and my voice had been hoarse for a few months.  No soreness, just sounded rough and harsh.  I thought it was because of my smoking, but my voice returned to normal eventually while the smoking continued.   Once again, I'm experiencing harshness with my voice, since November, and it's beginning to worry and annoy me.  I've been doing a little research, but I'm not sure if it's caused by a virus since I'm not sick or inflammation of the cords.  I'm confused because my voice gets worse after drinking alcohol.  Then it becomes better after exercising.  People suggest that I rest my voice but it also gets better after warming up my vocal cords with singing exercises.  What is happening and what can I do to get my voice back?  I would love to sing again.  Thank you!\n\n",

Any persistent hoarseness which does not resolve in a short amount of time (two weeks or so) should be further investigated.

    "content": "Hello,  I just have a general question concerning my own throat issues. Within the last year or so I've noticed a repeating pattern of my throat becoming sore, which then leads to illness (fever, cough, etc.) that tends to go away after a couple of days, nothing serious. I assumed that my throat was just easily caught by infections.  However, lately, if I do too much talking (and I don't mean being a chatterbox, just a normal amount of day-to-day conversation), I begin to feel this sort of warmth in my throat, and if I don't use sore throat drops and quit talking, my voice gets hoarse or I lose it.  There are no lumps or apparent redness in my throat, or any other throat pain symptoms as described by other posters on the board.   I was just wondering if anyone has had this/seen it before and has any ideas about what it may be? I'm going in next month to see an ENT about it, but if there is anyone with similar experiences or has dealt with this before, I would love to have your opinions to discuss with the doctor.  Thanks for any and all help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi agoldenstreak, Laryngitis may be acute (lasting a short amount of time) or chronic, (a long lasting duration). Acute laryngitis is typically caused by irritation/infection, etc. Common causes of chronic forms of course are smoking, alcohol intake, GERD (gastroesophageal reflux disease) and of course more serious conditions. Persistent hoarseness can signal a more serious anomaly. It is quite wise that you are going to have an evaluation by an ENT specialist as in my opinion it is certainly warranted.

I have alway spracticed good trained tenique and i don't know why this is happening to me.   Psyically i feel spectacular , i have infinite energy, i feel great at work and never tire ....i don't feel sick.....  This has been going on for 2 weeks now, also along with the mild hoarsness i have slight mild pain in my lower throat,...about 4 inches below my adam's apple. it doesnt go away.  I absolutely do not smoke or drink, i am a fanatic about my voice i wont even touch soda or be around people who smoke, i only drink water, and lots of it.  I have had problems in the past (not exactly like this, but effecting my voice) and have gone to my ENT, He has put the cammera down my throat and looked in there to clear my consious of the fear of singers nodes.  2 days ago he looked again, and said everything looks fantastic, no nodes polyups or anything....still....  Im wondering what could cause this...could the slight soreness in my lower throat 4 inches below my adam's apple be my thyroid that could that cause this?  i dotn know where to turn now, i have been to 3 different ENTs and they tell me everythign looks fine,...well it doesnt feel fine,...and wheni sing, it certainly doesnt sound fine either.  If anyone can help me i would really appreciate it...what tests should be done? what type of doctors should be seen?  please help if you want to also you may email me at  Edmanharnell@juno.com  thanks\n\n",

Nodules are usually palpated near the thyroid but don't move as your thyroid gland does during swallowing. A thyroid nodule, among other symptoms, may cause hoarseness. An Endocrinologist would be able to determine if a nodule is concerning or if in fact a thyroid disorder is present. If your symptoms do not subside I would suggest an evaluation.

About a year or so ago, I kept feeling this knot like( I presume swollen) glands on both sides of my neck(If I tilt my head back and rub my fingers about half and inch under my jaw on the side of the throat, I felt that it wasnt normal. I also noticed I was sneezing every morning and I got this bad cough and I would cough up yellow/green stuff until I moved out, we did have tons of cats and weird mold that would grow in the house, and when I moved out I felt better and the lumps went down. Ever since then I do still get pieces of white stuff on my tonsils and the lumps seem to have gone down except one, it is a smidge larger...but it still is a lot smaller than it was. I was afraid I could have cancer, but from what I have read on here, it seems to be more of an UNTREATED infection(which I hope that is what it is) or maybe abnormal glands that I shouldnt worry about. I am 8 months pregnant and I have had my blood tested twice and everything seemed to be ok. I am not sick and have No symptoms of cancers. I really need some Help to find awnsers. Please help, so I can have some relief. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Castleman's-Just cause I don't know where else to put it!",
    "content": "I'm 19, I just had my 4 week followup with my surgeon after having a lymph node sized slightly larger than a hard boiled egg removed from the side of my neck. The surgeon informed me that I'm the first positive case of Castleman's Disease he has ever seen. He asked me if I had any questions, and of course, at the time I couldn't think of anything, but now...! My biggest concern is that now that the lymph node has been removed and studied (negative for malignancy, definitely positive for castleman's), the surgeon thinks I'm totally cured (which, I hope he's right!), but should we be so sure that I'm out of the clear? Should I have a full body scan to make sure there aren't any more abnormally sized lymph nodes? And are scans something that should be done yearly to check for recurrence of the disease? I don't want to sound like a pessimist, I certainly don't want to have to go through any more surgeries, but I just want to be sure... And I feel weird about asking these questions to my doctor out of fear of looking like a hypochondriac or whatever. Another thing, 1 1/2 years ago I was diagnosed with extremely low iron levels with no known cause. It took over a year of high dose iron tablets to get it back within the normal range. Could that have been from the Castleman's Disease? I think that's all the questions I've got for now. If anyone has any answers, I would so greatly appreciate it!\n\n",

I don't think my doctor has completely diagnosed my problem. I do have trouble sleeping straight through the night, and have trouble staying awake during the day. In addition to that in the mornings, i find I have had a urinary accident through the early morning, even after being woke up and going to the bathroom through the night. I am overweight about 70 pounds. Is this part of the side affects of sleep apnea? Or is the urinary problem seperate? Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lynn66, Some of the signs and symptoms of sleep apnea are choking, gasping or loud snoring during sleep, Inability to concentrate, falling asleep during the day, for instance while driving, headaches, fatigue, behavior changes, frequent urination at night. There are treatments for sleep apnea, for exmple, a Continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) a machine that delivers air pressure through a mask placed over your nose. The air pressure is greater than the surrounding air therefore it keeps the upper airway passages open. A Bilevel positive airway pressure (BiPap) supplies a steady constant pressure to the upper airway as you inhale and exhale and builds to a higher pressure during inhale and lower during exhale with the intent of boosting a weak breathing pattern. These are only a couple of examples of how sleep apnea is treated and I would advise you to discuss with your physician the advantages of treatment. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "DIzzy Over a Year",
    "content": "Hi. I am sorry if I am not posting this properly. It started last October (of 2004). Went to my ENT for symptom of dizziness I thought may be related to an ear problem. He noted nystagmus and diagnosed labrynthitis initially, but had me come back to test my hearing and for BPPV. I was diagnosed with BPPV (hearing was fine) and given an Epley(?) maneuver to attempt to diminish it. This treatment did not work, so I went back, had another maneuver and wore a collar to keep my head stationary. When I went back again I was still dizzy. They sent me for an MRI in January. This was fine. I gave up for awhile but then went to the PCP in May . They said I was having a somewhat fast heartbeat. Had an echo. Nothing wrong.  Well, next to nothing,  I only had MVP ( I assume the diastolic abnormality noted in the echo report is due to the MVP?).  Anyway...I am still dizzy and went back to the doctor because it's been a year and  my PCP wants me to go to another ENT.   :(       I really don't want to go and was wondering what the longest time anyone has known a patient to be dizzy before it resolves on its own?  Please no more collars. All I got from the last one was a rash. It's just seeming kind of goofy and stupid and ever- present. Presuming there is no underlying problem of any consequence, and there does not appear to be,  it will eventually resolve on its own, right?\n\n",

I get up in the morning and it hurts.  recently I've started getting sore throats where it feels like i have a painful lump on the left side of my throat.  hurts just swallowing.  It's worse in the morning and at night.  breathing in deeply hurts.  My voice is getting scratchy.  I don't have a fever with the sore throats or lump.  I am a smoker.  Now, I'm only 24 years old and I'm getting really worried.  I don't want it to be cancer what i'd like to know is there anything else this could be and whether it's even likely that at my age I could be experiencing something cancerous.  I've also talked to my doctor about my sore throat several times and she doesn't seem to think that it's anything to worry about so i haven't seen her about the lump feeling yet. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I found this if your interested:  MedicineNet.com Link to this Article Ringing in Ears Symptoms & Signs Index  Together with other abnormal ear noises, ear ringing is medically called tinnitus. Buzzing, roaring, and pulsitile sounds are sometimes perceived when no sound is present in persons with tinnitus.  Tinnitus can arise in any of the four sections of the ear: the outer ear, the middle ear, the inner ear, and the brain. Tinnitus is often accompanied by hearing loss.

    "title": "Hole in gums to nasal passage.",
    "content": "Hello, new here.  I am a 50 year old male with top dentures. To keep them in place I suck them tight to the roof of my mouth which worked great until just recently.  I cannot suck them up anymore and found that I have a hole above my gum area where the top of the gums reaches the inside cheek. I can actually suck air through this hole and if I plug my nose, both nostrils, it stops. Also when I brush my teeth and take an amount of water in my mouth for rinsing and close my mouth and build up pressure, the water drips out of my one nostril.  Any help or advice is much appreciated. I have no pain in the area at all.  Thankyou!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Precinct38,  The possibilities are numerous, you must consult with a dentist, an oromaxillary surgeon and/or an ear, nose and throat specialist.  Serious causes such as cancer, infection of the bone itself or rare fungal infections could be the culprit.  Even though it is not impossible to have a hole in the bones of the roof of the mouth just from continuous pressure from a denture, yet, i think it is highly unlikely.  Please, consult with your physician as soon as possible.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Just to clarify alittle more, the hole is not in the roof of my mouth,  it is between the upper right gumline where the gum connects to the cheek tissue.

    "content": "Hi.  I'm sorry for hijacking this thread, but it was the closest thing I could find to my own problem, and I could not, for the life of me, figure out how to start a new topic.  Very sorry.  I've also recently noticed a hole in my gums.  It's below my bottom teeth, directly over the jaw.  When I press on the outside of my cheek, even lightly, it hurts.  It hurts constantly, but even more if I do something like this.  Or if I eat. My jaw and cheek have been hurting for several weeks but it's gotten nearly unbearable in the last couple of days.  Also, my neck feels swollen, right below the jaw.  It feels stiff. Only a couple of hours ago did I think to take a look inside my mouth where I found the hole in my gums.  Maybe hole isn't the right word.  Tear, maybe.  A deep, elliptical tear.  It looks clean, in a way.  It's not bleeding, the edges look perfectly smooth.... if I didn't know that there isn't supposed to be a hole in my gums and wasn't in pain 24/7, I would think it looked quite natural there.  I tried calling my dentist (before I realized a tear was my problem) but it takes months to get in.  The problem keeps getting worse and I'm not sure what I should do about it. It's three in the morning, I can't sleep because I'm worried and I can't eat because of the pain.  Thank you for any advice or information you can give me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Last night I was easting some pasta with spinach that still had some sand in it.  Halfway through, I had a sharp pain sensation in my throat and the very back of the right side of my tongue.  (I've felt this sensation in the past, it's like when you eat something extremely sour and you feel this pain in the back of your tongue and in your throat).  However, unlike the past, this pain is still occurring everytime I eat anything today.  At this point I can now feel a swollen lump on the right side of my neck.  When I'm not eating anything, there is no pain, but I do feel some discomfort since there is a swollen lump in my neck.  It's been less than 24 hours since  the first occurance.  Could this be an allergic reaction to something?  Or perhaps maybe I have a grain of sand stuck in the back of my tongue?  --m0tivation\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Karen78,        From what you have posted, the ringing may be secondary to your congested nose and (most likely you may be having frequent attacks of allergic rhinitis. Because of this attacks, secretions coming from your nasopharynx may go into your eustachian tubes (tubes interconnecting your ears and pahrygeal areas) or when you sneeze or blow your nose, pressures within may alter,  sometimes you may hear popping sound within your ears aside from ringing sensation. Ringing may also occur as one ages (particularly in the elderly age group - but the cause of this is entirely different from your case).        For your condition though, you may take OTC oral decongestants particularly those medications containing phenylpropanolamine HCL and Chlorpheniramine maleate 3x a day for 5 days. If you have any allergic reaction to these medications it is advisable that you see your ENT doctor first.\n\n",

    "content": "For quite a while I've had this problem, and it dosn't seem to be getting any better. I get buildup of a strange solid off white stuff in the back of my throat. It seems to be coming from to glands of some sort, one on either side of my throat, under my tonsels. This causes me to have a sore throat sometimes. If I use my finger to apply pressure to the area, the white stuff comes out, it seems like there is a never ending supply of it in there. Even when i manage to get most of it out, it always comes back. Today I examined one of the things and its off white, almost yellow and they all seem to have a brownish little dot in the center of them. They are also quite stinky. I brush my teeth a lot and use mouthwash everyday but it keep this phenomenon from happening. I asked my doctor about it but he seemed to think it was just food buildup. I am worried it is something more insidious, and it causes me to worry a lot. Does anyone have any advice? Could this be some sort of cancer or parasite or something?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there! Not to worry.  This has happenned to me regularily for some time.  I would feel kinda scratchy in my throat and would see white stuff near the sides of my throat - kinda in your little side flaps in the throat (no other way to describe them).  If you poke them, whitish, yellow chunks come out.  Mine even bled a little. After consulting my Dr., she said it was actually plaque that builds up.  There is no way to stop it and it just happens more on some people than others.  Unfortuantealy she said I have sticky plaque that gets trapped in there where most people's just gets washed away.  Even if you are a staunch tooth brusher that means you loosen the sticky plaque sending more of it down the throat and more of it to get stick on those nasty flaps.  (Which she said ar not that nasty as they also catch \"bugs\" that go down your throat so you don't get sick.\n\n",

They form in the tonsil crevices and pockets in the back of the throat in the tonsils. Everyone has them, some have more than others. They aren\u2019t pieces of food, they are a mixture of sulphur compounds, bacteria and mucous and they really do stink. Your throat may start itching, you have an urge to cough and up comes this \u2026 thing. You can gargle with salt water, mouth wash or lavage your tonsils with a large syringe (no needle) to flush the Tonsilolith out, don\u2019t pick at them, you can cause an infection or you can push it deep into the tonsil crevice causing an absess. If it really bothers you, get your Eustachian (inner ear) tubes checked out and your sinuses checked for infection by your physician. Cut down on foods that make mucous in your mouth like milk products and gargle well after eating. They don't cause cancer or any real harm to your throat but they can cause bad breath.\n\n",

Please post results as I'm experiencing an odd sore throat myself and docs can't seem to help.  The best way to describe it is sunflower seeds shells stuck in my throat.  Somewhat difficulty swallowing.  Ear ache as well.  I don't know what else to do.  MRI came back normal.  I'm getting a neck ultrasound next week.  If that comes back normal, I'm going to have an anxiety attack bececause I want to find out what's wrong with me.  I don't feel normal anymore.  I take 'anxiety' pills to get by the day.  Recently my chest has be having a burning/tingling sensation.  I'm on my way to see a new ENT next week.  Hopefully he'll be able to help me.  Any response would be appreciated.  Otherwise, thank you for listening and I would really appreicate some prayer my way.  Thank you!!\n\n",

    "title": "lump in neck and pain in ear",
    "content": "I have a disease called Kartageners Syndrome.  Basically, the cilia in my lungs and sinuses do not move.  Since a child, I have numerous sinus surgeries, (just recently two years ago), regular pulmonary problems and grew up going to Duke University being very much a guinea pig of sorts.  As a child, the doctors found out my organs were reversed--a symptom of the disease.  Anyway, recently, I have found two small lumps in my neck.  One is under my right jawbone and the other is right below the right of my adam's apple. The one under my jaw is about the same of a penny while the other near my adam's apple is the size of a pea.  After complaining to my ENT, a tube was put in my right ear.  That helped initially with the pressure I was feeling, but there was no explanation for the knots except they were residual infection from a cold or sinus infection.  After weeks of antiobiotics, the knots have not gone away and I am left with a tube in my right ear and continuing pain/discomfort in the right side of neck and right ear.  All the docs seems to do are provide antibiotics, which don't seem to be doing anything.  ALSO, after going to the doctor for a sore throat, I found out three years ago that my tonsils had somewhat grown back since having them taken out as a child.  I feel like that is part of the problem.  I have gotten infected tonsils twice since then I think they need to come out, but my ENT doesn't think so...  Any help you can provide this would be great!  I've already put paperwork in to change ENTs b/c I'm so frustrated and need some solid answers!  Thanks!\n\n",

Dr. did a strep test in the office and it was negative, but she gave me  Zithromax(3day dose).  I went on vacation but after a week, I still didn't feel better.  Went back to the Dr. and this time did a strep test that was sent out to the lab.  Test came back saying I did not have strep, but had another kind of bacteria.  Was put on Zithromax for 7 day dose.  Now I still have a sore throat, and swollen glands, but it seems to be related to my tongue.  It almost feels like a pulled muscle when I move my tongue in my mouth.  It seems to act up pretty bad the day after I've had a couple of alcoholic beverages.  I still have a dry cough/tickle in the throat that comes and goes.  I just wish I knew what the deal was with the sore tongue.\n\n",

I used to only hear it when I went to bed, and there was silence, but iIn the last few days I've been able to hear it all day.  It is not that loud, but other sounds don't drain it out - I just hear the ringing (like the buzzing noise a TV makes) over and above.  These is a relatively recent problem (last 6-9 months), and I can't think of any cases of exposure to loud noise, etc.  I have had \"train track\" braces since November, with the purpose of preparing my teeth for an operation to correct my overbite.  I have read that people with lower jaw problems may experience ringing ears, since the jawbone is connected to the earbone.  Is it possible that it is the braces moving my teeth that is causing this noise?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ksteves, The are many causes of vertigo from disorders and inflammation of the inner ear, abnormalities in the back of the brain, and vertigo related to certain medications. Let me say that I'm glad to hear that you are going to have an evaluation done by a neurologist. He/she will be able to determine if it is a condition called Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV)This condition can often begin following head trauma, a severe cold etc.  It starts suddenly and is usually first noticed in bed, when waking from sleep. Any turn of the head seems to bring on violent but brief bursts of dizziness. Often the vertigo happens with tilting of the head, looking up or down \"top-shelf vertigo\", or rolling over in bed. It is not unusual for nausea and vomiting to accompany this as well. If there is no hearing loss or severe ringing in the ears this helps distinguish BPPV from other inner ear disorders etc. The probable cause of this particular condition is small calcium carbonate crystal float through the inner ear fluid and strike sensitive nerve endings. Also keep in mind that sometimes causes of vertigo are unknown. Since laying on your right side makes the symptoms worse avoid that side and it should help decrease the symptoms. Good Luck with your evaluation and keep us posted on the results. Thank you for using http://www.doctorslounge.com Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I had been slightly dizzy on looking up earlier in the morning but it wasn't until I tried to get up after my PT worked on my back that I felt like I would fly off the table if I let go and started throwing up. I have never been so disoriented and dizzy in my life. They did a treatment called the Epley or Semont Maneuver. Here is a website that explains what they do and actually shows you what happens with the crystals that are \"out of place\" when they do each step of the treatment...also has lots of info on BPPV. The treatment isn't fun but it really worked wonders for me. http://www-surgery.ucsd.edu/ent/Patient ... _bppv.html I would definately find out what is causing the vertigo first and formost, then find a good PT or physician who knows about the treatmant if it is a problem that may be helped by it.

    "content": "Hi! I was hoping you could help me  I just returned from a happy vacation, however happy it was very stressful on me. Since this past Thursday June 30th, I have been waking up with a very very strong gag reflex unexplicably! It wanes off and on during the day. At 7-9pm it disappears and I am my \"old self\" again. The mere thought of food also makes me want to gag. I have not gotten sick so far and have managed to stop the gag reflex with every ounce of willpower. However this is no life for me and my quality of life has gone to 0. Could it be nerves? What is causing my overactive gagging reflex in the mornings, and when I think about eating/food. ((I ate like a horse until Thursday)). Also, my stomache itself feels hungry and even rumbles, and I almost always feel hungry right after I eat... perhaps its just acid 'warming up' my stomache making me think I feel hungry? ANY suggestions would be great!! Thank you!! Sammy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. Ever since the end of April I have been feeling pretty lousy. Here's what I've been dealing with:  end of April I got a terrible sore throat, worst sore throat I've ever had, could hardly swallow due to pain. Took antibiotics and it went away. Week later I got another sore throat which hurt but not as bad as the first one...took no antibiotics and it went away on its own. Week after that I got a terrible bout of Sinusitis, pounding behind my eye, swollen glands, and terribly inflamed sinuses. Took antibiotics and it got rid of it. Bout 2 weeks later I moved, and injured a rib (I think) in the process and have been dealing with chest wall pain due to it.  About two weeks ago I got a dry hacking cough for about 3 days, and then a bout of mucus build up from my nose (I could breathe fine, but had to blow my nose many times a day due to all the mucus).  That went away about a week ago and ever since last Thursday I've had swollen neck glands (started in left side of neck, moved to the right). The glands (nodes/tonsils...not sure what they are) that are swollen are the ones next to my throat under my chin, and the ones under the ear right at the curve of the jaw line. The ones under my chin are mobile, the ones under my ears are hard as rocks and not really mobile. Some are tender/sore some are not. Now all I have is the swollen glands and general feeling of tiredness and overall depression from being sick so often and not being able to enjoy life The only plus is that the inflamed rib seems to be healing.  My new health insurance does not start till mid August, so I am asking for advice or what this could all mean, so please don't tell me to see a doctor, I know this is what I need to do and I will as soon as my insurnace kicks in.   Background info:   had Lyme Disease for nearly a year as a child, but it was basically cured. Just started new job in NYC mid May (right after sinusitis) Just moved last weekend of May  Please help\n\n",

You would need to get a full blood count done to establish whether the white cell count is elevated or not. A raised white count would be indicative of a bacterial infection somewhere, but alternatively maybe you have picked up Glandular fever, in which case you would need blood tests for serology to test for this. Unfortunately, you do need to see the dr to get these tests done, unless you have a good friend working in pathology who could do it for you on the side!\n\n",

Since I can't really afford this but am scared of cancer, I need to know what to ask the doctor on Saturday as far as what tests to do. So far since I last posted this topic the glands on the right side of my neck continue to swell, making my neck on the right side of my body ache, mornings are normally fine, but by evening it gets bothersome. There is one gland in particular that is the worst, and its mobile, soft, and not irregular, but right under my ears where the jaw meets the rest of the skull there is a large very hard immobile lump on each side of my head. I'm tired but not so much that I can't function, so I don't know if this has anything to do with it. I guess I'm concerned this could be cancer since its been about a month now. Please help.\n\n",

Enlarged lymph nodes may be suspicious when they, for example, are hard, fixed, continue to enlarge despite treatment with antibiotics etc. Are you experiencing any other symptoms? Have you had a recent infection? An evaluation by your physician would identify if the enlarged lymph nodes are suspicious in nature. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

It is painful to touch although it is lessening,  but not too painful to swallow. I had UPP surgery for  snoring about four years ago so I have no tonsils. The pain  is four fingers from the voice box on my left side.(thing  that moves up and down when you swallow).   Symptoms:  1. Sharp pain four fingers to the left side of voice box  (larynx).   2. Mild fever. It is 99.0.   3. Mild headaches at temple come and go, lasting a few  seconds.   4. Worse at night when I sleep, I feel ears getting  plugged. Mild earache on left side.   5. Worse when I turn head to right and swallow.   6. When I swallow with head straight, virtually no pain.   7. When I walk in dress shoes, every step causes a pain in  the throat area.   8. No congestion. No nasal drips. No coughing. No phlegm.   9. A little bit tired.  What could it be? Is it the thyroid gland? Or is it the  esophogus? Wouldn't a viral or bacterial infection be  accompanied by fever and congestion. I have no congestion.   Please help.\n\n",

    "title": "Horrible ear infection.",
    "content": "Just recently I acquired an ear infection, and as of Wednesday I went into the local doctor to get it checked on. Here, they did clean out wax with a pick, and an ear irrigation, and then prescribed me Amoxicillan pills. Now this ear infection, seems to have only gotten worse. When I wake up, its pulsing, and has intense pain that I could never imagine. I can barely chew, and I am afraid of small hiccups that come at random during the day as it stings the ear. I have little to no hearing at all, and it seems swollen as the outside is very small space compared to the healthy ear, I'd be surprised if a Qtip could get into the ear easily.  Now this has had me worried, as I've been looking all over the net for help and read about several ear problems, and am just curious as to wether or not these are normal symptoms in an ear infection. I think the only peace I get is after an hour of taking one 500mg Amoxicillan pill, and two 100mg tablets of Motrine. The rapid pulsing, and the warmness of the ear has bothered me the most, and the feeling of something trying to exert itself from the ear, even though theres nothing in it. I've even found it hard to sleep, and felt the pain during my sleep when I do manage to rest. So I again ask, is this normal?\n\n",

    "content": "My name is Mandy, I am from Australia, I am 21 years old and suffer from a severe swallowing problem that Drs here can't work out what is wrong.  The problem started when i was about 10 years old but it didnt really bother me however 5 years ago it came on really strong.  My problem is my throat can't tolerate any kinds of food when i swallow, bits of food such as bread crumbs etc get caught in my throat and stay there for hours and really choke me. I cant even drink orange juice or anything with pulp in it as even the pulp gets stuck in my throat for a long time and chokes me. Like ways with any sediment drinks/foods.  For the last 4 1/2 years i am living on jelly, custard and cream and am currently drinking 2/3 litres of soft drink daily to try and keep my weight on. I am very weak, have lost a lot of weight and have no muscle tone at all from not being able to move. I am housebound as i have no energy, i am really weak and i faint and always feel dizzy. I only weight about 45kg and my healthy weight range is meant to be 65kg  I have been \"investaigated\" by several ENT people as well as a Gastro and have had the following tests done - CT Scan, MRI, Barium Swallow, Endoscopy and all have proved to be normal. I also have seen Naturopaths/Homeopaths etc with no help, I even saw a Chiropractor, the last Dr i saw was a Neurologist, all he did was check my reflexes and told me I don't have a Neurological problem. Have been told it all 'in my head' and even went down the road of a Shrink and Hypnotherapist and once again no help. My condition is worsening everyday and I do need help. I can understand that my problem is unusal, but for goodness sake i cant be the only one, there must be someone else out there suffering the same problem with a good outcome!!  Please can anyone help, any kind of information you can help me with would be greatly helpful, i am interested in looking for help overseas, travelling will be a problem for me as I am very ill but will do ANYTHING i can to get myself better.  I have reached the end, and if something isnt done soon to help me eat i will die as no one can live on the kinds of foods and drinks i am.  Please can you get back to me as soon as you can, as to whether or not you could help me or know someone who can. Your help would be greatly appreciated.  My email is [email]vegans@dodo.com.au  Warm Regards Mandy\n\n",

Subsisting on soft drinks and custard is not only unnecessary, but is also dangerous. Until you find the answer to your medical mystery, there are many calorie and protein-laden supplements on the market, as well as liquid vitamins, to help you meet your minimum daily requirements for vitamin and caloric intake.

I do not have insurance and have used all my resources with this visit and subsiquent medication. What can I do to help my ear to heal?  Is there anyway I can remove the wax from my ear safely? Thanks, GT\n\n",

    "content": "Dear GT: Sorry to hear about your infection.   I know how badly an ear infection can hurt.  As far as the impacted wax in your ear, you need to have the physician or his nurse remove.  Attempts to remove the wax yourself, as in using a q-tip or in trying to flush the wax out with water, can cause severe damage to the ear drum and force the infection further back into the ear canal which would be much worse.  About the only thing you could try yourself would be to use a warm pack on the affected side.  Lay down with a warm pack under your head so that if any wax melts gravity will allow it to flow out.  If this does not help then you need to see the doctor.  Above all do not put anything into your ears to try to remove the wax.  Use of q-tips or foreign objects to clean out ears are the major cause of ear infections.   CmMerritt\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   My father, who is approaching his seventies, is visiting me on a Visitor\u2019s visa now. Over the past couple of months he experienced recurring hoarseness in his voice. I checked on the web trying to find out what\u2019s wrong with him, and was frightened by the possibility that he might suffer throat cancer since my father have been a heavy drinker most of his life. I know I should take him to a physician for a thorough check-up as soon as possible. But since he only has a visitor\u2019s insurance, which does not cover anything considered as a pre-exiting condition. I am wondering if anybody can tell me whether American physicians ever accept patients without proper health insurance, and if they do, how much I should expect to pay for an accurate diagnosis of my father\u2019s throat problem at a physician\u2019s office?   Any help will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

If you father has not previously been treated for a condition it should not be categorized as a pre-existing illness. My suggestion to you would be call the (800) number which should be located on the back of the card and inquire what's their definition of a pre-existing condition. As for physician's offices, many will arrange a payment plan when no insurance etc. is available. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Snoring and Mucosal Thickening...",
    "content": "My wife insists that my snoring has to come to an end.  Over two years ago I visited my primary care physician. He prescribed Rhinocort and Allegra. My insurance wouldn\u2019t cover Allegra but my PCP said that Claritin would be fine. He also requested that I get a CT scan.  Afterwards, he told me that the CT scan said that I have mucosal thickening and referred me to an ENT.  That was two years ago and big events in my life interrupted my trip to the ENT. I stopped taking the Rhinocort and I take Claritin on occasion.   Soon, I shall return to my primary care physician and ask him about the snoring and get this started all over again.  My first question is, how do I approach my doctor in a tactful way that \u201cI blew him off\u201d for a couple of years but I am back. I am sure that happens all the time but I feel embarrassed.  Second question, if I get another CT scan to once again show that I have mucosal thickening, thus getting referred to an ENT, what kind of tests will an ENT do? Yes, I am a big chicken if someone wants to stick something up my nose. And what kind of treatments will an ENT prescribe for mucosal thickening?  As for snoring, I snore like a freight train. The purpose in going to an ENT or going to anyone is to stop the snoring, not necessarily to stop the mucosal thickening.  Any comments would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Don't worry about \"blowing off\" your doctor; they see this all the time, and your case wasn't a life threatening problem.     The treatment provided a bit of relief.   I didn\u2019t realize that I was not using the nasal spray properly until I almost ran out of it. The Claritin helped a bit too. At that point in time, I always assumed that everyone was as congested and stuffed up as I was. I had always been this way for over 30 years and never knew anything different.  Now I am cognizant that I am continually congested. I have more or less stopped taking Claritin unless I am severely clogged up.  My doctor didn\u2019t say anything about sleep apnea.  Yes, I am mildly or moderately overweight. My beer belly looks like I am pregnant if I bend over. I am actually thin but with a beer belly so I have the worst of both worlds. Because of high cholesterol, I have changed my diet and have tried to include more activity in my life but I have a ways to go in making more drastic lifestyle changes.  Years ago my blood pressure was a bit elevated but now that it has been checked, it is actually within normal limits.  Yes, I have been sleepy during the day for years.  I don\u2019t know if that is more of a mental thing. At times I have a lot of stress and it takes a while for me to get into a deep sleep. In addition, my wife doesn\u2019t want me to sleep on my back because my snoring gets worse, thus I end up with worse sleep when I don\u2019t sleep on my back.   My current and previous primary care physicians have prescribed me sleeping pills but I never wanted to take them.  I have gotten several prescriptions to Ambien but I am way too chicken to take them. I don\u2019t want to be drugged out when I go to bed (although I guess I don\u2019t mind when I have had too many beers).  My current physician prescribed something that he said that was better than Ambien in that it used to for treating depression but it doesn\u2019t have the addictive nature of Ambien. He even suggested that I take half a pill until I was ready to take the entire tablet.  But if this will help stop my snoring, then I will start taking that.  I am assuming that if my doctor requests that I get another CT scan and it confirms that I have mucosal thickening, when would an ENT give me as treatment?  I really want my snoring to end so I am curious what kinds of treatments are in store for me.  By the way, I can a very good guess on what mucosal thickening is, but what causes it and what does it do to my body other than cause me to snore?\n\n",

    "content": "The thickening can be caused by various obstructions, which were more than likely ruled out in the CT.  It can result from allergies, also.  The treatment you were on is what is suggested; some doctors also add guafenisen, which thins the mucous and lets it drain.  Surgery isn't done unless there is an obstruction like deviated septum or polyps for example, which were ruled out in your case.  If your ENT wanted another CT, he would probably wait on treatment until after the CT.  Something you may not know, is that if you drink in the evenings, even a couple of beers, it will interrupt your sleep.  It will make you sleepy at first, but will cause you to awaken during the night, thus when you get to deep sleep, you are more likely to snore.  Just an FYI.    What did your doctor prescribe in the way of a sleep aid?  He probably gave you an anticonvulsant, which can be much milder than addictive drugs.  I would suggest you try the half tablet to get more even sleep and see if that doesn't reduce the snoring, too.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctor,   Just a couple of days ago, while clearing my nose in the bath, there was a loud single \"POP\" in my right ear. Immediately after, I lost the hearing of high frequencies and sounds were very muffled. I was hearing through my head, not my ear. At almost the same time, I almost lost my balance and fell. I got worried, The condition did not recover to normality till at least 6 hours.   Thinking it was ok and isolated, just yesterday, I was in the shower again and I experienced the same thing - including the lost of balance!  Each time, there is no pain, just the uncomfortable and \"alarming\" dizziness and deafness.  Now, everytime, I need to blow my nose, though carefully, I can hear my ear near \"POPPING\".  Please advise if its normal or if I need to seek immediate medical attention.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, this is my first post, so I hope it works!! Fist off I have been going to an ent for a problem with my throat since jan. I started with a sinus infection at end of Dec., had to take Amoxil to get rid of it. Then about 2 weeks later I still had a sore throat, but noticed my right tonsil appeared larger and redder than normal. I suffered a couple of days waited for it to go away. This was the kind of sore throat tha hurts to even open your mouth. I finally looked and saw some nice white spots on the tonsil. Finally got to see Ent. Not strep either. ent did full throat culture and started me on clindamycin. bad antibiotic, suffered through diarrhea and sick stomach 10 days. back to ent still looks the same, he said, still have pus draining from tonsil(GROSS) still swollen and red, try some Biaxin XL. In the meantime I forgot to mention that I started to have some major anxiety about various other symptoms I was experiencing at the same time. Insomnia, hot flashes, and this persistant vaginal fissure. Went to Gyno he found nothing, not even anything wierd with estrogen. Now the tonsil is still red smooth enlarged(small kidney bean sized) and there is a new dark red spot just above it the size of an eraser on the back of the soft palate area.The biaxin I finished, but it made me sicker than the clindamycin. I've been told that will kill anything bacterial. I went back to ent, told him I did not want to take any more antibiotics without getting a clear visual or something specific that we were trying to overcome. No more without an answer to this problem. He told me that he does'nt investigate until after the tonsils are out & then the pathologist will give their findings. I think that there should be some other method that a naked eye and tongue depressor to look into this problem. He said let's take them out then. i said let's check back in a month. I go see another doctor at the end of the month. Is ther anything else I should be looking at? Thanks for any reply, brigette\n\n",

    "content": "10 days ago I started to lose my voice and chalked it up to allergies.  8 days ago I had a severe sore throat, no voice, but no fever or real redness in my throat.    From then on I've had enlarged tonsils, thick yellowey green drainage in my throat and when I wake up in the morning my left eye is sealed shut with green mucous and my eye is red (but not really itchy like when I've had pink eye in the past).  The redness clears up during the day but the eye still remains glassy looking and feels extra dry.  My left ear has a lot of pressure and that left tonsil hurts.    When I cough it is chunky, but because I have an autoimmune disease that leaves me pretty dry I can never cough anything up and out.    I don't have enough money to go to the doctor if this is something that could go away with enough time (viral--drink plenty of fluids and get rest diagnosis), so I'm looking for advice as to what I should do.\n\n",

Last March i developed a extreamly painfull sore throat and a 'rash' (which i later found out was guttate psirosis) I saw a doctor who told me i had strep throat and put me on a course of penicillin. The sore throat seemed to clear up untill the beginning of April when it came back and i was put on another course of antibiotics.Then again late April i was put on amoxcillin for the same thing. Beginning of May i went back to the doctors as this sore throat still hasnt cleared up, he gave me a spray, which i tryed untill i couldnt bare the pain anymore and went back two days ago. He has now put me on Trimethoprim and sent me for a blood test today. He is testing FBC,LFT,U+E and glocouse. Would anyone be able to tell me what he is testing for? I am at wits end, I am so much pain with my throat and just want it to stop.\n\n",

I deffintly took the whole course of antibiotics each time and didnt drink with them. The only thing i can think of is when i started to feel better i did sometimes forget to take them on a empty stomach this was with the amoxicillin. Would that cause them not to work? I had a throat culture at the dematoligists when they diagnoised guttate psirosis,she told me that guttate psirosis can sometime come out when a person has strep throat.I never actully found out the results to that  But i am taking it that the results would go in my notes and the doctor would have read it right? They certainly didnt do a sensitivity test though. I thought about Mono, isnt that glandular fever when your glands swell up? He hasnt tested me for it no, he has felt my glands everytime i go back and i don't think they are swollen. He has never said they were anyway. I have been getting headaches quite alot. I also had an ear infection in the middle of getting the sore throat back. I sometimes also get 'shooting' pains up my throat to my ear. But i havent had any of the other symptoms you mentioned.  I am very gratefull for all of your help and suggestions, i will certainly take a look at the green tea if nothing else to boost my immune system.\n\n",

I went to an ENT, two of them, and they found nothing as said maybe it was acid reflux.  I personally feel like that is not it.  Tried the purple pill for a couple of months and nothing.  In the beginning it used to hurt when i talked even, now it's just after a good laugh or cough.  I think i can trace it back to a rowdy scream during a football game, but both my ENTs said there was no damage that they could see.  Could this be a pinched nerve of some sort?  It's been around for 3 months!  Any ideas??\n\n",

If there were even the slighest inflammation they would easily be able to see it. The problem with throat symptoms is that they are more often associated with psychological problems (neurosis, anxiety). Once an organic cause is ruled out then a psychogenic cause for your symptoms is all that is left.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. I have been suffering with ulcers on the back of my throat for 18 years. I have been to numerous ENTs and other Mds with various treatments. Recently I have been under the care of a hem/onc for what he diagnosed as Igg subclass 3 defiency. I have had 6 treatments of Gamma Globulin which has decreased the frequency of outbreaks. I have been tested for everything under the sun and the only abnormality is IGG subclass 3. The problem I am having now is with tonsil stones. I am wondering if there is any correlation between the ulcers and tonsil stones. Do you know that if having a tonsillectomy would cure the ulcers? About 1/2 of the MDs I have seen suggested that I get my tonsils out. It seems that the ulcers are worse when I have the tonsil stones!!! PLEASE HELP!!!![  [/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Tonsil stones are known as tonsil calculi. They may be the result of food particles getting jammed in the tonsils and then being surrounded by bacteriae. Most people with calculi of the tonsils have no associated symptoms. For some people, however, the calculi can be quite bothersome, causing a constant foreign-body sensation, a chronic low-grade sore throat, recurrent episodes of tonsillitis persisting beyond childhood, or chronic bad breath.  Treatment consists of either removing the tonsils or removing the calculi. I think in particular it may prove helpful in your case. At the least it will remove a possible source of infection in the throat.   Regards,\n\n",

The only definitive symptom is congestion, most of my other symptoms are gone, and they all pointed to a common cold.  I never had a fever, but the congestion now has been causing some severe coughing due to post nasal drip.  If any one can tell me why it is orange and if I have anything to worry about that would be great. Thanks DG\n\n",

And there really isn't any pain except when I get stupid and plug my nose and blow to try to relieve the pressure, then it hurts really bad and after I stop and let go of my nose, my ear pops repeatedly for about 5 seconds and it hurts really bad.

    "content": "Hope this helps. Earaches are quite common. There are a number of reasons why people get earaches. It should always be considered to be a warning that something is wrong, although the problem causing it may not be serious. There are three different areas of the ear that can be involved in ear pain. The most serious problem occurs when there is infection. They are: 1) The outer ear canal, 2) the ear drum and the structures of the middle ear, the so called \"bones\" (the stapes, hammer and anvil) of the middle ear, and 3) the inner ear. (See Figure: 1.) The areas most commonly involved in creating pain or becoming infected are the outer ear and the middle ear.  Pain in the outer ear canal is usually caused by either a bacterial or fungal infection involving the lining of the outer ear canal. Often these infections may be predisposed by moisture in the ear canal resulting from warm, moist climates, from swimming (as in \"swimmers ear\") or bathing. Injury caused by attempts to clean or scratch the itching ear is another common cause. Occasionally, ear pain can be caused by irritation of the skin of the external canal such as contact dermatitis (from earrings, earphones, etc.), allergic dermatitis (allergies to foods or external substances) or seborrhea dermatitis. Symptoms Itching and pain along with dryness and scaling of the ear canal are the chief symptoms. A watery is generally first, once infections begins the discharge may turn into a purulent discharge and which may even contain small to large amounts of blood in it. This process in fairly common and while it implies that there is an infection does not necessarily mean something is extremely wrong. Pain may become extreme as the canal swells and blocked. This condition may be accompanied by enlarged and tender lymph glands around the ear or in the neck. Any or all of these signs and symptoms are a warning that medical intervention is necessary. Diagnoses The diagnoses are generally made on the basis of the history and physical examination. When looking into the ear canal the lining is red, swollen, and possibly draining. Treatment Often irrigation of the ear canal with either hydrogen peroxide (equal parts of water and hydrogen peroxide warmed to body temperature using a soft ear syringe) or seventy percent alcohol can temporarily stop pain and itching. This treatment may even resolve the problem before it can worsen. Topical antibiotic suspension or ointments (a prescription is usually needed) applied to the ear canal with a cotton wick. Topical steroids decrease inflammation and swelling. Localized moist heat can also be used to help to decrease pain and discomfort You should follow up with your physician espicially since your symptoms have worsened since your antibiotic spray. You could try the above interventions for some relief in the mean time. Good Luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have been having problems with my ears as far as I can remember.  My ears swell up so badly that I cant even get the drops in them.  They leak fluid and my god, this fluid has a foul smell to it.  I have a lump right under my ear that is also very sore but this lump only appears when my ears are swollen.  My ear feel plugged the whole time, and no matter how many pain killers I take, the pain does not go away. My doctor tells me my ears are fine and not to use Q-tips, well I took that advice and it has been 3 months since I used the Q-tips but my ears are swelled up again just like every other time. The drops I am on now this time is called Cipro  HC and they don't help at all.  I do wear a head set all day since I do work in a call center.  Is there anything that you can advice me to do so I don't have these sore ears leaking anymore. Some times it is so bad that I get dizzy , but stil my doctor says nothing is wrong with me and there is no wax build up in my ears. She actually thinks Im crazy.  Please Help, thanks\n\n",

    "title": "? CHRONIC OTITIS MEDIA",
    "content": "Hello Edwina,  I am of the opinion that you have a condition known as chronic otitis media, possibly with perforation of the eardrum. This occurs usually as a consequence of recurrent acute infections of the middle ear which may or may not have been  adequately treated. Trauma to the eardrum and other diseases may also cause this condition.  The characteristic signs of chronic otitis media are intermittent or continuous leakage of a purulent discharge from the ear canal. Pain is uncommon  unless during flaring of new attacks, but you may experience some hearing loss on the affected side. If the ear canal is swollen and you experience severe pain, then there is the possibilty that the continuous discharge from the middle ear is causing a secondary otitis externa.  An ENT surgeon should handle your case in order that well-known complications can be  prevented. Instillation of eardrops and analgesics will not solve the problem.  Has your primary care physician not offered to refer you to a specialist in spite of the persistence of symptoms?

    "content": "Hello Mattdman,  Humans usually hear frequencies from around 20 hertz to 20,000 hertz or vibrations per second. Dog whistles have different ranges, usually around 5000-12000 Hz and the \u201chum\u201d of fluorescent lighting you might hear is only 50-60 Hz. Sounds we normally can\u2019t hear would be the vibrations from whales, dolphins, elephants, some fish, etc. It would be very interesting for you to get a hearing test, they would test from the lowest frequency upward and you would know your range. You may have a very unique gift.\n\n",

    "title": "Voice change, facial spasms",
    "content": "Hello.  I am hoping someone can give me useful information, as I have yet to figure out my problems.  For the past 7-8 months, I have been having facial spasms mainly around the eyelids and nose, but often have them around the lip regions.  These recur almost daily and seem to be sporadic with no apparent trigger.  I have yet to figure this out and have taken precautions such as changing sleep patterns and even supplementing with Magnesium tablets.  It is a huge nuisance, as i am a graduate student and spend most of my day reading journals, etc., which can be quite tough when my eyelids are kicked into high gear and twitching.  Please help!  Also, I have been having throat problems for about 2 months, which seem to culminate with a buildup of mucus in the throat region.  I spend most of my days with chronic voice clearing/coughing trying to expectorate the mucus, but never with any success.  It peaks with a gargling sound in my voice that is extremely frustrating.  I have tried allergy medications (allegra, zyrtek) and also medications to treat GERD (Prilosec, currently on Nexium), along with trying the OTC expectorants.  These two problems are extremely frustrating and my primary physician has yet been convinced enough to refer me to any specialists.  This makes me feel good, as though he feels it is not serious, but I also want to figure out the problems.  Any information is appreciated!\n\n",

The whole room would spin.  I had about 4 catscans and all came back negative for anything.  The dizziness never went away. I've had it for 7 years now and nobody knows what is causing it. I have had everything they could think of checked.   Here is the list: Full blood count several times. STD test. Catscans too many to count. ENG. (CAme back slightly negative and was chalked off to anxiety from the test being so horrible) EEG. One yaer of therapy and antidepressants ruling out anxiety disorder or anything mental. Blood pressure is fine sugar also anything involving routine office visit is clear.  It's not really dizziness in the sense of room spinning though sometimes it is.  It's more like this 24/7 \"foggy\" \"disconected\" feeling.  My hands sweat and I shake sometimes.  I can't see correctly and just all together off blanced.  AFter seven years of \"living\" this way and having a two year old son and being a single mother I am at wits end.

Also, a step further might be to ask your dr for an MRI of your head if so desired, it shows alot more detail than a cat scan.

She used to get them frequently and on 2 occassions bled to the point where i called the hospital as she was starting to go pale. (the nurse said to wait a little longer and it did stop so didnt take her in). She hasn't had them for quite a few months now but has started again this last week and a half. This week she's had 3 nights where she's woken in the middle of the night with a blood nose. One night appeared to be both nostrils. Is it normal for a sleeping child to wake with a blood nose? She sleeps with her head slightly raised in bed. Also (not sure if this is significant or not) she fell over a week ago and at first didn't appear to have any real damage done but ended up rushing her to hospital few hours later where she spent the week in hospital with grazed and bruised kidney and mild internal bleeding. Is she just frail?  Any advise would be great.  Thanks, Kazzy\n\n",

The least scary way for a child is using silver nitrile stick which closes off the bleeding vessel.  It essentially looks like those big match sticks, and this way is not painfull.  On other occasions they need to be cauterized with a machine, for kids this is much more scary.  I would get your child checked by an ENT specialist if this continues to be a problem, especially if they are lasting for more that 30 an hour at a time.    Hope I helped.  Nikky, MA\n\n",

Last week I had a sore throat the doctor gave me medicine (amox) and it the soreness cleared up for the most part exceot for the morning but i think that is more PND. anyway i also went to my ENT and he did an endo scope (look down the throat through the nose) and he said he did not see anything.     I am really concerned. it is very annoying. I don't really think it is causing any other symptoms, although i do sometimes feel as though my salvia (not food) does not go down all the ay on that one side.

    "title": "Lump in center of Throat.",
    "content": "Hello, just found this forum in a search about my symptoms. I\u2019m a 28 year old man and I have a visible lump in the center of my throat above my Adam\u2019s apple and about the same size. It does not move with the skin so it is underneath the skin and actually on my throat. It often makes a popping sound when I swallow unless I clear my throat or am actually swallowing something. If I put my fingers on it when I swallow I can feel the popping motion.      I thought it was a reaction to an antibiotic, sulfamethoxazole/TMP DS tabs. The problem with my throat started right at that time. I told my doc and discontinued the med but he didn\u2019t check my throat. That med does show \u2026\u201clump in throat (goiter)\u201d\u2026 as a possible side effect, but the doc basically shrugged it off and said that I don\u2019t have thyroid problems. Also a goiter would be below the Adam\u2019s apple, instead of above, correct? I read a description of a goiter being butterfly shaped, and my lump does have a symmetrical shape with a notch in the top, like between two wings. That was a month ago and I thought it was getting slightly better, or I was ignoring it until today when it seemed more sore, slightly constricted and the popping was worse. (On the weekend, of course!)  Other symptoms that may or may not be relevant: Mild fever, 99 even.  One tonsil looks ever so slightly larger than the other. I\u2019ve had a plugged ear for more than six months and the gland just in front of the ear has been slightly swollen the whole time. The doc has looked at it twice and says there\u2019s no infection, and to take decongestants. I\u2019ve used ear cone candles to remove a huge amount of earwax and it\u2019s still not right. I figure if the lump in my throat is not a reaction to the medication, maybe it has something to do with my ear?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am writing because ever since I went off to college I have had bad sinuses. I've always had to deal with some type of sinuses when I moved from the beach to the mountains( it did not occur until then) Lately it has gotten out of hand. I find myself having to breathe out of my mouth sometimes I can't even blow my nose because it seems that the mucus is trapped somewhere in the back. I'm constantly trying to clear my nose, but I can't. I have been given several sinus medications and they work for a little while (barely), but then they do not work anymore. When I was younger I use to have to go to the emergency room because my throat passageway would get completly blocked by my tonsils that you couldn't even see down my throat. The doctors said that there was nothing wrong, that my tonsils were just swollen. I haven't had that problem in a couple of years. Also, my doctor told me that my nostrils were large but that nothing was irregular. I'm just trying to figure out what is wrong because my nasal congestion has gotten really bad that I have trouble breathing sometimes when I'm sleep and my friends that have been around me when I take a nap say that it scares them because it seems that I'm struggiling to breathe while I'm sleep. My mother says I now l seem to sleep with my mouth slightly open and that i take in large gasps of air through my mouth. At first I thought it was just sinuses, but I'm starting to wonder. This doesn't seem normal, and I don't like fighting just for air.Also, When I breathe in and out you can hear this noise that sounds like I'm snoring, but I'm not, it's how I breathe. My post basal drip is out of hand too... HELP ME!!\n\n",

    "content": "I could really use some guidance here.  I posted about my bleeds a while back and have maybe come up with a cause.  Was wondering if it sounds possible or if you have heard of this. I am tiring all other avenues here.  Just a very brief history.  I had my son in March 2003 and the next day started a series of severe posterior nosebleeds that lasted for 4 days before packing. After the packing they stopped.  In June 2004 while 7 months pregnant with my daughter, I was hospitalized for a week for the same thing, although this time they were a lot worse and required transfusions.  My nose was packed the first day but still bled thru for 4 days, mostly from the mouth.  Docs, nurses and ENT's could not come up with diagnosis.  Bloodwork done to check clotting, which was fine.   In all the months I have been searching I think I may have come up with something.  IT's a malformation of the spenopalatine artery, and when stressed by wacky hormones, can burst, causing profuse life threatening bleeding.  I do not plan to have any other children but this can still affect you thru hormone difficulties, thyroid etcetc.  I am wondering if you have heard of this or if it even seems possible before I bring it to my ENT's attention, although I wonder if they would not have thought of that.  I am really in no position to wait for this to happen again and I understand that there is a ligation surgery to correct this artery.  How serious is this condition, if thats what it is, and can it be treated successfully with surgery?? Any info would be appreciated.  Thank You\n\n",

I have not heard about the possibilities of hormone imbalance triggering off the bleeding. However, you do not seem to be suffering from any symptoms that would suggest the presence of a hormone imbalance. You can bring this up to your doctor and see what he has to say about this. Surgery can be successful for treating posterior nose bleeds whether the cause is a sphenopalatine malformation or not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Tulip: I see from your posting that you live in Canada, unless you live in Vancouver, at this time of year with the extreme cold temperatures and indoor heating the air tends to be very dry. This can cause bleeding when you blow your nose. Do you, or are you able to have a humidifier in your home, that would probably help greatly, even setting out a few large vases of water around your home would be beneficial in the winter months. Also are you drinking enough water? 8 to 10 - 250ml. glasses of water a day is recommended There are other causes for nose bleeds, ie: sinus infections, trauma, (that could include even blowing your nose to vigorously,) anemia,  but I would look to this first as being the most probable cause. If this persists, or your bleeding is profuse then I would recommend presenting to your doctor or a clinic. I hope this may be of some assistance to you. Let me know how you get on.

    "title": "DAILY NOSEBLEEDS",
    "content": "i really need somebodys help. For the past month ive been getting horrilble nose bleeds. Ones that last from 15 to 20 minutes. I get very dizzy during the nosebleeds and some of the time they are running down the back of my throat to where im choking on them(blood clots). Very gross and graphic i know but i need someones input on this situation as to what may be causing this. I used to get them really bad about 3 years ago and i went to the doctor and he said that it was an iron deficiency problem. So i started taking iron pills daily and that did seem to help a bit but they came back and its getting to the point where i cant go out anymore or hold onto a job because they are interfering with daily life. They come out of no where....ill just be having a conversation with a friend and blood will suddenly start pouring out of both of my nostrils. The amount of blood is what scares me. Ive seen people with nose bleeds who can just stick a piece of tissue up one nostril and it will pass in about 5 minutes or so. The blood loss makes me extremely weak and dizzy and its very scary. Huge blood clots coming out. My parents don't do much to help, because when i get these nose bleeds they look at me like i have a problem. So if anyone could give me some input that would be great. This really worries me. The nosebleeds sometimes even occur while im in a deep sleep..and ill wake up choking. THANKS ALOT AND TAKE CARE- JAMIE\n\n",

    "content": "Jamie, All individuals suffer occasional nose bleeds, of which the great majority are minor and occur on the anterior septum where they are easily managed. Occasionally patients present with severe, life-threatening, epistaxis arising from the larger vessels in the posterior and superior nasal cavity. Such bleeds occur primarily in older patients, often with significant co-morbidities. Bleeding compromises the patient's airway and results in hemodynamic instability.  You must seek medical attention from an experienced otolaryngologist. He will consider various surgical procedures, including cautery, and may suggest angiography with embolization.  Best regards,\n\n",

There is a bb sized mass-it's what is tender-I feel stupid going to the doctor-just want to know whats going on without seeming like a hypochondriac. Yesterday it seemed to grow worse during an extended exposure to gasoline fumes, not sure if it's the cause, or something i did earlier in the day.  I'm a firefighter, so the stress doesn't exactly let up, but it doesn't seem related.  At first I figured I was straining those muscles while I was working out, but that's not what has happened recently.  No tooth probs, just allergies to the *!7$%@ Texas Cedar.  Also I have swollen tonsils-since around march-no cold or flu, and not any other symptoms other than what I've described.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  A swollen tonsil is nothing but lymph tissue enlargement. Infections and inflammations can cause the tonsil to enlarge, and the spread of it can make other nodes of the neck to enlarge too, like you have now. The allergy you have could be exacerbated by the gasoline exposure, which could trigger the inflammatory response from your lymphatic tissue. Japanese cedar allergy found that pollinosis (as manifested by symptoms of allergic rhinitis isolated to the cedar pollen season, and confirmed in individuals seeking medical care by allergy skin and blood tests) was higher among residents living near heavily trafficked roads lined with cedars than in residents living in cedar forests without traffic congestion (Ishizaki 1987). Though these results are striking, they should be considered suggestive, as the researchers didn\u2019t control for some important confounders. A number of studies indicate that DEPM can induce immunological allergic reactions as well as localized inflammatory responses in humans (Diaz-Sanchez et al., 1994, 1996, 1997, 2000; Terada et al., 1997, Takenaka et al., 1995). Diaz-Sanchez et al. (1997, 1999) found that in allergic human subjects, nasal IgE antibody response and allergic inflammation were enhanced by co-exposure to diesel particulate matter.  An interesting study connecting cedar allergy and gasoline happened to be hit on a routine google search, which you might find good to know.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mscobra26, Generally speaking, mental stress can make many forms of vertigo worse, but will not, by itself, produce vertigo. In some cases the cause of vertigo is unknown. Vertigo can be a symptom of many different illnesses and disorders from inflammation of the inner ear to disorders in the back of the brain and or certain medications. If a neurological evaluation has not been completed to rule out a physical cause, I would suggest it be completed. Treatment depends on identifying the underlying cause. Meclizine is a common medication used to treat vertigo, but again an underlying cause should be indentified for appropriate treatment.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Laxa,  Vocal cord nodules are caused by continuous irritation to the vocal cords such as done by screaming, continuous low pitched voice and wrong techniques in singing.   Vocal cord nodules have certain characteristics that readily and easily identified by specialists. So, if you were told that these are vocal nodules, then i don't have a reason to suspect that they are otherwise.  Treatment for vocal cord nodules is initially always conservative with referral for voice therapy. Most patients respond after several sessions of voice therapy, but satisfactory improvement can take up to 12 to 18 months.   Surgery is reserved for rare cases that do not respond to voice therapy. Postoperative voice therapy, smoking cessation and acid reflux control are always indicated before and after surgical removal of nodules.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Constant Clearing of the Throat",
    "content": "Last January (2004) I quit smoking for about a month.  During that month, the air got real dry being it is in the middle fo winter.  I also worked in a lab which had real dry air.  I started getting this feeling in the throat where I had to clear it all the time.  I could clear up some junk, which was sometimes clear and other times was not.  Some times, there would be nothing that came up.  I finally went and saw and ENT doctor and after examining my throat, he said there was nothing wrong.  A nurse had told me prior to that that it sounded like I could have throat cancer.  The doctor said no, everything was fine.  It finally went away and only a few times since then did it come back.  Now, for the past 3 months it has come back pretty regularly and over the past monht it has been constant.  Sometimes I cough stuff up and other times, just clear my throat but most of the time, I can get something to come up.  This has me troubled and I think it is more than just dry air irritating my throat.  It feels like my throat is coated with something.  The stuff I cough up is not phlegm and it doesn't come up from out of my lungs but only my throat.  I've tried Vitamin C drops, cough drops, just about everything to try and see if my throat was dry.  I've even gargled with warm salt water and usually have a humidifier in my room as I sleep but nothing seems to relieve this.  Any and all replies with ideas or remedies would greatly be welcomed and appreciated.  Thank you very much!!  P.S.  This makes it difficult at times to try and sing which I tend to do from time to time since I'm in a band.  But like I said, this just started last year out of the blue which I originally thought was dry air.  I also don't think It's caused by any other air irritants as I'm not really around any of those.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with throat spurs 2yrs ago. This condition makes it hard to eat anything because it gets stuck in my throat I have had to have food removed because I was choking..   However I have not been able to get a straight answer on this subject as to what exactly are throat spurs and how can this condition be treated.  earlier this week I was forcing down a sandwich as usual and my throat began to hurt really bad it feels as if somthing cut it on the way down. soda and tea burns it now. but on one side I seem to be able to pass the food down a little easier. I am also curious to know if these \"spurs\" can break off and if they do can they cause bleeding or other complications that I need to be aware of.? I am unable to see a doctor until January because of insurance lapse when I changed companies.  but being a truck driver and alone most of the time I want to make sure that I find out all I can so I can look for danger signs. Any information on this subject will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It was diagnosed when I had to have some food removed because I was choking,( they put me under anesthia to go in and remove the food)  . After they said that I had throat spurs but did not explain what they were.. but they did say it was not cancer.  Yes it was a ENT surgen  and he wanted me to come back but because of insurance issues I have been unable to, he mentioned that he had never seen this before and would not go into detail.  However, the only management he spoke of was to have it removed. but did not elaborate any further as to cause or what type of damage it could cause or the risk in the removal .  several years ago while at the dentist they mentioned that I had something \"hanging\" in my throat and they were not sure what it was or what it was attached to, but they could see it.  As I mentioned in my last post something on one side seemed to \"break\" off and food is going down much easier but it still hangs up.. it must have been very hard because it cut my throat going down.   It is located behind the adams apple slightly to the lower half . I can feel it with my fingers.   I have tried to research this and I have come up empty. I would really like to know what this condition is or has it been mistaken for something else. I will be able to see a doctor in January but until then I would like to find out all I can about this, and also to be able to look for any warning signs that may not allow me to wait until January I do not want to be a regular in the emergency room for this.  any information on this will be greatly appreciated. Thank You in advance for your time...\n\n",

    "content": "I have a large bone spur on my cervical spine heading towards my throat area which does not yet interfere terribly with eating.  I was sent to an orthopedic surgeon who specializes in spinal surgery to see if it needed removing.  He does this surgery quite a bit and told me it doesn't need to be removed....yet.  When it interferes more with eating, they will take it off.  Have you been to an orthopedic surgeon?  They sent me for a scan of my esophagus (you drink some barium) and it shows your esophagus being pushed out.  The bone spurs are generally arthritis related.  I have them all over the place, I'm 50 and they said they're probably genetic in my case.  Hope this helps you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Below is some information you may find useful in dealing with your sinus infection.  Home care can help open the sinuses and alleviate their dryness.  Promote drainage   Drink plenty of water and hydrating beverages. Hot tea is often recommended.    Inhale steam 2-4 times per day by leaning over a bowl of boiling hot water (not while the water is on the stove) or using a steam vaporizer with a towel over the head and bowl to prevent the escape of the steam. Inhale the steam for about 10 minutes. Taking a hot, steamy shower may also work. Mentholated preparations, such as Vicks Vapo-Rub, can be added to the water or vaporizer to aid in opening the passageways.    Thin the mucus: Expectorants are drugs that help to expel mucus from the lungs and respiratory passages. They help to thin mucous secretions, enhancing drainage from the sinuses. The most common is guaifenesin (contained in Robitussin, for example). Over-the-counter (OTC) liquid cough medications or prescription tablets can also combine decongestants and cough suppressants to reduce symptoms as well as to eliminate the need for the use of many medications. Read label ingredients to find the right combination of ingredients or ask the pharmacist for help.    Relieve pain: Pain medication such as ibuprofen (Motrin and Advil are examples), aspirin, and acetaminophen (Tylenol is in this category) can reduce pain and inflammation. These medications help to open the airways by reducing swelling.   |Medical Treatment| The main goals in treating a sinus infection or sinusitis involve reducing the swelling or inflammation in the nasal passages and sinuses, eliminating the infection, promoting drainage from the sinuses, and maintaining open sinuses.   |Reduce inflammation  Decongestants help to reduce airway obstruction and are important in the initial treatment to alleviate symptoms.  Eliminate infection  The chief goal of treatment is wiping out bacteria from the sinus cavities with antibiotics. This helps to prevent complications, relieve symptoms, and reduce the risk of chronic sinusitis. The basic rule of thumb is to take the antibiotic until the symptoms disappear, then continue to take the antibiotic for 1 more week.  Maintain open sinuses  To treat acute sinusitis, 1 or more OTC or prescription therapies may be all that is necessary. However, for those with recurrent bouts of acute sinusitis or chronic sinusitis, the addition of an intranasal steroid may reduce symptoms. Commonly prescribed medications are Beconase, Flonase, Nasacort, Nasalide, and Vancenase.  I hope this information helps and have a great trip. Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I noticed in the last month or so, that the insides of both my ears (right on the outer edge of the canal) tingle.   The only way i can describe it, is as if someone is tickling it with the tip of a feather.  The weird thing is that, sometimes one ear will tingle, then the other, and then sometimes they'll both tingle at the exact same moment.  I told my doc about this, he looked at my ears, said all was fine.   I also think he might have thought i was a bit nuts...     I've also noticed in the past little while a sore spot on my tongue for about the same time i've had the tingling ears. It's on the right side, and it's a bit red, you can definately see the area that's sensitive. It almost looks as if it's real smoothe, and has no taste buds on it.. In the past couple days i've noticed that my neck is sore (both sides) along the anterior cervical lymph nodes.  The only thing i can think that links all this is the whole Ear / Nose / Throat connection.  Any ideas what might be wrong with me?  or am i just really going nuts.  -S\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  The cranial nerves supplying your throat do supply some of the ear. A typical outcome of these connections is how some people cough while cleaning their ears with a Q-tip or something similar. The brain senses the Q-tip sensation as coming from the throat, and tries to clear the throat producing the cough. Similarly, your inflammation of the throat could be sensed as a tickle in the ear. As your rightly commented, the ears, nose, and throat are connected in more than one ways.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "For about the last 2 months I have had problems with a lump in my throat (around the area the adam's apple is located). Sometimes it's bigger than other times and more painful, especially when I try to swallow anything, even liquids. I feel tired a lot and there's times during the day when my body feels weak and shaky all over. Right now my throat  isn't swelled up much and though it isn't real painful, as long as I swallow carefully, it is bothersome. When I first had problems with it, I had went to my Dr. for other reasons, but didn't say anything cause I also had a sore throat and thought it had something to do with that. Because of the size of my neck he had asked if I had thyroid problems (which I guess I don't... have also had other Dr.'s comment on it), he checked my neck but wasn't real concerned, so I decided at the time not to have a blood test. Because of the lump, I just recently had a blood test for my thyroid and it was 1.11, which I was told was normal. I also have a fairly high pulse rate, ranging anywhere between mid 120's to 140ish. I had told my Dr. about this and he wasn't too concerned,  because I have been having a bad flare-up with Crohn's, he thought it may have something to do with that.  Is it possible that I could have a lump on my thyroid and it not show up in the blood test?  Any other ideas what this may be?\n\n",

Labwork for the thyroid shows an over active or underactive thyroid but would not indicate if there were an actual lump. Since your symptoms seem to be persisting, I would suggest that you see your family doctor so that you can be evaluated by some other tests. Your consistently elevated heart rate needs to be evaluated as well because 120's-140's seems certainly abnormal to me, even with Chron's disease. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Did you have the ear pierced by a professional or was it done by a friend or at home?  Were hypoallergenic posts used? Are you wearing a post in the affected ear or a wire?  It is very easy for infection to develop in newly pierced ears because the area is closed tightly against a post earring allowing no air to reach the area so bacteria has a warm moist area to thrive in.  Keeping the area clean is mandatory.  Use Hydrogen Peroxide often to clean the ear lobe and dry throughly.  You might try using a hypoallergenic wire earring instead of a post and turning the wire several times a day to prevent it from sticking to the skin. If you see any pus like material coming from the opening you will need to go to the doctor for an antibiotic. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a sinus infection for the past week, no big deal happens from time to time. This morning however I work up to an unbelievable sore throat around the glandular area of my jaw, and was spitting up big globs of blood.  I went to the ER. The dr comes in I explain the details, he looks down my throat and says I have tonsilitis. Gives me a Rx for pain relief and for antibiotics.  Now at this point I had spent a total of 3 minutes being examined by the DR. I asked what to do about the blood his reply was \"spit it out\" At this point I ask myself why I needed a Dr to tell me that, it sure doesn't taste good and I wasn't gonna swollow it.  So once I get to the Pharmacy, I find that the antibiotics he prescribed to me contained Penecilian, to which I am allergic, and informed no less than 3 members of the ER staff of this, and had made sure to ask the nurse after she handed me the Rx's. After a call to the ER the pharmacy got me a suitible replacement medication.  Got home about 8:45 am and went back to bed. Woke up about noon and I am still spitting up these globs of blood. I feel I should be concerned with this, as it doesn't seem to be normal. I called the DR and he suggested i gargle with salt water. Does this seem right?\n\n",

However, my boyfriend did.  He had never had sore throats or anythng really prior to getting tonsilitis.  His was so bad that he had to get them removed a couple weeks after he was diagnosed.  He was spitting up blood also and the doctor told him to rinse with salt water also.  He had to go back several times before they ever did anything about it.  I would say the blood part is not abnormal, they said it's common once he went into have them removed.  He was also very tired.\n\n",

The tonsils are situated at the junction between the mouth and the pharynx. The pharynx is also known as the throat. Hence pharyngitis is an inflammation of the pharynx which could be bacterial or fungal or due to many other causes. One of these causes is streptococcal bacteria. In this case it is called strept throat.  Regards,\n\n",

The antibiotics have caused other thing to go wrong, female things.  i had 2 quick strep test: 1st negative & second positive.  A cpt (?) test which said it was bacterial.  Doctor had 5 vial of blood drawn & they found nothing except a slightly high sedrate level; no virus present.  I have other symptoms but am not sure they are related: not reaching deep sleep, tired, headaches always at base of skull, pain in shoulders, arms & hands.

This can happen if you have any of the list of conditions below: smoking excessive drinking of spirits mouth breathing chronic sinusitis chronic periodontal disease exposure to harmful industrial fumes long-term use of antiseptic lozenges From your profile, I can tell that the first two are not a problem for you. Do you constantly breath from your mouth due to a blocked nose? Are you overusing lozenges.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Doctor Fouad.  I do constantly breath through my mouth, but have done so all my life.  It is not that I have a blocked nose but that it is easier for me to breath through my mouth than my nose.  Almost like I can't get enough oxygen in my lungs through my nose.  I am exposed to 2nd hand smoke constantly & have trouble breathing when I get around it; I myself do not smoke.  I get regular checks from the dentist and have been told I have perfect teeth & gums.  My dentist has already check & ruled out that theory last week.  I don't think the rest apply to me.  I only started taking cough drops 3 days ago, because developed cough, & have been sick for 2 months.  My tonsils & lymphnodes are swollen, have delevoped a cough, and my throat feels scratchy.  When I first got sick I had a 101 degree temp, white patches on my tonsils, my voice went in & out, and a sore throat.  I still feel tired all the time, which I guess could be from trying to fight infection.  I have been diagnosed with 3 different things all which proved to be misdiagnosis by own doctor: bacterial infection, strep, and impacted tooth.  Went through 2 different antibioctics which did nothing to help & I have all my teeth & no wisdom teeth & dental x-rays show no impacted tooth.  My blood work showed no virus.  Could it be possible it is the second hand smoke?  Maybe an allergy?  Any suggested reading material?  Is there anything I can ask my doctor to look for?  Thank you for your valuable time and expert advice.\n\n",

It may be psychosomatic (is that the word?), but it's not my imagination.  When I swallow, I feel something lifting in the back of my throat and making a kind of clicking noise. I also find that swallowing is a bit more difficult than usual. My throat feels slightly swollen, and I feel the need for continuous swallowing. What's wrong with me? I also have a lot of stress at work and at home, and obviously I worried about my boyfriend yesterday.  Please tell me it's all just my imagination and it will go away when I forget about it?

My throat doens't hurt and it doesn't hurt when I swallow. Even when I don't swallow, it still feels like pressure on my throat from the front, as if someone is putting gentle pressure on my throat from the front. It's the same whether I swallow water or bread or anything, no difference. It's about a month now. Someone told me to give it 2 months, so I'm giving it another month now. Would hate to have to go for barium swallow and especially the tests following on that one. I think it may be this fear that keeps the swallowing problem from going away - all in my mind... Suffer from a lot of stress and recently also heartburn, which may be related to the swallowing problem, but hopefully isn't. I still hope it's all in my mind, given the timing when it started.\n\n",

    "content": "My son was born 14 months ago and I must say the whole birth etcetc was not very fun.  After 24 hours of labour, 2 epiderals, vacuum, forceps, and finaly emerg csection he was born healthy and strong.  The day after he was born I started bleeding severely from my nose and my mouth. The nurses would rush me up to Er where they would put liquid cocaine and adrenaline up my nose and then cauterize but it didn't help as this hapenned 2-3 times a day for about 5 more days. The nurses and doctors ere puzzled saying they had never seen this before which was very discomfortiung.  Anyhow, I refused a blood transfusion and finally a specialist was able to control the bleeding by a 48 hour pack etcetc.  Anyhow, I left hospital 9 days later weak and frail of course.  It took me 3 months to recover and in that time I suffered from post partum as well as being diagnosed with ptsd and a panic disorder.  i started losing all the feeling in my left side and had to undergo 3 months of testing for ms, strokes etcetc.  Finally all came back negative and my symptoms started to subside and the docs told me that it might not be wise to do this again!!!    Anyhow, here I am again, and I am 6 months pregnant and due to deliver in September by a planned csection this time.   My question, and I'm sorry about all the history is if anyone has ever heard of these nosebleeds after delivery and what could have caused them .  I did not do alot of pushing, maybe for an hour on and off, but my son wasn't coming out so other methods were tried.  They di not say that my blood pressure was low after, and my platelets wre fine but they still don't know what caused them.  I am trying to eliminate whatever it could be, epideral??anasetic? etc etc  becuse i am petrified of going through it again.  I spent what was supposed to be the happiest days of my life fearing that i was going to die and I can feel myself getting all panicked again at the thought of another episode like the first. Any advice would be so graetly appreciated.       Thank you so much.   Jody[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Helo Bill.... I haev no info on any workup reports or anything similar. While this was occuring in the hospital my ob said that they were testing my platelets, hemoglobin, etc daily and all was coming back normal except that I was in need of a transfusion from loss of blood from nosebleeds which I declined.  AS for the tests after my release, they were mri's for M.S, etc, and they came back negative, as well as the cat scans for stroke, etc.  That is teh only results I was ever given , I hope that I have been a bit helpful in responding and that you may have some answers for me.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

I am getting so worried and now even more things are happening. please read my previous thread \"visual to the naked eye- epiglottis\"  for background.  Along with all those symptoms of something very freaky, also i have discovered the roof of my mouth is completly white. it is not sore at all. around 2 years ago i had a very bad problem with dental problems. i am wondering if the white roof is anything to do with my other freaky thing-epiglottis. i am so worried about this. daily life and eating is becoming unbearable and my doc has referred me to a 17 week waitin list. things are getting worsse daily, and still i havent a clue as to why?   If anyone can offer even the tiniest shred of advice or info for me i would be extremely grateful   thanks in advance\n\n",

Fungal infection, usually candida, causes white membranes over the mucosa of the oral cavity and pharynx. Perhaps an esophagitis could have been the problem all along.  You will need to consult your doctor to get yourself examined to determine what really is behind all this. Meanwhile, you may get symptomatic relief using gargles like cetacaine/lidocaine if there is pain on swallowing.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Daddy very sick...help!",
    "content": "Dear Zookclan,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Causes of vomiting are various, please, refer to the following link for a list of the causes of vomiting  Click here!  In your dad's case, if this vomiting is positional, like you mentioned, happens when your dad is trying to lay down, how about other positions of the head? Because if this is the case, the cause of the vomiting might be either a problem with your dad's eyes, as a result of a small stroke or paralysis in one of the nerves supplying the eye muscles. In this case, he needs a ct scan of the head and/or orbits to make sure there is nothing there. It might also be related to your dad having an inner ear problem. In this case, there are certain medications that are given and your dad needs to see an ear, nose and throat specialist. Third possibility is that your dad might have had a stroke, but usually, with vomiting, the area of the brain that strokes out is so critical that your dad should have lost consciousness and developped other symptoms of stroke like paralysis and so forth.  The reason might be local in your dad's gut, there might be a problem, you have not mentioned whether your dad has diabetes or not, ever had a stomach ulcer, whether he had any abdominal sugeries before, whether this vomiting is associated with diarrhea or fever, as the symptoms accompanying vomiting in most of the times give clues about the causes of the vomiting.  If this has been going on for quite sometime like you said and it is affecting your dad's health, i think your dad has to be admitted to the hospital, not eat anything for a while, given intravenous fluids and has some investigations done in the form of a ct scan of the abdomen, an upper endoscopy of the gastrointestinal tract to if there is any reason in your dad's stomach to have this ongoing vomiting.   Regarding your dad vomiting blood, it could be that your dad was retching so violently when he was vomiting that something tore up and that is why he needs to be admitted to the hospital asap and be seen by a gastrointestinal specialist.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,   Thank u for helping so much in my previous inquiries...I was writing again because of the following:   I went to the doctor three weeks ago with a sore throat - very painful! ...they did a throat culture & sent me back home .... no one ever called back, so I assumed it was just a viral infection.  About a week later, I ended up in Urgent Care with a high fever & was prescribed antibiotics for my \"Strep Throat\"....This is what I was wondering about, I usually get a bad case of strep, at least once a year....but I think what I have is Scarred Tonsilitis....ever since I was little they will get so swollen even to swallow my own saliva would hurt like if I was swallowing glass....and I have seen the simptoms of such conditions and most apply to me.  For the last three years it gets so bad, with fever, weakness, nausea, & headache....and after the infection is gone, I still end up with a bad cough that lasts for weeks!...and feel tired all the time......this last time I couldn't even walk or get up from bed.  WHy won't the doctor want to remove them?? I was scheduled for surgery when I was little once, but it got cancelled. I am just tired of them   I finished my antiobitics, and two days later my throat started hurting again....  Also, this does not relate, but I have bruises all over my body - big Purple & green bruises on my legs, & arms & hands.....All my blood tests came out normal, but the bruises are big & they hurt, and my mom is worried.... should I go for any specific test??  Thank u very much again for all your help.  Sincerely,   Laura\n\n",

It seems your doctor is referring to an inflammation of the tonsils (tonsilitis). Some people are more prone to tonsillitis that their tonsils end up so inflammed that instead of protecting against infection (their normal function) they end up becoming a source of infection. Thats when they require removal by surgery.\n\n",
