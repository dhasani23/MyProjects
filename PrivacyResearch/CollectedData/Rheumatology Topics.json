    "title": "travelling joint pain, stomach pain",
    "content": "My sister is 16 years old and has always been an exceptionally healthy individual. For the past 4-5 months she has been suffering from serious joint, stomach, muscle and head pain.  During the H1N1 pandemic, she was diagnosed and placed on the tamiflu vaccine. After seemingly getting over the flu a few months later she began feeling sick again.  Her various symptoms, which appear in an array of combinations and wax and wane, include: -sever head aches -severe travelling joint pains (going from the elbow to knees to fingers in a matter of minutes) -severe abdominal pain -diarrhea  -constipation -muscle pain -dizziness -blurry vision -burping -occasional difficulty sleeping (mostly due to the pain)  She was, after seeing our GP, referred to a rheumatologist. She was tested for Chron's and Lyme's diseases both were negative. Appendicitis was ruled out after a bout of serious abdominal pain. Her haemoglobin test also came back within the norm. Mediterranean flu was also considered, but ruled out as well. She has had countless blood tests done, none which suggest anything out of the ordinary except for a slightly elevated white blood cell count (although that still was within normal range).  After that she went to a naturopath. After taking more blood work they found that her iron count (11) was exceptionally low and that she was sensitive to wheat, acidic fruits and eggs. As well it was discovered that her stomach lining and digestive tracts were destroyed from the tamiflu vaccine and subsequent antibiotic prescriptions at the onset of these symptoms.  However, after over a month of altering her diet to eliminate those foods, taking vitamin c, iron supplements, probiotic supplements and natural pills to repair the stomach lining, the symptoms still return.  She has upcoming appointments with a paediatric rheumatologist as well as a scheduled colonoscopy with a gastro specialist.  Our GP also suggested seeing a dietician.  We have also considered fibromyalgia, though she does not necessarily display severe fatigue and memory loss.  My family has come to a complete loss in trying to figure out what is causing these symptoms so that they may be properly treated. It has completely affected her life as at times, she finds she is constantly dealing with some sort of pain.  Please help with any suggestions of possible causes and paths to follow in order to solve this otherwise very mysterious illness.  Thank you very much in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Vivian14,  RA (rheumatoid antigen) can be positive in several different conditions beyond rheumatoid arthritis.  It can also be incidentally positive without disease.  If it is specifically your muscles hurting and not your joints then rheumatoid arthritis seems a bit less likely for you.  I would, however, recommend you see your doctor and possibly a rheumatologist, for further evaluation.  There are several autoimmune diseases that can affect the muscle.  Beyond the autoimmune issues there is a huge list of possible causes.    Low vitamin D is becoming very common and may or may not actually be related to your symptoms.  It may simply be that you are one of the many that are low and need to take some vitamin D supplementation.  Your doctor can help you determine how much to take.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 33yo, average to thick build guy who works seven days a week, with the weekends being just part-time work in a retail environment where I'm on my feet the whole time.  I've been dieting the last three months and have lost almost 40lbs which I'm very proud of, but in the last few days I've started to have pain in the muscle area just above my left knee.  The area is the whole front part of the lower thigh including the sides, but mainly on the front.  The pain coverage area goes about 3-4in above my knee cap.  The skin color is normal, but is very sensitive to the touch.  As if you were being stung by little tiny bee's... The underlying muscle is very sore.  When I walk around, it almost feels like I have a pouch of water sitting above the knee cap.  I've tried cold and heat packs for 20min at a time, no change...  I'm hoping a professional will have some good ideas for me.  I do plan on visiting my primary care physician soon... but would like to get some insight of what this issue could be.  Thank you for your help!  -Mike -Phoenix, AZ\n\n",

    "content": "Obviously Ehlers Danlos can be a catastrophe waiting to happen, however, I experienced a problem that made me ponder how rapidly things can progress.  Imagine yourself walking down the street.  As one leg steps down, the other leg lifts off the ground for a split second leaving your body weight balanced soley on the planted leg.  It was at this point that the leg supporting my weight all of a sudden had zero feeling in it, all the joints of that leg succumbed to gravity causing my 210 lb. frame to collapse to the ground like a sack of bricks in the ocean.  Upon impact a bone in my foot was broken and a ligament was probably avulsed.  I'm not concerned about the broken foot, it happens.  I am curious about the complete dysfunction of the leg that caused my rapid descent.  Immediatley following the fall, all the joints of the collapsed leg regained function.  The Dr. at the ER and the Ortho looked at me like I was nuts when I was telling them how I fell.  They offered no summation of what possibly could have happened.  The joints that gave way were the hip, knee, and ankle (maybe not the hip).  Any postulations would be greatly appreciated. Not looking for an epihony, just some suggestions.  At 31 years old, I had to use a scooter at Wal-Mart.  The stares from the senior citizens felt like pure hatred.  Worst of all, I live in an area with one Rheumy and his help has been minimal.  \"Prepare to get a wheelchair or scooter, bend over for a steriod shot, and here's a handicap placard.\"  Just so far away from any other decent sized city.

    "title": "Multiple joint pain and pitting edema",
    "content": "I've been experiencing joint pain in multiple joints for the last four months and for the last two days, I've also had pitting edema in my lower legs. I'm baffled.   My medical history is:   Born at 35 weeks gestation with slightly premature lungs. Had ear infections off and on the entire first year. Tubes were put in my ears at 15mos. Ear infections continued until around age 12. From ages 8-14, I had bronchitis or pneumonia every spring and winter. Menses began at age 12. By 13, my cycles were painful. At 14, I had an ovarian cyst on my left ovary. From ages 14-18 I suffered with depression. I left home after graduating from high school at 17 and went to college. At 18, I was diagnosed with spina bifida occulta- my spine failed to fuse at the S1 level. (That explains the sciatica and lower back pain!) I married a soldier at 19, and gave birth to our first son the following year. The pregnancy was unremarkable until the 36th week when I went in for a routine appointment. My blood pressure was 163/97 and I had a 3+ protein on dipstick. Stress test was fine, but they decided to induce labor immediately and started mag. This was to become the norm for my pregnancies. After this little one was born,  with magnesium poisoning, premature lung disease, and congenital pneumonia, with the aid of forceps, I decided no more kids! That lasted two years, at which time I was diagnosed with secondary infertility due to insulin resistant diabetes not pcos. After three months on metformin, I was able to concieve. This time around, the high blood pressure and protein began in the 33rd week. Labor was held off until the 37th week. Perfect baby, great labor. Two years later, baby three came along. Preeclampsia began in the 35th week, but due to a lapse in healthcare (military hospital), baby wasn't born until 39 weeks. Perfect baby. No magnesium this time around. Seven months later, severe stomach pains began. Labs were normal. CT scan showed fluid in the abdomen. Nothing was diagnosed or further explored. The following year, baby four came along. The high blood pressure began in the early second trimester. A rise in protein was also noted through \"routine\" 24hr urines done every three weeks. I decided to seek civilian care, feeling this pregnancy warranted good healthcare. I got lucky and had the military perinatologist (who had retired) I'd had with the two previous pregnancies, and an amazing OB. At 27 weeks, my 24hr urine came back over 400. We began steroids in preparation of baby's imminent arrival. BUT my bp dropped as long as I was resting, so I was allowed to go home on strict bed rest. No further 24hr urines were ordered. Labor was induced at 37 weeks and baby was born with vacuume assistance. BP returned to normal within two weeks. I spoke with my OB about my painful periods and he said it was probably endometriosis, but only by doing surgery would he be able to give a diagnosis. He also said that he and my peri were doubting it was actually preeclampsia but some underlying condition that was popping up due to the stress of pregnancy. Unfortunately, my time with him was up and I returned to military health care. That leads us to when THIS stuff began. (=  Nine months after my last little one was born, I woke up with a sore left knee. It was slightly swollen. Thinking I'd slept funny, I ignored it for two days. When it didn't get better, I was referred to an \"over-flow doctor\" as my regular clinic was full. X-rays showed fluid but no joint damage. That evening, my right knee started hurting and swelling. By the following week, other joints were affected. Right shoulder, then left shoulder. Left hand, right hand. Left ankle, right ankle. Hips. Even my toes- the big ones and the little ones, but the ones in the middle escaped this stuff. I returned to the doctor only one week after the joint pain began. RA was his thinking and wanted to begin steroids, but I was breastfeeding, so he said motrin, tylenol, and heat for the pain, cold for the swelling. He also ordered lab tests.  I followed up with my assigned primary care doctor who had the same thought.  She ordered lab tests.  In both sets of tests, my sed rate was slightly elevated. All else was normal/negative. Other sets of xrays were done on my shoulders, feet, and hands- fluid free. I was sent to a rheumatologist. He said it could be early RA, said to try mobic 2x/day, and said to follow up in 3mos or sooner if any of my major joints swelled up 2-3x their normal size, but that hand swelling was normal and not medically important. That appointment was a 6 weeks ago. I tried the mobic for a week, but switched back to my motrin/tylenol regime as it works better for the joint pain and the menustral pain. Two days ago, I noticed my lower legs were swollen. I smooshed them and realized it was pitting edema! I've only had that when pregnant. I have an appointment with a GYN nurse next week, but I'm wondering if I should schedule an appointment with my primary care provider for this asap or if it could wait a bit. What could be causing this? The potential RA? What tests should I ask for?   Thanks in advance for all your insight and information. I feel it's necessary for me to become informed and proactive in my quest for adequate healthcare.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 yr. old female with three small children.  I was just diagnosed last week with Lupus and have yet to see the Rheaumatologist.  A month ago I broke out in this horrible rash on my face and hands.  I went to the ER, they treated it like an allergic reaction.  They also figured out I had thrush and a kidney infection at the same time.  I was sent home with meds and told to follow up with my dr.  When I followed up with my dr I had a horribly cough and was very short of breath.  She indicated it was pleurisy.  It has been two weeks now and the only symptom I have had that is very bothersome is fatigue.  Last night the rash flared back up again on my face and I feel like I have been set on fire.  During the night I woke up with a nose bleed and my left jaw, gums, and teeth throbbing in pain.  This morning I woke up with a horrible headache, dizziness, lethargy, vomiting evey 30 minutes, and my face looks worse.  I am not really sure what to do at the point.  My regular doctor is out of town and I do not have a rheumatologist to contact yet.   Should I try to bear the pain and wait it out or should I bother with the ER and try to get some relief?  Does any of this sound emergent?  I just don't want them thinking I am drug seeking but I am in pain.  Also, I am concerned about my symptoms.  Please advise on the best course of treatment.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  I apologize that this response is not as timely as you likely had hoped.  With the diagnosis of lupus, it's very important to see a rheumatologist at the earliest opportunity.  Meanwhile, when symptoms are so acute, if your own doctor isn't available, there is probably someone covering for her who can provide interim treatment.  If it's urgent, by all means go to urgent care or the emergency room.  The interim treatment may be a short course of steroid therapy, as Prednisone, to reduce the inflammation.  There are other medications very useful in the treatment of lupus, including quinine-based medications, immunosuppressants or chemotherapy agents that your rheumatologist may suggest after evaluating your specific symptomatology.  It's important that you rest whenever possible, at least until your condition has stabilized, since fatigue is often a factor in lupus.    Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  Making the diagnosis of any form of lupus is very difficult, as signs and symptoms vary so much from person to person.  The Lupus Foundation has said that the term \"lupus\" may actually include as many as 200 different forms of this type of autoimmune disease because of that variability.    The diagnosis of lupus is generally made clinically, that is, based on the symptoms the person is experiencing.  There is really no hard and fast test for lupus.  An elevated ANA means there is inflammation in the body; persons with lupus may or may not have an elevated ANA, or the ANA may convert to positive well after the diagnosis is made.  Positive ANAs may also convert to negative when the inflammation is controlled.  The diagnosis is usually made by a Rheumatologist.  The American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of lupus recommend that the person experience 4 or more of the following (although the diagnosis can be made with fewer than 4):  Malar rash on face Discoid rash, which is raised, scaly patches anywhere on the skin Sun-related rash, which appears after exposure to sunlight Joint pain and swelling in 2 or more joints, at any time Swelling of the linings around the heart or lungs Kidney disease Neurological disorder, as seizures, psychosis, memory issues Low blood counts, including red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets Positive ANA Other positive tests, as double-stranded anti-DNA, anti-Sm test, anti-phospholipid antibody test, and/or false-positive syphilis test Other lab tests, which may include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests and urinalysis.    Oral sores, fatigue, headache, hair loss and Raynaud's Phenomenon are known to occur with lupus.    Although it's impossible for a diagnosis to be made or suggested in this type of forum, because you do appear to have several of the symptoms known to be consistent with lupus, I encourage you to see a rheumatologist for evaluation.    I wish you the very best of luck.\n\n",

The American College of Rheumatology criteria for the diagnosis of lupus recommend that the person experience 4 or more of the following (although the diagnosis can be made with fewer than 4):  Malar rash on face Discoid rash, which is raised, scaly patches anywhere on the skin Sun-related rash, which appears after exposure to sunlight Joint pain and swelling in 2 or more joints, at any time Swelling of the linings around the heart or lungs Kidney disease Neurological disorder, as seizures, psychosis, memory issues Low blood counts, including red blood cells, white blood cells or platelets Positive ANA Other positive tests, as double-stranded anti-DNA, anti-Sm test, anti-phospholipid antibody test, and/or false-positive syphilis test Other lab tests, which may include an elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, kidney and liver function tests and urinalysis.    Oral sores, fatigue, headache, hair loss and Raynaud's Phenomenon are known to occur with lupus.    Although it's impossible for a diagnosis to be made or suggested in this type of forum, because you do appear to have several of the symptoms known to be consistent with lupus, I encourage you to see a rheumatologist for evaluation.    I wish you the very best of luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Episodic debilitating joint pain, mostly in hands",
    "content": "Hello doctors :) Like the topic says, I have episodes of rather severe joint pain, primarily in my hands, but also occasionally (and less severely) in the knees and ankles. I have had some amount of discomfort since I can remember, and there is always a small amount of \"background\" discomfort, but nothing I'd call debilitating, and comparable to having a constant nagging headache. These past ~2 years, however, the episodes have gotten much worse, to the point where it's difficult to move about or do anything with my hands. Lifting a glass to drink, for example, can be quite painful. For reference, I'm a 22 year old male and a senior in college now.  I've found the actual sensation of the pain is very difficult to describe (ie, \"stabbing,\" \"pinching,\" etc. - if you have a list of words I'd be happy to look them over and try to pick one). However, there are some patterns it follows as far as what makes it better or worse, comfortable positions and so on. In the hands, the pain is almost entirely in the \"middle\" joins (proximal, if I remember my anatomy). It gets worse as I open my hand, and I get a sensation that I'm stretching something on the underside of the knuckle. During these episodes, it's most comfortable to just let my hand go limp, and not try to either open or close my hand further than it does by itself. It usually contracts to an almost fist position. Closing my hands further produces more joint pain, a similar, also uncomfortable stretching feeling on the top of the knuckles that connect the fingers to the rest of the hand (sorry... don't remember that one, heh). For what it's worth, I have noticed that squeezing a knuckle on the top and bottom stops the pain. As far as the knees/ankles go, the pain is similar to the hand pain in feeling, but duller. My legs in general feel sluggish and heavy when these episodes pop up. I don't know how relevant this is, but I thought it best to describe as much as I could.  As for relief - I can't tell you how much money I've probably wasted on aspirin, naproxen, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. I've tried all of them, sometimes having to take the maximum recommended daily dose all at once to get anything resembling relief. Sometimes I've had to do this more than once a day (though I try not to). I went on a doctor-recommended ibuprofen regimen (three times a day, I've forgotten the dosage) probably two months and quit after no success. I've tried hand creams (trolamine salicylate, things like Icy Hot) with no luck. I feel like I've run out over-the-counter options for pain relief.   My experiences with doctors have been less than encouraging, to say the least. The ones that I feel like have even taken me semi-seriously, rather than probably just thinking I wanted a script for narcotics, ran a some blood tests that came back negative. Aside from the standard, as far as I recall, they checked thyroid levels and tested for arthritis, neither of which seemed abnormal. I've had x-rays of my hands which a doctor (I don't think I met him/her) apparently said looked fine. I have not been on nor been offered any prescription medications for the pain.  Triggers have been tricky to identify. The only thing I feel semi-comfortable pointing to is caffeine. However, the pain usually sets in after the caffeine has worn off (several hours later). For example, I had a few cups of coffee this morning, and then had an episode (am having one, actually) around 7 or 8pm tonight, hence my encouragement to seek out online help.  That's nearly all the information I can think of at the moment (and I know it's a lot - sorry!). The only other things I can possibly think of are that these episodes sometimes come along with bowel issues and a both mental and body-wide physical sensation of... Hmm, \"tension\" and \"discomfort\" are the best words I can think of for it. Anyway, I'll be quiet now - I'm sure you're plenty bored by now, haha! Thanks to whoever replies! :)\n\n",

    "title": "joint pain & sore throat lasting 5 weeks after strep",
    "content": "Hello, I had strep throat in May 2010, and took 10 days of penicillin. I felt better after the meds, but 3 days after I finished them I started to have a sore throat again, but this time it felt more like a burning pain in my throat, and I could hardly swallow my saliva. I took Motrin every 4-5 hrs for 21 days; it was the only thing that helped. When it wore off, my throat would burn again, and my joints (mainly ankles and knees) hurt. I also started having night sweats and developed pink eye in my right eye. I saw my primary care doc who did a strep culture which was negative. After 14 days of the sore throat, I saw an ENT who scoped me and said my throat looked very red and it was probably a viral infection that would go away. He sent me for a CT scan of my sinuses which were normal. On the 18th day of the sore/burning throat, I broke out with what looked like canker sores in the back of my throat. They lasted a few days and went away, and so did the pain in my joints, too. The night sweats also subsided. I was symptom-free for 7 days, and then the sore/burning throat started again, along with the joint pain and night sweats. I don't have a fever, although the glands in my neck seem slightly swollen and tender. I have a headache once in a while, too, and my right eye is red/bloodshot. (My husband is an eye doc and checked my eyes but didn't find anything remarkable). My throat burns so bad I can barely swallow and Motrin seems to only last a few hours this time.  All of these symptoms started after I got strep in May, and I'm thinking I might be having have some type of autoimmune response. I have 2 children, ages 4 and 18 months, and I'm having a hard time taking care of them because I feel so awful all the time, and I'm tired, too. Any thoughts you have as to who I should see next (ENT again, primary doc, rheumatologist) would be greatly appreciated. I'm not sure who to go to for help. Thank you, LMERN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Imern,  What a difficult and distressing situation for you!  You have certainly gone beyond a reasonable time for the symptoms to resolve, so it is indeed time to seek help from a physician.  Perhaps the best place to start is to see your usual physician for a complete physical examination.  Did you see a physician when you had the lesions in the back of your throat?  A viral episode is certainly possible, but there should be signs of improvement after 2 weeks or less.  Discuss with your doctor if he or she would recommend an immunologist or rheumatologist as the next step if all of his or her findings are negative.  A medication such as xylocaine viscous(which you swallow) may help your comfort level while you are waiting for your next evaluation; be sure your doctor understands how miserable this has been.  If the immunologist or rheumatologist evaluation comes up negative, I would then ask to see an infectious disease specialist.  You may have superimposed infections, and evaluation and treatment is obviously needed.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Doctor.  Lost my fiancee to an ICH and just trying to understand some things I'm not sure of.  I'll try to make it short.  Lupus and autoimmune hepatitis patient.  On low dose steroids, lyrica and antimalarials.  Got a rash and then what seemed like a bad cold with fever.  was getting better but then got worse so took her to the ER.  Seemed to be a 'flare' and / or infection.  Low platelets, red and white cells. Had a headache also.  Admitted with treatment being various antibiotics, continued lyrica and hydrocholoquine, and added high dose steroids (60 - 80mg).     CT performed at admission.  CT was clear. Headache continued for some time on and off up to an 8 of 10 on pain scale but gone by day 3.  Improvement in all areas (rash included) by day 3 and 4.  Afternoon of day 5 developed headache which continued through dose of , 2 doses of hydrocodone, and a dose of percoset.  Increasing strength.  ICH.  Never recovered.  My questions are... they say that the high dose steroids (prednisone) should have prevented any inflammation leading to the event.  does this make sense?  Could it have been as simple as 'stop the headache'? (antihistimines had worked once before that I know of, or is it that the steroids were stronger and shouldn't have allowed for a headache in the first place?)  Thanks for any help you can give.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Seven11,  I am very sorry for your loss.  The death of a loved one is difficult enough when the reason for death is clear, and so much more difficult when it is unclear.  I'll try to help you understand some of the factors surrounding her death.  Your fiancee's autoimmune system was very compromised, according to the diagnoses of lupus and autoimmune hepatitis.  The diagnoses themselves mean that there was chronic inflammation, regardless of the type of lupus.  If the skin is inflamed in lupus, as evidenced by the rash you describe, the internal system is also inflamed to some degree, which can be from mild to severe.  Prednisone and antimalarials help manage and control symptoms, but the underlying disease process persists.  Both the disease and the prednisone have long term effects, which result in a weakened overall system.  The high doses of prednisone, then, would help prevent increased inflammation, but would not be able to completely eliminate it, due to the nature of the underlying disease process.  If a person's circulatory system has been weakened over time by some degree of chronic inflammation, there is a lower threshold for a catastrophic event.  The onset of an intracranial hemorrhage can be gradual and episodic, with varying degrees of headache as it progresses, or it can be sudden, particularly with hypertension.  The CT is the preferred diagnostic aid, but unfortunately, some microlesions or weakened areas simply are too small to be readily identified.  In some cases, no specific cause for cerebral hemorrhage can be identified.  It's extremely unlikely that it could have been as simple as \"stop the headache.\"   It's more likely that it would have required eliminating the complexities of the underlying disease process to stop the headache, which medical science has not yet been able to do.    I hope this is helpful to you.  Again, I am very sorry for your loss.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Thank you so much for your response.  I really appreciate it very much, as well as the condolences.  A couple of follow up items though by your answer, I'm not sure it changes anything.  The autoimmune hepatitis had been in remission.  No issues for over several years with a visit (including bloodwork) within the last couple of months as well.  The rheumatologist was calling her condition lupus just to give it a name and says that it was going in that direction, but really hadn't chosen a path just yet.  (I know you need to have several items as well as a few other definitive tests to be sure.)  She had been to the rheumatologist just a week or two before the rash and all was fine including all the usual bloodwork.  (He is fairly puzzled by the outcome as well as he labeled her condition before this as stable.)  Hence the thought that it was a cold though in retrospect, obviously that was a mistake and I should have followed through and gone back due to the rash being new.  Bloodwork in the hospital included a visit from the hematologist to check for various and multiple items (though no specific as none was known to be the cause).  other than the counts (white and red) being low, no other issues were found.  The counts, as well as the rash were improved within a few days.  I guess this is the piece that confuses me as it would seem that he improvement in counts and the rash would indicate overall improvement, but I guess you're saying that the underlying issues were still there, and then simply attacked again, with an even lower threshold for issues?  Almost a catch 22 of get the counts up, but when you do issues come back.  The rapid change from the previous rheumy visit is puzzling to say the least.  I did find out later that she had been having headaches, but with a family history of allergies, unfortunately they were assumed to be related sinus headaches as they went away with allergy / sinus medication.  Okay on the CT.  I was wondering about that as opposed to MRI.  A CSF after the event showed no infections strangely enough.  Again, thank you for your time.  I really appreciate the help.\n\n",

Medicine continues to be an art as well as a science, so that sometimes with the very best medical investigation, it is still somewhat of a \"best guess.\"  With her family history of allergies, the first logical thought is that her headaches could be attributed to a similar cause.

    "content": "Hello jwhitley1,  What a distressing situation for you.  Perhaps you can ask your parents to help advocate for you to have a complete physical examination, with evaluation by both rheumatology and neurology, as well.  The elevated ANA is of concern to me, and an autoimmune condition would be entirely compatible with the symptoms and difficulties that you describe.  However, both rheumatological and neurological issues need to be evaluated.  If everything is determined to be negative and a psychological evaluation is suggested, by all means pursue it, since you must be having considerable anxiety about the symptoms that you are experiencing.  I don't believe that a psychological disturbance will be found to be the underlying cause of your condition, however.  A CT or MRI of your sacroiliac joints may also be helpful in determining the underlying cause.  I encourage your parents to discuss with your doctor that it is time to explore this situation in depth.  I hope this is helpful to you, and I wish you good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, portalbuzz,  I'm pleased for you that your gout is under control - sometimes that is a very difficult thing to do.  You must be cooperating fully with any dietary restrictions, as well as being compliant with your medications.  I congratulate you!  Regarding your other pains, it's often very difficult to tell if it is actual bone pain or deep muscle pain.  I encourage you to ask your doctor for a complete physical examination to determine if there is an obvious underlying cause for your pains; ask him to include X-rays or any scans he may feel are indicated.  In the interim, please maintain a daily record of the pains - the location, duration, what you were doing at the time they occurred, and if anything helped relieve them, such as postural adjustments or medication.  Take your record with you when you see your doctor to discuss the complete physical.  It will help him determine any diagnostic pattern and may suggest if a neurological or rheumatological (or other) evaluation is indicated.  It's entirely reasonable that you would be feeling some anxiety about all this, and anxiety can accentuate pain.  Ask your doctor to consider that aspect, as well.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

If I miss my dose 1 or 2 consecutive times my joints will start hurting Very much (especially my finger joints and left big joint toe...so I try not to miss it at all. I tried Colchicine once before two 0.6mg pills and it really worked but had Diarrhea a few hours later never tried it again also heard it can rapidly build up in your body and cause serious problems even death...so I'll just stick with Uloric it's great and hardly feel any pains and no side effects. As to my other Bone pains..I havent felt any for a while so I'm guessing it's part of my gout and the Uloric is helping with that as well. Well thanks again and sorry for the long post. : )  Thank you very much\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis two weeks ago, and prescribed 7.5 mg of Methotrexate. Within 5 hours of taking it (7.5 mg) I was so groggy I could not drive. In the evening I began to experience a very long bout of muscle twitching--continuous for hour/now days. Benign fasciculations been a problem with me for over a decade--but usually it is off and on. Although daily--it's rarely continuous. I also take potassium, magnesium, and calcium every day.  I have several other medical conditions, and I often react negatively to meds. There appears a direct correlation to me taking the methotrexate and experiencing continuous twitching, sharp pains in my arms, legs and back, and sleeplessness--no doubt exacerbated by the deep muscle twitches.   I may have to stop the methotrexate as I find myself functioning a whole lot worse before I took it. I already have low platelets and WBC, but my RF was negative. My rheumatologist was rather meticulous in assessing my problem, so I am hoping he will be flexible to help me find the right medicine (hoping). Has anyone else experienced twitches or an increase in twitching upon starting methotrexate? Any advice or input is welcomed.\n\n",

If you have not informed your rheumatologist of your symptoms since beginning the methotrexate, please do so right away.  Muscle pain, joint pain, insomnia, dizziness, malaise, and fatigue have been identified as potential side effects of methotrexate, as well as epidsodes of hypersensitivity to the drug.  It would be helpful for you and your rheumatologist to discuss the benefit vs. side effects on your overall condition, as well as any possible alternative medications.  I encourage you to begin a daily record of your symptoms, including what the symptom is, what time it began, what time your medication was taken, what you were doing when the symptom began, how long it lasted, what helped or made it worse, and any other information that you feel is important.  Take your record with you to all appointments.  It will provide a clear view of the status of your condition and the effects/side effects of the medications that are prescribed.  Once again, I urge you to notify your rheumatologist right away of your difficulties with the medication.  I sincerely hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I suffer from joint hyper mobility and have my whole life. I\u2019ve just only recently, however, been diagnosed with it. I\u2019m a male student (early 20s) that lives a predominately sedentary lifestyle (though am in relatively good shape because I do plenty of non-taxing exercising). Though the hyper mobility was more fun (look what I can do!) than it presented a problem when I was younger, within the last few years, I\u2019ve recently started to experience joint popping and pain in various places. Most notably, my right femur pops every time I take a single step ascending stairs, and often when I\u2019m just walking across flat surfaces (even carpeted ones). Although I haven\u2019t experienced pain concurrently with the popping, I\u2019ve been experiencing pains in bed at night right where my femur pops. I\u2019ve just recently had an X-ray, moreover, which came back \u201cunremarkable\u201c. I\u2019m quite certain, therefore, that it has everything to do with my joint hyper mobility.  My question: I\u2019m wondering what I can possibly do about the various pains I experience as a result of my hypermobility. I\u2019ve tried the gamut of OTC analgesics (to no avail), and have asked both my former primary physician and a rheumatologist to treat my symptoms, but was refused help by both. On top of other disappointments with the medical profession (and they are many) I\u2019m losing hope that I\u2019ll find a doctor who will give me more than a \u201cWell what do you want ME to do about it?\u201d. At this point, I\u2019m starting to think I'm better off going back to suffering in silence, as depressing as it sounds.   So, in short, who should I see/ what should I tell them/ what should I do at this point? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Analgesics are at best only symptomatic. The cornerstone in the management of individuals with joint hypermobility is physical therapy to strengthen the muscles which surround and stabilize the joints.You stand to gain significantly by being under the care of an expert physical therapist who can tailor the exercises to a given individual.  A physical therapists generally would decide on what sorts of disabilities exist in a given individual and the priorities.  Joints and the muscles that move them act as a single unit.The proprioceptors within the joints and the ligaments appear to have a feed-back control (a feed-back loop)over the muscles that move the joints as well as muscles that stabilize the joint(stabilizing muscles-which may be more proximal in location).They complement each other.  Thus, physical therapy to enhance the stability and function of the joints may involve, - strengthening of the muscles that actually move a joint and - strengthening of the more proximal stabilizing muscles.  \"Dynamic\" stabilization exercises are recommended by some.These involve gentle.short range, sustained tonic exercises that are believed to enhance the function of the feed-back loop that we mentioned earlier by stimulating the 'postural and slow twitch muscle units' within the muscles in question.Exercises such as co-contraction and co-activation of muscle groups(agonists and antagonists) is also one of the techniques recommended.  The extent of benefits one may gain out of physical therapy ultimately will depend upon, - availability of expertise (with special interest in treating individuals with joint hypermobility disorders),and  - patient compliance.  As far as you are concerned, i feel that analgesics are not the answer and you must find an expert physical therapist and comply with his/her guidance. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your reply. I most probably will look for a good physical therapist sometime soon for associated problems with my hyper mobility. However, one (of many) of my other problems is chronic pain in my right wrist post corrective surgery for a fractured scaphoid bone. It\u2019s mobility is limited, I\u2019d guess it has about 75% of its former range, and whenever I hit the limit in either direction, it hurts (for example, I couldn\u2019t do a normal pushup (due to the angle of the wrists it requires) if my life depended on it). Luckily I was never an athlete to begin with, because I couldn\u2019t play any sports that put a significant strain on the wrist ever since I had the surgery. I mentioned this chronic pain to the same rheumatologist, and he directed me to the surgeon that performed the operation. This was unfortunate for me because I already had an appointment with the surgeon, but cancelled it because I falsely presumed seeing him and the rheumatologist both would be redundant. Now I have to wait for god knows how long to get an appointment with the surgeon again.  In any case, since the chronic pain in my right wrist is not solely the result (though perhaps partially) of my hyper flexibility, but more the after effect of surgery, and since I still regularly perform the very same exercises for the wrist that I was taught from the physical therapist I saw after the surgery, I don\u2019t think there\u2019s much more for me to do for the wrist physical therapy wise. Though I treat it like I\u2019m supposed to, that doesn\u2019t stop it from hurting/ cramping regularly from doing things as simple as writing or typing for extended periods of time. The 35 minute writing portion of the LSAT, for example, caused it to bother me throughout. It\u2019s no fun, frankly. But again, it could be worse. At least I\u2019m not athletic, or I would probably have been ruined. Though my hip is the latest nuisance, my right wrist is the oldest of the most bothersome of the lot of my health problems, 3 years running, now.  My joint pains, then, aren\u2019t just limited to my hyper mobility, and I probably should have made that explicit in my first post. However, in addition to complaining of pain from my hyper mobility AND my right (and dominant) wrist, neither the rheumatologist, nor the former primary, would prescribe anything.  I realize physical therapy IS beneficial for my wrist, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m still doing what they taught me. However, it\u2019s simply not enough to eliminate my wrist from paining me during the most trivial of activities. My request of analgesics, then, took both of these problems together. I figured it was about the only option for my wrist, short of possibly another surgery (to end up leaving it worse off, perhaps?). I could understand (though still probably wouldn\u2019t like) being refused were my only problems from issues such as my femur popping (I also have TMJ pain, by the way, and wear a night guard for it regularly), but with the wrist pain added to it, I simply don\u2019t understand .   But assuming that I don\u2019t want/ can\u2019t afford another surgery right now, and that I\u2019m still doing the physical strengthening exercises I was taught in physical therapy for my wrist, is my asking for a stronger analgesic, after having attempted to self medicate myself with OTC analgesics ever since I had the surgery, really that preposterous of a request as to be twice refused?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Regarding the issue of pain control for chronic right wrist pain secondary to hypermobility syndrome and post fracture repair of the scaphoid: changing from OTC analgesia to prescribed medication will need to be discussed with your family physician.  There are increased risks of dependency and addiction with long term narcotic pain medication use and according to some studies (e.g in chronic low back pain conditions) efficacy is very low.   Other consideration are heat and cold modalities, splinting and continued exercise.  Regarding the hypermobility syndrome: dynamic stabilization exercises for whole body are important as other areas of the body will tend to flare up with popping and pain so start now to prevent future problems.   Take care.\n\n",

I was told then that i have some nerve inflamed probably and diclofenic Na was started. The pain was always under a control and i had to use medicine one a week maximum.

    "title": "Re: General Information about RA",
    "content": "Hello bafrog,  Rheumatoid arthritis is an unpredictable disease, since it can be dormant for long periods of time or have frequent flares.  When flares occur and pain is increased, it is an indication of increased inflammation, and damage can occur.  Plaquenil is often supplemented by short courses of prednisone during flares, which addresses the inflammation and reduces damage to the joints.  Fatigue is a chronic factor in autoimmune disease, and it is also unpredictable.  Allowing for routine adequate rest is helpful both to fatigue and stress on muscles and joints.  If the flares increase in frequency, your wife's rheumatologist will likely consider immunosuppressant therapy, or a drug known as methotrexate.    If your wife would like to learn more about rheumatoid arthritis online, looking in Wickipedia is helpful, as it gives a good overview of conditions and often includes information about usual treatment, without the frightening pictures.  The Lupus Foundation has information about most autoimmune diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and can be accessed online, as can the American Rheumatological Association.  If you have any questions that you'd like me to help with, please don't hesitate to ask.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Connective Tissue Disorder with + ANA & SSA",
    "content": "Hello AngelShan02,  Unfortunately, there is no single test that can confirm a diagnosis of an autoimmune disorder.  The ones you have had (ANA, SSA) do indicate an autoimmune disorder.  Your ANA result was indeed high, and a speckled pattern occurs in more than 95% of persons with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  Tests for anti-double-stranded DNA or anti-Sm antibodies and anti-ribonucleoprotein are also definitive for SLE.  The diagnosis of an autoimmune disease is made after consideration of test results plus evaluation of the person's constellation of symptoms and physical examination.  There are many autoimmune conditions, and most include symptoms of fatigue and joint pain.  The Lupus Foundation has noted that the most common thing heard by persons with autoimmune disease is \"You don't look ill, so how can you feel so sick?\"  The Lupus Foundation recommends that a person suspecting autoimmune disease investigate their family history, since there can be a familial influence, and to track their own symptoms.  Keep a journal or record of symptoms and give details such as when the symptom happened, what you were doing at the time, what you were eating and drinking, what medications were taken, if any, and the duration of the symptom.  Note if you have any sleep disturbances, including frequent wakening.  Since Sjogren's Disease has been ruled out, the next step is to consider other autoimmune conditions; one of the diseases in the classification with Sjogren's Disease is SLE, so that might be the next thing considered by your physician.  Seeing a rheumatologist is recommended, and seeking second or even third opinions unfortunately is fairly common in determining an autoimmune diagnosis.  The important thing is for your rheumatologist to keep ruling out conditions until the most likely diagnosis can be made, and for you to have confidence in your physician.  Treatment can include anti-malarials, prednisone, and immunosuppressive medications.  Anti-malarials and prednisone are often the first options that are offered.  If anti-malarials are effective at lower dosages, they have fewer side effects than prednisone, particularly in women with a family history of osteoporosis.  Immunosuppressants and drugs such as methotrexate are used if the condition is not responsive to anti-malarials and/or prednisone, or if they are the most appropriate for the specific autoimmune conditon.  I hope this information is helpful to you.  I wish you the very best of luck.\n\n",

Initially it impacted his left hand as well but now not anymore and apparently the pain is just there. He has visited a few doctors and has had numerous answers on what to do. He has done rehab at a clinic specifically suggested for this with no luck. He has tried acupuncture with no luck. One doctor recommended surgery but said  since it is due to something  close to the spine and there is a chance that it it goes bad he might not be able to walk ( which sounded extreme but was his statement so my dad decided to rather live with it). Does anyone have suggestions as to what this is and  what can be done as I really want to help my dad ?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: episodes of acutly tender muscles",
    "content": "Hi, Unfortunately you have not mentioned one crucial information- the duration of your complaints.Also you have failed to mention which group of muscles are involved.  Assuming that it is chronic, and that many muscles are involved, one would like to exclude a couple of  possibilities to begin with. - polymyalgia rheumatica and  - fibromyalgia.  There can be many causes for pain in the muscles(myalgia). Some of which are, - Tension or stress, - trauma (sprains and strains), - Overuse of muscles, - Infectious myositis: HIV, other viruses, fungi, bacteria (including mycobacteria, staphylococcal pyomyositis),  - infestations of the muscle such as trichinosis or disseminated muscular cysticercosis, -  Autoimmune disorders such as polymyositis or dermatomyositis, - Fibromyalgia - Generalized infections such as Lyme myositis, influenza, malaria, Rocky Mountain spotted fever, polio, leptospirosis, rat bite fever, measles or rheumatic fever - Drugs including corticosteroids, chloroquine,  clofibrate, amphotericin B, carbinoxolone, or hydroxychloroquine.  polymyalgia rheumatica appears less likely as you are younger than 50 years, have no specific location for the pain(neck, shoulder girdle, hip or thighs), no definitive morning stiffness, and no elevation of ESR(frequently elevated).  Firomyalgia has a constellation of symptoms and your symptoms may somewhat fit that description.  Due to lack of sufficient details and lack of opportunity for a physical examination, in such cases, it may not be possible to offer a definitive diagnosis.  You should consult a rheumatologist and have your condition sorted out. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Evening!  The facts: I was referred to a rheumatologist early this year by my GP due to widespread joint pain that started with my knee eight years ago and spread to the rest of the joints in my body. My rheumatologist diagnosed me with bursitis in both of my hips, knees, elbows and shoulders in April 2010. After naproxen and oxaprozin didn't do the trick (naproxen made me nauseous; oxaprozin made my heart race and cut my period in half), I got cortisone injections in my left hip and right shoulder. The shots began to wear off after a couple of weeks and, while I do feel a little better, I've started a more natural and hopefully successful approach toward healing: mostly ice packs, rest, occasional ibuprofen and listening to my joints. The natural mindset was spurred on by the bill for the cortisone injections, I admit.  My rheumatologist's first instinct was RA and she ran a few more tests to add to the ones my GP already ran, but they all came back negative. She mentioned Fibromyalgia but hasn't pursued that vein (perhaps because none of the pressure points hurt besides the bursitis).  When I last saw her (the day I got the cortisone injections), I got the impression that we're playing the waiting game: waiting for more symptoms. I didn't have to schedule a follow-up for once but she did say to come back if things get worse.  I am very curious as to what could cause bursitis in so many joints... or if there is any more I can do for myself at home without taking prescriptions or getting more shots.\n\n",

I get sharp pain and tightness in the lower outside part under the knee (both legs) when I go to bed or at rest and feel the need to move around until i can get semi comfortable. Also I kick during sleep and toss and turn all night. Sometimes it is so bad I have to get up and walk around for 20 minutes so I can sleep. The pain is getting worse. I have been to a Rheumatologist and an Orthopedist and they could not find anything. I do not know what to do because I cannot sleep and when I do it is for 30 min increments. I do not know what to do anymore. The only thing that helps me sleep is if I take two Motrin and thats because it makes me so tired and even then it takes about 40 minutes to fall asleep and I am still exhausted the next morning.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: restless legs with knee pain",
    "content": "Hi Kelikei914, RLS is an unpleasant sensation in the lower limbs (and occasionally the upper limbs) that occurs at rest and is relieved by movement. It is described by affected persons in many ways such as, - \"creeping and crawling sensation\",  - \"pins and needles\",  - \"jittery feeling\" or,  - \"feeling fidgety\".   Your description of pain in the outer aspect of the leg below the knee has not been mentioned(to the best of my lnowledge) as a common symptom in RLS.   Drugs associated with RLS include: - Phenytoin - Nicotine - Paroxetine - Caffeine - Mianserin - Alcohol  Systemic disorders associated with RLS include:  - vascular disease including congestive cardiac failure - End-stage renal disease - neuropathies - diabetes - rheumatoid arthritis - spinal cord and cauda equina damage - radiculopathies  - thoracic spinal lesions - complete spinal cord injury - Parkinson's disease - Iron deficiency - Folate deficiency  Cryoglobulinaemic neuropathy manifesting with restless legs syndrome has been reported in middle aged women. In one study, psychological disorders had been diagnosed in 44% of the men and 46% of the women (cf. 10% and 23% of controls respectively).  Pain in the outer aspect of the leg below the knee is suggestive of a condition known as \"Peroneal muscle spasm\".This is known to occur commonly with 'Pes planus' or flat foot (especially spastic flat foot associated with bony deformities in the foot bones).You may need to be investigated for this possibility.

    "content": "Dear Kelikei914,  I can completely understand your frustration as RLS can be such a relentless pain.  It just about drove me nuts and then I had a thought, perhaps epiphany, depending on whether this works for you as it has worked wonders for me.    I have had multiple surgeries throughout the years and I remember them always putting surgical stockings on my legs (like tight hosiery) designed to keep the blood flowing through your legs while you're laid up recovering.  I remembered how good they felt when the nurse put them on me before surgery and all of a sudden and \"aha\" moment arrived.    I dug around the house, finally finding a pair.  I placed them on, climbed in to bed and lo and behold the discomfort was reduced from 100% to 15%.  I couldn't believe it.  It made me believe that perhaps RLS is simply a blood flow problem robbing the nerves of adequate blood.   Maybe it will work for you, or perhaps it was just a fix for me.  Give it a try and good luck!!!!  Sincerely,  Joel (SloppyFloppy)\n\n",

No doctors have been able to tell me anything, so if anyone has ANY information or wants to talk, please email me at hshaw709@yahoo.com   Thanks.\n\n",

I recognized that the pain start for example when I walk barefoot on a cold  ground. The pain is only on one body half like, on this body half everything hurts, leg, knee, arm, half nose, fingers, foot, neck, ear.   The hurting body half variates. Very very rarely the whole body hurts. If the pain starts at night I use paracetamol because its hard to sleep with one side hurting.  Some years ago I visited a doctor but he couldnt find anything, I can't remember the tests he did.\n\n",

I find my self making fists to stretch my hands.  Typing on the computer is sometimes painful. My pinky and ring fingers on both hands usually cause a dull achy pain that I try not to pay attention to.  I Have taken anti inflammatories, but I don't like to take a lot of meds.   The left thumb sometimes has a little swelling, but 95% of the time there is no swelling.   I take a lot of vitamins.  should I take a bioflex vitamin or joint vitamin too?  Are there any remedies I can do at home?  Should I ice them or heat them?  I do not have insurance.   I currently have cataracts and cannot fix them.  I just started onglyza a week ago and my sugar has dropped 100 points every day consistently.  Fasting is now 124-135.  I do not qualify for any medical aid.

    "content": "Hello, Chattagal,  Under usual circumstances, the progressive nature of your hand difficulties would likely fall into the category of arthritis.  However, to confirm that or to recommend the most appropriate treatment would require evaluation by your doctor.  Such a condition left untreated can result in deformity and limited use.  The vitamins you asked about are not generally effective treatment, although some doctors recommend them as an adjunct to their regular treatment.  If your doctor finds that your problem is arthritis, he or she will likely recommend heat rather than ice.  Some people find that leaving supper dishes until morning, so that they start their day with their hands in hot water, is beneficial.  Anti-inflammatories are often recommended.  I encourage you to return to your doctor, since your condition appears to be progressing.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

It has never gone around to the front and has never caused shortness of breath, racing heart or palpitations, and no angina or chest pains.  It happened once when I was driving and lasted, as in the nighttime episodes, for several minutes (approximately 5 minutes) and then goes away. This is very unnerving each time it happens.

A thorough history and physical f/b a CT scan would be my first step ...as well as cardiac workup (e.g. EKG or stress EKG or echocardiogram).

    "content": "Thank you very much for your quick reply! To give you more insight, one week ago I had an allergic reaction to MSG and ended up in the ER.  When I was giving my medical history to him, I told the ER doctor about the occasional back cramp that I described to you.  I have occasional heart palpitations that started about 10 years ago, and that was when I got diagnosed with MVP.  After giving all my medical history, the ER doctor ordered an EKG, X-rays and a blood workup that he said would determine if I was having, or had ever had, a heart attack.  He also ordered my cholesterol and hormones checked.  All of the tests came back in his exact word \"perfect\".  My total cholesterol was 162, (which was even lower than in August when it was at 173).  The good cholesterol is high, the bad is low and triglycerides are also on the low side.  My BP usually averages 108/64.  After the tests finally came back they sent me home.  Also, about 10 years ago I was in a car accident. After 6 months I had an MRI which showed degenerative changes at multiple levels (C3-C6) including multiple ruptured and bulging discs, foraminal narrowing and C6-5 spondylolis with degenerative disc disease.  Could this cramp possibly be related to the car accident problems?\n\n",

    "content": "Non fracture Injuries of the spine (especially whiplash injury) are notorious for lingering pain.  10 years would be a quite a stretch of time to say that the pain is a direct result of the MVA; however, if the ligaments or non contractile soft tissue of the spinal column were sprained during the accident, the back may be more prone to injury down the road.  The principle is similar to an ankle sprain - once the ligaments are overstretched/damaged the ankle is prone to another sprain.  This is why rehab is important.   I would consult an experienced orthopedic physical therapist.  Your family physician can write the order.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, and thanks for being there for us! A few mornings ago - 30 minutes or so after waking up - I had another cramping up of my back.  I was sitting at my computer (as I usually do most mornings) and my back muscles from midpoint up through my neck, and from side to side - including my jaw muscles - began to cramp up.  I thought it was because I may have been sitting wrong, so I got up, stretched, walked around, stretched more, walked around more, but with no improvement.  I finally went and lay down flat on my stomach.  After about 10 minutes the cramping finally subsided.  This time it was not the deep pain as I had described in my prior post from November, but seemed to \"lock\" my entire middle and upper back (muscle-wise), and actually felt like a very similar pain as with the deep interior pain described in my previous post.  I took my blood pressure and it was 119/82, with no shortness of breath, heart palpitations, no squeezing feelings or anything of that nature, just scarey! Don't know if this would be related, but after this episode, I started my period (for the second time within a month) with significant bleeding.  I would really appreciate any thoughts you may have as to what could be causing these strange back cramps every few months.  Thank you in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear rooter,  It sounds like Sciatica,  Sciatica occurs due to a nerve root (sciatic nerve) compression in the lower (lumbar) spine. The condition is due to a herniated disk in most of the cases in the low lumber spine.  This compression results in pain along distribution of the muscles innervated by that nerve, so the pain radiates from your lower back to the buttock down to the back of the legs.   This commonly happens in people who sit for prolonged periods. The pain can be in the form of  mild ache to a sharp, burning  pain, discomfort or electric shock. Prolonged walking may aggravate symptoms in some people.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases it is secondary to spinal or bone problems.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy.  Non surgical treatment includes also, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, Stretching, non-steroidal Anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities. The pain usually improves faster than the numbness and the weakness if present.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had ankylosing spondylitis for many many years and I had been on many different types of medicines including Vioxx, Bastra, Mobics, Celebrex, Vicodin, Enbrel and Remicade. Couple of those are actually been taken off the market because of the danger of causing heart attack. I use to take one of those above medicine alone with Vicodin just in case I have more pain than I can bear. The most recent medicine I am on is Remicade and been on it for a couple of years now. it is the best medicine ever. Over time times, I even drop vicodin and was no longer needed while I was on Remicade. Remicade was administer every 6 weeks for me. That works great up until recently, I have change my insurance and it took me 5 months to get the insurance working. At this poing, the remicade in my body had been worn out and I was in extreme pain. the first time I got back on Remicade, It lasted for only 3 weeks, than all my pains came back. I was taken some Mobic and even some vicodin in addition to the Remicade. I felt a little weird, my stomach has completely ack up, because I also had GERD and Ulcer, Mobic just made the damage worst. also, I been having sudden dizziness, headaches and ringing in my ear at all times. Also I felt very tire and week at all time. I was not sure it was caused by the addition medicine I was taken. Just recently I had taken my second Remicade. I thought I would have more luck with the first injection, but not really, the second injection lasted for a little over 2 weeks, even shorter than the first injection. I spoke to my doctor about my issue. He had mention the dizziness, headache and ringing in the head could be causes by my ankylosing spondylitis, Gave me some muscle relaxant medicine for the dizziness and headache. I been on it for a few days, but didn't feel the different. Also, my doctor had also mention about taken some Celebrex if I needed rather than the Mobics.  Sorry for the long history, my main question is to see if someone can give me some suggestions with being on Remicade and Celebrex at the same time? I always worry about taken too much medicine, it can really screw me up, and I really worry about medicine interaction. can someone give me some suggestions please? thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, swon888,  Thank you for the history that you have given; it's very helpful in seeing your overall condition and concerns.  First, there is no reason that Remicade and Celebrex shouldn't be taken at the same time if taken as prescribed, and monitored by your physician at regular intervals, as with any medication.  It's often the case that when a medication is reduced or discontinued for a time, when you go back on it, it's not as immediately effective as when your blood level was being maintained.  Discuss with your physician the idea of needing to start over, that is, to again take the initial dose of Remicade, again in 2 weeks, then 4 weeks, and then every 4 to 6 weeks, or whatever your doctor recommends.  That will help re-establish the effective blood levels that you achieved stability with before having to discontinue the medication.  Whenever you have concerns about combining medications or how to take them, always discuss it with your doctor.  That is part of his or her expertise, and your doctor knows you best since you've been receiving treatment for a long time.  Finally, if you need a medication that your doctor has prescribed, it's best to take it.  I can appreciate that you want to take no more than necessary, but with your diagnosis, increasing dosages may be necessary to manage your symptoms.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "severe pain Ankylosing Spondylitis?",
    "content": "Hello. I apologize if this is a little long. I have minimal disk desiccation  in my T11-L1 and L5-S1 areas. I also have Schmorl's nodes in T12-L3. None of this screams any sort of pain though. Yet I have gone from very active to all but completely bedridden overnight. I had a few back spasms when I was younger (age 10, 11, 12) but we blamed it on growth pains even when they were extreme. I was never in any sort of accident.  The reason I have been thinking of Ankylosing Spondylitis is because I met a woman recently who has been diagnosed with AS and she suggested I look into it. When she began to tell me about it, it fit so much into what I've been going through; the sudden onset after a normal, active lifestyle, swollen ankles, constant loss of eyesight, etc. About a year ago I had my appendix removed in an emergency surgery. I was told it was acute appendicitis but my blood work came back completely negative of any infection.  AS is an autoimmune disease and I was told that I would have a great immune system that attacked my spine but redirected when I get sick. Which also came up when my whole household got diagnosed with Swine flu and I had the mildest case. I also feel better when I get sick (pain-wise).  The pain is chronic and severe yet my scans show nothing serious (I've been scanned from my Cervix to my S1). That and I'm HLA-B27 negative.   I've made an appointment with a rheumatologist but I'm wondering if I'm just setting myself up for failure to find anything again.  Could it be AS?  What else could I look into? I feel like I've been tested everywhere and though I'm swimming/biking regularly I'm only getting weaker. Thank you so much for anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello elledani77,  You've certainly had to cope with a lot.  At the very basic level, pain is an indication of something wrong somewhere.  You've had evaluations that have not disclosed a specific reason, so you're absolutely correct in pursuing further medical evaluation.  Your point about AS is actually a good one; your symptoms are consistent with those of AS, although there are other diagnoses that are also possible.  Seeing a rheumatologist is the best next step.  I always recommend that a person maintain a daily record of their symptoms and related issues, such as feeling less pain while ill.  Record the symptom, when it occurs, how long it lasts, what you were doing when it started, what helped alleviate it, if anything, and any other data that seems significant to you.  Take your record with you when you see your physician(s), as it can be invaluable to them in evaluating a diagnostic pattern and when any medications might be most effectively given.  It will also track any improvement or deterioration.  I hope this is helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck in finding out the basis of your health problem.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 37 year old female who recently in April 2010 began experiencing chronic joint pain. I have a postive CCP Positive HLA-B27. My ESR and C reactive and RF are normal.   Due to my insurance I am having a hard time with the doctors. My primary says its RA my Rheum  says its likely AS w/ peripheral arthritis although he did no tests to confirm. I have not had an MRI of the spine because primary doesnt think neccesary and needs to authorize because rheum wont have his staff spend time calling for authorization.  I just want to know what is wrong.. Is it possible to have both rheumatoid arthritis and ankylosis spondylitis. My father has severe AS. My mother had RA. The rheumatologist noted tenderness and inflammation of the sacroilliac joint but also at the finger joints, toe joints. I have a synovial cyst on my wrist and carpal tunnel which gets worse with the inflammation. The carpal is diagnosed with nerve conduction test. So could it be both? I NEED A DIAGNOSIS the waiting for answers is causing me so much grief.  Are there any case studies of someone having both?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can you have both AS and RA",
    "content": "Hello, jmssk323,  Your situation is complex, and I'm sorry you are having such difficulty communicating with your doctors.  It is possible to have both RA and AS; your laboratory findings tend toward AS, and the signs in your peripheral joints tend more toward RA.   In the early stages of AS, radiographic changes in the sacroiliac joints may not be discernable by regular X-ray, but would need a CT scan or MRI.  Since you've been dealing with this since April, it's still fairly early and the CT scan or MRI is warranted.  If your physicians are not responsive to your concerns, please discuss it with them very clearly.  Perhaps they would prefer that you change to alternate physicians, which should be possible regardless of the type of insurance that you have.  The reluctance to help you obtain a necessary diagnostic procedure is puzzling; please ask them why this is an issue.  You are entitled to appropriate medical care, as I'm sure your physicians would agree, and any office staff should be very willing to obtain the authorization required if the physician requests them to do so.  That is totally within the context of such employment parameters.  Early, appropriate treatment is essential to the best outcome and management of either of the conditions that you may have.   Please advocate for yourself clearly and emphatically.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I have lived with myy face swelling up on both sides for 3 years.  I have been to many ENT specialists and none can say what is causing it.  I noticed coffee is a big problem for me, but other things I eat cause them to swell.  When I push on the area and hard to, the puss or crystalized saliva comes though my cheek and into my mouth.  My face will still continue to swell until I push all of the strands through.  I have such severe pain that I dreed waking up in  the morning.  The doctors would like to do surgery on both sides of my face but the results are unknown.  I cannot figure out why this happens and what has caused it.  I used to live off of coffee and did not drink much fluids but, not it seems like it will never let me live my life.  I am 25 and have missed 2 years of going out and enjoying myself.  I no longer drink starbucks because it scares me to death.  I need a doctor who will try to save my face.  Every doctor I see has made me feel like I have no hope besides surgery.  No stones were detected and cancer was not something either.  I am so confused because I would rather have a diagnosis then to wonder or to do surgery on a what if.  PLease help me someone find a reason or a cure to help this pain.  Everyday I wake up and say I hate my cheeks.  I want to wake up and do my day the way I used to.  I would appreciate any imput cause thats all I have left.  Thank you so much for your time- Ashley\n\n",

    "content": "Dear medgrl7,  It would be useful if you can inform us about all the investigations that have been done and their results. Your past history and past diagnoses of any systemic or local diseases are also important.  Causes of parotid enlargement involve a wide range of local and systemic diseases and disorders including:  Chronic Sialadenitis  \u2013 This is usually due to the presence of calculi or stenosis of the ducts secondary to permanent damage after an attack of acute infection.  Manifestations include recurrent attacks of mild pain, with recurrent parotid enlargement that worsens with eating .  Investigations include: CBC may show changes suggestive of infection or inflammation during the attack. ESR and CRP to exclude inflammatory syndromes. CXR to exclude other LN enlargement. Plain x-ray may show a radio-opaque stone in a salivary duct.  Treatment include: 1) treatment of the underlying causes    2) Sialogogues, massage, heat,  and hydration 3) Periodic duct dilatation 4) Excision   - Some tumours like MALT lymphoma affects the parotid gland and CT scan is of choice in the diagnosis in addition to the previous investigations.  FNA, Open Biopsy and surgical removal are often avoided.\n\n",

My nail is fine as that my hand was palm down. It has been over 5 hours since this happened and my finger is very tender, and is now taped together with my ring finger so that I cannot use it. I do not want to waste any emergency rooms time if this could be nothing, it just hurts very bad, and for me I have a very high tolerance for pain and this is killing me. Tylenol and Aleve have done nothing for the pain. Please advise\n\n",

It was almost like my leg had fallen asleep but it was not really tingling and I had a dull ache in the middle of the back of my thigh. I did do quite a bit of yard work this weekend, mowing, planting shrubs, weeding flower beds etc..  Could that  have anything to do with this? It seems to bother me more when I am sitting down though I still notice it when standing and walking. I don't have any bruising or pain when I push in one certain spot. Is this something I should be concerned about?\n\n",

I do not have diabetes or hypertension and as far as I know there is not any family history of  blood clots.

It causes swelling of the muscle compared to the other leg ,tenderness,redness. but that is not the case for you as was confirmed by your doctor,Thank God.  It might be a strained muscle as he said...it'll take time to go away...from 1-3 weeks even... according to how much you rest it. It's very bothering i know... how about that tingling sensation in your back of your right thigh, I think it's referred because your leg hurts so you use muscles you don't normally use to compensate for your other injured area.   so , i don't think you should be concerned about it. you can use an anti inflammatory cream/gel/ or even tabletsl ....it'll ease the pain and at the same time will relieve any accompanied inflammation, ok?

    "content": "Hello,  I am not sure if this question belongs under joint pain or allergy. I have not been able to find information anywhere so far that matches with my recent problem. I appreciate any suggestions you have.   I am a 30 year old woman and a few months ago I started experiencing terrible aches in my right collar bone area. At first I passed it off as stress but eventually I made the connection to alcohol and now I am certain that this is the trigger but I don't know why or what it means.   The pain always originates in the right collar bone area though the severity can range from vague ache to preoccupying pain. If it's a bad case, the pain will often run down my arm and into my fingertips. Eventually, it will end up in the left collar area as well. The pain does not FEEL as if it's muscle but more like the bones themselves hurt.   The pain begins normally just a few minutes after I start drinking (maybe 1/4 glass of wine for example). I've experimented a little and seem to see that red wine is consistently bad but all alcohols cause some degree of reaction. I haven't been able to find a pattern between mild and severe reactions.   I'm not a big drinker but wine research, tasting, etc is kind of a hobby. If I have to cut it out of my life, I will, but it would be great to find another option.   Could I have developed an allergy here? Or is it possible that the alcohol is aggravating a symptom of something else?  Thanks in advance for any advice!  J.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there. Thanks for your reply.   Well since I posted this, I have seen an orthopedic specialist who believes that I have some sort of compressed nerve in the neck. Indeed when I read about the symptoms for a slipped/herniated spinal disk, they sound exactly like what I've been experiencing. Since February the pain worsened so that it was present all the time, and not only when I drank any alcohol. At present, I am taking ibuprofen to keep the pain down. If and when I have any alcohol, the pain worsens.   In a few weeks I'll be having and MRI and Xrays to be able to get a better handle on the problem. Meanwhile, the doctor could think of no explanation for the alcohol connection. He also said that 30 was extraordinarily young to have a herniated disk.   My latest thought, is whether or not it is possible that there is a connection to the birth control I was taking, Depo Provera, which is now known to cause bone density loss. As soon I learned this a few weeks ago, I changed birth control methods. I have not yet mentioned this to my doctor but will do so at our next appointment next month.   Any other thoughts?   Thanks again!  Jessica\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jess_march, Calcium supplements are typically recommended, not only regarding the use of Depo-Provera, but other birth control medications as well. Be sure to discuss this with your physician when you go for your follow up evaluation. Nerve compression depending on the location may cause symptoms of shoulder/arm pain and numbness in which if this is the causative factor for your symptoms the MRI will be able to determine. Alcohol induced pain is a rather unusual symptom. If you are not experiencing any of the constitutional symptoms that I mentioned previously, fever, unintentional weight loss, etc. then I would not relate it to a particular condition I had considered. Alcohol use may disrupt calcium balance having a negative impact on bone health but is usually seen in \"chronic\" alcohol users rather than in \"occasional\" users. I hope that when your time permits, you will post an update. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

As it turned out, I did in fact have Lymphoma. After several more doctors and an MRI in 2006, no one could explain the problem. When I re-read your reply today, I can see that you suspected Lymphoma too! I wasn't having any other symptoms initially as it turns out that alcohol pain tends to be one of the first symptoms experienced in Lymphoma. Eventually by August 2006, I came upon a large hard lump sticking out of my collarbone. And from there a series of new tests, chest x-ray, biopsy, PET scan, etc. all of which confirmed a diagnosis of Hodgkin's Lymphoma. I was a Stage II with bulky disease present in the chest cavity.   I proceeded with chemotherapy and radiation therapy through 2007 and am happy to say I have been in remission since then. It was a long hard road and a life experience that has truly shaped who I am today. But I feel lucky to have survived it.  Thanks for your help at that early stage Theresa. I hope someone else may read this and get the help they need as soon as they can.  Very best.  Jessica\n\n",

    "title": "Are enlarged lymph nodes a symptom of Fibromyalgia?",
    "content": "Hi  I have been diagnosed with FM for around one year now and have been far from satisfied with the information given by my own doctor.  I have a few symptoms that I'm not sure are FM related but ever since the diagnosis any health complaint I have has been put down to me having FM.  I have extremely enlarged (approx 1 inch) lymph nodes recurring mainly around my underarm or groin.  This has been ongoing for several months now.  I also have almost daily migraines and severe sensitivity to flashing or very bright lights which manifests itself into nausea and often vomiting.    I'm not sure if I'm being overly critical or paranoid but I am finding my quality of life almost unbearable at the moment and the attitude of my doctor quite dismissive.  I have been refused additional pain medication as the doctor thinks I ought to manage with what I have at the moment but I am often in tears from the pain when just moving from a chair or my bed to the bathroom with my legs having what feels like a searing burning pain going through them which lasts for hours sometimes.  I have also been refused medication to aid my sleep and, while I'm aware that such drugs can be habit-forming and doctors aren't very happy to prescribe these, I am just getting desperate now for a decent night's sleep.  I lie in bed after doing all the things I am told to - milky drink, quiet atmosphere, warm bath etc. etc. until 5am most nights and I end up just trying to get 'power naps' during the day when I can.  I don't feel like I am being taken seriously.  I have had ANA test done some time ago as my Mum thinks I show all the symptoms of SLE (which she has) which came back negative and I had my thyroid checked last summer and this was fine also.    I would be ever so grateful if you could have a look over this and give me your professional opinion.  I have seen a few different doctors but as I have mentioned before the FM seems like a 'catch-all' diagnosis and I am just told to go home and try additional vitamins and supplements and the like.  I feel like I wasting people's time. Please accept my apology for writing so much but I want you to have as much information as possible.  I do suffer quite badly with anxiety and stress which is managed by the anti-depressant Escitalopram but I am a reasonably intelligent person and know I'm not a hypochondriac but I do worry this is how my doctors see me.

    "content": "My child is an eight year old male.  14 weeks ago he presented with severe hives all over his body accompanied a week later with migrating joint swelling.  This continued for several weeks.  The hives were controlled fairly well with Atirax and the swelling stopped.  However, in its place was left migrating joint pain that may be in the joints in his arms one day, and in his leg joints the next.  Wherever the pain is he will not use that limb.  He will hold his arms against him as if in a sling.  If he falls he will not even attempt to catch himself.  He has to lean over to reach the fork to eat.  It is really scary and sad for me to watch.   He has had numerous, numerous test.  They have done MRI's, a bone scan, an EMG, and many other blood test.  He has been tested for Lyme, arthritis, Churg Strauss, Polymiositis, and on and on.  Nothing is showing up.  He continues to go about life the best he can, but is becoming frustrated and more impatient as time goes on.  I keep getting the \"Let's wait and see\" line from his neurologist and rhumatologist we are seeing.  However, I look at it this way, he's an active 8 yr old little boy who has been given no pain relief and no answers.  They have him on Trileptal and Choline, Magnesium, Trisalicylate which are not giving him any relief.  I know there has got to be an answer.  I need help.\n\n",

A few weeks ago, I broke out with hives - all of a sudden. I have never had hives EVER before.  They continue, but as not as worse as they were, but still quite frustrating. I don't know what's causing them. About a week after the hives began, the migrating joint pain hit me hard. It felt as if my right shoulder was broken and I was having some tingling pain in my left wrist and fingers. Then when the pain started to leave my right shoulder it completely jumped to my left shoulder. So now the pain is just rotating around my body. It was severly in my hands a few days ago. It can be debilatating at times. I have had most of the same tests done ( alot of bloodwork) that all comes up negative. No lupus, no arthritis, etc. So the doctors don't know what's wrong with me. They are giving me pain killers which don't seem to be working. PLEASE if anyone knows of a painkiller that actually works on our type of symptoms. DO TELL. And if anyone knows what this is, Please Do TELL so I can advise my Doctor.... Sound wierd, right? :?\n\n",

I have been using a neuro-mechanical acupunture device to administer electrical pulses to the acupunture nodes and to \"trigger\" points in the affected areas as well as to the area which I think is the source of the problem in my case--namely to acupuncturet points at the base of the skull to either side of the upper vertebrae--these points affect the nerves of the upper limbs. Corresponding points at the base of the spine affect the lower limbs.  I have also had deep massage at these points.So far this approach has given temporary relief and I hope that further work in this vein will alleviate the problem.. Oscie\n\n",

A few weeks ago, I broke out in hives for no apparent reason.  My skin was itchy and irritated.  I had to take a steriod drug to get my skin back to normal, although it's not quite normal.  I am now having my joint pain flare up, especially my shoulders, and my hands have been tingling/numb (although I can use them just fine).  I went to my doctor, who assured me all my tests are normal, and I think she thinks I'm nuts.  My allergiest informed me that autoimmune diseases can take years to diagnose, and that it might take a long time for the antibodies or whatever to show up in blood tests.  Anyway, I feel for all of you who are as frustrated and frightened as I may be because not knowing what is causing this is upsetting.  I am going to try to meditate and imagine my immune system being \"happy\" and healthy.  I will let you know how I do with that.

    "content": "Hello, Hives are the result of an allergy to a substance in or on the body.  Poison ivy for example causes hives.  An allergic reaction to a medicine may cause hives.  Some healthcare products (soaps,shampoos, toothpaste) contains ingredients which may cause hives (e.g. certain fragrances or dyes or chemicals).   So the questions become, if hives preceeds the arthritis - why is there arthritis and will it get better and what do we do about it? We can say that something on or in the body which caused the hives now is causing the immune system to act or overreact specifically in the joints.  Identifying the certain suspected substance may be difficult.   I would treat this arthritis like a reactive arthritis.  In this case, we may add to our suspects a microorganism.  So, in treatment, I would combine a course of oral steroids (2-3 weeks) with a course of antibiotics (e.g.doxycycline 100mg bid for up to 3 months).  It may also be helpful to analyze the synovial fluid from a large affected joint (shoulder or knee).  Your rheumatogist can guide you through the specific treatment plan.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son just turned 2 years old and has the EXACT same thing happening to him as the lady who made the initial post about her 8 y/o child.  My son woke up with some randomly placed hives a few days ago.  The hives seem to come and go and appear in different areas.  He still has them popping up in different spots, particularly in his armpit area, back of neck, legs, and wrists.  It is not eczematous, though.  He never really seemed bothered by the hives, but we gave him some Benadryl in case he was itchy and to try and get rid of the hives.    Then a day or two after the hives, he would limp when walking around.  We noticed he was favoring his right leg, so we inspected and saw that he had swelling, redness, and some warmth of his right ankle.  He didn't like us touching it either as it was apparently painful.  Then later that evening he seemed to have gotten somewhat better and was walking around, but the ankle was still swollen.  Next day, he had the same issue.  Didn't want to walk on the ankle.  But then we noticed he wasn't moving his right arm and would refuse to pick up anything with his right hand.  We noticed his right wrist and dorsum of his hand was swollen, red, and slightly warm as well.  The ankle seemed to be getting better, but now he seemed to have migrating arthralgias.  We looked at all his joints and noticed both his knees also appeared swollen and warm (but not erythematous like his wrist and ankle).    It is extremely difficult to see him like this.  We are thinking it's probably a viral-induced reaction, but we got blood work for Lyme in case.  That is pending.  His WBC was normal.  His CRP was slightly elevated, but that's non-specific and should be expected with his inflammation in the joints.  We are awaiting the sed rate, which like the CRP, will be non-specific.  At least the WBC count is normal and makes us not think it's leukemia or juvenile rheumatoid arthritis.  We were told it's probably not rheumatic fever either.    Did anybody above get any answers as to what their children had when they got these symptoms (particularly that person made this original post back in 2005)??  We want to know what it is and if it's going to last or cause any future complications.  Please let me know.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear dbacs  Medrol belongs to group of medicines known as Glucocorticoids , which are are naturally occurring hormones that prevent or suppress inflammation and immune responses when administered at pharmacological doses  The severity of the adverse effects associated with prolonged administration of pharmacological dosages of corticosteroids increases with duration and frequency of therapy. Short-term administration of large doses typically does not cause adverse effects, but long-term administration can lead to adrenocortical atrophy and generalized protein depletion.  In your case, the dose you are taking is considered low. high doses per see are when we talk about dosing of i mg/kg, which is not the case in yours.  However, i may stress on the importance of patient education regarding possible symptoms which have been associated with chronic use and usually with high doses:   Glucocorticoids are responsible for protein metabolism, and prolonged therapy can result in various musculoskeletal manifestations, including: myopathy (myalgia, muscle wasting, muscle weakness), impaired wound healing, bone matrix atrophy (osteoporosis), and bone fractures. These effects are more likely to occur in older or debilitated patients.   Glucocorticoids interact with calcium metabolism at many sites, including: decreasing the synthesis by osteoblasts of the principle proteins of bone matrix, malabsorption of calcium in both the nephron and the gut, and reduction of sex hormone concentrations. Although all of these actions probably contribute to glucocorticoid-induced osteoporosis, the actions on osteoblasts is most important. Glucocorticoids do not modify vitamin D metabolism. Postmenopausal women, in particular, should be monitored for signs of osteoporosis during corticosteroid therapy.   Again , these symptoms occur mainly in elderly, not in young patients.  In addition, Corticosteroid therapy can mask the symptoms of infection and should be avoided during an acute viral or bacterial infection. Immunosuppression is most likely to occur in patients receiving high-dose (e.g., equivalent to 1 mg/kg or more of prednisone daily).  Also, various adverse dermatologic effects reported during corticosteroid therapy include skin atrophy, acne vulgaris, diaphoresis, impaired wound healing, facial erythema, striae, petechiae, hirsutism, ecchymosis, and easy bruising. Hypersensitivity reactions may manifest as allergic dermatitis, urticaria, and/or angioedema.   And very importantly, pharmacologic doses of corticosteroids administered for prolonged periods can result in physiological dependence due to hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) suppression. This inhibition decreases ACTH-mediated synthesis of endogenous corticosteroids and androgens by the adrenal cortex. The severity of glucocorticoid-induced secondary adrenocortical insufficiency varies among individuals and is dependent on the dose, frequency, time of administration, and duration of therapy. Administering the drug on alternate days may help to alleviate this adverse effect. Patients with HPA suppression will require increased doses of corticosteroids during periods of physiologic stress.   I am mentioning this to you, in case you decide to quit it one day, make sure to do it gradual, this is because  HPA suppression can last for up to 12 months following cessation of therapy.    Other possible side effects can include hypercholesterolemia, atherosclerosis, fat embolism, hyperglycemia, increase in blood pressure due to fluid retention. Corticosteroids may also decrease serum concentrations of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) and vitamin A which may rarely produce symptoms of vitamin A deficiency or vitamin C deficiency  While on long term use of medrol, you should monitor the followings,  blood glucose,  PFTs, and  serum potassium  Now to move to the next drug, which is Methotrexate , this drug also has immunosuppressive properties and can thus, exhibit anti-inflammatory activity, like medrol. together they can produce an additive effect. and the combination seems beneficial.  The most frequently reported acute adverse reactions associated with methotrexate include stomatitis, esophagitis, oral ulceration, nausea/vomiting, and abdominal distress. hepatotoxicity has been documented ,but in very high doses.  As for methotrexate , important monitoring parameters include CBC with differential,  LFTs: in patients receiving prolonged oral therapy,  serum creatinine/BUN and serum uric acid  I should mention to you, that if you are using methotrexate for anti-inflammatory purpose, the dose is usually 20 mg/day. not 10 mg daily.  Finally, as for any possible interaction between the two drugs, there has been no documented interaction between the two drugs, however, since i said before, that both drugs cause immunosuppression, be careful, that these drugs can mask the symptoms of infection, and remember to monitor for any possibilities of drug-induced side effects.  Thank you very much, and i hope you always feel great\n\n",

    "content": "Wow thank you that was a huge amount of information.    Ok well i actually got a lot of positive things in that info, even though there are a lot of bad side effects that you listed.  For instance the low dose i am receiving seems positive because even though i am at 4-8mg some days i can go without taking it, but usually not for more than two days.  Also i didn't know that Methotrexate can be taken up to 20 mg.  This seems like it means that i can increase my methotrexate dosage and decrease my medrol dosage.  I have taken some steps to ensure some protection while on these meds.  I have been consuming a protein shake 2-3 times a day.  The protein shake has a good profile of amino acids and a high dose of protein.  This seems like it will prevent protein wasting and muscle catabolism.  In fact i think because i'm on the medrol my protein shake gets metabolised better than when i'm not on medrol.  I have also read that L-Glutamine is beneficial to those taking Methotrexate.  Do you have any info on this topic?  I have found information regarding this on Medline.  L-Glutamine is in my protein shake.  Lastly i am thinking about adding Milk Thistle and Sam-E to my supplement regimen to offset any harmful side effects to my liver.  I have also quite drinking alcohol, for 3 years now.  Do you have any info on Milk Thistle and Sam-E in regards to liver protection?  Thanks again for all you help.  Very much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dbacs  L-glutamine is a protein amino acid found in proteins of all life forms. It is classified as a semi-essential or conditionally essential amino acid. This means that under normal circumstances the body can synthesize sufficient L-glutamine to meet physiological demands. However, there are conditions where the body cannot do so.   Recently, L-glutamine has come to be regarded as one of the most important of the amino acids when the body is subjected to such metabolic stress situations as trauma (including surgical trauma), cancer, sepsis and burns. Under such conditions, L-glutamine becomes an essential amino acid, and it is therefore very important to ensure adequate intakes of the amino acid in order to meet the increased physiological demands created by these situations.  And when it comes to taking this protein while on methotrexate, there is one report that methotrexate may decrease the possible effectiveness of supplemental L-glutamine for chemotherapy-induced mucositis. In another report, nine patients with breast cancer were reported to have decreased symptoms of methotrexate-related toxicity when given supplemental L-glutamine at a dose of 0.5 gram/kilogram/day.  Doses of L-glutamine up to 21 grams daily appear to be well tolerated. Reported adverse reactions are mainly gastrointestinal and not common. They include constipation and bloating. There is one older report of two hypomanic patients whose manic symptoms were exacerbated following the use of 2 to 4 grams daily of L-glutamine. The symptoms resolved when the L-glutamine was stopped. These patients were not rechallenged, nor are there any other reports of this nature.  I have attached below a couple of references regarding this topic , in case you are interested.   Wilmore DW, Schloerb PR, Ziegler TR. Glutamine in the support of patients following bone marrow transplantation. Curr Opin Clin Nutr Metab Care. 1999;2:323-327.  Huang EY, Leung SW, Wang CJ, et al. Oral glutamine to alleviate radiation-induced oral mucositis: a pilot randomized trial. Int J Rad Oncol Biol Phys. 2000;46:535-539.  Now to address the issue of using  milk thistle and the other herb you have mentioned, milk thistle is known \" to be the liver herb\".... it has the following advantages:  \u2022 Protects the liver from damage due to alcohol and chemicals \u2022 Assists regeneration of liver tissue \u2022 Detoxifies the blood \u2022 Useful in the treatment of cirrhosis, hepatitis and fatty liver  Milk Thistle yields three main active compounds known collectively as Silymarin, which work in a number of ways to restore liver health. Firstly, Silymarin inhibits the factors responsible for causing liver damage. As well, it increases the liver's content of a substance called glutathione which is responsible for detoxifying many chemicals, drugs and hormones. Silymarin also stimulates the growth of new liver cells so that damaged areas of the liver may be regenerated  It is essential that the Milk Thistle extract you choose is standardised to provide a minimum amount of Silymarin in each dose. Without this you have no way of knowing how much of the herb's active constituents are present in the supplement.   Milk thistle is widely available, at health food stores, and even some drug stores and grocery stores. The standardized extract that has been widely tested and has also been approved in Germany for liver disease and functional liver impairment contains 70 to 80 percent silymarin. Dosage recommendations are usually on each bottle, and should be discussed with an individuals medical practioner, but a general guide offered by some for an adult humans use is 420 mg. of silymarin taken in 3 divided doses daily. If there is no liver damage, and you simply want to protect your liver from damage, it is often recommended that an adult human use around 280 mg. of silymarin daily.  Thank you very much, and my best wishes to you...\n\n",

The combination of medrol and MTX is the standard  therapy in the whole world. Even 4mg medrol are beneficial, because some publications have seen some protective effects by the small dosage for the boneersosions, but also some have not seen this effect. Anyway, if your body tells you that below 4mg medrol is impossible there are two possiblities: Stay with 4mg or increase MTX up to 0,3mg per kg body wight a week (we are using a maximum of 25mg pwer week in europe). But, I tell my patients that 4mg merdol is absolutely perfect if disease activity is absent, therefore I would not increase MTX.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  This is very ironic but i was searching the net about methotrexate and protein matabolism and found one of my old topics.  I was searching this because lately i've been losing weight or muscle, and have had \"fibromyalgia-like\" symptoms (according to my doc).  This past week i've tried eating more and adding dhea plus weight lifting and it seems to be helping somewhat.  I've tried all these things before but seperately with no success.  Can anyone tell me if methotrexate, dhea and xolair is safe?  I'm taking 7.5mg methotrexate, 2 shots of xolair once a month, and 50mg dhea in the morning and afternoon.  I really feel much better with this \"coctail\" but i want to still add more muscle/weight.    I'm 5'2\", 130lbs, and having 2000-3000 calories daily, with about 60 grams of protein.  I want to double this by adding a shake but don't know if i should.  To update, since its been 4 years since i last posted, i lost my hearing in both ears (autoimmune).  Got a cochlear implant in left ear which restored 80% hearing.  Got left knee replacement and have controlled my hives pretty well.  Since starting to weight lift and adding dhea hives have been gone, i have more energy and no \"fibro-like\" symptoms.  I want to keep doing what i'm doing, is it safe?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Last night I was sitting in a chair and for some reason felt my elbow. It felt as if it were bruised. About 2 minutes later it swelled to the size of a baseball. I went to the ER and the Dr there said it was bursitis. Today when I got up the swelling was down somewhat but the elbow is purple with a bruised area about 3 inches around the elbow with a section of darker purple to the left and another section of purple going about a third of the way down my arm. I didn't injure this elbow to my knowledge or over use it as it is my left elbow and I am right handed. My entire arm is numb and it is somewhat painful. Maybe a 3 on a scale of 1-10. I really don't think it is bursitis but don't have a clue as to what can be causing this. Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Clasmom,  A bruised part of the body, is usually caused by trauma to that part and more often than not, actually, people do not remember hurting themselves.  However, this can also be caused by bleeding into the joint space caused by bursitis if the inflammation was severe enough. Also, if you are taking a daily aspirin, sometimes this can happen if you have a severe inflammation also in the joint.  The numbness could be because the nerves going to the forearm pass around the elbow at varying distances and they will be irritated by the inflammation and/or the blood.  Please, be advised to see your doctor after this er visit.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I fell to the ground grazing my knees and elbows, but i got strong pain in right elbow, as this took most of the fall. I came home, took some ibuprofen, and used ice. I had swelling come up on the elbow, and pain. I couldnt straighten or bend my arm fully.   This morning I woke up still with slight pain, but not as much as yesterday. I can bend and straighten a bit further than yesterday but still have pain. Also the swelling has gone down. I was wondering should i keep using the ice and taking the ibuprofen as gradually pain decreases and my elbow movement increases?  thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Questions about tendinitis (correlation to RA/SLE)",
    "content": "I do have a rheumatologist, and have received my diagnosis accordingly, however I'm not entirely comfortable with my diagnosis, the treatments and the explanations.  I've been suffering from severe pain in my hands and wrists (mainly fingers/wrists, and yes, both) for about 2 months now. This is not uncommon for me, but the pain has just more than doubled which is why it began to seem significant. Over the past week, it became so severe that I've been needing to take a lot more vicodin than usual. I went in to see my rheumatologist yesterday, and she informed me that she believes I have tendinitis and has recommended hand therapy.  She neglected to tell me what I can do in the interim, though I asked at least 3 times, and by the end of the appointment was so hopeful about the hand therapy I completely forgot about the fact that I'd have to suffer until at least that appointment.  I also asked her why I developed tendinitis, as crippled as my hands are, I hardly put them through any sort of strenuous activities, so it just didn't add up. She just said it was \"...over a long period of time...\" , the ellipses (...) being bits of her sentence I couldn't make out. I did a little googling (which I know doctors hate when we patients do this, but I don't sit here believing everything, I just try to stay as informed as I can be without bothering my doctors too much), and found that injections of corticosteroids can be very helpful. I wonder why she didn't suggest this, especially since prednisone (oral) has always been a good friend of mine during really bad lupus flares.   I really do not want to take vicodin. I have suffered from severe nausea (literally 24/7) for almost 3 years now, no definitive diagnosis (I do not suffer from indigestion, zero heartburn), oh and of course vomiting associated with the nausea. I'm down to vomiting about 3 times a week now, occasionally it's a couple times during the day, and I've tried not taking medication to see if it helped, I altered my diet tremendously--I'm a vegetarian, do not eat fried foods, no soda, juice, coffee, alcohol and am lactose intolerant so of course no dairy. I even try starving myself, but it seems that makes the nausea worse. Because of this, you can see why I do not want to be on vicodin, especially at such a heavy dose (besides the other health factors, while I do care for my liver, as a human being we tend to care more about what's happening right now, than what will happen in the future).   So, finally, I guess my questions are, a) what caused my tendinitis? I am positive it is not from over-use, b) why wouldn't my doctor recommend steroids? (I called her office this morning and left a message for a call back in regards to this) especially knowing how much vicodin and zofran I'm having to take, c) given my history, and this post, does it seem like I have received the right diagnosis? I understand that you can't argue much with blood work, but something just doesn't seem right. I do not want to live a crippled life. I want to get out there and get back to my old lifestyle, I want to have a family someday (hopefully soon), I really want children...I just want to be functioning again and I want to know how to achieve this.  I should also include that I try to stay as active as possible by going for 30 minute walks with my dogs twice a day, I go swimming (I live near the beach) for about 30m-1hr 3 times a week, and before this tendinitis thing I was also doing yoga 3 times a week. So it's not a matter of needing to push myself further, I am doing what I can. I have followed all my different doctor's orders to a 'T'. I've recently been able to cut my medication list waaaay down after carefully reviewing them with my general doctor, but I'm hoping to cut it down even more.   I'd at the very least like to know a little more about this tendinitis hooplah. All the googling I did seemed to repeat the same things over and over again all products of over-use, and rarely you see people with finger tendinitis or have it replicated in their opposing areas...it's to the point now that I can't sleep properly. Last night I woke up 5 times in tears from the pain. This morning (after taking a few vicodin to get myself to sleep) when I woke up, there wasn't much pain, though my hands were very stiff, a few hours later they began to hurt again.  I've begun shutting myself out from my friends and family again, and I'm moody and angry, and this just isn't me. I need some answers...  Thank you so much for your time reading all this, I know I tend to babble, but I figure the more information (no matter how insignificant) I give, the more someone can help me...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Without actually examining a patient in these circumstances, it may not be possible for anyone to hazard a diagnosis.One should be able to examine & determine what is causing the pain in your hands such as...... tendernesss in the muscles, joints or the tendons, the range of movements of the joints, swelling of the joints and so on.  Arthralgia, myalgia, and frank arthritis(in SLE) may involve the small joints of the hands, wrists, and knees. SLE arthritis or arthralgia (in contrast to rheumatoid arthritis), may be asymmetrical, with pain that is disproportionate to swelling.  You mention 'fibromyalgia' as well.Thus diagnosing your condition is not straight-forward. It is possible that you may have co-existing conditions(for example, SLE+fibromyalgia).  It is now-a-days possible to diagnose tendinitis and tenosynovitis fairly confidently by MRI.  You may discuss with your rheumatologist from this point of view (if you are not satisfied with the provisional diagnosis that has been offered). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response. A few days ago I had left a phone message with my rheumatologist about receiving corticosteroid injections, and she agreed it'd be a good idea right now, so I went in and instead of receiving the injections in my joints/tendons because there were so many spots (it would have been every joint in both hands and my wrists) I received one intramuscular injection and was informed it may take about a week until I see the effects.  I do have a definitive RA/SLE diagnosis, I'm not sure what Frank arthritis is, but I will go read up on it on google. The fibromyalgia diagnosis I received a year or two ago is kind of up in the air because there are no real diagnostics for that disease and the only symptom I've suffered from it was random flares of tender spots around my body (pain only upon touch).   I also did receive a definitive diagnosis of tendonitis, I guess I'm just concerned because it seems like every other month I'm diagnosed with something new, and this just isn't making sense to me. I understand that it is part of SLE, but I still feel uncomfortable. I plan on being more pro-active and upfront with my doctor and hopefully things will improve...  Again, thank you.\n\n",

There can also be inflammation of the shealths around the tendon of the middle finger.  Bending the finger would cause pain.  The most common area for this tenosynovitis is on the outside part of the thumb.   You may not find the exact diagnosis but should treat the symptoms of inflammation and pain with heating pad and NSAIDS like ibuprofen.  During time of low or no pain, perform range of motion exercises and strength the hand and fingers with putty exercises.  Use caution as too much exercise may worsen symptoms. By the way, which labs did the doctor run? Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

The pain is very localised and it hurts more when i push gently on it. The leg has been hurting for a few months, with increased pain later in the day or after exercise such as running (when the pain sometimes extends to the left ankle too).   I have visited the doctor about this who told me to try resting it and taking anti inflammatory medication, but this has not worked. The only cause I can think of would be that I ski regularly. However, the only injury I have had from skiing was a temporary bruise on my right knee, which fully recovered. As far as I know, I have not received any injuries to my left leg.  Thanks in advance for any advice.  SD\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SD, What you are describing sounds very much like a possible tendonitis.  The area you are referring to contains both the anterior and posterior tibial tendons.  While you may not recall specifically any trauma or injury, it is possible that you may have strained the area simply by applying pressure to the site during your skiing adventures.  Many skiers favor one side over another when slaloming, and during stops, and it is possible that you may have inadvertently injured the tendons this way.  The doctor did recommend the best treatment for this: rest and the NSAIDS (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs).  You may wish to examine your skiing postures, and see if you may indeed be favoring particular styles of skiing that may be causing the underlying problem.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  Sorry to reply to this old post. I have the same issue. Very isolated pain right above the inside of (left) ankle. About the height of a sock. I ran a marathon last year without problems.   I think pain started while \"over-training\" in period after the marathon. Ibruprofen and 3 months complete rest from running helped. However, recently carefully re-started running but pain comes back almost immediately.   Pain feels most clear when rolling my footstep towards the front part of my foot. Could it be possible my shoes have had too many kilometers and do not provide sufficient cushioning anymore? In other words; can this be solved by simply buying new shoes or would it be more complicated?  Please advise, thanks upfront!\n\n",

Had a RA factor/SED Rate done about 4 months ago both came back high, normal was 15 and mine was 90 the DR said to have it done again in a few months, had the test done again last week (Oct 09) by my primary DR and had the same results. I am having awful pain so DR put me on Prednisone 20mg 2x a day I have no relief and have been taking it for 7 days. Have appointments with Rheumatologists but not until January 2010...Do I really have to wait months to see a DR as of now I am not able to work and I have a very physical job (cook/supervisor in a restaurant) (dropped a pan of hot water last week because of the pain and also dropped my fork while eating) i do not have swelling at joints. I have a past history of Lyme, Thyroid Cancer and Cervical Dystonia. Do you think this sounds like RA or something else and if you think of something else can you give me some ideas\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Since you have a feeling of muscle weakness, are seropositive and have not responded to steroid therapy, it is unlikely to be 'Polymyalgia rheumatica'.  As you had undergone thyroidectomy for thyroid cancer (histologic type is not mentioned), one differential diagnosis to be considered is sporadic medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) associated  'sensorimotor polyneuropathy' usually manifested by progressive numbness and muscle weakness in the extremities.  Para-neoplastic syndromes are well known and occur with many types of cancers including thyroid cancers.Among thyroid cancers, medullary thyroid carcinoma(MTC) has been more often implicated, but para-neoplastic syndromes due to the other differentiated thyroid cancers have also been reported.  'Dermatomyositis' is another auto-immune disorder that can occur as a para-neoplastic phenomenon.But as you have no skin rashes and have not responded to steroids, makes it less likely(although you have a history of lyme disease - which can produce 'Lyme myositis'. but whether it can trigger dermatomyositis is debatable).  Hypothyroisism also can manifest as muscle weakness, and therefore, your thyroid funtions must be looked into. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure where to begin.  I am so desperate for all the facts to be laid out that I am fearful of missing or forgetting a symptom.  I am a 34 year old single mom.  I have had pain for as long as I can recall.  Perhaps it best to start from the beginning.  My mother had told me of my birth quite a few times.  It went from being amazed when i was younger - to pity for her when i became a mother - followed by anger when all this pain and weakness began, wondering if this was part of the problem.  When I was ready to meet the world, i was face-down.  This doctor had decided to flip me while i was on my way out.  Simply told my mom \"sorry\" then stuck his hands up there and twisted.  My mother, of course, passed out from the pain.  As a child I was a tomboy doing silly things and always getting hurt.  Once i had fallen 20 feet out of a cabin on stilts and landed flat on my back.  My headaches began around 10.  Pain and stiffness in  my neck and shoulders.  My parents were big in chiropractors so that is where i went.  For 6 years.  4 times a month.  At 16, I realized this was doing nothing for the pain and was in fact causing more pain, so i stopped.  At age 19, an iron gate (the kind from the olden days at the mall when closing time?) fell on me the length of my spine, nearly knocking me out.  A few other car accidents were about the extent of my trauma.  At age 20 i had gone to see my doctor regarding severe pain in hands and wrists.  He brushed it off as arthritis (to me seemed odd at a young age) and sent me on my way.  When i was 24 the severity of my pain and symptoms really began.  (after my child and emergency c-section).  I was always an abnormally strong girl.  (carrying 3 cases of beer etc.  always pushed myself as well if something was to heavy i would strain to carry it.)  Those days came abruptly to an end.  To this day my strength has not returned and on what i call my bad days - my weakness is worse than ever.  (having my daughter open things for me!  I sat on the floor once for 1hour and cried cuz i was unable to open a spaghetti jar)  The pain in my back was awful.  Each time i would go to the dr, i would ask him to check my back.  He said it felt like every muscle in my back was in spasm at one time. (which it felt worse than a spasm)  I was not a crybaby so i just ignored it, hoping it would go away one day. One visit, I was suffering from severe pain shooting from my shoulder, to my neck - up through my head/ear, and my jaw would pop.  He said was chronic pain, thus began the testing. MRI's were normal - have been to this day.  (though I can not lower my chin to my chest for over 5 years now- like it is stuck - not just because it is painful) I began therapy which after 4 months really did nothing.  I lost my job due to having therapy 3x a week for 2 hours so i lost my  insurance.  I have been on a downward spiral since.  Bouncing from dr to dr to find someone who cares what becomes of me during the times i do have insurance has become exhausting.  The pain is daily, in every joint i have - though i am not sure if it is the muscle pain that is causing that or vise versa?  After all of the testing and therapy - it was determined that i have fibromyalgia, but I don't believe that is it, and the most recent dr i visited agreed.  My pain is in shoulders, elbows, wrists, fingers, toes, ankles, hips etc etc.  It at times feels as if my muscles or nerves whatever are going to rip right through my skin because they are so tight.  I had recently been tested for carpal tunnel, which i was told i had 5 years ago.  It came back negative, though i have limited mobility, severe pain and weakness.  He also performed a test where he was to stick 25+ needles into my muscles...not sure what that was?  He barely got through 10 of them.  When those needles got into my muscle, it felt as if he were using a jagged knife to rip through my arm.  I was screaming and crying, I had never felt such pain.  He could not finish all the needles - he was shaking so bad.  (for the record, my tolerance to pain, before all this was very high.  now i do not believe it can be charted after living with this pain for so long.  i have a few tattoos and barely flinched for them.  Just to give you an idea of how very painful it was)  This exam was following a slip and fall at the dealership i was working for.  I had not seen this dr after nor did i really find out his thoughts.  Before i left his office he spoke to me of SMS - stiff man syndrome but I heard nothing more about it.  To try and describe my daily pain - it is almost like i was in a car accident and it is the day after, every day.  Always a constant ache all over.  Except for a few spots (that change daily) where it feels like the worse tooth infection I have ever had.  Could be a shoulder or knee or ankle- changes all the time.  At that time i was prescribed baclofen, zanoflex and vicodin.  It did help me to get out of bed and to actually sleep more than 3 hours.  The pain is worse when i lay down in bed at night.  If i am actively doing something, the pain in less, not gone but less.  When i stop doing that something and sit down, the pain is worse.  I cannot stand for longer than 20 min or so w/out my legs getting shaky and weak.  It is hard to shave and wash my hair etc anything longer than 2 minutes, due to arms and hands giving out.  My sex life has gone down hill.  I am too weak to do much but lie there and that is no way to live.  I used to be a very active and fun person.  I played 2 games of darts one evening (plastic darts!) and could not move my arm for 3 days.  Due to having no insurance, I have to buy street drugs (painpills) to be able to get out of bed and care for my family.  I no longer can take any OTC medicine.  They no longer help and i had been told by doctors that i had taken too much of it.  (approx 4-6 ES at once 3-4x a day, then PM formulas to try to sleep) I was already not suppose to be on anti inflammatory medicine due to overtaking them when i had my impacted wisdom teeth.  I had no insurance and had to take naproxen for bout 2 years - til i passed blood in my stool.. Am afraid my liver and kidneys will be/are damaged.  I can't type much more, because my fingers are missing keys and shaking.  I used to type 60wpm!  I just want to know what is wrong with me.  I am much to young to feel this dam old.  I want to go walking with my daughter. I want to have a normal life.  Or at least as close to normal as i can get.  As for other things in my life - my eyesight is poor - 2 astigmatisms left eye vertical, right eye horizontal and i am near sighted in one eye and far sighted in another.  I get migraines.  I was told i have plantar fasciitis...my bowel movements are never normal - were green more than a few times and at lease twice a month, at least, i get these awful attacks that feels as if an alien (for lack of better analogy) is bursting through my stomach.  I get light headed, sweats and almost vomit.  I get to the bathroom and on that trip rarely anything happens, but passing of gas.  Followed by diarrhea that lasts about 3 trips then am fine.   Sorry for the book - I could keep going if my hands would allow...I hope someone has something enlightening for me.  Thank you in advance for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am truly sorry and sympathetic towards the suffering you have been going through. Medically speaking, it sounds as if there have been no testing for connective tissue disorders or rheumatoid conditions. This would include a basis screening with CBC, ANA, CRP, sed rate, anti-CCP and rheumatoid factor.  You may also need a muscle biopsy done. I have also seen some type of therapy i.e. Feldenkrais methods which have been very effective for chronic pain and movement disorders. In essence, find a family physician who can take some time to do some focused examination of your condition and get you on the right track.  Some of the sweatiness, nausea could be withdrawal symptoms from the narcotics. Nevertheless, begin with an understanding family doctor who will invest at least 12 months of time with you to guide you to better health. Remember nutrition and adequate water intake are part of good health. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "just wanted to be clear that the sweats and the nausea that i experience are only when i am trying to have a bowel movement-this has been ongoing, monthly at least, for about 13 years- although i do experience nausea often in the mornings (for about 1 year) comes and goes in waves.    wanted to be sure that was indicated in case there would/could be ne connection with that.  i am not able to get medicine on a regular basis due to only receiving unemployment currently and when i do have the option, my intake is limited to  5 mg -enough to take the major edge off so that i may do ordinary cleaning and cooking for my family.  i try very hard to make them last as long as possible because without them, my life barely exists beyond the couch.  my mind wants to get going and do the things that i need to but my body just can't.  it feels exhausted - like each limb weighs 100lbs. and the muscles are being pulled from my joints or my joints are pulling my muscle?  i feel as if i am becoming hunchback?  i really do not have the control to sit straight any longer.  the pain is just too much.  and i have always been ocd with sitting up straight. (ask my daughter! lol)  i do have every intention of seeing a rheumatoid specialist - but not sure how far in the future insurance is.  very difficult finding a new position at this time.  i am almost at my wits end.  this pain and fatigue is getting the better of my mind.  i cry now almost daily and although i tell myself every second how much worse it COULD be-that has stopped helping. wanted to get a better feel i guess from someone on what they think this could be...i know u can't diagnose but has anything i have told u strike some familiarity with u?  i looked up the testing and i am assuming it was an EMG performed on my wrists and then on my muscles (that caused the near passing out pain i spoke of previously but got no diagnosis from the appointment) thanks so much again for your time!  hope all is well and have a great day.\n\n",

It only helps a bit but it does help some. I cant sleep, which makes pain worse, which stops me from sleeping which causes pain and so on, i am constantly swollen and as you said typing is almost impossible for me. but i have found that the codine phosphate woeks a little.

She has not been compliant with prednisone for a year now. recently she developed 3 tender painful lymph nodes on her left supraclavicular region. she has now gone to get a ct scan and fine needle aspiration. here are the results...  CT SCAN RESULTS:   non enlarged anterior mediastinal lymph nodes with central calcification and heart in enlarged.  findings can be due to granulomatous disease.     Partially visualized left supraclavicular adenopathy is noted. There are two non enlarged prevascular mediastinal lymph nodes with central calcification.     Multiple bilateral supraclavicular fossa necrotic lymph nodes. The largest one is 2 x 1.7cm. adjacent inflammatory changes in the left supraclavicular fossa. Multiple bilateral deep cervical/spinal accessory chain necrotic lymph nodes measuring 1.2cm in the suprahyoid deep cervical chains. Dystrophic tonsilar calcifications.     Mild prominent palantine and lingual tonsilar soft tissues.       Fine Needle Aspiration= granulomatous inflammation in the background of acute and chronic inflammation and extensive necrosis. Every culture came back negative.   Peripheral smear for acid fast bacilli is next step in management according to the pathologist..  So basically she is at a standstill now...she has these nodules in her neck, she doesnt know what is going on, she is not taking any meds for polyarteritis. I am thinking that this is a systemic manifestation of PAN, but honestly...I have no idea.

    "content": "Hi,  'Sarcoidosis' a chronic granulomatous disease, has been reported in association with polyarteritis nodosa.  This condition is characterized by 'non-caseating' granulomas and can affect almost any part of the body.  Calcified hilar or mediastinal lymph nodes may be present in patients with longstanding sarcoidosis.  Calcified lymph nodes may also be found in silicosis,tuberculosis, and other chronic granulomatous disorders.  The pattern & distribution of calcifications seen on CT scanning in sarcoidosis differs from tuberculosis.The lymph nodes in sarcoidosis are generally larger than those in tuberculosis (mean diameter approx,12 mm vs 7 mm), more often focal, and less likely to be completely calcified. Lymph node calcification tends to be bilateral in patients with sarcoidosis, but in only in a minority of patients with tuberculosis. (You have not mentioned the sizes of the mediastinal lymph nodes).  In your your girl friend's case, sarcoidosis remains a strong possibility.    In passing, let me mention another condition... 'Hairy cell leukemia'. This also has been reported in association with polyarteritis nodosa. There have been case reports of sarcoidosis developing in patients with this condition.

    "content": "Hi, On a forum like this, it is highly difficult to offer opinions because we lack one very important aspect in patient management namely, clinical examination of the patient.   Especially in cases such as yours, with a multiplicity of symptoms and signs, it is but impossible to 'guess' what diagnosis would explain all of your symptoms.  However, if all your complaints have to be brought under one umbrella, my choice (my guess, rather!) would be 'Hypovitaminosis D'.  Vitamin D malnutrition is being increasingly recognised and diagnosed even in developed countries (increasing numbers of elderly individuals, individuals in old age homes and hospices,  lack of out-door activity and other life-style changes).   Vitamin D malnutrition has been linked to an increased susceptibility to several chronic diseases, such as tuberculosis, periodontal disease, high blood pressure, cancer, chronic pain,multiple sclerosis, peripheral artery disease, seasonal affective disorder,cognitive impairment,and several autoimmune diseases including type 1 diabetes.  There is an association between low levels of vitamin D  and Parkinson's disease, but whether it is the cause or the effect is unclear.  It may not be a bad idea to have your vitamin D levels checked. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a fever of an unknown origin for 6 months now. It usually ranges from 99-100.3. It presents itself everyday. I have been through the ringer with doctors. I am totally fatigued, have wrist pain and abdominal pain/lower back pain.  The serum protien test showed a faint discrete band in the gamma region and IGg levels were elevated. I also had a WBC scan that showed increased radiotracer activity in my pelvic region and a Laperoscopy that show a markedly inflamed bowel (outside wall) and a colonoscopy that was normal. My CBC is normal, sedrate is normal, c3 & c4 compliments are within normal range and c reactive protein is normal. However, I tested positive for ANA twice and I also test positive for the Anti DsDNA antibodies. In addition to that, I just developed painless mouth sores underneath my tongue. I went to see the Rheumy and he has pretty much dismissed me because I don't meet all 4 criteria of Lupus, I meet 3 right now. He didn't even reschedule me for a follow up visit. I am so frustrated with these doctors and just don't know what to do. He says it's because my CBC is normal right now although I have heard from many sources that the CBC can be normal in the beggining stages of Lupus or when you are in remission. Can you have a normal CBC and still have Lupus that has not progressed yet? I am so frustrated with these doctors and feel that I need a second opinion. what are your thoughts about my symptoms and test results? I am pretty convinced that I do have Lupus.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Positive ANA (twice) & Positive Anti dsDNA",
    "content": "Hi, I can understand your frustration. For a doctor, to label a patient as having SLE is not in any way easy. Symptoms of SLE are highly variable, at times intermittent and overlap symptoms of so many other diseases. This makes diagnosis very challenging.  Understanding the results of the various tests for SLE may be somewhat confusing (more so for patients).  The terms 'sensitivity' and 'specificity' can be confusing(more so for patients).   For example; Anti-dsDNA antibodies are highly specific for SLE; they are present in 70% of cases, whereas they appear in only 0.5% of people without SLE. This means that this test is more useful to exclude SLE if it is abscent. In other words, it is good in correcly identifying people who don't have the disease.   Similarly, CBC results have higher specificity than sensitivity (approximate sensitivity = 59%; specificity = 89%). So, once again, this means that this test is more useful to exclude SLE if it is normal.  So also, the various criteria for diagnosis of SLE have their own sensitivities and specificities.  Your rheumatologist must have considered these aspects critically before deciding that he/she was not as convinced about 'your' diagnosis as you are.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Prolonged Gout Attack - Diclofenac?",
    "content": "I have had a gout attack for 6 weeks now (I seem to have on average one attack a year lasting about a month). In the first two weeks I took Diclofenac (as prescribed by a doctor). It did reduce the swelling and definitely helped but unfortunately the attack still continues. In the last few weeks the gout/inflammation seems to be moving from  joint to joint (foot), revisiting some joints but mostly not in two places at the same time. I'm away from home so cannot see a doctor or rheumatologist to discuss long term treatment plans for another few months at least. I am also being extremely careful with my diet at the moment (watching purines and fructose intake).  My first question is - is it ok to take Diclofenac for another 2 weeks or so in the hopes that the swelling will go down again (this particular attack has lasted quite a while now and I am frustrated at not being mobile).  I want to check this as I understand NSAID's should not be taken for prolonged periods, but I am not sure what constitutes a \"prolonged\" period.  My second question is - I have read Diclofenac is an anti-uricosuric ... therefore is this not something I should be avoiding considering my history of gout? Should I be using another NSAID rather? Although I understand Diclofenac is one of the most commonly prescribed NSAID for gout?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You are right in saying that Diclofenac is an anti-uricosuric drug. The treatment of choice for acute gout is indomethacin+a glucocorticoid. Colchicin in lower doses has been found to be beneficial in multiple acute episodes of gouty arthritis.  However, there are other NSAIDS which have a uricosuric action, such as...... - Tiaprofenic acid and - Diflunisal.   It is advisable that you should consult your doctor before using any drug or changing over to another drug. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with Rheumatic Fever back in 2004. I had been having swollen and painful ankles and knees since i was 13 or 14. I was relieved when i finally had answer for my problem-rheumtaic fever. I went virtually symptom free for a couple of years. Recently, within the past year or so (maybe 2) ive been having what i thought were flare ups from the rheumatic fever. Ive had more than 4 occassions where my ankle has become swollen and painful. To the point where i cant put any weight on it. It has occured in both ankles. It usually occurs in my ankles although i have had the same problems in my elbows, knees, and now my foot and shoulder. The \"flare ups\" have been occuring more frequently now, to the point that i can expect to have miss work at least once a month due to this problem.   I have made numerous trips the urgent care all with the same result. Not rheumatic fever but a sprain. Earlier on, i took this diagnosis without question and figured that i just didnt remember doing anything to hurt it. Now that these episodes have been occuring more frequently, I know for sure im not doing anything to hurt myself. I wake up and the pain and swelling is there and it stays for about a week. The pain at times is so bad i wake up in the middle of the night in agony and cant get back to sleep until the ibuprofen kicks in. Its becoming a serious concern. But i cant seem to find an answer. I have been tested for Lupus, Gout, and everything  that goes along with swollen and painful joints and all have been negative. If its not rheumatic fever or any of those others what could it be?  Ive come to the point that i don't even go to urgent care anymore, because there is nothing they can tell me that i havent already heard. I need some input as to what other problems this could stem from.\n\n",

Another approach to the diagnosis may involve pulling fluid out of the swollen joint and analyzing it.  To pull all the information together, sift through it, and make a working diagnosis may require the consultation of a rheumatologist.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

If negative, I might do an MRI of the cervical and lumbar spine and perhaps an MRI of the brain.  Cervical spine problems can cause these symptoms (foot symptoms uncommon with cervical problems).  Another consideration is that the headache and dizziness could be an unrelated problem to the hand and foot symptoms.  That is why the wrist splints were recommended.  Another test to judge the amount (if any) of nerve involvement is an EMG or nerve conduction velocity test which can be ordered through family practice.  This will give you an idea if the nerves to the hands and feet and being affected and if so to what degree.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I went to see my neurologist and he told me that EMG test isn't neccessary. he thinks that since i stopped the medication so suddenly on 7/05/09 it might be due to stopping the medication. my primary doctor order a blood test for numbness and tingling  and i guess it's all normal. my neurologist also told me that since i was taking medication for a long time, he told me that it could cause rebound headache.  I'm happy that i'm taking vitamins but am i ever going to get better? my neurologist told me keep excercising and i'll see him again in six months. i also did a abdominal ultrasound because i was having lot of abdominal pain and i have been vomiting alot with nausea. i doubt that the test won't show anything but can abdominal pain and headache could be related?? i've done all the test and it was normal that's probably why my doctor doesn't seem to think that it's neccessary to do the EMG test.  what do you think?? I'm 25 will be 26 in two months. I'm glad nothing shows up on the test but why am i so sick all the time with headaches and all??\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 year old female. 2 years ago I had gallbladder removal surgery. There were complications and I had a severe infection, developed pneumonia and remained in hospital for several days. As I was healing i noticed my right foot was constantly numb and tingling, also very sensitive to any touch. Told my surgeon who referred me to my reg physician who referred me to neurologist. He did nerve conduction study which turned out ok. Could not figure out what it was so just decided to try and live with it. Shortly after I began having numbness and tingling in both arms at night, waking up sometimes unable to move went back to doctor who did some blood testing and was diagnosed as being vit b12 and vit d deficient and put on supplements. The neurologist also had an MRI done of my brain and neck and noted that i had 2 slightly bulging discs in my neck although he thought that they weren't bad enough to be causing my problems. I started having intense nerve pain in both arms at night and was also diagnosed with brachoradial puritis at this time and put on gabopentin (this is seasonal and only bothers me a couple of months out of the year I only take the gabopentin on the nights that the pain is unbearable). For the past 4-5 months I have been waking up every morning with incredible weakness in my left leg (like I spent hours working out the night before)..the leg tingles and is very weak..until I am up for about an hour. Also, my feet and toes crack and pop all the time now (this is completely new) they are very stiff in the morning as are my hands. My grandmother had RA and I was wondering if this could be related? Or if you have any insight into what could be causing my leg issues. It is every morning. I keep waiting for it to go away but has been about 5-6 months now. I would appreciate any information you may have  :)  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 36 year old female who starting about 3 months ago began having joint pains in my wrists and fingers. I work as a barista part time, and thought it was repetitive motion injury.  At first the pain was only in my hands/wrists, and only at night after I had worked a shift.  I would be fine by the following day.  Then I started hurting while I worked too, especially if I didn't sleep well the night before, but got relief when I had days off.  Then the pain started migrating from the hands/wrists to my elbows, shoulders, hips, knees, neck, the top of my feet, ankles, and balls of feet.  At any one time, I will have pain in these multiple areas.  (It's never just in my shoulder, for instance.)  Also, from one day to the next, the pain can go from annoying (but tolerable without meds) to making me limp and take 5-6 ibuprofen/day.  When it's really bad, I have to take ibuprofen or I can't fall asleep because I can't get comfortable.  I am pretty healthy otherwise, and am on no meds other than ibuprofen 1-2 times/week.  I still need to go to the dr. but thought I would fish for possible diagnoses first.\n\n",

    "title": "Negative RA tests - Multiple Joint Pain",
    "content": "I would like to list the things I've been feeling over the last few years.  Most recently my shoulders.  I have seen my primary care doc and he has run full blood tests includingUric acid, RA latex Turbid, C-Reactive Protein, Sedimentation Rate-Westergren, H.pylori IgG, Abs.  All are normal.  Cholesterol, sugars, all normal.  Technically I am extremely healthy according to my labs and yet I'm having these issues.  (My mother has had RA, Hypothyroid, and Breast cancer.  I am trying to be ahead of the game on the RA and am suspicious.)  For 2+ yrs numbing hands from wrist to fingers stretching my hand backwards helps a bit with this.  hands achy in cold.  for 2+ years upon sleeping or sitting long period aches in both hips, alternating sides not at same time.  Slight stiffness upon waking in the morning in ankles/feet but goes away within 15 minutes.  Bunions in both big toes, worsened within the last year.  i reduce pain with silicon toe spacers 3x per week while sleeping.  Left toe is worse and visible, but discomfort in both toes.  Switching to Clark's shoes has helped.  Most recently & most severe is shoulder joint issues.  within the last 2-3 months increasing in severity.  Both shoulders hurt deep in the joint, range of motion is slightly restricted.  Mostly on the left side.  If i sleep on left side i wake in extreme pain until I adjust or turn.  Then the right side begins to ache but not as bad as left.  I am tired often and notice an increase lack of energy since the shoulders have gotten worse.  They are uncomfortable during the day, typing at the computer, keeping them suspended while driving, reaching backwards - these things antagonize the pain. placing a pillow under the joint relieves.  The pain does not hinder my activity.  Although I am concerned with it increasing.  I do not like taking ibuprophin and do not take often.  I would rather know why than remove the pain with pills.  I do not see any swelling as listed online for RA joints.  In heat/hot days I swell quickly, but I believe that may be unrelated.  All my labs are normal and my primary doctor is at a loss.  Question - could all of the above be unrelated and just age.  i am 38, 5'5 and 165lbs.  Always been very healthy, no issues at all.   Should I press to see Reumetologist, or leave it alone and deal with it.  Primary care doc at this point is being nice, but I believe he thinks I'm nuts.  Thanks,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would consider the shoulder and hand pain and symptoms related to repetitive work at the computer   - typing.  In fact, you may have carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS).  Sometimes the shoulders can be affected either from sitting at the desk or secondarily from the CTS. You may try some rehabilitation for both shoulders and hands/wrist and include bracing of the hands during work and sleep.  Lastly, evaluate your work station set up for proper ergonomics.

    "content": "Thank you for that, I suspect maybe you are correct about the hands....and stretching them backwards frequently during flare ups does help - bracing hasn't helped in the past- but maybe I'll consider again.  Not so sure I agree shoulders are due to computer....but none the less if it's not RA.... then therapy is my only option no matter what else it could be.    I'm not big on surgery so carpel tunnel surgery won't be an option as well as bunion surgery.  I believe in doing as much prevention naturally since surgery has it's own complications and side effects.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello good morning,  I am 30 years old.  My hands kinda weird like a numb or worst, its like when my hands are not doing anything I will feel the pain all over and when i tried to open it or move it, its kinda locked.  This happened during my first pregnancy last 2004. My OBGYN told me it will fade right after i gave birth. True enough it went away.    Last 2007, during pregnancy again, I suffered the same symtoms but which much pain and sometimes i will just tripped off or mostly feel pain in my legs/feet.  I assumed that it will go away just like my OBGYN told me. But it became worst every winter. I stand 4 '11 and weigh 120 lbs. Recently I tried to lose weight and to my amazed, it worked. I could say it totally gone to the point that I can drive for hours without shaking my hands just to relax it for like every 3 minutes.  Then I gained 10 lbs again and started to feel the pain again. So i guess its  my diet or arthritis?  Now, just last night, my left arm just almost beside my armpit, I felt the pain, prior to that, I always feel pain in my chest or heartburn.  But last night just the pain in my armpit.  Pain is tolerable but it is uncomfortable and like pointing pain. I decided not to take a pain reliever because I want to observe what will happen.  Now when i wake up in the morning, I have the same pain like in my armpit spread through my fingers particularly all the way to my thumb.  I have also pain in my right ear.  (I have seen by a Doctor and told me that my eardrum is almost totally gone like they recommend for a surgery to fix it. But it was not infected, no discharge or anything. )  I don't have pain even i have problem with my right ear.  I don't have fever and discharge up to now, not even infected. Now I have pain and since then this pain in my chest and then left armpit.  Please help me enlighten becasue I am think it could be a heart problem with regards to my armpit problem and my pain all over my fingers and sometimes feet/legs.  Thank you very much.'

    "content": "Hello, The armpit pain is not likely due to a heart problem since you are young.  If you have any congenital heart problems, certainly have a cardiac assessment. The hand issue could be something as simple as carpal tunnel syndrome.  Shaking the hands free of numbness is a classic sign. However since other parts of the body seems to becoming arthritic then check in with your physician to consider testing for rheumatological problems (e.g. rheumatoid or lupus). You may screen for diabetes as well. Take care.\n\n",

My Consultant has advised that its ok for me to do this in moderation but sometimes I don't and so I tend not to take my Methotrexate for a couple of weeks to give my liver a rest. As this doesnt cause me too much trouble apart from the odd twinge  I would like to discuss with my Consultant about getting my MXT dosage down and maybe use another alternative drug to support it.  Would Glucosomine be a good one to help support a lower does of MXT or is there another remedy that might do the job?  AS you can imagine Im not keen to discuss with my consoltant that I miss doses of my MXT as I know she wont be impressed.\n\n",

It is a stinging, pulling pain, that only ice helps. I also feel out of sorts when it begins. The most distressing symptom is a tingly, numb feeling up into the back of my head. I've had multiple MRI's and nothing turned up. I also had EEG, and EMG tests, and they were normal. I've had several diagnosis including bakers cyst, chondro malacia, herniated disc, and on and on. I do not have the extreme tiredness that is common with fibromyalgia, and I feel like this is a catch all term when doctors are uncertain.  When I was a teenager I had a very serious case of the shingles virus. I have not experienced any type of rash, but wonder if all of this pain and suffering without the rash could be the culprit. It causes so much anxiety that I sometimes feel like the doctors think this is why I'm having these issues, but the anxiety is due to the pain, and scary, tingling feelings\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Cases like this i.e. when the pain starts in the knee then travels to the thigh then to the back of the neck can seems confusing.  How can these things be connected or are they? Fibromyalgia (FM) is sometimes helpful term to described multiple areas of tenderness throughout the body in fact if multiple tender points are not present then it is not FM. With chronic musculoskeletal pain, consistent and regular exercise with non narcotic analgesia are the mainstays of treatment.  Good nutrition (5-7 servings of fruits and vegetables) and plenty of water (1/2 oz per pound of body weight per day) is also key.  You may also check some auto-immune connective tissue disorders like lupus by doing a rheumatological screen panel - ANA, RF, anti-CCP, sed rate, CRP and CBC.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Last April both of my feet and ankles swelled up and both feet became very red and very painful.   Part of the swelling was edema because on my ankles and lower shins I could leave dents just by pushing in and I get that when the weather is hot and I sit for prolonged periods which happened the day before but I have never had paid with that.   I don't have health insurance and am not currently working but I was in so much pain that I went to an urgent care clinic and they charged me $165. and did no tests but told me I had either pseudogout or rheumatoid arthritis.  Since then I have had frequent pain in both feet, both knees, both hips and upper buttocks.  The pain in my feet are at the base of the toes and sometimes includes minor swelling but not usually, the base of the middle toe, the insteps and the back of both heels.  The pain in both knees doesn't seem to have a specific point but they are very stiff especially in the morning.  They improve with movement and the pain will come back if I rest during the day.  The pain in my hips is at a point on the outer leg where it meets the hip and the buttocks is the upper buttocks in the center on both sides.  From the research I have done it appears that most of these points seem to correspond to bursa sacs but it is not extreme pain and except for occasionally the base of my toes I do not see any swelling, nor have I noticed any redness or heat.  I don't have the pain in the hips and buttocks every day but when I do it is always on both sides.  I pretty much always have the pain in my feet and the stiffness in my knees.  Do you think this is related to pseudogout or could it be rheumatoid arthritis or bursitis or what?  I have read about all of these conditions and my symptoms don't really seem to fit.  Thank you  A\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain in multiple joints",
    "content": "Sounds typical of rheumatoid.  But it could also be a few other things including fibromyalgia.  However, with fibromyalgia you have pain even in areas not near sites of the joints.  Because the pain is on both sides of the body pretty much at the same time and acoompanied by swelling, this is why it sounds like rheumatoid arthritis.  If so, then the only treatments really seem to be to treat symptoms.  They do have some new drugs out now that they use though.    You really need more follow up.  But I understand the lack of insurance and funds.   Also with rheumatoid, over time, you will see actualy damage to the joints.  The fingers are very likely to be affected and you see abnormal curves at the joint sites.  The ulner drift is common (when the fingers seem to have the joints drifting toward the outside of the hand....towards the pinky finger).  Damage is likely to show up in some of the joints before long if it is rheumatoid arthritis.  And inflammation at the joint sites is common and shows up as red swollen areas at the joint sites.      I might tell you that if it were me I might take some ibuprofen, aleve, or aspirin for the joint pain because they are all anti-inflammatory meds.  They can help the pain some.  But remember, I am not a doctor.  But it is what I would do for myself.  But you must be sure that the meds I mentioned do not interact with  any of the other medications you take.  If you are not on a blood thinner or some other kinds of anti-inflammatory meds, then it is probably ok to take one of the over the counters I mentioned.  Also keep in mind that these meds can cause some stomach problems for some people.  You also feel very tired all the time with these diseases.  I see you have narcolepsy so that may not be anything new to you.    Please try not to worry, but follow up with a physician as soon as you can.  They can test you with  blood tests to diagnose rheumatoid.  The they can rule it out or prove it is rheumatoid arthritis.\n\n",

I have been wearing a tubi-grip bandage folded in half (to act as more of a support) over the tendon below my knee for about two days and this evening I have noticed a swelling along the inside of my tibia (this is not localised, it extends almost all the way from my knee to my ankle). When I press my shin an indent appears and very slowly fills back up with a liquid (it does not hurt to touch). I have been noticing an occasional tingling in parts of my leg and foot (both below and above the knee) but this is very sudden and only lasts for a second or two.

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.  I got a copy of the MRI report for further knowledge.  Not sure I understand and can't wait for another 2 months before I see a Rheumatologist.  Just to let you know, I am a 37 yr old female with no known medical problems.  Could you please tell me your opinion based on the following from my MRI report?  There is right-sided marrow edema in the inferior endplate of L4 throught L5 and at the superior endplate of S1.  Anterior superior L1 subentheseal marginal edema is present and there is some accentuation of marrow fat at the anterior superior margin of L2.  Discs have a slightly biconcave appearance.  The distribution of marrow edema at L5 also extends anteriorly in a circumferential manner and there is some left-sided discongenic edema at the margins of L4-5 as well.  No overt collapse can be seen.  No destructive lesions can be identified on out of phase gradient images.  The central canal is patent.  No evidence of a disc herniation.  No clear evidence for an endplate fracture.  Foramina are patent.  Lateral recesses are unremarkable and facet joints are unremarkable.  Distribution of marrow edema could be seen with an inflammatory spondyloarthropathy.  Possible that endplate deformities represent minor chronic osteoporotic deformities but mineralization on prior xray shows no specific abnormality to suggest osteoporosis.  The sacral lateral view shows minor subentheseal sclerosis anterosuperiorly at L5 which would suggest early spondyloarthropathy.  No evidence of significant disk disease facet arthrosis, central canal narrowing, lateral recess or foraminal encroachment to suggest mechanical source of back pain.  Numerous locations of marrow edema in lumbar spine end plate of L1 and to some extent of L2.  No abnormalities to suggest stress fracture.  Numerous minor end plate concave deformities are probably developmental as I do not see evidence of an osteoporotic compression fracture.  DXA exam may be of help.  Again, thank you for your time and interpretations.  At least I can have some type of heads up what may be the issue and possible treatments.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The MRI essentially says that the spinal cord, the canal which houses the cord, the discs and the small joints of the vertebrae themselves are all normal.   However, the marrow edema and endplate findings raise the suspicion of \"inflammatory spondyloarthropathy\".  This would include diagnosis like ankylosing spondylitis (AS)and back pain associated with psoriatic arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).  Seeing a rheumatologist may help pin down the diagnosis and add some treatment options however, you can start on a regimen of NSAIDS and exercise and follow up with the family physician to review the list of possible inflammatory conditions causing this low back pain.  Here is the list of possible diagnosis for \"inflammatory spondyloarthropathy\" reactive arthritis ankylosing spondylitis psoriatic arthritis IBD with associated inflammatory low back pain   Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  These symptoms  are often seen with RA, and especially in the morning, but  most often are accompanied by some local redness or heat. Assuming you have no other significant medical history (especially heart or kidney disease) then I think we can safely assume this is due to RA. If you do have either of the other problems as well,  then you would need a doctor to make a differential diagnosis to be certain this isn't caused by any additional systemic problem.  One thing you could do which might help in eliminating heart or kidney problems from the list would be a simple  self-test wherein you press on the swelling on each ankle or foot fairly firmly, then release. If a dent remains in the swollen area (pitting edema) then there's a greater chance this is due  to something besides RA, and you should have yourself checked to make sure everything is in order. If there is no pitting then this is very likely due to RA.   I hope this is  helpful to you. Good luck with this. Please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 42 year old male.  A year ago I was having chest pain.  I went to th3e hospital and my CPK was high but it was my CPK-MM, not MB.  I follwed up with a cardiologist who did various test and I ended up with a blockage that was taken care of, but it has not helped with the chest pain.  I still get the pain in my left chest as well as my left shoulder and trap.  My CPK-MM remains high at about 1700. My cardiologist thinks tha pains might be related to an autoimune disease and not the heart.  He ran blood test, ANA, CBC ,RF ESr and a liver panel but they were ok.  He suggested that I seek Rheumatologist.  In addition, recently the left side of my neck, jaw and face have been getting swollen and I have had extremely bad pain in my left foot for a couple of years which may or may not be related.  Any suggestions on what it might be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Something is keeping some muscle or group of muscles inflamed and this inflammation probably was related to the original heart problem, but continues on afterward,  and  so seems likely an autoimmune problem. It's impossible to say what specifically it may be, and sometimes there are new variations that surface that aren't  well-recognized. Even though your ANA came back normal, which sometimes happens, you can still have an autoimmune problem. This is part of the reason they are so frustrating and  sometimes difficult to diagnose (and so treat correctly). A rheumatologist would seem a logical next stop in figuring this out. I suspect the other problems you mention, those that are more distant from the heart, are likely related to whatever the original cause of muscle injury, so I'd definitely second the suggestion to see a rheumatologist next.  Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated as well.\n\n",

The doctor took more blood to check for other test and he wants me to go for a bone scan, not sre what for, and an EMG test on my limbs,  I am not sure why.  I guess I should have asked more questions.  Someone mentioned that he might be looking into one of the muscular dystrophies.  Not sure.

Neuromuscular problems could well be exposed that way, and if so, all the better, as a treatment plan can be formulated. For that reason I actually hope it turns up something so you can begin to get things turned around. Otherwise it's back to the detective work.

There are a lot of variations on that theme that are more amenable to medical management.

    "content": "The diagnosis of the biopsy states - Rare atrophic myofibers in skelatal muscle sample without inflamation or myofiber necrosis.  The notes state there is a slight suggestion of a neurogenic process.  The atrophy has some features of denervation and there is some clustering of type 1 myofibers, although not enough to be tru fiber-type groupoing.  There is also type 2 clustering but this sometimes seen in the type of muscle biopsied (thigh).  There are also Neuclear clumps.   The microscopic description states - This skelatal muscle sample has no inflamation.  There is no nyofiber necrosis or regernation.  Internal nuclei are mildly increased in number and there are occasional muclear clumps and a rare nuclear chain.  The myofibers do nto contain vacuoles or inclusions.  Most of the myofibers are of normal size and shape, but there is focal limited atrophy.  A rare rounded myofiber that is smaller than most noted and there are a few isolated angualted atrophic myofibers.  In the paraffin section, ther is a small group of angulated atrophic myofibers.  There are no taget fibers.  There is slight periphial accentuationof staining with the NADH stain but isw interpreted as within normal findings.  Than is goes on to talk about the typing descibed in the notes and that other test were normal, PAS, fat, edomysial.  It shows a small zone of myotendinous sinertion.  The blood vessles show slight prominence of capilarry was as seen with diabetes mellitus.  The Rheumatologist has reffered me to a Neuromuscular specialist.   The next appointment is six weeks from now.  Any thoughts on what it might be?\n\n",

    "content": "Well. That is certainly not something one expects to hear, but it may not necessarily be a terrible thing. It is rare enough to warrant not trying to hang one of the more commonly known labels on it as yet, since it warrants further study and the pathologist didn't connect it to any of the more \"popular\" demyelinating diseases. Still, it could be a limited or localized response to one of those diseases, most of which are at least managebable, although rarely are these technically \"curable.\" Most do respond to medical therapies. You'll no doubt be hearing more from your doctor about this, and about which group it falls into (or if it's so rare as to be unique). Treatment will probably be planned around the group of disorders it most closely resembles. Please keep us updated about this.\n\n",

I get a little depressing to still not know what is wrong.  Not that I wanted polymyositis, but at least I thought I was at the point where it would finally be treated.  Now I feel like I am back a the beginning.  Also, at least I knew the myositis would have been treatable. I am assuming that whatever it is, it's treatable but you always worry.  Some days I feel pretty good while other days I have trouble getting up from a sitting position.  I actually go up stairs on my hands and feet when it is bad.  Those are the days it is the hardest to stay positive.  Again, thanks for the encouragement and I will keep you updated.\n\n",

While scleroderma isn't known for its denervating properties, I honestly don't know why, since it should be somewhat disruptive in that area. It's certainly one of many autoimmune diseases that should be ruled out, and this can be done at a very basic level with ANA testing. It's definitely worth consideration, even though the more \"interior\" parts of this don't seem to fit the picture. Thanks again for your helpful (and very timely) passing along of this idea!\n\n",

    "content": "I do not know about Scleroderma,  I think my Rheumatologist would have picked it up.  He checked my for a whole bunch of antiboldies which I think that was one of them.  The other night I noticed that my left calf muscle moves by itself.  I was sitting relaxed and I see it moving in various places.  It was almost like something was underneath moving around.  So I started looking at my calfs and noticed that the right one is considerably smaller than the left one.  Which is strange since I am righty, you would think that they would either be the same or the right one would be bigger.  The size of my calf worried me a lot because I have always had very large muscular calfs that mostr body builders would want.  Whenever anyone would see them they would ask me if I played a lot of football.  I guess a lot of football players get very muscular calfs.  My left calf is 21 inches and my right calf is only 19.  I more worried about the movements.  I read that is a sign of denervation as well. It stinks that I have to wait another 5 weeks to see the Neurologist. When you look on-line most of the diseases that you see are not too encouraging if you know what I mean.  Keep you fingers crossed and thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "I also would think a rheumatologist would have taken scleraderma into account already. What you describe, today especially, does sound like a demyelinating disorder, and the fact that you've always had (previous to the atrophy in the right one) the calves of a football player is strongly suggestive of long-latent distal muscular distrophy, one of the less serious forms of the disease. I don't know of any \"desireable\" diseases, but some are less undesireable than others, and if you're suffering from a muscle wasting disease or demyelinating one (such as MS), there are worse things by far that could happen.   I'll be looking forward to an update once you've seen the neurologist, and all fingers are crossed here. Good luck to you!\n\n",

The numbness,tingling, creepy crawling under the skin, extreme tiredness,and high CPK are also my symptoms!!  My numbness is painful,it is just like when as a child, my toes got so cold,that when they were released from the skate, and exposed to the warmth,they hurt like heck. T he only other way I can explain the pain isit feels like when something stops the circulation, the areas go numb, and then the boold rushes back in.  I was sent to a neurologist, who after only reading the MRI center's report, rather than viewing the brain and cervical films himself, checked my knee reflex and how I walked, then----sent me homw with carpal tunnel bracesand told me to sleepwith a pillow under the top of my thighs!!!  It didn't change anything.  I return to the doctor's this Tuesday, and because I know how I feel is not normal for me,I was searching the web for \"painful numbness and muscle weakness\", which is how I came across this site and your information.  I had looked at chronic fatigue syndrome and Epstein Barr info also.  I've printed out your info and am bring this tomy doctor.  I have a titanium rod, and although I am allergic to metals except gold and 99% silver jewlery, this was not thought to be of a concern.    I have had high colesterol,controlled by medicine. Yet, the med was changed recently(3months ago) and in monitoring the liver, that's how we found the high CPK.   I will definitely stay tuned, and provide any information I find out.\n\n",

    "content": "For dkisis: What you're describing sounds very much like idiopathic peripheral neuropathy (IPN), an inflammatory process of the peripheral nerves, usually mostly in the legs. Idiopathic meaning the cause is unknown. This can cause numbness and pain simultaneously, weakness in the legs and sometimes other muscle groups, and stinging and burning pain in the feet. It can also cause inexplicable fatigue, lightheadedness, and balance problems, mostly due to gait disturbances. This is usually diagnosed via nerve conduction studies and electromyelograms, done in the same visit, which will demonstrate slowed nerve impulse conduction and some mucscle weakening and possible demyelination, again usually most prominent in the legs, though it can affect other areas as well.   The neurologist first of all should certainly have looked at the brain films, as IPN is frequently confused with early MS, but the brain films could probably rule this out.   If it is determined you have IPN the usual treatment is a nerve pain blocking agent such as gabapentin or pregabalin (Lyrica) for pain, and exercise and adaptation practice (balance exercises) to strengthen the muscles and help maintain balance, since often the patient will tend to lean, stumble (foot-drop) or otherwise get off-balance, often without realizing it's happening til a fall is invitable, which can be annoying and possibly injurious. Also, due to numbness sometimes scrapes and abrasions go unnotices.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us after your doctor appointment. Hopefully this is something you could bring to his attention as a possibility. If not, a second opinion will definitely be in order, assuming MS is ruled out via the brain films. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello John, Thanks for your reply.  My CPK is still high (401)! A fasting glucose remains 86; yet a HA1c is 6.3, so the MDs while still investigating this, are leaning toward diabetic neuropathy. I'm not convinced - more below.  The neuro exams were normal, so MS was disregarded. ALT high (41), IEP, EGRF and aldosterase were all normal. I am due for a fructosamine test, and a redo of chol pane and CPK. In '08 sed rate was high (27). My LDL and HDL are high, we've been trying to see if the different chol meds were spiking the CPK, yet it remains high even when I stop meds and exercise.   Why do I have hesitations? I have sensitivity to heat, scrapes to my skin go unnoticed at the time they occur, I'm amazingly tired, I'm noticing that my vision is beginning to blur, and most importantly if I place the slightest stress on my joints, I get a bony painless protrusion like that of an arthritic! These do not go away. Certain times, it looks like there is some swelling at my knee cap. I'm wondering about Lyme Disease? Could this be possible?\n\n",

    "content": "Lyme disease should certainly be ruled out (not always an easy thing to do, takes some time and detctive work), but it also sounds as though you are describing idiopathic peripheral neuropathy. I say \"idiopathic\" as oppsed to diabetic-related because your A1C is actually pretty good at 6.3, and not diagnostic of diabetes. You could still be prediabetic, but it would likely have no relation to the neuropathy. I would suspect some other autoimmune process, but again, Lyme should be ruled out, and MS follow ups done as well, since it also can be a difficult diagnosis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have had raunauds for a number of years although it was just actually diagnosed by my doctor this past winter.  I had not bothered to mention it to him before, because it is just something I am used to.  The reason for mentioning it this past winter was because it seemed to be getting worse and I was getting painful blisters on my toes as a result.  I tried calcium channel blockers for about 2 days but they made my heart race and I felt jittery.  Now, for the past few months (since about March) I have been getting burning feet and ankles at night and occasionally during the day.  Usually it happens about three hours after going to bed.  My feet and ankles will swell, turn red and throb.  The heat is unbearable and cannot be relieved easily.  Temporary relief comes when I run them under cold water.  It is causing serious disruption to my sleep and I have now started getting up for relief while still sleeping.  The other morning, after thinking I had slept through the night, I woke up with a very sore toe.  When I looked at it, the nail was badly broken off and the toe was quite bloody.  I had obviously stubbed it quite badly.  Beside my bed was an ice pack which I have used before for cooling my feet in the night.  I have no memory of getting up for the ice pack and no recollection of stubbing my toe.  Is this burning and swelling part of the Raynauds or a sign of something else?  Why would it be getting worse after so many years of being predictable?  Can I get any relief apart from calcium channel blockers?  My doctor just about laughed me out of his office when I mentioned this in passing when it first started.  Do I just have to live with this?  Age: 32 Sex: female Other medical issues: vulvar vestibulitis, gastritis Medications: topical gabapentin, pariet mild complaints not likely relevant: bruise of no origin that never went away (2 yrs old), mouth ulcers, frequent muscle pain and mild hip pain.\n\n",

I am not sure why the ice helps relieve the symptoms but it seems like ice would make the Raynaud's worse instead of better.  Treatment for Raynaud's includes smoking cessation, stopping medicines which may trigger Raynauds, and avoiding cold exposure.   Medicine for Raynauds includes calcium channel blockers.   I would investigate other sources of the pain, swelling, and redness.  This would include infection, peripheral vascular disease, and skin conditions (e.g. dermatitis).  So a revisit to the family physician would be in order.    Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your response!  I just wanted to clarify one thing.  My normal Raynauds is the typical symptoms of pallor, purple, red in the winter and it is in response to cold.  Now since March it's like I'm getting symptoms the opposite of Raynauds attacks.  It's like my Raynauds went in reverse.  Instead of the vessels being restricted and not letting blood through, it is like they are letting too much blood through and I can't get them to stop burning.  I saw a pediatrist when it first started and he said there was nothing wrong with my actual feet.  There were no signs of a fungal infection or anything that normally causes burning feet.  It starts just above my ankle and seems to be brought on by heat at times but I don't know what is causing it in the night time.  You mentioned checking for infection.  Do you know what kind of infection would cause similar symptoms?\n\n",

I was not thinking of any specific infection but with redness, swelling, and burning in or around a joint infection is a diagnosis to give some amount of consideration. A CBC and other blood work (rheumatoid factor, sed rate and CRP) may also be in order.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, I think it would wise to see a physician who can evaluate the feet.  Bilateral foot swelling in your case could be from aggravation of an old ankle sprain injury but would also warrant investigation for other problems since there was no incident and both feet are affected at the same time.  Some potential causes of bilateral feet swelling without pain are poor venous circulation in the legs, congestive heart failure, and kidney or liver problems.  Therefore, some basic testing usually blood work (CBC, comprehensive metabolic panel), urine analysis, and perhaps x ray are starting points.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr.,  I am a 33-year-old woman (5'4, 120 lbs) recently diagnosed with fibromyalgia after exhaustive testing.  My pain has decreased and my sleep has improved with daily yoga and diet modification (I gained 7 lbs back).  But I still have several hard lumps in my neck that cause great discomfort.  Three lumps are where lymph nodes would be above the clavicle and under the jaw; two are right on the SCM; four are along the trapezius, on the back of the neck.  Some are as small as 1 cm; some are much larger.  An ultrasound, chest X-ray, a CT and a PET/CT, all in the last seven months, have shown no malignancy -- and no significant lymphadenopathy.  A needle biopsy failed to show what the lumps are.  My doctors say \"reactive nodes\" (for seven months?) or \"scar tissue\" and \"don't worry about it.\"  All CBCs are normal; no Lyme disease, either.  The lumps themselves don't hurt, but they make everything around them hurt.  I also have constant rock-hard swellings and pain in my jaw muscles.  What are these lumps, since they are not cancer?  Sarcoid?  Calcifications?  Does \"scar tissue\" make sense as an explanation (with no injuries or accidents)?  How can I get them to go away?  Thanks, Grace\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The difference between APS and Lupus is a good one but the answer can be somewhat fuzzy and complex.  Primary APS is characterized by the presence of an antiphospholipid antibody in the plasma plus one clinical manifestation usually clogged blood vessels. Besides clogged blood vessels, other systemic problems similar to Lupus can occur (e.g. cardiac, renal, respiratory, and skin conditions).  Sometimes the APS can be associated with other disease such as Lupus and can be secondary to Lupus.  Coumadin is standard treatment for APS as this helps prevent abnormal clogging in blood vessels in legs and to vital organs.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Let me apologize in advance for the length of this post. I'm 27, female, and HLA-B27 negative. In 2004, I developed bulging disks L4-L5 and L5-S1. In 2005, I was diagnosed with fibromyalgia by a rheumatologist. In 2007, I had a CT scan of my pelvis because of something unrelated, and as an incidental finding it showed \"bilateral asymmetry and sclerosis of the SI joints with partial fusion of the right SI joint.\" I showed this to my rheumy, she said she did not think I had AS, but would do an MRI (closed, 1.5 Tesla) to make sure. When the report came back, she told me there was no active inflammation and that \"it was just osteoarthritis.\" I never saw a copy of the report, I took her word for it, and I was relieved and moved on. I don't know if she ever looked at the actual films.  An x-ray of my lumbar region done for my disability case showed loss of normal lordosis, a Schmorl's node, and something about chronic apophysitis. A few months ago, I started having pain in my neck, MRI showed two right paracentral osteophyte complexes and cervical straightening.   Recently, I moved to a different part of the state, and got a new rheumatologist. He took one look at the CT and MRI reports and said he thought I had AS. It turns out the MRI report from 2007 says that, while there was no active inflammation, there was \"partial fusion of the right SI joint via an osseous bar.\" I wanted a new MRI, he said he didn't think it was necessary, and was all ready to put me on Remicade. I asked my PCP for an MRI, wanting to be sure. She ordered it, but for some reason ordered it as an OPEN MRI (half the magnet strength). The report came back this week, showing \"No active sacroiliitis, slight asymmetry of the SI joints, with mild narrowing and predominantly iliac sided subchondral sclerosis of the right SI joint.\"   I faxed it to the new rheumy, he got the CD of the films and showed it to a radiologist. The radiologist feels confident that the report it right and that there is no need to get a closed MRI, which is what I wanted. I am having the CD of the 2007 films (the closed MRI showing fusion) sent to him so he review that next week.  I feel like I'm on an emotional rollercoaster. I'm totally lost. Can anybody shed some light on all of this? Or tell me what I should do next? Thank you for your help, Kristin\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This description sounds like you may have AS but I would defer to the rheumatologist for definite diagnosis.  The issue of whether or not this is AS comes into play when deciding on second and third line medications (e.g. methotrexate and Remicade respectively)  First treatment options are exercise and NSAIDs.    Since the spine with AS straightens (decreased lumbar lordosis) and fusion of SI joint, mobility / AROM exercises are important.  For the lumbar spine, do extension exercises.  The other issues that comes into play with AS are potential systemic problems such as:  uveitis (inflammation of the eye tissue) colitis (inflammation of the colon) aortic problems and arrhythmia more spine problems (e.g. subluxation of the upper cervical vertebrae)   I think the imaging so far is sufficient to move forward into treatment but again working with the rheumtologist is key.

I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis (diagnosed in 2002) and was diagnosed in February with Lupus. I am not sure that I agree with the Lupus diagnosis right now. But, I have a hard time expressing that to my doctor. Other tests have not been done to rule out other issues that can be misdiagnosed as Lupus (I have been reading a lot on the subject). Could Lupus explain these blood results and are there other things that could cause these results?

Around one year ago when I started working (I\u2019m sitting a lot in front of the computer) I started having muscle twitches, which are distributed around the body. At the same time I\u2019ve started having brain fog symptoms, which only worsen during this year: I\u2019m having problems concentrating, my memory and coordination are poor, sometimes I can\u2019t find the right word, I\u2019m confused. I feel fatigued all the time: even if I sleep 9 or 10 hours I don\u2019t feel refreshed after the sleep. My blood pressure is usually around 110/70 but it drops to 105/62 when I\u2019m at rest. My hands and feet are really cold; sometimes I feel numbness and tingling. I don\u2019t tolerate cold as well as before. Sometimes I hear buzzing in my ears.  My MRI is ok, cardiologist says that my heart is fine; neurologist also says that I\u2019m ok, endocrinologist too. I did ultra sound of thyroid and adrenal glands, both of which were ok, as well as hormone tests. My blood tests were fine, except that I once had a higher level of monocytes (11.5% while upper limit is 10%). I don\u2019t know if it\u2019s important, but my mom quite often feels tired and has to sleep a lot in order to feel fresh.  I was repeatedly told by doctors that I need to relax, and that basically everything is in my head. It would be really helpful if someone had any idea about my condition. Thanks, Zoran\n\n",

    "content": "I had virtually identical symptoms and went undiagnosed for years, even after seeing 10+ \"specialists\" who failed make the connection between my symptoms and my history of exposure to a Lyme endemic region [Cape Cod on Massachusetts].  I found your post the same way I made my own diagnosis, by Googling key word combinations of my symptoms like \"muscle twitching\" and \"brain fog.\"  That led me to a paper by Dr. Robert Bransfield, \"The Neuropsychiatric Assessment of Lyme Disease\" [you can Google to find it].  It should be a \"eureka\" moment for you as it was for me.  There is lots of research /info available on the web.  Best starting point is http://www.lymediseaseassociation.org.  Good news is the prognosis is good if you can find a Lyme literate doctor who knows what to do-typically an extended course of strong anti-biotics.  I've been on Tetracycline [1,500 mg/day] and now Biaxin for the past 6 months and am doing much, much better.  Feel free to contact me directly at ken@lyme-advocate.info for more info as I've made it a mission in life to help as many people as I can so that you don't suffer as needless as I did.

My TSH went up and down and I'm no longer on thyroid medication.  I'm pretty sure I tested negative for Lyme disease several years ago and also lupus.  I've tried potassium and magnesium and numerous other vitamins and supplements and diets.  Mangosteen juice helped my fatigue and brain fog for a while but symptoms are returning.  Nothing has helped my muscle twitches yet and right now they seem to be getting worse.  I would like to know if Zoran found any help yet.  Funky\n\n",

    "content": "PBour et. al - I have been suffering with Brain Fog and tinnitus since December and have little improvement. Some days are better than others. I use to run 3 miles four times a week and do weight training five days a week (now walk & some weights today - 3-4 days a week). Now I am more fatigued, depressed, irritated easily, which has had some effect on my relationships and work (unless I am really cognitive of my attitude and behavior).  I contracted this blasted condition during the holidays when I was sick with the flu and upper resp. condition. I took antibiotics that I had left over from a year ago (now I know that taking this wasn't wise) and sleep aids due to the fact that my decongestant caused me to have insomnia.  Anyway, one night I went to bed and the next day - brain fog and tinnitus.  Again, some days the fog is lighter than others (especially when I am able to get adequate rest) but it is still there. And somedays the tinnitus is better than others.  I have been to scores of doctors and had the plethora of tests done: MRI, CT, blood tests, hearing test, eye exams etc.  and no doctor can give me a reason for my fog and tinnitus.  I thought it was CFID but I took an online test and was advised it wasn't CFID or CFS.  I have allergy testing upcoming and have read some recently on Toxic Encephalopathy - eviro poisoning.  I don't know - has anyone gotten relief?\n\n",

    "content": "For at least ten years I have had bouts of facial, and total body hyperhidrosis brought on by lying down, turning over in bed, raising my arms over my head when reclining, using a hair dryer, drinking hot drinks, heat of any kind, or for no reason at all.  It wakes me up all night long.  Minutes before I experience the sweating, I feel a rush like an elevator in my abdomen, then start sweating profusely on my face, scalp, under my arms, breasts and behind my legs.  I need water right away when this happens.  I also have bouts of freezing for no apparent reason, even in summer, but the sweating is keeping me from sleeping.  No one seems to have any idea what causes this, and I have a lot of doctors.  I have diffuse Scleroderma, and Raynaud's.  Is there some relation, to these two diseases and any treatment?  I never sleep more than two or three hours because of this, it's debilitating to the point I have to carry a small portable fan to get me through the worst bouts, even in public.  My hair becomes soaked and sometimes I become really cold afterwards.  There are different degrees of the episodes, and sometimes if feels as if it is fading in and out.  For years doctors blamed menopause, but no hormones ever helped this, and now I am passed the age, so though doctors are listening they don't seem to know what the cause is or how to help me.  I haven't slept through a night in over ten years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some historical questions to ask with excessive sweatiness are: any headache any racing or fluttering of the heart any weight loss elevated blood sugars electrolyte abnormalities (e.g.potassium)  Affirmative answers to some or all of these question leads one to suspect a metabolic problem as the cause of excessive sweatiness.  Examples of conditions leading to increased metabolism include:  hyperthyroidism adrenal gland (located on top off the kidneys) tumor  The general physiology of sweating involves catecholamines and receptors near the sweat glands.  Stimulation of the alpha receptors (Rhaynauds may have overstimulatory effect on the alpha receptors) and/or rise in catecholamines (seen in pheochromocytoma) increases sweatiness.  These mechanisms should be considered when thinking about the solution to the excessive sweatiness.  95% of scleroderma patients have raynauds.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I am not sure which forum to put this in. It seems this type of condition eventually falls under Rheumatology so I thought I would try here first.  I am a 32 year old male.  Recently I was diagnosed with \"Leukocytoclastic vasculitis\".   As I have been reading, 50% of the patients diagnosed with this never find the cause of it. Currently my Dermatologists thinks it might have been a reaction to my old blood pressure medication - Amplodipine/Benzapryl.   I have been suffering this for about 5 weeks.  It started out with the usual red spots/rash that are common with Leukocytoclastic vasculitis. After a few days I ended up getting the extremely painful lesions on the feet and ankles. (Any google image search for Purpura lesions will show you what I am talking about).   The Dermatologist sent me to see the Hemotologist. After about two weeks they started me on 150mg of Lovenox (blood thinner). Within three days the lesions started to dry up and heal.  The hemotologist also thinks that I have a blood clotting disorder called \"Antiphosphlipid Antibody Syndrome\". So they now also have me on 10mg/day of Warfarin.   It has been weeks now, and while my lesions are healing, the red rash continues to fade, and come back.  Almost on a daily/bi-daily basis. One day my arms and legs are covered in obvious red spots or patches. Over a day or so they turn rust colored and fade away. Only to come back in a different spot.  Is there anyone else that has had this sort of thing happen, and have it go away completely or at least for a good length of time?  I am getting a little beat down by the fact that some days its almost all gone, and I wake up the next morning and my whole body is covered again in the red rash.   I also will see a Rheumatologist next week, just because both the Hemo, and the Derma think they might have an opinion as well.   Medical bills are starting to pile up, and it seems like no one really knows if this will ever go away.   Thanks!  PS. Current medications Warfarin 10/mg day Atenol (Hypertension) Prednisone 30mg/day Asprin 81/mg day\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to one study, 93 of 95 patients with Leukocytoclastic vasculitis were completely symptom free by 16 months.  The same source stated that the majority of the patient required no medicine while the remainder were treated with NSAIDs and fewer with prednisone.  A biopsy of the purpuric lesions should show a distinct pattern (immune deposits other than IgA in the blood vessel). The most common casue is a drug reaction thus removing the offending drug should help heal the blood vessels.  Also of note: this diagnosis is defined as inflammation confined to the skin and not to internal organs.  If IgA (an immunoglobulin) is found in the blood vessel, then you may suspect Henoch Scholein purpura.  So bottom line is that a skin biopsy, if not done, will help better define the condition and diagnosis.  Take care.\n\n",

My enzymes were slightly elevated so I was sent for a hepatic panel which showed a smooth muscle antibody of 38 and an ANA of 1:40. My liver enzymes were normal from then on.  A repeat test showed my sm antibody to be normal and my ANA still at 1:40.  In May of 2009 I had an ANA checked d/t ruling out Shogren's or Lupus or auto immune disorder while trying to find the cause of chronic mouth ulcers.  The ANA was negative on May 4, 2009. I asked my primary doctor to recheck my sm antibody, and ana and he also checked ss-a and ss-b and double stranded dna on May 12, 2009. My sma was 19. My ANA was 1:320 homogenous. All other labs negative. I have had a rash across my nose and cheeks for a few years which is the pattern of the malar rash and not painful, itchy or bumpy.  I feel like I have something going on. The plan is to recheck my ANA in 3 months. Is there anything else we should be checking?  Do I need to see a Rheumatologist? Right now fatigue and mouth ulcers are my only complaint. Any suggestions would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The ANA of 1:40 is essentially normal however the 1:320 result suggests lupus especially with the facial rash, mouth ulcers and fatigue.  Any symptoms of arthritis?  Anti smith and anti ds antibodies are the next steps.   A referral to an endocrinologist is reasonable especially since you have met some of the criteria for lupus and will need some follow up testing and treatment as indicated.  Take care and let us know how it goes.\n\n",

She had Knee Arthroscopy surgery in February of this year but still continues to get excrutiating pains in the knee as well as subchondral cysts, osteophytes & osteophytic lipping on her right foot, other symptoms include numbness in toes and gout attacks in the same foot.  Latest (taken last week) radiology results state:   ap and oblique views only - right foot The first mtp  marginal osteophytic  lipping with a few generative subchondral cysts are noticed.Further generative cysts are noted  within head of the first proximal phalanx.Medial tibio - taler marginal osteophytes are noted.Further lateral malleolar tip osteophytic lipping with lateral calcaneo - cuboid marginal osteophytic lipping noted.Mid and hind foot soft tissue swelling is noted.  My mom is due to see a surgeon tomorrow, Please can you advise me of what the difference is between generative and subchondral cysts? and what are the treatment options for this, advising me of what you think the best is in your opinion? I have read that these cysts can be drained or injected topically with methylprednisolone acetate.  In addition to this, Please can you advise me of what exactly ''Further lateral malleolar tip osteophytic lipping with lateral calcaneo - cuboid marginal osteophytic lipping noted.'' means? and what is the best treatment for this, as well as..if surgery is the best option in treating osteophytes?

    "content": "Hello, In general osteophytic lipping is bone spurs. In this report, the spurs are in the lateral ankle and lateral midfoot (cuboid).  She probably has been compensating for the knee pain by bearing more weight on the lateral foot to avoid the pain of the medial knee compartment.  If the spurs are not causing pain or dysfunction then no operative treatment is needed.  Even with minor symptoms, conservative treatment ie physical therapy and medicine is tried before surgery.  The subchondral cysts are treated likewise.  Conservative management first then surgery if needed.   An MRI of the foot may be in order when considering the extent of the cyst involvement.  I am unfamiliar with the term generative cyst - perhaps it is a typo and should read general.  Again, an MRI would better rank the cyst as mild, moderate or severe.   Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Bakers Cyst",
    "content": "Hello, The wallet in the pocket suggestion is made under the suspicion of the sciatic nerve being pinched in the buttock.  It is a classic recommendation to anyone who demonstrates some type or radiating pain or paresthesia (numbness and tingling).  If the sensation is localized to the knee and doesn't seem to radiate in a linear pattern along the leg, it may be caused from a local knee problem.    Baker's cyst often indicate a problem with the internal structures of the knee.  If the internal structures are damaged and not fixed but cause swelling (leading to Bakers cyst), then the cyst will return.  My recommendation would be to assess the internal structures of the affected knee with a complete history and physical from your physician or an orthopedist.  Take care.\n\n",

I had the exact same thing in my ankle a few years ago, and ended up seeing my doctor about it because I found it quite uncomfortable. She examined the strength in both legs and said there was a definite weakness, so she sent me to the hospital to be on the safe side. They examined the area that was feeling weak etc, but they couldn't find anything and didn't know what was causing it. In the end, they told me to keep an eye on it and if it got worse, I was to see my GP again. It lasted for quite a while after that, but gradually started to fade. I still get it every now and then, but it hasn't came back in a while.   Maybe it's just the same with you, and will gradually fade away? I know it isn't much help, but hope it makes you feel a bit better about it\n\n",

    "content": "2 months ago I got a flu, fever, hot and cold flashes, nausea,vomiting, diarrhea, and a continous 3 day headache, this lasted for 2 weeks, the doctor said I was very dehydrated and my sodium level was low, after 3 liters of fluids he let me go home. At the end of the 2nd week my entire body started to ache, the pain felt like it was in the joints, then the pain turn so bad that I could hardly get out of bed, this lasted for 2 days then went away as if someone turned a switch. 2 days later the pain came back and stayed, my doctor put me on prednisone for ten days then weaned me off of it, now I'm on Ibuprofen and it allows me to move and the pain is managable but it's still there, when I'm not on anything the pain is so intense I just lay there and groan, this pain is constant, it doesn't get better and it feels like it's getting more intense as well, and the intensity seems to be moving up my body, at first the pain in my legs and hips and lower back were bad, now the worse pain is in my shoulders, elbows, wrist and hands. And the pain feels like muscle sometimes and other times it feels like joint, I can't figure out which.  My joints don't swell but they seem to give off heat, I have no fever, bowel movement is fine, no problem urinating, and I have constant fatiuge and my concentration seems to be lacking as well.  My doctor tested for RA, connective tissue disease, lupus, vasculitus and valley fever(I live in Az), and all tests were negative, he also tested for allergies and arthuritus, these were negative as well.  I enjoy weight lifting and have tried different supplaments but stopped those at the beginning of the year, I also started an intense workout, 7 days a week, and was constantly dehydrated, my diet at that time was lacking very badly, I was eating once or twice a day. I was eating the right foods but just not enough. This was what I was doing when I got the flu. I tried working out when I was on the prednisone and I felt fine, just the usual soreness a day later,no pain.  I go through an IHS hospital and my doctor seems lost with whats going on with me, but he does listen when I offer suggestions though, and with some of them he actually took action on them lol. Trying to get another doctor requires an act of congress here and I can't wait in any case, the pain is driving me crazy, I have no insuarnce so I have to make do with what I got.  I was wondering if you could offer some suggestions that I can take to my doctor?  Thank you. PS: I haven't tried steroids, but I've tried other stuff that claimed to be as good, I always stopped because of the effects they had on me, they made me feel odd, thats the best way I can explain the effects.\n\n",

And certainly may be related to activity.    Running is hard on the lower limb joints especially without pre conditioning.  I recommend at least 3 months of strengthening and low impact cardiovascular training before attempt any serious running.  Stretching is also important.

I am always getting sick with every bug that\u2019s going around. I have insomnia. All my lab work has come back within normal ranges including Rheumatoid factor, CBC and thyroid. MRI of my SI joints shows no arthritis. I\u2019m having a head CT on Tuesday. What else can I do? This is such a frustrating condition.\n\n",

This is a tough situation (as you have stated).  Exercise certainly is indicated for fibromyalgia and should be continued especially with history of MS (although use some caution with intensity level) and Parkinsons.  Other things I would screen for would be diabetes (tingling in hands) and Lyme disease (especially with any history of tick exposure).    Take care and keep us updated on how things go.\n\n",

Was there trauma, how long has the pain been there, is there swellling, what makes it worse, is the pain constant, gradual versus sudden onset, etc.   These questions help point to a specific diagnosis.  In any case, a visit to the family physician may be in order.   Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "3yr old, intermittent knee pain, no swelling, & ALL",
    "content": "My daughter begain limping last spring. Complained of pain in her left leg for almost 2 months. Then began complaining of right knee pain. Bone scan revealed a VERY SMALL area that was biopsied. She was dx with ALL pre-b. Dx was made exclusively on femur biopsy from left leg. Hip biopsy was clean. She has been undergoing chemotherapy for almost a year now, yet the knee pain has not subsided. She still shows no swelling, warmth, or redness in her knees when she complains. Yet she wakes up in the middle of the night in agony. Ironically enough, we went back to the pediatric rheumatologist, who said he had never encounted anything like this before. Our oncologist thinks she may have some autoimmune/rheumatoid condition. She had a positive ANA last year & dx of Sjoegrens before the ALL diagnosis. They have retested her for autoimmune, but most of the tests don't reveal anything or have not come back yet. Her bloodwork at dx was unremarkable-everything was within normal ranges except her ESR and CRP were extremely elevated. Her last ESR was 28 (again she is only 3). Our docs are all baffled, and figure they will have to wait until she is off chemotherapy to continue searching for the cause of the knee pain.  Now that the background is done...my question is whether there is anything that could cause the knee pain and not actually cause swelling. She has a few weird things happen lately as well, her fingers turning blue several times to mention one. She suffered from hives and swollen lymph glands in her neck for a year before any other diagnosis. And always took a really long time (months) to heal from bug bites. And has always bruised easily. I'm not sure what would be relavent at this point, I'm just looking for suggestions as to why the original symptom after a year of treatment? Also, she has muscle weakness and delayed gross motor skills (assessed 18 months behind her age). She is very stiff when she gets up in the morning, and her muscles fatigue (in her legs) after working out (like phyiscal therapy or playing) even though she is not really tired herself. Any insight would be appreciated. I'm not looking for anything exact I suppose, just some insight into another possibility for her chronic \"flares\" of knee pain.\n\n",

I have no throbbing pain or even loss of motion in the hands; i can bend at the joints, make a fist, type, etc. There's slight swelling, but it doesn't subside with ice. I've also tried to put some heat on it, and it's better but as the fingers go cold, the symptoms return.  I've had this pain for about 2 months now - at first i thought i jammed my fingers playing basketball, but there's no loss in range of motion nor does it hurt when i press the fingers toward my wrists. It does hurt a lot when i pinch them on the side of the knuckles, which is odd.   The only activity i partake on a consistent basis is weight lifting - but i use gloves and there isn't any moves that would put a strain on the fingers per se; at least not more on my left hand/fingers than my right.   How can i rehab this (if i can at all)? Is there some kind of application or medicine i can take to make it better over time?  David\n\n",

Some types of arthritis osteoarthritis rheumatoid arthritis gout psoriatic arthritis   Typically arthritis labs include CBC, sed rate, CRP, rheumatoid factor.  Other special labs can be added if lupus, rheumatoid, or gout are suspected.  x-ray helps show if there is any degeneration in the joint.

    "content": "Hello there. I am a 26-year-old male who has been experiencing a dull throbbing pain in my upper thigh for a few days now.  The pain is not intense or shooting, but rather a gradual throb that lasts about three or four seconds each time.   It's always in the same spot, which is at the very top of my inner right thigh.  The area the pain is coming from feels like it would be about the size of a dime, then radiates to the size of a quarter before quickly fading away.   This has been happening intermittently for a few days now. Sometimes it happens every 20 minutes or so, other times it can be as frequent as every 3 or four minutes.  Like I said, it is not a terrible pain, but it's been happening  for long enough that I'm wondering what it might be. To give you an idea of my health, I am about 6'3, 230 lbs, and a smoker. I eat relatively well (I'm no saint though), and haven't been very physically active since I took a desk job several years ago.  If any one can give me an idea of what might cause this throb in my thigh I would greatly appreciate it. Is this something that exercise might take care of (I'm hoping to get a gym membership in the next few weeks), or could it be a sign of something more serious that I shouldn't shrug off?  Thanks kindly for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "For a while now I have been in a moderate amount of pain, and I am wondering if these symptoms are somehow linked. Every person i talk to about this seems to think I am crazy, but I figured it would be better to discuss it on here to see if it's something i should look into.  For starters, i have the strangest pain, the most of it occurring in the skin of my knees, and my shoulder blade area. It feels as though I have sunburn or a rash of some sort, but there is nothing there...no redness or any visible traces of a problem. It hurts if the sheets on my bed so much as rub against it. Very frustrating.  In addition, I get severe stabbing pains in my chest, usually on the left side under my ribs. It is not constant but very sharp. My back is constantly bothering me as well, it just seems to hurt no matter what i do. I feel tired  constantly and have terrible difficulty sleeping, and as of late, a very hard time moving bowels. I have a pretty healthy diet so I don't believe this is contributing. I know this sounds like a bunch of complaining, but I just feel like someone my age (23) should not be having these types of problems. Any doctor I see will usually just prescribe me with an anti-inflammatory or muscle relaxer, and these do not seem to help. If anyone can help me figure out if these symptoms are linked, PLEASE let me know. I just want to find out what's wrong and address it. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Nikki613,  Such obscure symptoms as you describe can be due to an autoimmune condition.  Your symptoms suggest diagnoses such as Fibromyalgia or Dermal Lupus, both of which can have associated symptoms/conditions like the bowel issue you describe.  Since anti-inflammatories have not helped, it's time for you to see a rheumatologist, or a university associated medical center dermatology department.  Many times, this type of condition has an insidious onset, with symptoms developing over time, which makes it hard to diagnose, and will require assessment by a specialist.  Please schedule an appointment as suggested, and go to a site such as \"Mayoclinic.com\" to review autoimmune symptoms and conditions.  That will help you organize what you need to describe to your doctor.  Also, a log of symptoms as they occur can help the doctor see the severity of what you describe.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

After getting it checked out and not getting anywhere I just kind of moved on and learned to deal with it.  Then in Aug 2008 I started getting pain in my knees, intense pain.  I hurt to stand up, to run, to even go up stairs. In both knees.  Then I began getting pain in both wrist and both ankles.  It sounded like Rheumatiod Arthritis, however when the doctor tested me my RH and other arthritis tests came back negative to include Sjogrens, which he tested for me because I have been experiencing dry mouth consistently for 2 months, and have to take restasis for dry eyes.  I was devestated bc the only thing worse than being in pain is not knowing why you're in pain.  And at 25 I shouldn't feel like I'm in a 70 year old body!    Even though the RH test came back negative, is it still possible that I could have rheumatoid arthritis or is more likely that I have something else?  Like her I am tired ALL the time.  I've even began taking B12 shots to try and help combat the fatigue.  It's ridiculous how tired I get.  Even when I don't do anything strainful I'm tired.  I'm eat healthy and a good healthy weight (I'm in the military so I have to make height and weight standards).    What's the likelyhood that I still have arthritis or Rheumatoid arthritis?

    "title": "Constant daily head pressure and chest pain.",
    "content": "I wasn't sure where else to post this, but I am in dire need of some help here. I've been suffering with pressure in my head that can only be described as a kind of pressure at the base of my skull that radiates to the front of my head. This pressure is constant and feels like it makes my head unbalanced like something inside is trying to bend my skull. I have had this now for 3 years. Doctors don't know what it is. One of my doctors noticed the back of my throat was constantly red, so instead of doing a swab test I was socked with a 2 month supply of augmentin that did nothing. The pressure is also in my ears sometimes and feels like I need to pop them. It feels better when I lay down. This all started back 3 years ago I was working as an electrician I just all the sudden one day got the symptoms. Now that I think of it I went to a Christmas party and got sick off some cater food ( I'll never eat cater food again). I didnt think it was necessary to go to the doctors so I just let it go. Few weeks later I got really weak and felt feverish almost like I was going to pass out, and that lasted for a day or two and went away. Like an idiot I didnt go to the doctor. A few weeks after that I felt the pressure in my head that was only there for like a day. Then it would go away and come back every couple days. Now it's every day. I will mention that I've worked around alot of flourescent light bulbs and I read where they have mercury in them. I don't know if that could have done it. I don't even know what the hell it is, and no one seems to know and nothing helps. Headache medicine doesnt help. I can't focus on anything and I get so pissed at the littlest things, I often forget words and Im constanty playing video games to take my mind off of it. I feel like I'm losing my mind. A few weeks ago I just started getting a pain in my calf that wont go away, eylid twitching that happens every day now, and now I have chest pain that wont go away. The chest pain is sorta at the top of the bone that connects the ribs and underneath the adams apple. I need some idea at least as to knowing what this could possibly be. Just the idea of having this and not knowing what it is makes me go crazy. I don't know if I'm going to live or what. I did have slight high blood pressure last time I was checked ( 143 over 80). I'm not very physically active anymore because of this so needless to say I don't work, or exercise because it makes me feel worse. My throat is red all the time and I did have a CT scan done on my sinuses and it came back clear. Had some blood taken for testing almost 2 weeks ago and havent heard anything since so I guess thats a good sign. I had a anomalous metal test and western blot test with the blood work. I did go to a chiropractor about 6 months ago and had an xray done and they said I have and unaligned spine just above the shoulder blades ( like one side of my spine is wedged). I was given the treatment with syringe looking tool and some electrotherapy but it really didnt help. Crazy thing is is I don't know how I could have done that. I did smoke for 10 years and chewd tobbacco for 3 but I quit them both about a month ago. I still feel like crap but o well, maybe this was just the kick in the rear i needed to quit. I also had anxiety brought on by the use of marijuana when I was 15 (im 26 now). Those days are long behind me and I've learned to deal with the anxiety. This all just feels very life threatening to me for some reason like I always have this weird feeling over me every day. I greatly appreciate any help. If I forgot something I'll remember it later and post it here.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience.  Looks like chronic sinus infection cause has been ruled out with a negative CT scan of the sinus and no response to 8 weeks of Augmentin.  With the pain starting at the base of the skull, I wonder about cervical spine.  With an odd sensation near the base of the skull, a cervical xray series is indicated.    Migraine headache is also a consideration.  A regimen of NSAID and avoiding migraine triggers may produce good results.    The calf and sternal pain seem like separate issues.  Your family physician should evaluate these symptoms and give you some guidance.  After a good history and physical, he may be able to reassure you that these ailments are not life threatening.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

My white blood cell count has come back slightly higher than it should and my sed rate was 26.

    "content": "I've seen a rheumatologist. Due to symptoms and abnormal EMG, a diagnosis of myositis (probably polymyositis) is almost certain. We have scheduled a biopsy in 2 weeks. My only problem is that my symptoms are worsening and everything I have seen about this disease says that treatment is most effective sooner rather than later. He wants to see me 3 weeks after my biopsy. This means I will have to wait 5 weeks to even begin treatment. I let him know of new and worsening symptoms. His office just told me to see my primary physician. I haven't done so yet because I know there's nothing they can do for me. I need treatment for this disease. I need to be put on corticosteroids, probably Prednisone. Would it be wise to find a way to get on Prednisone before the biopsy? I feel like my heath is suffering and will suffer more the longer we let this disease progress. I am now experiencing dysphagia, aches in my chest, cough, muscles in my arms and legs are worse. I am concerned about lung involvement which will make treatment more difficult and will not help my prognosis. I feel I need help now and am being ignored. Any ideas on how to proceed?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 23 year old female who is very frustrated with my body. I'm constantly sick, tired, and exhausted. The abridged version of my situation is as follows:  I break out into hives anywhere between 5-28 times/month every month since I was about 2 years old. I've been very sick over the last few years with mono, strep, gall stones, colds, and UTI/bladder infections. I'm always very fatigued sleeping 10-14 hours a day, my hands sometimes swell in damp weather, and there are days I'm so weak and faint I can't take a shower without some one standing near by to ensure I won't fall. These past weeks I've had a low grade fever, neck pain, and muscle pain that led me to the ER.   My blood work has come back this past week as follows: Sed rate: 91 C-Reactive Protein: 17.4 Netrophil Count: 6.8 Neutrolphils: 77 Lymphocytes: 13  I feel like I'm chasing doctors, and never get any direct answers. I have an appointment with an allergist later in May, and also am meeting with a gynecologist in mid May. I'm concerned because I have HPV and had C1 cells, and fear that it has progressed to cancer. I also fear that I have rheumatoid or lupus (my mother has advanced rheumatoid) though I've had blood tests that show I don't. I'm only 23 years old, and because no one has guided me to the right doctors, I've hit nothing but \"medical walls\".\n\n",

It would be good to see the total white cell count and percentages of differentiated white cells as well as red cell count.  This is to help determine if you have rheumatoid arthritis or lupus.    Also, because of the multiple symptoms (fatigue, joint pain, hives, chronic and recurrent illnes), I would check the thyroid hormone and basic metabolic panel.   By looking at the labs and doing a complete history and physical your family physician can get a clearer idea of the specific diagnosis. The exam should include neurological testing (reflexes, sensation, strength, gait and balance) to determine the remote possibility of multiple sclerosis.   I also agree that checking with your gyn regarding HPV and high grade cervical dysplasia is wise.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Osteopenia places you at higher risk for fracture.  Xray is the starting point. If no obvious fracture line, then treat conservatively.  If pain persists then may consider bone scan but I would not choose that as my initial test.  You may also at some point repeat the dexa bone scan if it has been more than one year since last scan.   The RA and SLE may flare and cause joint so this is a consideration as well especially with elevated inflamatory markers and concurrent wrist pain.   For an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan for the hip see your family physician or rheumatologist.   Take care.\n\n",

It is however necessary to exclude gout which typically affects the small joints of the feet, especially the joint of the big toe,  or the arch of the foot. It usually presents with acute onset of pain, with swelling and tenderness, frequently at night, without any apparent precipitating cause or following alcohol excess or certain medications.

    "content": "I have this exact issue happening with me and it has been happening for the past 8 years. No one has been able to tell me what it is. It just happen to me when I was in excellent shape. Now after 8 years I went from 200 lbs to 300 lbs and during the 8 years I have had two doctors tell me that I have gout and that now they don't think I have gout. I am going to a gastrologist now because my doctor has referred me to one of them because of my fatty liver. He has tested me for all kinds of liver diseases and nothing has come back that is related to this foot pain. My doctor said I need to get my liver healthly first before he can handle my foot pain. He said he needs to know that the two are not related.  Any ideas from anyone? Any other type of doctor I should be seeing?\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the question.  I see the only connection between the fatty liver disease and the foot pain is if you have a history of alcoholism or alcohol abuse.  Alcohol can worsen gout and of course can cause liver damage.  Arthritis in the feet can have several causes: gout septic (infection) arthritis  osteo arthritis rheumatoid arthritis inflammatory bowel disease psoriatic arthritis (usu have a hx of psoriasis - but not always) Reiters syndrome (classically will see urethritis and conjunctivitis too).  Of course not all foot pain is arthritis.  Nerves, tendons, ligament and blood vessels all run throughout the foot and can be inflamed, infection, swollen, etc.   I trust that you and your physician will be able to work through this.  A podiatrist may help if the foot pain continues.  Keep us posted and let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "I do not drink so that helps rule that out. My pain doesn't feel like joint or bone pain. I do have swelling in my ankles though when it happens. Not a lot of swelling but some. Also, it doesn't always happen in the same foot, even though my left foot usually is the one to hurt. I've never had an injury on my feet during my high school days in sports or anytime outside of that. You mentioned nerves. I randomly have my feet go to sleep even during these attacks and sometimes sleeping. Could it be caused by poor circulation?  On the tendons and ligament subject. I did have ankle sprangs during sports when I was younger. Could there have been damage to tendons or ligament during that time that randomly just acts up on me?  My condition started this way: 200 lbs 6'2\" 1. I wake up in January of 2000 on morning to this pain in my feet. Not just one of my feet, but both. I had to walk on the outsides of my feet just to move around. I stayed in the bed for 2 days and then the pain went away.  2nd attack started exactly one year later to the month. Same exact thing. I stayed on my feet for 2 days and then it went away.  Next attack came upon me just 6 months after the second attack. 6'2\" 240 lbs.  After this point I started loosing track of my attacks because they come too often now. I get them 2-3 weeks apart now. Now I weigh 300lbs. I'm sure the pain coming so offen now has to do with my weight gain. I'm still on day 2 waiting for a gastrologist to contact me. No luck so far! ;(  Is there anyone that is close to the Dothan, Alabama area on these forums? or someone that you can recommend to me in this area or even close to my area. I'm tired of living with this condition that no one can help me with. I want to get out there and find help and I would be willing to travel around AL, GA, FL, etc. to find some expert help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Bilateral foot edema can be caused by arthritis, poor circulation (poor venous return), or heart failure.   Your physician can best determine the cause with a thorough history and physical.  Why did two doctors say you had gout and then one doctor say you did not?   How did they come to their conclusions: were you uric acid levels high, were there urate crystals in the fluid aspirated from the joint?  what did the xrays show? Bilateral foot swelling leads one to believe the cause is not gout.  Regarding the liver: sounds like this might be non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (aka NASH).  Treatment is conservative: weight loss, low fat diet, vaccination against Hepititis A and B, avoiding medicine through could cause liver toxicity (acetaminophen, statins).  Let us know how it turns out with your feet.\n\n",

    "content": "I am trying to find help and advice regarding an ongoing undiagnosed medical condition that my brother is suffering with. The NHS seem to have stopped attempting diagnosis, and are instead looking to manage the symptoms through physiotherapy. Painkillers with antidepressant properties have been offered, but my brother declined, since his primary concern is lack of mobility, and he is not suffering with depression (beyond the expected frustration).    I will try to give you a basic outline of anything I think might be even remotely relevent:  current age 28  suspected glandular fever aged 21 in 2001  family history: cousin (fathers side) with Wegener's Granulomatosis                       family history of high blood pressure                       Dad had to have an operation to rectify a joint problem with his fingers (sorry, can't remember what it's called. The finger began curling into the hand, and surgery was required to fix it)  smoked aged 15-20 (less than 10 a day). Smoked cannabis within the same time frame.  Bitten multiple times by ticks as a teenager in UK  Travel to Australia, USA, Cyprus.  Tested negative for all the common STDs, multiple sclerosis, lupus - many more than that over the years, but can't recall them all.    The onset of symptoms began in 2004 (age 24) and we believe presented initially as pain, stiffness and tenderness between the shoulder blades (uncomfortable student bed at uni, so this may or may not be related). It then spread to the right hip/pelvis, which was tender, then over time became excruciatingly painful to the touch. At its worst, he rated it a 9/10 on pain scale, and my brother errs on the side of stoic. The pain became more manageable over the following months. Over the course of the year this spread to limited mobility in the left arm, inability to fully extend the elbow, and pain. The initial diagnosis was tennis elbow, despite the fact that there was little in the way of repititive motion that would usually trigger this (he used to drum, but had not drummed regularly for some years). The problem then extended to the other arm, though the effect is still not as pronounced as it is in the arm originally affected. Xrays come back clear, as did MRI.     In 2006 his eyelid began to droop and tests showed that his pupils were slightly dilated at different levels (unilateral ptosis?). Admitted to hospital for MRI, lumbar puncture and lumbar xray.  - all negative. Sent home without diagnosis. Eye seemed to regain proper use of own accord.    Since then symptoms have spread to the knees, thumbs, knuckles, neck and the latest development is within the jaw. Psoriasis (or similar) on the scalp. Joints remain painful. There is not tyically any swelling of the joints, although the knee has suffered from swelling in the past (this could just be incidental, because of the way he walks). The problems seem to wax and wane, with no obvious triggers. He now finds chewing food painful, he walks with a distinct gait (from a distance he has been mistaken for an elderly relative), and when he stands up the most appalling sound can be heard as his knees grind - the closest I can come to describing it is that it is a mix between the noise of velcro being ripped apart, and the sound of popping candy being eaten. It is loud enough to be heard from the other side of a room. The left arm still cannot be fully extended.    We do not have the money to pursue this matter with private health care, though if we could find an expert I may be able to get a loan to pay for him to get a diagnosis, but ongoing private treatment would simply not be achievable. Any advice or support you can offer will be so graciously recieved. It is a heartbreaking situation, and as a sister to have a sibling wince when you hug them is just terrible. He's just so tired of pursuing this now, very worn down by the lack of diagnosis, so I'm doing what I can to help.    Sorry for the very long post but I wanted to be thorough! Please do ask if you need any more information.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With polyarthritis with psoriasis and eye problems (bowever the eye problems were droopy eyelid and dilated pupils versus uveitis), I would be thinking psoriatic arthritis as a diagnosis.    Reiter syndrome, RA, Lyme disease are all in the differential diagnosis too. Some blood work like RF, anti-CCP, sed rate, CRP and CBC along with xrays of the affected joint may help.  Also with a history of tick bites and knee arthritis, I would do a screening test for Lyme disease (an ELISA test and confirmed with Western Blot).    After a thorough history, physical and lab review, you should be able to start treatment either with a med like methotrexate (for RA or psoriatic arthritis) or a prolonged use of antibiotic for late stage Lyme disease.

    "content": "Hello, The problem with pregnancy and rheumatoid arthritis is that if during pregnancy the arthritis flares up, the medicine typically used to treat RA is contraindicated in pregnancy.  Since treating RA early helps decrease the risk of joint destruction then not taking medication increases the risk of joint degeneration.    Pregnancy seems to cause less symptoms in RA patients probably due to the immune system changes that protect the baby from rejection in utero.  After the pregnancy, there is a increase incidence of RA flare.  These are probably the issues the rheumatologist was referring to.  The concern was probably about the post partum changes which may bring up a flare of arthritis.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I do not know where to go for help. My primary is now suggesting a Rheumatologist.  I do have an appointment for later this month.  History:  I am a 46 year young female. Insulin Dependant Diabetic on the pump. Rheumatic Fever as a child.  In 2001, I became very ill with gasto issues.  I was admitted for ten days with Crohns disease.  My Dr. gave me a Remicaid infusion and I used Predisone and other such drugs for a several years.  Four years ago, I was in a car wreck.  Within a month I was having hip pain.  My doctor gave me several cortizone shots in the hip to try to lesson the pain and make walking a little easier for me.  We quit the shots as they worked for a short time only.  We were concerned about possible issues later from the cortizone. The pain never went away but the severity would lesson then come back full force.  I moved to the East coast three years ago and my new Gastro said I was misdiagnosed.  I do not have Crohns but Diticulitus and Polyps.  I stay on top of this issuse.  One year ago, I developed shortness of breath that comes and goes.  Severe fatigue and short term memory issues.  I also went through an embarrasing episode of falling down all the time last summer.  I still fall occasionaly.  In November I started having hip pain again along with some mild knee pain.  Then my wrist, hand and fingers started going numb on me.  At Thanksgiving I came down with a hard bronchitus type flu.  We used anti-biotics but the cough and fatigue worsened.  I started having chest pains and edema.   Last month the edema became more pronounced.  I saw my Primary again, who gave me more anti-biotics for another infection.  Then a week later I thought I was having a heart attack.  I spent three days in the ICU to no avail.  I responed well to Nitro but stress tests and ekg and all the rest of the tests came back fine.  Thyroid was good as well.  I was still stuffed up and coughing.  My gastro said that Gastro issues were not a problem either.  They sent me home telling me my kidneys were good too.  I do have an elevated white blood count.  I do not know what the number was as \"I never asked.\" Seems silly after looking at other posts.  They also sent me home with support socks due to edema worsening.  The next week the edema worsened to the point I was looking odd.  My ankles and feet were miserable.  My knees are weak and painfull.  My lower back is in pain as well as my hip.  Every spot that hurts is swollen to weird amounts.   Last night it moved into my neck and left arm.  I am now oddly swollen and having a problem using my arm.  To lay down is awful.  I am stiff in the morning but horrible at night.  I am now having issues walking and my ribs ache.  I am grateful for the swelling as it reasures me I am not crazy.  With the moving intense pain, it would make me wonder without the swelling. My joints crack, I sometimes have clicking in my joints and one knee locks up. They are now sending me to a Rheumatologist.  I just wish we had anidea of what is going on and where to turn.  I feel like we are grasping at straws and I am tired of living like this.  My mother did have Stills disease as a child and now has RA.   My RA blood test is negative.Kidneys show no problems with blood tests. Any  ideas  would be helpful.  Also, ideas for pain relief and getting rid of the fluid. Do you have any thoughts on what could be causing this??? Thank you, Legalgirl5@yahoo.com\n\n",

Goals for any sore finger are to maintain full range of motion (within painfree limits), control pain and swelling with analgesics, ice, heat, compression; and finally gradual return to normal activity.   Some exercises with putty may be helpful to recondition the hand and finger.  Take care.\n\n",

When I get up in the morning I have almost no range of motion in my wrist. It takes me a hour or two to get where I  can function.  I have been tested for everything from Lupus to Rheumatoid arthritis on several occasions and all tests have been negative.   I also developed a sensitivity to the cold.  The ironic part is my friend who lives around the block from me just started experiencing similar symptoms only its causing swelling in all joints.  Could this be an alergy, some type of poisioning or somthing else.  When I was on prednisone, the symptoms went away, but I cant be on such a damaging drug forever.  Please help!\n\n",

To my knowledge there is no pollutant which specifically causes arthritis.  I suppose a heavy metal in the system may cause some problems.  Gadnolinium for example can cause some skin lesions but this would be from contrast medium not in the environment. Any potential for heavy metal toxicity.  I would expect constitutional symptoms with toxicity however.  You may consider any occupational causes including repetitive use of hand.  This may lead to pain and stiffness.

    "content": "Hello, Creatinine kinase is an enzyme released by damaged muscle (heart or skeletal) and brain. This rise in CPK sounds like its related to a skeletal muscle problem. Some cholesterol medicines (statins) can cause muscle damage and raise the CPK. Some myopathies (muscle disorders) can raise CPK. If this is suspected as a myopathy, an EMG and sometimes muscle biopsy helps diagnose the cause.  You will benefit from talking to your physician in detail about the test results.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been having issues for about four months and the list is long. The symptoms are not always present and each one comes and goes. I need help because I have no insurance and cant afford to go to anymore doctors with out some direction or idea of what it could be.  Fingers- This is the first and worst problem I've had. I had one pinkie swell, become painful and red for several weeks. Slowely other fingers began to swell one at a time. Now both hands(not the thumbs) swell at the knucle but can not move at the first joint. They are always stiff but the pain and swelling comes and goes. Also when the swelling comes there is redness in the creases of the fingers that itch. Some rash shows on the side of one or two fingers and there are some blisters that seem to be under the skin that appear randomly at this time, these don't hurt.   Fatigue- I am very tired but sometimes it is better. Last month I couldn't sleep at all and had to drag through the day and I got sick three times in four months.   Bathroom- I find that I have been thirsty and well as hungry more often and have gained some weight. I find also that when I go to the bathroom I have to go urgently and can't hold it very long and have to pee often, this is new.   Headaches- I started getting headaches about four or five months ago that hurt a lot around my eyes. It happened about once every few days and stopped for about two months and just came back yesterday. These headaches are unbearable. I think they are migraines but I never had one till now.   Right knee- My right knee feels weak but not all the time. One in awhile when I'm walking my foot drags for a minute or when I sit for awhile it is hard to get steady for a minute. Elbows and forearms have some pain too but I figure it is from my hands.  Rash- My face has not really a rash but I have had a few times what looked like an acne out break on my cheeks that came out of nowhere. Yet when I go to bed and wake up it is gone or just no longer red. My cheeks are often red but I don't know if it is a rash because I am always cold and wear a lot of clothes and may just be hot. Does itch a little right now.   - I get shaky and upset when I don't eat. When I had tests done for this they said that I had nothing on my hand xrays and I didn't have arthritis. They said my sugar came back high twice and they said I was diabetic but then the a1c was time and other sugar tests were normal. My sugar is just all over the place it seems and I feel bad it I don't eat a lot.  Please help, I have put a lot of my savings into this and may have to just deal with it if I don't find a solution.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello...I am a 27 year old female that is fed up and wanting answers. I have been dealing with pain for years. When I was 12 years old I had my tonsils/adenoids removed. I had suffered all my childhood years with repeated strep throat and tonsilitis. My parents finally decided that it is the right time for them to have them removed. Well after the surgery I was told by my doctor that my tonsils were \"HUGE!\". He went on to say that he was surprised that I was able to breath. He also told me that they fit in an adult male palm. I was shown pictures..and was allowed to keep them. I now can't seem to locate them. He went on to keep my tonsils and use them in a medical journal and show them at a conference that he was attending the following day.  My question is...Could that have been an early sign of RA or Lupus..or both? My doctor believes now that I have RA which was brought on by Lupus. I always thought that it was one of the other..but I was wrong. Could something have been done years ago that may have made a difference in how I feel now?\n\n",

Rheumatic fever is an autoimmune response to strep throat and is characterized by multiple joint arthritis, possible endocarditis, nodules, rash. My understanding is that rheumatic fever does not predispose a person to rheumatoid arthritis. Nevertheless, it doesn't sound like you had rheumatic fever with your chronic throat infections.    I tend to think the bodies' immune system would not tend to go into an autoimmune state later in life because of chronic infection as a child.  I do not see any evidence of that.

    "title": "Suspected RA in NIDDM patient on Plavix.",
    "content": "My 38 year old husband suffered an MI on Christmas. He had PTCA with 2 stents in the RCA and one Xience V stent in the circumflex. He now takes Plavix, Toprol, Simvistatin (currently held - you'll see why) Lasix, K+, Glucovance, ASA. 10 days ago he developed diffuse migratory urticaria. He refused to see a doctor. He's in school right now and \"can't miss even an hour\". I felt it was a bit late to be an allergic reaction to his medications 3 weeks into therapy, so I gave him benadryl and topical hydrocortisone. 3 days later it resolved. The very next day, he developed moderate diffuse muscle pain. It progressed over the next 2 days. I held his simvistatin, thinking it could be statin induced myalgias. He won't even CALL the doctor, let alone go see him. Absence of the statin didn't help. The pain has progressed to multiple sights. He has OA in his knee, but states that this isn't joint pain, its in the muscles around the joint. Hands, wrists, knees, hips, and shoulders are affected bilaterally. Last night he collapsed in pain. He has difficulty with ADLs and can barely tolerate driving or holding a pen due to pain.   Last night, he finally agreed to see the doctor. Since I am soooo smart and I already had all the differential dx in mind (statin induced myalgia, hypokalemia, rhabdomyolysis) and since the walk in clinic where his PCP works was closed, I took him to the Lubbock Heart Hospital where he had his PTCA and his cardiologist was actually on call. They wouldn't specifically tell me what labs were drawn, but reported that his liver enzymes were normal, metabolic panel was normal, his renal panel looked good, and they felt they had effectively ruled out the medications as the cause. Then they pointed out to me that his 1st digit on his left hand was significantly swollen and the distal joint was erythmatous. He was diagnosed with migratory polyarthralgia and was asked to see his PCP for a referral to a rheumatologist. The ER internal med physician is highly suspicious of RA. They didn't test for it since this would be a send out, and he didn't think the result would ever even get to us although the bills for testing would. (honest answer, huh?)  I worked in pain management for 3 years and RA seems like such a debilitating disease. I know that it won't always be like this. Here's my problem. This town only has four rheumatologists and I know from professional experience that it could be months before I can get him in with one, and even longer before a concrete  diagnosis can be found. I have called in a favor from a friend of mine, and he is going to try to get my husband on the fast track to get in with one. I just don't know what to do with him in the mean time. He is in so much pain! He can't take NSAIDs due to the fact that he takes Plavix. They gave him solumedrol last night, and now I'm worried about his glucose levels. He's a very non-compliant patient, and his last A1c was 13. I'm not exaggerating. As a diabetic, the usual coctail of MTX and prednisone is off limits. Does MTX alone work well?  He can't take any type of narcotic pain medications due to his job and school. Regardless, I've never known them to work very effectively and RA patients usually end up with intrathecal narcotics once other rheumatology treatments have failed. That's not an option for my 38 year old husband. I know that there's no telling how long this flare up will last and that it could go into remission for months or even years. But it's so unpredictable, I don't know how to help him. His current classes are in defensive tactics, and he has to practice physical altercations with suspects all day long. They are taking it easy on him right now, but they can't do that for much longer. He is afraid that he will lose his job.  He is aware of the risks associated with his medicated stent. Since he is typically so non-compliant, I explained to him how the endothelium is affected by the stent, and that if he doesn't take his Plavix, he could develop and embolus and it could be fatal. I did this to show him how important it is to keep taking his medications. Now he says he cannot and will not live in pain like this. He has stated that he would rather be dead. I am terrified that he will stop taking his medications in hopes of inducing an MI. How can I help him until the real help comes from a rheumatologist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported that your husband had stents placed over Christmas time.  He has hx of diabetes and dyslipidemia.  3 weeks post op, he developed muscle and joint pain throughout upper limbs and legs.  General work up was negative and no change with stopping statin. Concern is about the possibility of RA and subsequent treatment and about general well being of your husband.  There are multiple patient issues here: - his ability to continue working and taking class.   - s/p cardiac cath and acute MI - new onset of polymyalgia and polyarthralgia - possible thoughts of suicide - medication non compliance - poorly controlled diabetes - caregiver stress  Regarding the polyarthralgia and polymyalgias, the first step is to do a basic screening panel which can be ordered by his primary care physician.  This will give an idea if RA is probable.  Labs include RF, anti-CCP, sed rate, CRP, and CBC.  May also add ANA as a connective tissue disorder is part of differential diagnosis. May consider xray of the hands and feet.  This will get the ball rolling so his visit to rheumatologist will be more productive.    Regarding the heart and diabetes issue, I will send a note to the cardiology section folks and ask them to review his case.    In the meantime, if he is indeed thinking of suicide, he will need to go to the ER or seed professional help.  Lastly, take good care of yourself and chronic illness can weary both patient and caregiver.  I'll send the case on to cardiology as well.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "So any suggestions to help manage his pain until then? He can't take NSAIDs due to Plavix and ASA use, APAP is no help, thermal patches don't stay on, transdermal lidocaine and dicolofenac did not help at all. The steroids didn't really help, but they were given IV, and that really isn't helpful at any one site anyway. The ER doc told him that the mornings he has defensive tactics and other physically demanding classes he could take a hot soak and one hour before activity take 600mg ibuprofen, but that he cannot do this often. He tried it one day. The soak, Ibuprofen and the solumedrol made one day very tolerable for him, but that's all.   I keep hoping this is statin induced myalgia, but I see more and more evidence pointing to RA like edemic, erythmatous joints. I also notice that this is actually progressing to more and more joints, and he's now 15 days off Zocor. If this were statin induced, wouldn't absence of the statin at least halt the progression of pain? I know it may take time to metabolize all of it out, but I wouldn't expect his pain to actually worsen at this point.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi techsasgirl --  I'm going to try and add a little to the already excellent response by Mr. Plamadon regarding the cardiovascular implications and what you might expect in this area, especially as complicated by diabetes.  First, it seems likely the initial MI was caused by not only poorly managed diabetes (owing to the diffuse CAD found and treated), but also probably triggered by a generalized inflammatory process (RA would be the prominent part of  this right now, but it's likely invaded a number of body systems). Since pain is a significant issue, and since the stress of severe chronic pain adds a layer of risk for a patient with active heart disease, the introduction of MTX and Prednisone only adds to the body's stress response and may at best wind up being a wash, if not an actual disadvantage.   What may work best right now is early discontinuance of Plavix, which is not a permanent solution to the CAD problem anyway. Since it's equally likely the MI was precipitated by a ruptured plaque as by a traveling clot, Plavix may not be an ideal drug for use in a patient with so many comorbidities which need to be addressed. Of course the ultimate goal is to keep your husband alive, followed by keeping him well. He's not supportive of these goals himself, yet is unhappy with the current state of his health (and  quite understandably so). His suicidal ideation is a concern all on its own, and I think if he (or his doctor) D/C'd the Plavix, this might actually allow for more comprehensive treatment of the RA, while only causing a small (but significant) increase in CAD risks. Plavix won't prevent a thrombus anyway (as would,  say, Coumadin), but rather enables blood to flow through tighter spaces than it might normally (Plavix is a true \"blood thinner\" whereas Coumadin is instead an anticoagulant).   I believe it's probably most important right now to treat the most acute problems, which are the severe chronic pain of RA, along with addressing in a broad way the suicidal thoughts, under which one must list his general non-compliance, which may be interpreted as something related to a \"death wish\" if not literal suicidal thoughts. Psych intervention along with comprehensive anti-inflammatory therapy might well yield the  best overall results in your husband's case, as the stented arteries have been opened temporarily and may actually benefit a good deal from successful anti-inflammatory intervention. Placing the potential CAD risks ahead of these other issues may have a lower benefit-to-risk ratio than might be apparent at first glance.   As Mr. Plamadon has rightly pointed out, continued expressions of any suicidal ideation or discussion of death wish will require emergent psych intervention anyway, and in this sense your husband has set himself up for failure by refusing not only to be medically compliant but by being unwilling to temporarily set aside his career goals in favor of keeping himself alive and healthy. These priorities are seriously out of order.   I'd recommend a consult with his cardiologist, rheumatologist and a psychotherapist in order to achieve a consensus as to which path would do the greatest good for the patient right now, and I suspect heart disease, as serious a matter as it may be, could come in second or third if this were broken down logically. Since rheumatology seems to be the most difficult hurdle in your area, the situation may only be manageable by treating this as a psychological emergency -- which, of course, raises a lot of issues which can be very stressful not only for your husband, but for you, since you'd be acting to save not only his life but to relieve his suffering, while he's placed career concerns first, relief from pain second, and staying alive third. Since this is not a reasonable arrangement, you can expect an unreasonable resistance to intervention, but it really is looking like a choice between emergent intervention (with a possible interruption of career goals) and allowing your husband to place his own life at far more serious risk from the cumulative problems (as opposed to \"just\" CAD).   I hope this is helpful. My short answer would be to re-order things with CAD dropped down to second or third behind suicide prevention and pain management.   Good luck to you both.

    "content": "I'm sorry to read your husband is in so much pain with multiple medical issues he has experenced in the past.  First, is his NIDDM well controlled?  Lack of blood flow to various parts of the body happens with diabetic patients.  when blood flow is limited, pain often results.  Is your husband overweight?  If so, this may amplify his pain that he experiences, regardless of the cause of your husband's pain.  With RA, Average onset of this arthritis is one in their early 40s.  While most frequent in women with RA, that does not mean that your husband does not have RA.    Yes, a blood test for RA, as well as inflammatory markers, such as CRP and WSR should be done, if not already.    A rheumotologist should evaluate your husband, and possibly a nerologist to rule out any muscular abnormalities that may not have been considered yet.  Good luck,  Dan\n\n",

    "content": "I noticed that there are a lot of questions about Lupus, so I thought I would share some general information from the ACR about diagnosing lupus.    There isn\u2019t a definitive test that clearly tells a doctor whether or not a patient has Lupus, there are however, tests that can indicate that Lupus or another autoimmune disease may be a possibility.   Below is some information the ACR put together to help doctors diagnose Lupus.   The American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has developed clinical and laboratory criteria to help physicians diagnose and classify lupus. If you have four of the 11 criteria at one time or individually over time, you most likely have lupus.   Face rash, which doctors call a malar rash, which is butterfly shaped and covers the bridge of the nose and spreads across the cheeks  Scaly rash, which appears as raised, scaly patches  Sun-related rash, which appears after exposure to sunlight  Mouth sores, which are usually painless  Joint pain and swelling that occurs in two or more joints  Swelling of the linings around the lungs or the heart  Kidney disease  A neurological disorder  Low blood counts, such as low red blood count, low platelet count (thrombocytopenia), or a low white cell count (leukopenia)  Positive anti-nuclear antibody tests, which indicate that you may have an autoimmune disease  Other positive blood tests that may indicate an autoimmune disease, such as a positive double-stranded anti-DNA test, positive anti-Sm test, positive anti-phospholipid antibody test or false-positive syphilis test.\n\n",

My docs were concerned about the stress that goes with the job and they thought it would be best if I retire.    I miss the medical world terribly, I started doing in home health care when I was 16 and loved it so much that after I graduated from high school I went to college to become a nurse, it was (and still is) my passion in life.  It has been extremely hard for me to walk away from the medical field, so I thought maybe I could contribute to your forum a little.    My specialty is cardiovascular, but I have become very knowledgeable in other diseases as well, such as chronic inflammatory diseases, strokes and neurology.  Since my husband and I both suffer from these disease I have kind of made myself as much of an expert on these conditions as possible. I guess that is the blessing or curse (however you see it) of being a nurse.  (smile).  I look forward to being here and hope that I can help from time to time.

    "content": "I am a 20 year old hispanic female and the past 4 months have been a roller coaster ride in and out of ER and doctors and there is still no concrete answer as to what is \"wrong\" with me. To make a long story short, I have been suffering from migrating arthalgias without inflammation and generalized musculoskeletal pain for the past 2 months or so and I had other symptoms such as abdominal pain and severe headaches.  The last time I went to the doctor they did a series of tests including: CBC, electrolyte panel, liver function tests, lipid levels, and also immunology tests (RA factor, ANA, Smooth muscle IgG, ASO titer) to check for autoimmune disorders or other possible causes of the symptoms. Also, they did a chest x-ray to check for TB or any acute process of the lung or see any bony changes and also an x-ray of my wrist (the doctor told me to choose ONE joint that I had been experiencing pain to avoid exposing my entire body to more radiation).   All of the tests came back within normal ranges, the x-rays were unremarkable and showed no acute process or abnormalities, and my RF factor was 10, and ANA was negative and IgG was within the normal range. The only thing that came back high was the ASO titer which was at 600 (normal 0-200).  When I returned to my GP he did a throat swab (which I don't know the results) to check for strep throat and said that my symptoms could be due to acute rheumatic fever or post-streptococcal reactive arthritis. He ran tests to determine if there was any heart damage since that is one of the major signs for acute rheumatic fever and said that everything was normal. He prescribed a 10 day antibiotic treatment of Penicillin VK 500 mg BID and referred me to a rheumatologist and I am currently awaiting the approval from my health insurance.  The arthralgias have practically subsided but I have been suffering from generalized muscle ache/pain which is most prominent in my back area, neck, upper buttocks, occipital area, shoulders, arms... BASICALLY EVERYWHERE! I feel as if it could be my tendons, ligaments, not sure...it's just a generalized achy feeling.  I experience abdominal pain when I eat sometimes and I am gassy (im not sure if this has any correlation) but I have a GREAT appetite and no other GI symptoms.    I am really worried! My father passed away from protate CA so I guess I am somewhat traumatized from that experience.   The doctors have reassured me that I am fine and it is just a matter of doing process of elimination but what else could this be? I have thought possibly FM or CFS but I am not sure. Could this be a result of a post-strep infection/rheumatic fever or possibly something else?  I am not requesting a consultation just some guidance or may be advice on what to discuss with my rheumatologist, I will greatly appreciate any input.  Thanks in advance.  ps: my mother has hyperthyroidism, I know that she used to suffer bone pain and generalized malaise before it was Dx but my doc hasn't tested for TSH levels, is this something my rheumatologist can request?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Hopefully by now you've gotten some answers, but for now, let's go with what's here. Your original symptoms certainly were consistent with rheumatic fever, and it was treated appropriately. Since this can sometimes serve as a trigger for FM or reactive arthritis, it is entirely possible this is what's going on now. There is also the potential for some thyroid involvement, at least tangentially, since that gland is often affected by generalized rheumatic inflammation, and the problem also tends to run in families. Your rheumatologist certainly could order a TSH test, if, of course, he is inclined to go that route. It would be interesting to see what, if anything, that were to show.   Meanwhile, I'm afraid the idea of a process of elimination is probably the only realistic approach, along, of course, with appropriate treatment of the symptoms to keep you comfortable until  this is either diagnosed or has run its course.  If there is anything new, please update us. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

After the penicillin tx they have somewhat reduced in size EXCEPT for the lymph node below my ear (on both sides) is still about 1-1.5 cm and is pretty hard and continues to be painful. Recently Ive been having a sore throat again and the area under my jaw feel tender. ALSO, i've been suffering from tinnitus & ear ache and I feel pea sized lymph nodes behind my right ear.   Could this be caused by the same streptococcal infection? I believe my GP will perform serial ASO titers when I go to my appt next week but just so I can have an idea because I am terrified of lymphoma/cancer.

    "content": "Hi again -  You're very welcome!  Well, oddly, for some reason, at least in my experience, those parotid glands that lie in the hollow beneath each ear seem to take a lot longer to normalize after an infection than the others do. I have no idea why this might be, except that there may be some anomaly in the design of the way they drain. At any rate this seems to be a pretty common complaint/concern, but seems to be normal.  Given that you also find enlarged nodes behind one ear and continue to have some ENT symptoms, you may have a stubborn or recurrent infection, and if that's the case it's most likely something holed up in your sinuses, which is where these kinds of bacteria find wonderful hiding places and breeding grounds and sometimes become a chronic annoyance. Your history would argue in favor of this sort of problem, with perhaps some swollen turbinates or polyps having formed somewhere up in the upper nasopharynx, which can contribute to poor sinus drainage and recurrent infections. Sometimes these can be found on thorough examination and removed, with dramatic results. Sometimes the subject just has to deal with each infection as it develops, but there are constantly more and better approaches to treating these problems, so I'd be pretty optimistic about the eventual outcome.  I understand your concerns regarding lymphoma/cancer, but the likelihood of that, given the history, is pretty slim when weighed against the likelihood of chronic sinus drainage problems. Your ENT specialist should know about this concern (if he doesn't already), so he can help put your mind at ease about it.   Good luck to you, and please let us know how your appointment goes.\n\n",

He says that given my history and because I didn't have any other accompanying symptoms of weight loss he didn't think it was anything bad but rather reactive lymph nodes of a previous infection/chronic infection. I have still been experiencing some right ear pain every so often and have congestion, and my lymph nodes become tender every now and then.

    "content": "Hello,  The symptoms and problems you describe fit entirely with MCTD, which could involve the criteria for SLE as part of the overall diagnostic picture.  The memory issues and fatigue are very much a known part of your diagnosis, so I'm not sure why your physicians would doubt you.  It's important that you receive appropriate treatment to prevent progression of your symptoms.  Is there a major medical center within a reasonable distance?   If so, seek an appointment with both Dermatology and Rhematology.  Your experience in having to convince your doctors of the reality of your symptoms is common with your type of diagnosis.  If you are able to attend a Lupus support group (which normally include all autoimmune conditions, not just Lupus), it would probably be very helpful.  The other members have very likely experienced exactly what you are going through with your physicians, and they can clue you in to the best diagnosticians and treatment providers.  If there is not one in your area, join one online.  I encourage you to try memory improvement through puzzles, crosswords, learning a new language, etc.  These have proven to be very helpful, even in profound memory-related diagnoses such as Alzheimer's Disease.  It's an unfortunate reality that you have to deal with finding resources when you least feel up to it.    Good luck to you,  Faye, RN, MSw\n\n",

Questions are: Should milkthistle be added to protect the liver? and What OTC B vitamins can replace Folgard?  Milk thistle in some studies has lowered AST and ALT  (liver enzymes) levels.  Studies are inconclusion about living disease prevention.  Side effect profile is limited to mild symptoms (GI upset, headache, rash...occasionally arthralgia).  So, unless your liver enzymes are elevated, you could hold off on the milk thistle.   Folgard contain 0.8 mg folic acid, 115mcg cyanocobalamin (B12), and 10mg pyridoxine hcl (B6).  So you should be able to find some OTC preparations combined or individually which amounts to Folgard.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thank you for your response. To update....  I have been to the Rhuematologists.  X-rays shown increase joint deterioration in my hands and ankles. General function is fine. The stiffness doesn't go away anymore though.  Liver enzymes are Ok. I did go ahead and start the milk thistle. The doctor is aware of this but sees no issue up or down because of it.   I am on my first month of Humira + 5 tabs of methotrexate.  The Humira is 1 injection every 2 weeks. The methotrexate is 5 tabs per week. I take 3 one day and 2 the next day per the doctor.   I started a new job this past week. I may not be able to stay there. It is VERY physical. My hands are really taking a beating. My ankles are good till the last hour. By the end of the shift I can barely walk.  For my ankles specifically I have been using a product called bio-freeze. I massage it in after work. Wow... what a relief... :)  I am concerned about the heavy physical nature of my new job though. I don't know if \"work\" aggravates the RA or if I am just not used to real work and will adjust...  I guess the humira will take a while to kick in. If I don't feel better next week, I will start a round of Prednisone. I hate that stuff, but it works...   I am trying to weigh the work thing with the possibility I am just having a flare... Did the work cause it? I don't know.\n\n",

If I am suspecting lymphoma,  I may expect anemia, low platelet count, high WBC count with reduced lymphocytes however CBC can vary and normal does not rule out lymphoma.    Of note will be other clinical data:     *night sweats, fever, weight loss,     *size (node larger than 1cm shoud be biopsied), character (benign appearing nodes are soft and freely mobile...watch for immobile, hard, painless, or firm rubbery nodes.), number, and location of lymph nodes (e.g. supraclavicular lymphadenopathy raises a large red flag for malignancy)    *family history     *history of RA or SLE which may associate with lymphoma    *other risk factors: hx of Crohn's disease, chronic H.pylori + gastritis, celiac disease  Also consider any history of skin cancer on the face.   Lupus can cause generalized lymphadenopathy especially in the cervical area.  Node size and tenderness may vary depending on the state of the lupus.  I'll send a copy of note to oncology for any thoughts about screening for malignacy.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Many times chronically swollen lymph nodes are just post-infectious consequences. After a viral / bacterial infection some nodes remain larger than normal. These are usually in the range of 1 cm, 2 cms at the most.   If however, you are absolutely sure some of these nodes are growing in size then you must report to the doctor immediately.   Lymphoma tends to be broken up according to its degree of aggressiveness into an indolent and an aggressive type. Indolent types grow over the course of years and have a milder disease course.  As Dr. Yasmin mentioned if on clinical exam the doctor feels there is suspicion of lymphoma the only way would be to biopsy one of the lymph nodes.  Good luck and keep us updated!\n\n",

Neg for thyroid problems.  Elevated Sed rate.   Just had more labs drawn..no results yet.  Could I have Lupus with a negative ANA?  And if I had labs when not in a flare, could the ANA or rheumatoid panel be a negative?  Or could I have rheumatoid with a neg rheumatoid panel?    The doctor keeps looking at me and saying \"scleroderma\" because of the appearance of my hands.  Don't have many symptoms of scleroderma at all. Do have occasional swallowing difficulties where I choke on liquids which is becoming more common.  Thanks so much, Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  The hands (ulnar drift) and morning stiffness sound a lot like rheumatoid arthritis while the multisystem problems bring the possiblity of lupus closer to the forefront.  Some SLE and RA patients have negative labs findings but the sensitivity of ANA for lupus is 98 or 99% so a low false negative rate.  For RA, the RF sensitivity is low but gradually increases as the disease progresses.  Adding anti-CCP to RF raises sensitivity but still can get many false negatives.   It usually recommended to also check CBC, CRP, and sed rate.  May look at hand xrays too - for diagnostic and treatment reasons.    From your report, I think RA should be considered and possibility of concomitant connective tissue disorder or neurological problem (especially condidering the loss of congnition, fasciculations in the arms, weakness, etc.).  I think an EMG, MRI of the neck and brain would be wise.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "For 8 years now, I have  been experiencing lots of symptoms.   The first \"flare\" that I had started after a moderate sunburn and lasted about 2 months.  It consisted of muscle pain, muscle cramps and spasms, and severe fatigue.  Also, during that time I broke out in hives on two different occasions.   Exercise or even just mild exertion triggered the muscle cramps and spasms.  They didn't occur during exercise, but afterwards, during rest.        The flares now last about 2-4 weeks, with a period of feeling better in between them of about 6-8 weeks.  I have a previous diagnosis of neurocardiogenic syndrome that I have a pacemaker for and also type 1 diabetes, proven to be autoimmune related due to the fast onset, proven by a normal HbA1c at the time it was diagnosed.   About 5 years ago, my endocrinologist discovered that my alkaline phosphatase was elevated.  He ordered a bone scan which showed evidence of mild arthritis.  My endocrinologist didn't feel that explained the severity of the elevation.  My ALP is still elevated, but not as high as it was.  I also have a goiter, but my endocrinologist says it is \"inactive\", and my thyroid testing is normal.       Any exercise or even a little extra exertion of any type still triggers the muscle spasms and cramps.  If I over-do it, my muscles (mostly in my thighs and/or calves) will spasm and cramp, which sometimes results in my muscles balling up in large, hard knots.   Occasionally I will have bouts of running a low grade fever for no apparent reason.  My lymph glands in my neck and also in my groin sometimes swell.  I have extremely dry hands and feet (to the point where my skin will crack and sometimes bleed).  I often have a  mottled, bluish rash on my legs, as well as keratosis pilaris.   I also get a rash on my scalp that is scaly and causes some hair loss.       Obviously, I have been experiencing a lot in the past 8 years.  I have been to several neurologists, none of which knew what was wrong.  I have had a lumbar puncture to rule out MS.  My ANA and RA are always negative, and my SED rate is always normal.  My doctor now feels that this is more than likely an autoimmune disorder that is rheumatologically based.  Is that possible with all of my negative testing?  Thank you for your time!-                                                                                        Hayli\n\n",

    "content": "I have had several blood panels done two checked my ANA and it was positive with borderline titers. I have been diagnosed with Raynauds syndrome two years ago. I have been struggling with severe abdominal pain the last two years. My first colonoscopy was performed two years ago and a biopsy was performed of my small bowel showing slight inflamation throughout the region. My second colonoscopy was done 12-23-2008 due to the localised pain one inch to the direct right of my belly button. The pain is just like a knife is in that spot, very localised. The most recent colonoscopy showed a normal mucosa with normal random biopsies. But when the doctor attempted to get near my small bowel opening the small bowel began to spasm so bad she couldn't get the biopsy. After the procedure she put me on two anti-spasmatic medicines. They worked for about a week and the pain came back even worse then before. My diet doesn't affect the pain. Nothing makes it better. I will be having a small bowel x-ray in a week to see if they can find anything that way. I was given more pain killers yesterday at my follow up appointment. I would like someone just to listen to my story and want to help find me answers. I don't know if this is related but I am finding that I am unable to lose weight. I gained 12 lbs in one month and I consume no more then 2,000 calories a day. I eat very healthy no fast food my biggest food sin is diet soda. A month ago I reduced my calorie intake to 1,700 and added prescription Xenical. I do cardio 40 min. 3-4 times a week with no weight training so I know my lack of weight loss isn't due to muscle gain. I am 5'9'' and 180lbs. One year ago I was 159lbs. I am slipping into a deep depression due to this weight change and pain I'm experiencing. I am barely 21 years old and I suffer everyday with this horrible pain. Please someone I beg you to take the time to read my story and health history and tell me if you can help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  A marginally positive ANA commonly occurs in the general population so this lab alone does not diagnose lupus.   There can be an association of lupus with Raynauds...again just another piece to the diagnostic puzzle.   If we are thinking lupus as a diagnosis, some GI manifestations include peritonitis (inflammation or infection of the abdominal wall), ischemic vasculitis, and diarrhea producing enteropathy which causes loss of protein.  Weight gain can occur with lupus if the kidney cause loss of protein (nephrotic syndrome) or with enteropathy. Your family physician may do a complete review of system including questions about skin rashes, hair loss or hair growth, joint inflammation, chest pain, shortness of breath, etc.  He may also consider an abdominal CT, further labs like urine analysis with microscopic exam and a 24 hour urine collection checking level of free cortisol and protein.   With the weight gain, problems with thyroid or adrenal gland should be explored.    Regarding bowel spasm, some patients have found peppermint oil (in tea or capsule) to ease irritable bowel.  Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

Untreated with will last about a week until the skin dies and peels off, however it is painful swollen and the inflammation prevents movement.  My GP has ruled out an infection which was my first thought with the cold.  This last instance, the Doctor treated me with Prednisone and the inflammation has reduced in a day, and now at 3 days the skin is dying and peeling.  The GP's initial thoughts were a strange presentation of Gout due to \"slightly raised Uric acid levels\", however there is no direct joint discomfort, the pain is coming purely from the inflammed skin.  This only happens on my right index finger and only when my immune system seems to be fighting something else.  I have had the finger x-rayed and it showed \"no abnormalities\" and I am waiting on other blood tests.  Does anyone have a suggestion about where to look next.  While not life threatening this condition does cause me concern.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thank you for writing in.  You have reported a painful swollen index finger with desquamation.  Symptoms start with flu or cold symptoms and last a week.  Symptoms decrease with prednisone.   I agree that this is an odd presentation.  My differential diagnosis would include: - small vessel vasculitis (I would expect more than one finger to be involved) - Raynauds (I would expect both hands to be involved) - gout - desquamation secondary to viral illness.  The reason for the latter diagnosis is that some viral illnesses cause rash and some viral illnesses localize the red, swollen skin to the hand (eg Kawasaki disease).  Although Kawasaki disease occurs in children, the mechanism may be similar - ie a viral illness causing desquamation.  Why this happens is unknown.    Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "title": "Positive ANA test... Negative retest. Very confused.",
    "content": "Hello. I am a 20 yr old female and have a quick question. At school about two months ago, i got a bug bite (probably mosquito) on my foot, and it started itching terribly. I began to scratch it and saw a little bite mark and figured it was just a normal mosquito bite. Soon, it began to swell up and there was quite some inflammation. The next day, the swelling had reached my ankle and i went to my doctor. He performed an ANA test and it came out positive. He said that this might have been due to the infection/ inflammation from the bite, so he retested after the swelling went down, and it came out negative. What does this mean? Is it posible for ANA to come out positive from the type of infection that was on my foot? ANy help would be EXTREMELY appreciated. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While many -- perhaps most -- medical tests can have a false negative but rarely a false positive, there are some that have the  opposite problem, and ANA testing is one of those, mainly because it's not designed to uncover a specific disease or condition. The fact that you had an acute inflammatory process going on in your body (specifically your foot) when the test was done very likely threw the result off. Now that that's resolved you're coming up negative. It seems entirely likely the test was positive because of the rather severe reaction you'd had.   Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you. Follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your questions.  Regarding the lab work: the ESR and CRP are non specific markers for an inflammation process.  They help monitor progression/regression of inflammatory disease (eg lupus, RA, gout) but limited use in diagnostics.    Besides rheumatoid factor, ANA and anti-CCP are two antibody blood tests that help with diagnosing RA.    Clinically, we look for multiple small joint arthritis in the hands and feet.  We look for symmetrical involvement vs just one side of the body affected.  Any morning joint stiffness lasting for more than one hour.  Xrays or the hands and feet are also important.  Finally, are there any nodules under the skin near the arthritic joints.  This is not to say that the RA can not be in the elbow or knees but usually attack the smaller joints.   DMARDS stands for disease modifying anti-rheumatic drugs.  These include methotrexate, Plaquinil, sulfasalazine and others.  If the diagnosis of RA is made, it is important to see a rheumatologist to consider DMARDS.  Early intervention may prevent bony erosions in the joints and stop the RA disease.    Each medicine has its own unique profile (risks and benefits) and should be discussed with the physician prior to starting.    All the best to you.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Certainly tendonitis can cause the elbow pain you have described especially with repetitive or strong action.   The most common tendonitis is lateral epicondylitis (tennis elbow).  Tenderness is located on the outer aspect of the elbow.  Gripping and many hand grasping maneuvers aggravate the pain. Treatment includes ice, rest, NSAIDS, and gentle stretching and strengthening exercise.  Tennis elbow brace helps.  For chronic tendonitis alternating heat and ice packs helps.  Having a physician or orthopedist evaluate the elbow would help clarify the diagnosis.    Let us know how it goes.\n\n",

The range was 0-14...mine was 14. Doctor suggested that I should repeat it in a few months. Now its 17, even higher.  I had the following test done:  ANA: Normal ACA: Normal Sjogrens: Normal ESR: Normal CBC & WBC: All normal Cholesterol: All normal  Ive also had an EMG for muscle twitches: Normal The only thing that came back abnormal was my CRP: Slightly high (was on birth control) at the time.  My grandmother had sever Rheumatoid Arthritis in her hands.  Does my RA factor level mean that I will have it too?  I am currently being evaluated for MS. Doctors feel I don't have it but MRI said \"suggestion of demyelination but not specific\"  What do you think if causing my high RA factor? Im only on vitamins no medication at all.  I understand that I have to see a rheumatologist to be fully evaluated but I do appreciate any insight.  Thank you!\n\n",

Any repetitive hand and forearm motion can cause inflammation of the forearm muscle's tendonous insertion onto the epicondyle of the distal humerus.   Epicondylitis can be either medial (golfers elbow) or lateral (tennis elbow)... or both.    Treatment includes rest, ice, compression.  Gradual return to activity.  Forearm strap/brace.  Sometimes corticosteroid injection at the epicondyle.    Hope this helps.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I hope you can help with this question. My doc found protein in a routine urine test 10 months ago. I have repeated the tests, had ultrasounds, and a 6 month follow up with no change. I went to a Nephrologist, who repeated all the tests, albumin in urine is up form 10 to 18.3 now. He said the kidneys were fine, and mentioned that the rheumatoid factor serum came back High. the complement c3 is 1.98. All other blood work came back fine, and low blood pressure. I am seeing a urologist in a couple of weeks for a prolapse bladder and overactive bladder.  I am concerned about the back pain I have had for almost a year now. When I get up in the morning, my back is very tight, and takes about 15-20 minutes to loosen up and straighten out. Very painful. Same thing if I lay flat on my back or stomach even for a few minutes. If I twist the wrong way while lying down, feels like my back is locked, and have to get up and straighten out (same as when you get a toe cramp). I slipped in the stairs 2 years ago and bruised my tail-bone. 8 years ago my doc mentioned I had mild scoliosis.    I am only 27, active, otherwise healthy and would love to get this whole thing resolved. Can the back pain, and abnormal blood work be connected?  thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HI complement C3, back pain, albuminuria",
    "content": "Thanks for writing in and sorry about the delay. Main information given was proteinuria, high complement (c3) level, and low back pain with morning stiffness.  Any connection between the three?   One of several causes of proteinuria is systemic lupus erythematosis which can present with arthritc pain.  This more often occurs in women.  May present with fatigue, muscle aches, rash (eg butterfly rash on the face). The eyes, heart, lungs, brain, and musculoskeletal system may also be involved.  Some labs like ANA and anti-CCP would help.  I would suppose a low complement count to be more indicative of autoimmune disorder.    A high complement level with low back pain and stiffness may be assosciated with an inflammatory condition.  In a young man with low back morning stiffness, worse with inactivity, anklyosing spondilytis (AS) should be considered. Occurs in young men. This condition should improve with activity.  Pelvic xray may help see inflamatory changes in the sacroiliac joints (sacroilitis). Probably want lumbar xray too.  A late finding would be the \"bamboo\" looking spine. May also check sed rate and crp as inflamatory markers.  If indeed this in AS, spinal extension exercise, walking and NSAID are indicated.    Scoliosis (a lateral curvature of the spine) could cause back pain.  Depends on the severity of the curve.  Hitting one's tailbone hurts initially but shouldn't cause this amount of pain in the back.    Kidney problems can potentially cause low back pain but probably are not connected with a high complement count unless something else (inflammatory) is going on.  All the best to you.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

Yesterday, I finally felt good, then today after work, the pains came back. the pains aren't intolerable, because it isn't persistent. the fatigue has me feeling almost flu-ish, and have a hard time with daily functions. I went for some more blood work, with all Rheumatic factors, and waiting for results. Protein is still elevated, been almost a full year now, and she feels it isn't connected to the back pains (still there), and now these new pains. Dr. seems to think it might be fibromyalgia, but needs to rule out MS, and other conditions.  You mentioned Systemic Lupus, sounds pretty likely, but no rash on my face, actually my face is the clearest it's ever been.lol . Would Lupus show up on routine blood work, or with the Rheumatic markers? I am waiting to see a Rheumatologist, could be a few months.  Thanks again for your help. I'll post results once they are in.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I have had pain and swelling in my left armpit for a month now. I describe it as if I had been squeezing a tennis ball under my armpit all day and have finally let it go.  The skin doesn't hurt and my pectorial muscle isn't sore.  At first I thought it was an injury from working out, but I haven't worked out in weeks and had been on the same routine since May without adding any weight.  I was concerned because I'm 27 and have high blood pressure (usually 140 over 98) and a family history of breast cancer.  I went to my doctor a few days ago and was told that my lymph nodes aren't swollen but there is definately fluid build up in my armpit.  My armpit is now twice the size it should be. She said the tingling in my hands isn't due to a circulation problem (so probably not a blood clot) and told me to take ibuprofin for pain and that was it.  No tests.  The pain is not excruciating but bothersome and annoying after a month of it.  I don't know what to do.  I've done heating pads, ice packs, and warm washcloths in plastic but none of it helps.  I don't want to be eating aspirin like candy.  Is there anything I can do as a home remedy?  Any idea what could cause this?\n\n",

    "content": "I started having joint pain and fatigue over 6 years ago. I have a broad diagnosis of UCTD. The majority of my labs are negative (ANA, RA, complement studies, anti ds DNA, lyme titer, etc.). My ESR is around 50-60 without meds, with current meds it has been around 20. I also have a beta band on SPEP. I am 26/F, nursing student, and work part time. I have experienced worsening symptoms, with minimal releif from current medications. I take ibuprofen and ultram ATC most days. I started on the sulfasalazine and was told to stop the plaquenil if the sulfasalzinie worked. I did and about 2-3 weeks later my symptoms worsed with extreme fatigue, oral ulcers (about 1 x month) and vaginal ulcers (3rd time for the vaginal ulcers in about 4 years), and increasing joint pain. I also have pain in what my rhemie calls my SI joint that started about 6 months ago. I also was told I have glaucoma in my left eye after recent follow up for the plaquenil. Also have dry eyes. MDs are pretty sure its autoimmune but I am pretty much in diagnosis limbo. The rhemie mentions things like ankylosing spondylitis, psoratic arthritis, etc. each time I vist but he really isn't sure what is going on. What medications can I ask for to help relieve my symptoms? I am sure my liver and kidneys are suffering from the tylenol and motrin I have been taking for the past 6 years. I really feel like my symptoms are progressively getting worse over the past 6 years. With the recent SI/hip pain I am a little worried about not being able to function normally. If I work more than 3 days in a row I start to limp from the increased activity. I understand there is no miracle drug to cure this, but am I out of line to ask to start on Enbrel or Humira? Is there something else that I can suggest? And what are the risks of continuing working in the hospital while on an immunosuppressant? Thank you in advance!\n\n",

Of course risks versus benefit should be weighed when deciding on these medicines.   With methotrexate, CBC is monitored monthly as well as kidney function.  Methotrexate use will place you in the immunocompromised risk category so acute illnesses will warranted closer monitoring and attentiveness to treatment.   Depending on what patient population (eg acute hospital care vs outpatient orthopedics) you work with as a nurse will determine whether autoimmune suppression therapy will affect your job.  What kind of beta band showed on the SPEP - number 1 or 2?  Let us know if you have any more questions and keep us posted on how things go. Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for all your info Tom. The band on the spep was just a beta band. The alpha shows 1 or 2 (both norm). Not sure if you were thinking of that or maybe this test wasnt that specific? I had a trial of the pred for about 2 weeks. It helped with the fatigue but not the joint pains. I should think about trying it again though. That was about 4-5 years ago when all this started. I just hate to think of the side effects of long term steroids and it also works as an immunosuppresant so we are back on the same boat of suseptability.  I work in an acute care hospital, with about 200 beds. I am on a cardiac/med-surg unit so we get a little of everything. Thats what worries me about going on some sort of immunosuppresant. I was questioning the shots because I hate having to remember to take the pills all the time. A shot 1 x week would be so much easier! I wasnt sure if the TNF blockers are considered \"stronger\" than mtx. I will have to sit down with my rhemie and talk about all this. He is a great doc but he has only been practicing rhematology for about 2 years. Great because he's fresh out of school and has new training, but I can also tell he is inexperienced. He actually told me that people with RA and Lupus, if they just take their pills they will feel fine! Apparently there are magical pills he is neglecting to prescribe me.... He also said that weather doesnt affect joint pain/swelling..... Tell that to the 90 year olds that come in that don't know there is a storm coming but know their knee hurts! So I am hoping with experience will come a little more knowledge for him. I think he is still going by what his med books say and not by what his patients are telling him. I really do like him, and he explains things great and listens pretty well. Thank you again for your advice. Melissa\n\n",

    "content": "For three years I have been to  specialists and have worked my way through referral to a rheumatologist.  My main complaints are cramping and hyper-toned muscles, muscle spasms, exercise intolerance, pain due to these and also minor soft tissue injuries, some fasciculations and sleep disturbances.  The orthopedists and PT's treated my various injuries, my GP found no pertinent abnormalities in my blood chemistry, my neurologist found 2 ruptured discs that seem to have healed and said I have Cramp Fasisculation syndrome and it would stabilize and abate (it didn't), and the rheumatologist found a few areas of osteoarthritis and DDD but I still have what started all the initial complaints and problems. He suggests that I see yet another neurologist (I've been to 2) to get a biopsy.  So who do I see to get tested for a metabolic myopathy?  The endocrinologists thought I should see the rheumatologist and now he is sending me on again.  Sometimes I get the feeling that they don't really know what to do with me other than write a Rx. I have been given many drugs, some of which helped the symptoms but caused other problems making it difficult to work so I am taking NSAIDS for pain now.   It seems to me that my stressed muscles are causing much of this. A major problem is that I am not able to exercise due to the pain and injuries and this is impacting my overall health (high cholesterol for one).  Who normally does muscle biopsies?  Suggestions are welcome.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry about the delayed response. Your case is a complicated one.  The main differential, in general, is Peripheral nerve hyperexcitability (PNH) which entails a spectrum of diseases or may be labeled as cramp fascicular syndrome or myotonic disorder and metabolic myopathy.   The basic mechanisms of each diagnoses are different.  In PNH, auto immunity must be ruled out whereas in metabolic myopathy enzyme deficiencies should be ruled out. Key diagnostic tests include EMG, muscle biopsy, CPK, CBC.  Perhaps electrolyte panel. (a muscle biopsy which is a minor in-office procedure certainly can be done by a general surgeon and depending on experience GP may do one) Also, for metabolic myopathy a test called forearm ischemia exercise test can be done.  This messures the levels of lactic acid and ammonia in the blood before and after exercise to see if the muscles are able to use glucose and fats as their energy source.  In metabolic myopathy, the problem is the body's inability to use either glucose or fat for motor activation.   The treatment for PNH includes anti convulsants or immune suppressants... therefore neurology or rheumatology respectively are appropriate. Seeing that rheumatology, endocrinology, and neurology are already involved, it is reasonable to expect the family physician to serve a main person to bring all the test results into a collective picture and attempt to coordinate care.   Again the key question is: Is this metabolic myopathy (enzyme deficiency) or is it an autoimmune problem.  ps Let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.  Yes, I agree that my case is difficult in that I seem to be lodged between specialists.  I have not yet gone for any additional testing as I wanted to try exercising again to see what happened plus I do not like the idea of open-ended testing.  Where my symptoms had lessened quite a bit while I was sedentary, they came back as soon as I became more physically active.  It is not a normal soreness that one would get from working out or over-doing it; it occurs much more quickly after the activity - sometimes during it - and tapers off from the time of muscle use onward unlike normal muscle soreness.  Plus there is an inordinate amount of strain on my joints because the muscles stay tight for a long time.  However, I am still not able to find one person who will run these tests that you mentioned.  The nuero-mucular specialist, if he decides to see me as he makes you do a questionnaire first, will do the muscle biopsy - I have no idea who would do the forearm ischemic exercise test yet.  I really need one person to be 'at the helm' so I can stop this shuffling as it is getting me nowhere.  My GP will do none of these as she feels that they are best handled by a specialist & I've put in a call to my neurologist to see if he has any insights but have not heard from him yet.  He usually gets back to me but it may take making another appointment.  Isn't there some field - physiology, kinesiology, that would deal with this type of malady? Any ideas?\n\n",

This seems the best bet for me as all standard blood chemistries, neurological clinicals and EMG have come up close to normal to show that I am not neurologically, immunologically, or endocrine impaired.  Since the rheumatoid specialist thinks I should investigate a metabolic problem, and I don't want to medicate myself into oblivion, it seems the only avenue left outside of a sedentary lifestyle.  Perhaps since physiatrists are involved in rehab they will be more inclined to understand my need to be physically active rather than sedentary (even though this enables me to be relatively pain-free).  I will write you with an update when test results and examinations are concluded.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with SLE several months ago (athletic female in early 20s) and currently am not on any steroid treatment, only Plaquinil. Today I experienced a gradual increase in swelling all over my body, starting in my legs and eventually extending into my face, lips, neck lymph nodes, etc. The edema in my lower legs was so bad I could hardly walk. I'm not allergic to anything and it was a very gradual onset over the course of the day. I'm not able to see my Dr. until after the New Year so I'm highly curious what's going on and if it's possibly just one of those mysterious Lupus symptoms that will pass. I haven't checked my blood pressure, but I generally run fairly low due to my activity levels...so I am quite sure it's not hypertension related.\n\n",

    "content": "This may be a flare of the lupus.    Moreover, this edema may be caused by nephrosis (abnormality of the kidney characterized by protein in urine >3.5 grams/day, hypertension and swelling):  I would check routine urine analysis, the 24 urine sample for protein, serum for albumin levels, and check for high blood pressure.    Secondary, examine the joints for arthritis (warmth, swelling, pain).  Generalized edema is not an adverse effect of Plaquinil.  Your physician will discuss treatment options.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

It started when I lifted 20kg bag an year ago, It initially started basically in the pelvic region, with very painful menstrual cycles, then it spread to the left thigh, gradually to left hip as well. now i don't have any pelvic pain but for last 5 months it has spread to the left shoulder and severe chest pain. It is increasing with the passage of time. I consulted my doctor and have undergone pelvic ultrasound, and left scan, blood test, but the results were clear. Nowadays i am constantly having this pain, intensity varies though. it even hurts if left thigh and hip touches any surface, and sitting causes very severe pain. Chest pain seem like that caused by heart attack and is very intense. I was referred to physiotherapist who didnt seem to understand my problem after detailed examination. My doctor is confused and ask me to exercise, but its been a long time nothing seem to work with this pain. it is increasing and spreading continuously. Now i don't know who to consult for this problem? Should i go to rheumatology, pediatrics or neurology?\n\n",

    "content": "Some other testing and history may be helpful.  Regarding the chest pain, it is important to discuss with physician your risk of heat attack: age, blood pressure, diabetes, family history, smoker, weight, cholesterol level.  Physician may order a stress test or echocardiogram.    Otherwise, may consider MRI of the pelvis and lumber spine...since the initial pain and injury was related to the lumbar spine or the pelvic area.  In many ways, your condition sounds musculoskeletal in origin and related to the back issues.     Hip pain that is painful to touch reminds me of trochanteric bursitis.  This would respond to NSAIDS, ice, and steroid injection if needed.    Family physician should be able to take care of initial testing, sorting through these things and referral as needed.

    "title": "Severe muscle pain during colonoscopy prep",
    "content": "Thank you for the opportunity to ask my question. For five years on and off I have experienced unexplainable pains throughout my body. They originate in either my shoulder blades, hips, calves or thighs and radiate. The only way I can describe the pain is as a pulling pain that feels like when I was a child and I had \"growing pains.\" The pain is not usually severe; but it is persistent, sometimes lasting nearly a week without reprieve and then it will suddenly go away. No medicine, exercise or posture change will alleviate it. However, movement is often more tolerable than sitting or lying still when I have the pain. I can have it in one of the areas described only, or several at the same time. In the past I have attributed the pain to various dietary issues - sugar, aspartame, etc. but eliminating these never seems to do the trick. I thought it only occurred when I was sedentary but I am very active now and it still occurs occasionally. Happily, in addition to not being severe, the pain is also not regular and I am without it much more than I am with it.   My gastrointerologist scheduled me for a colonoscopy after symptoms of my previously diagnosed small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO) resurfaced a few months after treatment. When I began the prep for the procedure the day before I had the pain that I described above, but it was very minor and only in my left calf. I began to drink the Golytely solution and about an hour into drinking the pain intensified and spread to all of the areas I mentioned so I was effectively in pain from my shoulders to my ankles. It was excruciating. Only my torso and arms were not in pain. The pain lasted through the night and into the next day and until I was put out for the procedure. My gastro suggested dehydration. He told me he would give me electrolytes to drink after the procedure but I think he and I (being anesthetized) forgot. I left with no pain, but the anesthesia wore off and the pain came back. My husband had to walk me screaming and crying to our nearby health center. The doctor who saw me in urgent care was dismissive. I explained about the procedure and my gastro's suggestion of dehydration. She said that I could not possibly be in such pain from dehydration. She asked about stress at home and made me an appointment with a neurologist and a urologist and sent me home. After the doctor sent me away, the nurse pulled me aside and told me that I was most likely suffering from an electrolyte deficiency and to go home and drink water. I am fairly sure that he was right. I looked up my symptoms after they went away and assumed that I might have had mild hypokalemia. I drank electrolyte water and I also ate potatoes, which I do not usually eat as I keep a low carb diet to manage my SIBO symptoms.   When I saw the neurologist he expressed concern that the urgent care doctor did not test me for serum calcium, serum magnesium, and phosphorous. He also ordered a thyroid panel, Chem 24 and ESR (SED-RATE) However, he thought that having me take any of these tests would be useless if I was not presenting with symptoms. So we are waiting until the pain comes back and then I will go in for the lab work. Of course I do not want the pain to come back at all and I am afraid we missed a unique window of opportunity to find out if there is a preventable solution to avoiding this pain again. Is there any reason why the original doctor did not perform any tests and is the neurologist correct in setting me up with so many labs? Are there any other tests that I should ask for when I see a doctor who isn't dismissive? Thank you.\n\n",

Doing electrolyte count, thyroid screen, and sed rate are all indicated.  And I can see the reasoning behind doing the electrolyte and sed rate count during time of pain.    I would also add CPK (increase with inflammatory muscle conditions), ANA and rheumatoid factor.  Do you have any muscle weakness, skin rashes, dry eyes, joint pain or inflammation?  Any history of blood clots?  Fever?  Weight changes?  Fast heart rate?  Fluttering of the heart?  Review of medicine is important e.g any statin drug use to treat high cholesterol.

I would like to know specifically where the pain is located (e.g. in or around a specific joint vs in the muscles or tendons) and does weight bearing make it worse.  Crutches may be needed until the limb heals.  It is also important to consider:past trauma, any past medical history (diabetes, osteoporosis, circulation problems in the legs, arthritis), past surgeries; any response to hot or cold packs, acetominophen or ibuprofen; any use of splints or Ace wraps.   Did the local clinician offer any suggestions of a diagnosis of sprain or strain and how to treat it.   Many non fracture post traumatic injuries in a limb are disagnosed as a strain or sprain and treated accordingly. Keep us updated on how things have gone.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your patience. First, for chronic migraine headaces. It is important to assess medications that may cause rebound (e.g Fioricet or triptans).  Then look at triggers especially food and medication (eg caffeine, chocolate, MSG, nitrates/nitrites in food). Then consider prophylactic medications.   Unexpected weight loss is a concern.  Have your family physician do a complete history and physical.  A CT of head may be warranted.   Throbbing arm and hand pain could stem from Raynauds.  Use caution with some medicine for Raynaud like topical nitro cream as these can trigger migraine.  Is this the same arm as the rotator cuff repair? The VMA in urine is checking for pheochromocytoma which is caused by a tumor on the adrenal gland.  Classic findings include headache, high blood pressure or fluctuating BP, excessive sweating, heart palpitions, hyperglycemia, and hypermetabolism (which would include weight loss).  Other testing includes 24 hour urine and/or plasma metanephrines; CT or MRI of the abdomen...adrenal glands which are found on top of kidneys.   Again follow up with family physician is important to sift through these signs and symptoms. Let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "My partner is 46, male, and has always been in good health.  Since June of 2007 though, his mobility and sense of well-being have been deteriorating consistently.  Several tests have been done, medications and other treatments have been attempted, all without success or a firm diagnosis.  His doctors do not seem to be very proactive in trying to investigate the cause for the symptoms so that they can be treated accordingly.  We are trying to find someone who can help point us in the direction of the proper specialist to consult so that we can finally begin to learn what is really going on and obtain the proper treatment.  Here is a summary of the symptoms:  Tightness/stiffness in hands - back of hands and tops of feet - a feeling that the muscles/tissues are not stretching as they should for movement Extremely tight hamstrings - they do not stretch as necessary for movement Overall tightness and stiffness in legs with pain in the muscles NO pain in the joints of fingers, legs, or feet Joint pain does occur in the knees when he takes stairs, to be expected Lower back pain  The tightness is usually worse in the morning, however it does not ever subside completely, and muscle pain is present most of the time day or night.  Several years ago he began experiencing symptoms of gout, for which labs confirmed high uric acid levels.  An anti-inflammatory would usually relieve the pain when he had an attack until last year.  That is when he first sought treatment; received x-rays on his feet and blood work revealed uric acid level was high (9.0+).  He was referred to a rheumatologist who prescribed colchizine to knock it out, then on a regular dose of allopurinol.  His uric acid was tested again in the fall and it was down to normal levels and the allopurinol discontinued.  However, by this time, even though the gouty symptoms in his feed had subsided, he was suffering from widespread symptoms - those listed above.  He was tested for RA and it was negative; the doctor did not seem to think he had any osteoarthritis either. (no x-rays were specifically done to check, and there is not any pain in his joints, per se) No more blood work was done and the rheumatologist seemed unconcerned.  After a few more months of suffering from pain and tightness that was increasing, my partner again contacted the rheumatologist, who had labs done to test Vitamin D levels.  Although we did not see the results, he said that it was low and prescribed an 8-week course of Vitamin D (prescription dosage).  To no avail.  The tightness continues to increase.  My partner decided to give chiropractic a try, since it had helped me greatly with my lower back problems after an injury.  He received numerous treatments and massage over a period of 4-6 weeks, and began working on a gradual stretching regimen as well.  As of today, the symptoms remain, and appear to be consistently getting worse with continued attempts to stretch (he is not overdoing the stretching, rather, focusing on the gradual).    A couple of days ago, after experiencing four days of extreme fatigue, intermittent nausea, labored breathing and some blood pressure elevation, we took him to the ER.  Labs came back \"normal\" they told us, with the exception of a slightly elevated uric acid again; chest x-ray was normal, and his lower back x-ray showed only \"minor degenerative changes\".  We obtained a copy of his labs that show in fact that several things are elevated: MCH - 31.1 MCHC - 36.4 Absolute Neutrophils - 7.7 Glucose - 108  (not fasting, although draw was done appx. 2 hrs after toast w/peanut butter) Uric Acid - 8.2  Noting that the Absolute Neutrophils count is high, I should also note that his WBC was well within normal range - indicating that the white blood cells swimming around are switched on for infection fighting, but there is no infection.  He is slightly overweight, 5'11\" and 230 lbs.  Physical activity consists generally of yard work (which is fairly involved); we try to walk in the evenings but he cannot go very far because of the pain.  His work is not physical other than walking through facilities.  His alcohol intake is generally on weekends with an occasional weeknight, although it is substantial during those times.  He has a previous history of using cocaine although it has been two years since last used.  He does not smoke.    Could any of those lab results be connected in some convoluted way to the symptoms he is having?  Could a drug (prescription or otherwise) he took in previous years have led to what he is experiencing now?  Would his alcohol intake have an effect on what is happening?  Basic liver function tests in the CBC are well within normal levels.  What additional types of testing should we be pursuing, and what kind of specialist would be the best to employ for doing so?  We are not convinced that rheumatology is the avenue we should be pursuing at this point.  Any suggestions (or evaluation from an MD) would be SO appreciated.  This is progressively getting worse to the point that it is affecting his ability to do ANYTHING remotely physical and we can't seem to get anyone to take it seriously enough to look deeper.  We know that we need to be looking under rocks, but it would certainly help to know which rocks to start with.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

Checking thyroid labs (TSH, free T4), fasting basic metabolic panel (will include glucose screen for diabetes).  A thorough history and physical will help too.  Include deep tendon reflex testing; sensation testing (to see if certain patterns of tingling exist); muscle strength testing; neurotension testing (e.g. SLR); axial compression of the cervical spine (trying to reproduce symptoms).  These are done by primary care physician.   Further lab work for rheumatological causes start with ANA, rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP, sed rate, and CRP...and perhaps xray the elbows and knees. Also, the \"strong pain killer\" may not include an anti inflammatory medication like ibuprofen so talk to your physician about an NSAID.  Let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Radiosynovectomy vs traditional treatment",
    "content": "Thanks for your patience. Radiosynovectomy is a procedure in which radionucleotides are injected into an arthritic joint (eg RA).  The radionucleotides emit a type of ray which destroys inflammatory tissue such as synovium (the inner lining of a joint which produces the slippery synovial fluid).  This procedure replaces surgical synovectomy (removal of the synovium) and is used after oral medicine fails.   Since this is considered nuclear medicine, a nuclear medicine faciltity should have information about the procedure.   Risk includes infection in the joint and increased swelling and pain. (A good question to ask before having the procedure is \"What is the chance of the radionucleotides destroying healthy tissue like cartiledge or ligaments?\")  Check with your HMO provider for coverage.  You will probably need to show that other treatments have failed.  This procedure should be more cost effective than surgical synovectomy. Let us know how things with your Mom turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for you patience.  You presented a history of SLE, GFR at 56-55, left sided lower rib pain recurring.  Regarding the pain, is it tender to touch; does it change with movement; does it increase with deep respirations.  It would be prudent to think about a musculoskeletal cause or a pleuritis etiology (inflamation of the lung or inner chest wall lining).  Occasionally, SLE \"flare-ups\" present with pleuritic pain.    Regarding the kidney concerns, commonly SLE patients have kidney disease.  It would be worthwhile to get a UA with microscopy, Bun, Cr, and a 24 hour urine if protein present on the UA.     Your family physician may consider SLE as a source of both problems and test and treat accordingly including consult to nephrologist.  Let us know how things go.\n\n",

The main question with spurs on the spinal canal is: are the spurs causing narrowing of either the spinal canal itself or intravertebral foramen (holes where the nerves exit the spinal column).   Spinal cord compression is an emergency.  Symptoms include (lumbar): leg weakness, inability to urinate, saddle paresthesia (numbness in the genitalia area) and in the cervical area you may have ataxia (stumbling gait), arms and leg weakness. Otherwise the peripheral nerve compression can cause limb numbness, pain, and weakness.     In either case, she should see a neurosurgeon. Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "This is more of an academic question(s).  ANA are antibodies against one's own cells--specifically the nuclear part of the cells.  If one's immune system is manufacturing these antibodies, one's body is literally attacking itself.  It is reasonable to assume that small amounts of ANAs may occur in infections where cells have been infiltrated by viruses or bacteria; or perhaps in cancers where  cells have been mutated.  There is literature mentioning that a small percentage of 'healthy people' test positive for ANAs, however I cannot seem to locate the original literature that actually demonstrates this, nor have I been able to find literature that says consistently 'high titre ANA's' are found in healthy individuals. Also, I have not been able to determine what exactly 'healthy' means. Is there an implication that healthy means 'does not have the particular illness we are investigating' or does it mean fit to run a marathon.  If one's body is attacking itself, by definition one cannot be 'healthy'.  Therefore if one is consistently producing large amounts of ANA's, one must have a disorder/disease.  1. Where is the literature?  OR 2. Where is my logic faulty?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Idakini-  I'm not sure that your question has a specific, black and white answer.  Your analysis of ANA is accurate.  However there are further considerations.  ANA may be elevated in persons taking the drugs hydrazaline, procainamide, or isoniazid, as well as in identified autoimmune conditions.  The research you request is not isolated in one place, to my knowledge.  Rheumatology texts and forums are most likely to contain the answers you seek.  However, your statement regarding \"high titre ANAs\" in healthy individuals is not accurate.  Some healthy people have elevated ANAs, but not consistently high titres.  To futher confuse the issue, some people with autoimmune diseases do not have elevated ANAs, or convert after diagnosis, and ANA tests can have false positives and false negatives.  Generally speaking, persons with consistently high titre ANAs most likely have some degree of an autoimmune condition.  The degree of a person's health status is determined by all systems being within normal range.  Just as there is no real \"average\" person, there is no definitive state of \"health\".  I hope this helps.  Faye, RN, MSW\n\n",

ANA are antibodies produced against nuclear components, therefore the antibodies must test positive for one nuclear component (as in the case of antimitochondrial antibodies), several nuclear components, or all nuclear components.    It seems that identifying which nuclear component(s) are being 'attacked' is merely a matter of testing against each one. And if a set of tests don't test positive, the particular nuclear component has yet to be identified.  Would this be true?\n\n",

The pain in my shoulder was gone but then hurt my knee.  IT got really stiff the day after one of my workouts and continued to get stiff in morn. and hurt so i stopped working out.

    "content": "Hello -  If this  is rheumatic in origin it can start at any time, and usually doesn't start until adulthood. What may be a factor in the way yours has presented is that you built your body up way beyond what it had been used to carrying. Even though it is likely mostly muscle you've added, it's still a great deal more bulk than your skeleton and joints were used to bearing as a load. Even though big muscles can help stabilize the overall structure, if you have a rheumatic problem you're probably not \"natural\" for your body type and the underlying disease, which would seem very likely to be arthritis. Does this mean you can't work out anymore? No, but it may mean you'll need to change your style of fitness and  athletecism to something more aerobic and less bulking up. We do what we have to do, and the good news is you wouldn't have to give up being active and athletic, but may have to change your approach. But first you need to have this diagnosed and treated. Seeing a rheumatologist would probably be a good starting place.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

This is a very reasonable and proper part of such an exam, but likely hadn't been planned; there will probably be some  other things done now, as well, to get a good overall impression of your husband's general health.  This is my best guess regarding the chest x-ray.  I can think of no singular reason,  relative to the main complaint, that would warrant it, but a complete evaluation does make sense.

    "title": "Scleroderma &/or lymphoma ?",
    "content": "Hi, My mum (54yo) has suspected scleroderma, which started in her big toe apparently 3yrs ago, it has now moved up her legs & into her buttocks, it was also evident in her hands. Purple, shiny, swollen, hard. At least one of her ankles won't turn due to tightness/swelling (think she said).   She had a CT scan & ECG done the other day via her GP. She has the CT scan results which she read to me & included such things as:  * many enlarged lymph nodes * mesenteric nodes * pelvic phleboliths * pelvic chain nodes * inguinal nodes * left renal hilum * concerns about:  aorta / IVC / mesentery  * tests to rule out lymphoma should be done * esophigas (sp?) is affected - possible scleroderma)  The ECG results don't come in til Wed, but she is going out of her mind with worry at the moment. When the GP has all these results then he'll see her & refer her to a specialist, but her GP aptmt isn't until 12Dec apparently.  Any insight please? Thanks so much.  She also has narcolepsy (well a rarer form, whereby the only diff is she doesn't go into REM sleep) & medication is not helping, she see's this specialist 1-3mthly & he said something like 99% of his patients episodes are controlled by the meds, whereas hers is not. It is far worse in the warmer weather.  She also has permanent back/neck injuries.\n\n",

The person at radiology before the scan said looks like u have scleroderma! I was reading on the internet about scleroderma & it sounds like systemic scleroderma... & somewhere it said life expentancy up to 5yrs from onset!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Systemic sclerosis is used to describe involvement of different body organs and tissues with fibrosis and chronic inflammation. These organs include the skin, the viscera (commonly esophagus), the lung, the kidney and the immune system.  The disease is diagnosed mainly on clinical basis with major and minor criteria provided by the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) criteria for the classification of systemic sclerosis    The major criterion is symmetric thickening, tightening, and induration of the skin of the fingers (proximal to the metacarpophalangeal or metatarsophalangeal joints) that may extend to the entire extremity as well as the head and the trunk.  Confirmatory tests include the presence of autoantibodies (ANA) in the blood of the majority of cases and histopathological characters of tissue biopsy if taken.  Blood vessels can be affected in different ways and lymph node involvement as a secondary effect to changes in the involved organs drained by them is not uncommon.  The association between scleroderma and lymphoma is uncommon and there are no data that support a casual relationship. If these lymph nodes are small enough to be reactionary, the physician may not consider biopsy. Otherwise the only way to reach the diagnosis would be through a biopsy from the most significant  and the most accessible lymph node.  If it is a lymphoma associated with scleroderma her doctor may treat her as lymphoma since scleroderma symptoms have been shown to improve also with lymphoma treatment. Symptomatic treatment and local skin measures are essential parts of the treatment aproach.  Life expectancy in scleroderma is very individualized, and depends on the extend of skin and visceral involvement as well as their response to therapy.  In general, in limited disease, majority of patients are expected to live up to 20 years while those with extensive diseases are expected to live 5 years or more.  Unfortunately you will have to wait for the evaluation of the specialist to reach the diagnosis.  I would advise you to follow up with her doctor. Only by complete history and direct clinical examination the proper management can be reached. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Intense Night Pain in Lower Back and Hips",
    "content": "In the past 8 years I have had intermittent back pain.  It began while I was pregnant with my daughter who will be 8 in January.  I was diagnosed with a stress fracture in my lower back and said it was caused by the pregnancy.  During that pregnancy I also had intense pain in my hips and thighs only at night and it was also explained as pregnancy pains.  I have also had neck/shoulder pain and was told from a brief physical exam that I had bursitis, have had intermittent knee pain/swelling in my right knee and frequent eye infections.  My eye will get red and be very painful (feels like pressure on it), become weepy and my vision will blur.  It usually only lasts a day with antibiotic drops.  I have over the past few years gone through periods of time where the pain in my back during the night became excruciating and I have never sought medical help thinking that it was possibly an arthritis type condition caused from my previous \"injury\".  I am not a hypochondriac and rarely see a physician going years between visits.  As of late, the pain is terrible during the night, I never sleep past 1-3 am because of the pain, I am exhausted.  When I get out of bed I often crawl out and can only raise myself up with the assistance of my arms because I cannot do it on the strength of my back alone.  My back does not cause me pain during the day unless I strain it somehow.  I have no medical insurance and just moved to begin a new job.  I have read much about ankylosing spondylitis and think it may be a possibility and have thought perhaps my father suffered from the same problem as I recall him telling me that he believed he had herniated discs in his lower back.  As he had an aneurysm when he was fairly young that caused major brain trauma, it is hard to know.  I only know that he suffered from debilitating back pain.  None of my previous diagnosis were based on x-ray or MRI - they were assumed.  How important is it for me to be seen by a rheumtologist and is it possible to be seen without a referral?  Is there diet/exercise that may help?  What would be my least expensive course of action to get a diagnosis and assistance?\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding ankylosing spondylitis: Men > women (3:1) Onset between puberty and 40 y.o. Worse in the morning and stiffness lasts > 30 mins;  worse when lying down or inactive and better with exercise and activity Duration > 3 months May have peripheral joint pain (shoulders, hips, knees, etc) May have associated uveitis (the uvea is the layer of eye tissue just deep to the cornea and continuous with the iris anteriorly) May involve other systems (heart, lungs, GI-colon, and neurological).  Formal testing includes an xray of the lower spine and sacrum, sed rate and CRP, and perhaps an HLA-B27 blood test.    I present this information more from academia and less from experience.   From experience, I would: 1. Start with a couple simple tests you can do at home to see if the sacroiliac joint is inflamed.  These are Gaenslen's Test and Patrick or Faber test (google image these for description) 2. Start a one to two week trial period of NSAIDS (indicated management of ankylosing spondylitis).   3. Use a heating pad on the area followed by painfree active range of motion exercises for the shoulders, hips, and low back.  Examples are single knee to chest, trunk rotation, trunk extensions, overhead reaching and hamstring stretching.  All of these can be done in recumbant position.    Other considerations: 1. With feeling of increased eye pressure and blurred vision, a trip to the optometrist or ophthalmologist would be prudent especially during \"flare-ups\" 2. With multiple sexual partners, recurrent eye infections and joint pains/arthritis; gonorrhea infection is part of differential diagnosis.  I would invest in a visit to a competant family physician who either has a background in ortho or rheumatology and/or willing to do some thorough investigating himself - thus saving a trip to a specialist.\n\n",

    "title": "I injured my back at work, could I have a bulging disk?",
    "content": "About 2 and a half months ago, I was at work and was lifting very heavy objects (100-120 lbs working in ankle deep mud) constantly over about a 2 hour period.  My back hurt quite a bit, but i thought I was just sore from work like I usually am.  However, over the next week to two weeks my pain developed into more than just soreness. I started experiencing muscle spasms, severe pain, debilitating cramps, and started to have trouble sleeping. I have been to two different doctors, had X-Rays and MRI's done, and all were negative.  The doctors didnt really know what it was but said it was a strained muscle.  Now I am not a wimp when it comes to pain.  I played sports for a month with a torn labrum in my shoulder thinking it was just normal soreness.  This pain in my lower back is unbearable, and brings me to tears at times. On a scale of 1-10, 10 being the worst, tonight it reached a 10.  On top of spasms and cramps from my lower back into the back of my legs, my girlfriend noticed swelling in two different areas of my lumbar, which happened to be 2 of the areas where I was experiencing much of my pain.  While massaging my back, she pushed with her fingertips in the areas of swelling (both areas were just on either side of my spine).  When she did this, I could not help but cry, and I NEVER cry over physical pain. I KNOW that this is not a muscle strain, could it be a bulging or herniated disk?  Please help me figure out what this is!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I injured my back at work, could I have a bulging disk?",
    "content": "The MRI would show a bulging disk.  There are however small joints in the spine called facet joints which can become inflamed and cause pain and ...there are small ligaments, tendons and even very small muscles in the spine area (that help support and stabilize the column) which can become tender, swollen, and inflamed...not to mention the large \"strap\" muscles that run the length of the vertebral column which often go into spasm.  Spasms cause pain.  Swelling and inflamation cause pain.  Sprained structures supporting the back cause pain.  Immobility causes stiff structures which when moved cause pain.  So the level of pain is not surprising ...even without a herniated disk!  Treat the symptoms with heat or ice packs (or both); NSAIDS, rest, and walking as tolerated.  Prescribed muscles relaxers may help.  Refrain from lifting, bending, twisting, pushing or pulling or carrying until the back heals. Any restrictions should be in writing from your family physician or occupational health doctor.     Watch for numbness, tingling or weakness in the legs; inability to urinate; or numbness in the pelvic area (the area which would touch the saddle while riding a horse).  If present, seek medical attention ASAP.  This may indicate the spinal cord is being pinched.    Since the pain has lasted beyond the typical one month mark (most acute low back pain resolves in one month) and the MRI is negative.  It is time to see a Physical Therapist to start rehabilitating the back.  It is important to break the pain-spasm-pain cycle and allow blood flow into tense and tight soft tissue.   This allows healing.  Your back should improve with time and therapy.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: I injured my back at work, could I have a bulging disk?",
    "content": "I wouldn't think a muscle spasm of the lumbar paraspinals would reduce a disc herniation (conceivable but not probable).   I would think that the entire MRI quality would be poor if lots of movement occurred during imaging.   Localized low back pain with spasm does not necessarily equate to herniated disk despite the pain level.  Spasms are the body's natural response to injury - it says, \"Don't move, I'm injured and hurt\".   Healing takes time but also may require a manipulation or mobilization of the spine to realign malaligned structures.  Moving misaligned inflamed structure can hurt and cause spasms chronically.   I would stick to my original recommendation to see a chiropractor or manual physical therapist for assessment and appropriate management.  A repeat MRI with contrast or a bone scan may be an option but I am not sure how much you would gain with these.  An experienced orthopedist or physiatrist may offer their opion.\n\n",

    "content": "Some questions about \"Pain and swelling in the foot that radiates both down to the toe and up the calf\":  Is the pain worsening? Is there redness and warmth with the pain and swelling? Any fever? Are you overweight? (may increase risk of ankle injury or arthritis) Was there an injury or an increase in activity 4-5 months ago? What kind of work do you do? Do you have flat feet or high arches? Any changes in shoes? Does the pain start on the inside or outside part of the ankle? Any history of back problems? Do any other joints hurt? Any leg weakness? Any numbness or \"pins and needles\"?  Neurological problems (pinched nerve, bony spur, arthritis, lumbar disk problem) of the lumbar spine can cause pain, pins and needles, numbness, or weakness in the lower leg.    Otherwise a good exam of the ankle itself will be important as several local structures can cause this kind of pain:  ankle ligament sprain, arthritis in the ankle joint, small fractures, etc.  Answers to these questions will help you prepare to see a physician who can assess the ankle in person.  Also, an x-ray may be neccesary.\n\n",

But after some use, the pain disappear. Another morning, it will appear again.  And also from this year, my eyes became dry. I often woke up at night due to my eyes. I felt dry, irritable (like something inside my both eyes). I checked with eye doctors, they checked my tears secretion and found secreation is low. And now i use the artificial tears every day but still feel dry.  ANd from last year, i got the pain on my sacral lumbar part. I don't dare bend the back backward. and if i brush my teeth too long with a little bent position, i couldn't straight my back due to much pain.  I checked with my doctor, but she didn't what happened.  Actually, from the april of 2007, i began to feel the weird feeling on my both hands (such as warm or hot feeling and i have to cool my hands with cool water, or feel swollen but my hands are not actually swollen), and feel immigrant pain on my bones of the whole body. And then i was found to have the Monoclonal Gammopathy (IgG type) but have no damage on my bones (with X-ray bone scan).  I don't know my new symptoms appeared from this year is due to my abnormal IgG protein in my blood or due to other immnology diseases?  Hope i can get some feedback.  Thanks,\n\n",

    "content": "There are some things to consider with this knee pain.  Most importantly is a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Risk factors for DVT include sedentary positions (hospital stays, prolonged travel in plane or car, orthopedic and other surgery), pregnancy, hx of cancer, family or personal hx of clotting disorders.  Signs may include swelling, pain, redness in the calf.  Low probability of DVT may warrant a blood test called BNP whereas a higher probability for DVT may warrant venous doppler ultrasound test.    Other possible diagnosis include: Baker's cyst (benign cyst in the posterior knee ie back portion of the knee) Internal knee ligament damage Internal knee cartiledge damage Tendon strain or sprain (e.g. hamstring)    It is important to see a physician who will evaluate the knee and quickly determine the probability of DVT with appropriate testing.  Otherwise orthopedic considerations will be made.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Allergic reaction in the form of skin rash is a known side effect of the Humira (a Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) blocker).  This is a considerable side effect that you should inform your doctor with before receiving the second dose.  A rash with this particular distribution makes exclusion f viral reactivation (herpes Zoster) is essential too even if you are under antiviral therapy. Being on immunosuppressive medications, make you at risk of virus reactivation that can also present in atypical form and with no itching or numbness.  These are the two most important causes (in my openion) to be excluded before your next dose and before considering any other causes.  I would advise you to inform your doctor and to follow up with him. Please keep updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am also morbidly obese, I have researched the various bariatric proceedures and decided RNY is right for me. I had my consult with my surgeon, had approval from cardiologist, and psycologist as required by insuance. I was literally one day before my proceedure when the rheumatologist decided that I should not have this procedure it was to risky given my IgA deficency. No other explaination. I am currently waiting for a second opinion but my appointment is months away so I thought I would ask my question on the board, to see your thoughts on if a patient with no symptoms, diagnosed with an IgA deficency can safely proceed with RNY surgery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course there are risks involved but as you know, morbid obesity has known, serious risks associated.  If you do not take care of this problem, you are likely to have much more risk of premature death as well as diabetes, hypertension, joint problems, other endocrine disorders and a myriad of other problems.  In all procedures you must weigh the risks and benefits.  I doubt this risk is greater than the risk of NOT getting this life-saving procedure but you should discuss it with your RNY surgeon.  You already have the opinion of the rheumatologist.  With all the facts out, you will need to decide what is right for you.  Your surgeon should be well-versed in the risks associated with the surgeon and with proper follow-up you may be able to counter any ill-effects from the IgA insufficiency.  I don't know a lot about this but if ulcers are of concern there is the evidence that the small pouch is less likely to produce ulcer-forming acids and when ulcer does occur it may be treated with medication.    You definitely face risks whether you go ahead with the procedure or not.  You need to feel good about which risk is the greater; which is the lesser.  You might benefit from some online support through a bariatric specialty such as www.bariatricsupportcenter.com - these folks have been in the business for a very long time and can help you understand the long-term implications and the importance of follow-up care and dietary restrictions, exercise, education, support, etc. for your success.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  You may have suffered an intradelivery herniation of one of the inguinal muscles, or perhaps just a pull or tear in that area. Since it took months for the pain to develop it's probably not a hernia, but it still could be. It also could be a nerve beinng impinged upon, again probably due to pregnancy or the delivery. Muscles are weakened and stretched prior to and during delivery of a baby, and a weakened muscle can eventually herniate or become inflamed. I'd  have this looked at before it has a chance to progress, on the off-chance it may actually be a hernia or muscle on the verge of herniating.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here, and  if there's any more to the story, please fill in any blanks. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctors:  I am a 37-year-old female and have been experiencing a palmar rash off and on  that consists of flat, red spots, most about the size of a pencil eraser that do not itch, along with redness, warmth, stiffness, and tenderness of one distal interphalangeal joint.  The finger affected varies.  It sometimes also affects the PIP joint in the same finger.  The entire finger is noticably warm, and the skin feels taut.  The rash occurs during the day,  then the joint swelling and pain in a finger flares at night, often waking me from the pain and throbbing.  This lasts a day or two and resolves completely but recurrs serveral times a year.  I saw a dermatologist who ran an ANA and sed rate (both were normal) and let it go at that.  I've read that osteoarthritis typically affects the DIP joints, but I've read nothing about it occuring with any red spots on the hand as well.  They definitely occur together for me.   I also have some mild CBC abnormalities of unknown origin.  My counts drop out of the normal range and then come back up again, and then drop again, etc.  No diagnosis there either.  My CBC's are monitored regularly.  I have no other arthritic complaints or rashes elsewhere.  Could this all be related?  Is osteoarthritis still the most likely diagnosis in spite of the presence of the \"rash?\"  Do you recommend a workup by a rheumatologist, or does the transitory nature make it too difficult to diagnose?  Thank you for your time!  You're doing a wonderful service on this website!  Penny\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Penny,  The rash could be related to the pains and swellings in the joints that you have. Osteoarthritis affects both the proximal and distal interphalyngeal joints and it is sometimes associated with nodules on the joints themsleves but no rash on the palms.   i can not think of a condition that causes hand rash and arthritis at the same time for now but may be a rheumatologist would. May be it is the early beginings of a rheumatological disease like psoriasis. May be it is something transient.  When you say your blood counts are low which blood counts did you mean? If the white cell count is the one that you mean, there is a condition called cyclic neutropenia in which the patient has low white cell count on regular basis may be every 3-4 weeks sometimes accomapnied by infections and sometimes not. There is no specific treatment for that. Are the rash and joint symptoms related to the decrease in your blood count in any way?  The best thing is to go see a doctor while you have the rash and the arthritis, this would the perfect setting, the doctor will see the rash and the joint changes at the same time.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pain in back and shoulder",
    "content": "Hello -  Everything you describe, plus your history, suggest asthma or chronic bronchial inflammation (possibly due to SLE), with some residual right lower lobe congestion that probably needs to be broken up by regular, therapeutic breathing treatments. Since your cough is productive but not bloody, it may be you've developed an autoimmune variant of pneumonia that's become chronic. This can even be a mild form of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP), which is often missed in tests because of its unique nature (no infection, yet it mimics mild to severe pneumonia without most of the systemic signs such as fever, that would normally be seen). This and othere similar sorts of chronic interstitial lung disorders, are often treated successfully with steroids.   It would seem a consult with a pulmonologist may be in order. The pleuritic pain can accompany almost any sort of lower respiratory infection or psuedoinfection, and may linger for quite a while even after the acute problem has resolved. It would help to have even a broad diagnosis (\"could be A, B or C) rather than just having a lot of possible causes tossed out and no attempt to narrow it down and get it resolved.   Hopefully this is helpful to you. A more thorough workup is required to get to the bottom of the problem. One way would be to test for SLE and rule it in or out. Another would be to have a bronchoscopy done to see if that RLLL congestion is actually BOOP, which sometimes must be biopsied (or at least a specimen obtained) in order to identify it, since it creates a unique sort of almost cellulose-like material instead of ordinary mucus.   Best of luck to you with this, and please do follow up as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: finger pain",
    "content": "Hello -  While morning joint stiffness is often associated with arthritis, since this has been ruled out,  the next most likely cause is something called \"trigger finger\", in which the tendons that control the finger become irritated, thickened, and eventually cause the finger to actually assume the curved attitude of pulling a trigger (even though it may not be one's index finger, the tradition finger used for pulling triggers). If that's what's going on, yours hasn't reached that point yet, and may not, but it may eventually get to that point. Otherwise what happens is the finger becomes  stiff, sore, and may move in a jerking fashion when  flexed or extended. It's a sort of tendinitis, and in your case it may remain no more than that. Since it is inflammatory in nature (even if it's not arthritis), it should respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammtories such as iburprofin or naproxyn. You can try this and  see if it helps. Sometimes these medications can actually give the inflamed part relief long enough to heal and the problem doesn't recur.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some people are more prone to the \"cracking\" of joints but it is a normal process as bubbles form in the synovial fluid that surrounds the joint and increases when the joint is stretched.  The joint recovers from the pressure drop and the gases are absorbed and for about 25 minutes or so they don't \"pop\" until the gas is redissolved and the air space is created again.    You don't need to see a doctor about this if it is not causing you pain or function problems because if it is just the normal cracking there is nothing to be done for it.    Best wishes.\n\n",

The leg biopsy showed a vascular rash she called PPP.  My arm biopsy came back positive for lupus.

I was just wondering what the chances are that the first biopsy is correct and I really do have lupus?

    "content": "Hello -  Barring a lab error, a postive finding for lupus is almost always correct (there are far more false negatives, very rarely a false positive). As for keeping the rashes from getting worse, I would think the doctor would have given you any information on that which might be of any use. However, if it wasn't discussed, wait and see what happens, as there are treatments for these things. If the  rash worsens you should let the doctor know and ask just what can be done to help abate the rash.  Best of luck to you. We'll be interested to hear what the immunoflourescent biopsy shows, as that would be the definitive one.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe burning back pain and shortness of breath",
    "content": "I am a 50 year old female who was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 13 years ago.  The onset of my fibro was severe fatigue and a slight burning in my mid back.  After that I would get small mouth sores and oral yeast.  My symptoms leveled off after a year and a half to achy in the morning, which would resolve after a shower and being up for an hour.  These symptoms were more of an annoyance than debilitating.  Several weeks ago I started with a cough and felt short of breath (the cough is now gone) and then a severe burning sensation in my back in and around my spine, mid back an upper back.  I then felt dizzy and had numb feeling mid way down my left arm. Although I didn't have an official temp my temp was 99.5 during this time,  when my normal temp is around 98.6.  Two weeks after all these symptoms appeared the severe burning sensation in my back literally went out.  This burning was moving around and I felt as if something went out.  I was fine for a day and  then a much milder burning sensation appeared but the shortness of breath and pressure in my mid and upper back area remain.  My doctor so far has sent me for chest xrays, ct scan of chest which shows some non specific thickening in my lobe ( doctor says it could have been caused by bronchitis as a child).  I have also had an ultra sound on my thyroid in addition to a radiative scan.  All normal.  My blood work is normal except that my potassium level dropped slightly since my last blood test.  They are sending me back to determine if was a lab error. The symptoms that remain are burning in my back, pressure in my mid back, burning in my upper back and a feeling of not feeling well.  I also have some cervical spine compression from some herniated Disks which causes neck pain and arm throbbing. Arm throbbing has resolved but neck pain persists.  I do have a rheumatologist appointment but don't get to see him for another 4 weeks. My doc seems to think it sounds like muscular inflammation.  I am concerned because of the array of symptoms I am having. Any thoughts  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It does sound as though you are suffering from a muscular inflammatory problem, and it is probably related to fibromyalgia, just based on your history. There are other possible explanations, but they would be obscure and given the known history and your description of the discomfort, I would favor fibromyalgia as a cause.   Regarding the chronic problem, have you ever been prescribed a pain-blocking drug such as gabapentin or pregabalin? This might just help with the current burning, which of course also could be simply shingles or post-herpetic pain, for which the previously mentioned drugs are also effective.  I hope this is helpful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Background:  Fibromyalgia  -Constant tendonitis (in one area or another)  -Random shooting, stabbing, aching, throbbing pains  (Hips, Knees, Chest, Elbows, Shoulders, Hands...)  -Joints are sensitive and weak; especially after exertion (running, etc) Walking increases pressure on hips/knees and the connective tissue/muscle feels paper thin as though I might tear it with the slightest move  -Sporadic muscle spasms/twitching (Restless leg syndrome)  -Frequently suffer from headaches/migraines  -Dizziness/Lightheadedness upon standing  -Fatigued/extremely drained all the time   JUNE 08: I was beaten by multiple men  -Face & chest punched repeatedly  -Head slammed into concrete several times  Trip to ER 1 week later resulted in the diagnosis of bruised ribs & possible cheekbone fracture  No x-rays were done (advised against it by the nurse because of the risks)   End of JUNE-JULY  -EXTEMELY ILL, with no idea of the causation  -Could breathe in only to a certain extent without intense lung (?) pain  -Nauseus, but without throwing up (I described as feeling sea-sick) Could not eat or drink ANYTHING but water without feeling ill  -Shaking/Fevers  -Throat was sore and gradually got worse and worse until I ended up in ER because I could no longer swallow even water (UNBEARABLE pain)  Diagnosed with Mononucleosis after being hooked up to an IV for fluids and drugs. Given Hycodan for pain, along with advised bedrest (no work) for 7 days Visited ER again after a week, because medicine was not helping and pain was getting worse. Received another IV for fluids/drugs & steroid pills were given  -Throat issue gradually went away  -Weakness and fatigue (associated with mono) persisted  -Panick attacks/constant crying and depression for no known reason  -Huge trouble sleeping/insomnia [*]One night I stayed awake in bed for HOURS, eyes open, dreaming; practically hallucinating.  Another night I literally found it IMPOSSIBLE to sleep.  My body and mind would not let me, yet this was far from a typical case of \"I can't get to sleep\"; something I know well.     AUGUST  -Onset of chest pain  -Sharp, stabbing pain beneath left breastbone  -Feel inflammation between ribs and breast bone on both sides (more so on the left)  -Severe pain in shoulders (much more prominent in left)   -Off and on aching pain in neck (both sides)  -Pain in upper arms   -Slight pain in back of head  I saw a doctor because of these symptoms, but failed to mention a lot of them, not necessarily thinking they were connected at the time.  Settled on the idea that it was inflammation in the chest from the mono and would go away soon.  Blood test revealed anemia/low red blood cells (I was told to take vitamins, even though I had already been doing so for awhile, in case of iron-deficiency)  Chest x-rays showed nothing abnormal  -Went to lie down one night and was shocked by a thousand needles splintering all over in my chest; Sat up immediately and did not go to bed for fear of what might happen  -Indulged in some fried rice one day, and while eating, experienced sharp, intense pains in center of chest  -Recently laughed a little too hard at work with a friend and scared her with my sudden reaction to a sharp stabbing pain under left breastbone; scared the hell out of me and I had to pause for a few moments to breathe and recover  -Possible heart palpitations (I feel it flutter or it seems to stop for a moment or skip a beat and I'm afraid it will give up altogether). I would only have to assume, however, that if anything were wrong, a doctor would have picked up on it after listening with a stethescope. I do have a friend (with a heart murmur) who listened to my chest once, only to tell me he thought I had a heart murmur, as well (of course he's not exactly a doctor...)  Doctor's visit was two weeks ago, and the pain is not going away, even with motrin or excedrin.  It hurts just as badly as it did before, if not worse. I have this overwheelming feeling that something is wrong. It could be something harmless, but I need to know. I feel helpless, and I have an all-around feeling of ILLNESS. I can't secape the sense of disease in my core; it's frightening and bothersome. It scares me most, because this is unlike anything I've ever experienced before, DESPITE the fact that I am used to large amounts of pain from the fibromyalgia.   YESTERDAY I hadn't had alcohol in a couple months because of the mono/high levels of enzymes in liver. Decided to drink with a friend last night: two glasses of white wine, and a glass of bailey's irish cream a little later. I woke up to a ton of facial pain, around the jaw. Told her my face hurt, and she laughed. Entire body feels TERRIBLE and my mind is in a fog. Much more so than a regular hangover, though, I promise. I don't drink too often, and this has happened before; I don't have to have much. Just now realizing it might not be normal. I mention it to people and they act as though I must have had a TON to drink. It lasts for at least an entire day, sometimes a few, and makes me rethink whether I should drink at ALL; even a glass. It's not worth the pain, or empty, deathly feeling in my gut.  Please....help? I am seeing another doctor soon, but in the meantime all of this is driving me absolutely crazy. I feel as though it is one thing after another. While these things may or may not be related, I thought it was important to include everything, in order to make a more accurate diagnosis. The fact that some symptoms overlap, leads to confusion, and makes doctor visits a bit more complicated.\n\n",

He was diagnosed with Scoliosis when he was younger, but as of now, it is very minimal.  Of all of the problems known to me, this is a breakdown: (The symptoms I know of have been gradually increasing over the last 6 months, some were there prior)  - trouble sleeping/staying asleep (doctors prescribed sleeping pills but they do not work) - extreme chest pains (worse on right side) [been to ER numerous time for fear of heart attack, but all tests come back normal) - extreme pain in neck, shoulders, back, arms, wrists, hips, legs, ankles, feet, knees - just about pain in every joint of his body) - complains of burning sensation in arm going down to fingertips - complains of cold feet/hands  - blurred vision becoming a problem, even with glasses/contacts - trouble concentrating - gets nervous/shakes (doctors prescribed depakote, but not helping in any shape, form or fashion; i believe it is making him more nervous) - others as well, but can't recall as of right now.  We've been to the general doctor, neurologist, rheumatologist (who said he would not say he had fibro because it is not good for a man), chiropractic dr., behavioral (they want to say all of this is probably depression), and have had a list of testing that all come back normal.  He has been prescribed various muscle relaxers and pain medications that are used for inflammation, and none of them have worked.  Each doctor gives us a diagnosis of \"I don't know\" but none of them will even consider Fibromyalgia because he is not a female.  His mother and grandmother have both been diagnosed with this disease as well.  I'd like to know if I am barking up the wrong tree with this way of thinking, or could it be some other problem I am not seeing.\n\n",

We encourage doctors and nurses to join out team so we can help more people without cost involved.  And, as glenp said, sometimes there are no answers.  Even with our best medical knowledge and intuitive efforts, there is no clear diagnosis or treatment.  We sometimes just have to experiment with different therapies, hoping that one of them will help alleviate the unpleasant symptoms.  We continue to hope for better answers and I would love to one day see the Star Trek type diagnostic feature - wave the wand over the body and the computer tells all.    Good luck with this frustrating condition.  CFS and FMS are some of the most exasperating conditions of all.  In the meantime, moderate, regular exercise with stretching and excellent diet can help to some degrees.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 26 years old female and for the past few months, I have noticed that my fingers tremble lightly when i try to do things that require precision (picking at split ends for example, or putting thread through a needle)... My arms and legs feel weak often.. For the past few weeks, i've also noticed some sort of pain mainly in my arms (around my elbows, forearms, or the back of my arms).  It feels like the \"electrical shock\" of when your elbow hits a hard surface, but maybe 10 times less painful..  Just yesterday, I was eating a hamburger and the fingers on my left hand seemed to have \"stuck\" in their hamburger- holding position.  I am in fairly good health, and had alot of blood tests done 3mths ago because the doctor wanted to rule out thyroid problems (my stiffness problems hadn't surfaced like that back then). All my tests were normal, except for my cholesterol, but that may be because i had 2 eggs that morning.  Can someone tell me what this could be? What kind of tests do i need to tell the doctor to do?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello kandy -  I very much hope by now you've found an answer to this peculiar problem. A few things suggest themselves, and while Parkinson's would be a very long shot it should be ruled out. It certainly doesn't sound remotely like arthritis, which involves joints. More likey, it seems, would be some sort of polyneuritis: usually caused by a virus or appearing as a sequel to a viral infection (often which went unnoticed itself), wherein voluntary nerves in the extremities become irritated with resulting pricking and tingling sensations (not unlike what you describe), as well as weakness and tremor in the etremities. Gillain-Barre syndrome also comes to mind, although it usually progresses more rapidly and peaks much sooner than the time period during which you've been having this problem. It could be as simple as a vitamin B-12 deficiency. A neurological workup and blood tests would seem to be in order.  Again, by now I hope very much you've gotten an answer and also found a way to resolve or at least manage the problem. If you check in here please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the answer.  I researched briefly the 2 possibilities you mentioned and it seems they both start from the legs going upward, which is the opposite for me.. As a matter of fact, I no longer have any problems with my feet/legs.  It's still just my hands, mainly the right one.  It seems it wants to do involuntary movements.  For instance, if i scratch my nose slowly, my finger would make a sudden move and move an extra 1 inch more than what I was aiming for. Could CARPAL TUNNEL SYNDROME be it? When i exercise, or shower in hot water, it seems that my hand is very heavy and my fingers have alot of difficulty doing things that require precision.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  GB syndrome does, almost always, start at the extremities and work its way inward. Polyneuritis can \"blossom\" all over the place at once, but what you describe now sounds less like that (could have been a coincidence) and more like a nerve compression  or entrapment, perhaps the ulnar nerve, which usually causes the pinkie and next finger the most problem (sometimes rendering them numb) but also can cause spasticity, slowness, cramping, etc., in the whole hand. Carpal  tunnel syndrome can also cause these symptoms, but usually with a good deal of local pain as well. Ulnar entrapment can occur anywhere from the carpal tunnel on up to the elbow, then at the thoracic outlet and even at the cervical spine. This would be worth a nerve conduction and muscle function test for sure (electromyelogram). This test could now quite possibly at least isolate the hand problem and lead to a remedy.   I hope this is helpful and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello pt_i_am -  While I have in the past monitored patients receiving Remicade infusions and have witnessed at least one severe  reaction, I've now gone through the available literature and can't find anything specific to what you describe. However, there are listed a number of \"post marketing reactions\", some of which are similar in mechanism to what you describe. However, the trail runs cold at that point for me, I'm afraid.   My best suggestion would be for you to try and find a rheumatologist or immunologist who is familiar with the ongoing studies involving Remicade to see if there is any newer information. The problem sounds like it may be an acquired autoimmune reaction, and this is potentially linkable to Remicade therapy. However, I can find no suggested remedies for similar problems. Again, a rheumatologist of immunologist who has an interest in following this particular kind of problem would probably be your best resource.  I wish I could give you something more concrete, but that's the limit of my insight into this. I think it is likely related to your initial reaction, but that's as far as I've been able to get with this.   Please do follow up with us, and I will continue to research this as well. I wish you the best of luck and hope by now you've found a resolution to the problem.\n\n",

They range from being in my upper arm, wrist, even fingers and toes, but never at the same time, usually only one spot in my body at a time.  I am 30 years old and 145 pounds. I do sit at a desk all day and have poor posture which I am working on.  Have been seeing a chiro and massage therapist. I had an MRi on my neck in November and it was fine.

    "title": "Re: Shooting Pain in Extremites",
    "content": "Hi heather1111 -  While your observation about poor posture is strongly suggestive of more than one pinched nerve or at least random nerve compression due to posture, it is also possible this could be caused by a deficiency of vitamin B-12. See if your GP would give you a referral to a neurologist for a consult. It's probably something as simple as posture, or perhaps that vitamin thing, but if it continues you really should find out what's causing this, as the fix is more than likely a simple one, and if it  isn't corrected the problem could become  worse.   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "i am a 21 year old female. I have been diadnosed with endometriosis,HPV,and interstitial cystitis. I have had surgery for all 3. I had a laporoscopy for the endometriosis,laser surgery for dysplasia caused by HPV,and I can't remember what they call the surgery they did on my bladder. I also have Orthostatic Hypotension.  I have along family history of so many different things. So basicly anything you can think of is in my family history, Arthritis,diabetes, heart disease,kidney problems,um cancer, and many others.  I am currently not taking any medication except for tylenol,I buprofen,and ocassionly aleve for the pain. Which doesn't seem to help much at all.  The back pain started first and it is constant,in fact all my pain has been pretty constant. At times my back hurts so bad that I have difficulty getting yp from sitting and laying down. Then a little over a month ago my hips and legs started to hurt,and they hurt everyday as well. Sometimes it hurts too much to even walk. And within this last week my entire body aches and every joint in my body in hurts. I don't know what is wrong but it's starting to concern me very much! I have other minor symptoms that come and go as well. I have had pubic hair loss too for about 4 months now. Not sure if that has anything to do with these other symptoms  For instance there are times I get very dizzy and have tingling in my head,hands and feet. Sometimes fingers go numb. U sually just one or 2 at a time. An dI have been getting bruises on my legs that I have no explanation for at all. I'm sorry if this is so long I am just really worried and figure the best way to get a good opinion is to give the basic story of my symptoms.   Anyways thank you very much for your time and sny thoughts you may have. I greatly appreciate the oprtunity to try and figure this out. God Bless!!\n\n",

Make a list of all the things you have noticed, as you did here, and talk to the doctor about them.  It is very complicated by your description and there could be some type of syndrome going on (like chronic fatigue, fibromyalgia, etc.).  A rheumatologist might be helpful with the fibromyalgia, if that is the case.  There are also autoimmune concerns, so getting the evaluation is important.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I read your post and felt like you were describing me!  I have been diagnosed with fibromyalgia and chronic fatigue syndrome.  It was about 2 years ago they gave me the diagnosis.  Like you, I have RLS but I take Mirapex for the symptoms.  I was taking Cymbalta and Lyrica but didn't get any relief so I stopped due to the cost.  Do you get fibro headaches everyday?  I do and they are most of the time debilitating.  My family dr. put me on Topamax which has really helped that part.  My biggest complaint is that I can't seem to get restful sleep and the pain I lve with is so debilitating at times that I find it hard to work.  I feel like this has taken over my life to a point that I'm really unhappy.   I have been referred to another rheumatologist to see if my symptoms can be better controlled or to see if I have developed Lupus or another auto immune disorder.  Try to see if you can get that referral too, it can't hurt more than the pain we live with.  Good luck.\n\n",

I was diagnosed with Atiphospho lipid antibody in 96 after I had several Heart attachs and strokes.  I am on warfrin my INR has to be between 3. to 3.5. In 97 I was bleeding out into the lungs and the cavity around the heart.  I was placed on a breathing machine and put into a drug indoced coma.  The doctors put an A line in my left arm and placed a cover over it and didnt pay attiention to it needless to say a clot formed and it was to late it destroyed the a large amount of nerves and i can barily use it.  I was diagnosed with lupus SLE in 2001 and have been taking tons of differant meds too much to list here.  The Lupus has been out of control sence 2002 of and on.  The Lupus is effecting my Lungs, Heart, brain and kidneys. I am on oxigen for the lungs are so bad. I have probles with memory, thinking strait and halucenations.   In 2005 I had a clot in my right kindey even though my INR was a 15. It was so hi because i was so sick, vomiting unable to eat and sever halucnations, and server jerks all over, i couldnt hold a cup because the jerks were so bad, my wife called 911 and they found a problem with the kidney and put a shunt in it.  I also had a seisure while in the hospital and the nurses and doctors observed this. I saw a nerologist at the VA he said i had epolapcy, then another doctor at the VA said i didnt (the VA goes through doctors like i do with tissuse when i have a bad cold. in other words they cant find their behind with both hands) I am on sisure meds.  The jerking was diagnosed as myoclonic jerks in 2005.  I am not sure if is that or not.  I have these jerks when Im wide a wake, there are times that i cant hold a cup or fork my wife has to help me when i have these problem.  Ok to my question. Is these jerks related to the Lupus SLE?  My remitologist gives me a blank look when i ask this. (man i hate the VA), but i have no choice to go there. I have medicar but we all know how that works.  Sorry for the bad spelling and thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi rshipley,  I have gone through with your long winded question- and with some difficulty!!- and you have my deepest sympathy with you on having a complicated systemic disease like SLE with all its multisystem manifestations.  To answer your query, yes, SLE is a multi system disease, there are various types of antibodies circulating in an SLE patient and the manifestations vary according to the type of antibody.   The fact that you had Antiphospholipid positive goes strongly in favor of a CNS [Central Nervous System] involvement and this leads to siezures. Unless proved otherwise, siezures in SLE with antiphospholipids is always due to SLE itself.  Also, since you had strokes in the past. A stroke leaves a scar tissue in the brain. This scar tissue sometimes becomes a focus for seizure initiation.   I hope this is of help,   Apurva\n\n",

Lumbar spine - mild herniation at L4/5 and L5/S1 with degeneration at all levels and arthritis.  I have had endless tests over last 6 mnths for other problems so lots of blood tests - 6 weeks ago full blood count and thyroid plus had in last 6 momths ESR, liver, kidhey, potassium etc and blood clotting factors all normal. ultrasounds of pelvis and abdomen normal. sigmoidoscopy, occult blood and complete stool anlysis normal.  8 weeks ago i gripped with my left hand and got stabbing pain in wrist extending to hand/fingers and lower arm also inner elbow . Could not grip as hand so painful.  This spread to upper arm pain in muscle at front and back.  Then it spread to right arm with exact same pains in same places!  Again I can be okay but as soon as I grip with either hand I get the stabbing pain in werist and this sets off the rest of pain for day. I wake up every morning with stabbing pain in lower back same place on both sides!!  Now I am getting stabbing pains in ankles and lower legs - fleeting but all over.  I go back to my Dr in a couple of days.  I cannot imagine my spinal problems could cause such extensive nerve type pain all at once - I haven't been checked out for rheumatology blood tests and wondered if this needed doing or is there something obvious that I am missing.\n\n",

I wonder if you have fibromyalgia - something that does not show up on blood tests, MRIs, etc.  I'm sure your doctor will rule this one out as the investigation continues.  In the meantime if you can get some daily moderate exercise, in spite of the pain, you may find you get some relief over time.  It may not be immediate.    I don't know what else to suggest beyond this.  Good luck, and please let us know if you learn anything.\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend is a 25-year-old who suffers from Wiskott-Aldericht Syndrome.  Normally, his immune system is more or less under control, especially with a monthly dosage of gammaglobulin.  However he has been on about 60-80mg of Prednisone since September for the treatment of scleritis (or at least what is presumed by his opthamologists as scleritis) and has been hospitalized for fevers and arthritis-like inflammation and severe pain in his extremities (particularly in his knees, but also more recently on his wrists and fingers).  He has been having a bout with this condition roughly once a month since mid November, when his Prednisone dosages have been at their peaks.  Recently, since he has been tapering to 40-30mg of prednisone a day, he has experience sexual side effects and erectile disfunction and lack of drive as well.  Perhaps this is due to the diminishing testosterone levels that were replaced by long-term steroids?  Is there anything (herbal, over-the-counter) that can ease the side-effects of prednisone and the withdrawl symptoms?  Also, I have read that cannabis, when applied as a topical agent along with iodine and aloe vera has helped many people with similar symptoms.  My significant other already regularly smokes cannabis on a recreational level (much to my chagrin, but boys will be boys...), so I am curious to know if applying it topically would have any soothing effects.  He has mentioned that iodine, aloe vera and warm compress eases, as does ingesting aloe and flaxseed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry your boyfriend is suffering with this condition.  I'm afraid I have seen nothing indicating that the side effects of prednisone withdrawal can be diminished using cannabis.  It is important that the tapering be done very gradually to reduce the unpleasant side effect such as achiness, fever, headache, nausea, etc.    He has nothing to lose by trying aloe vera and iodine but I can't say about topical cannabis.  It would likely be safer than smoking it for sure.  I have not been able to find anything to validate this treatment and studies are not typically done on illegal substance use so information often comes from other countries.  A study in Germany did find it to be helpful for itching so perhaps it is soothing for other skin conditions as well but beyond that I really can't say.  If side effects from withdrawal are too severe it is recommended that the dose tapering be reduced, even if it takes many months to discontinue it.  Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

Your symptoms are very consistent with a nerve type problem.  I would recommend you see a doctor for this if possible.  You may need some imaging studies, such as an MRI, to better determine the cause of your pain.  Often, there are local clinics that can see patients without health insurance on a free or reduced fee scale.  Your local health department can help find these clinics if needed.  Also, perhaps campus health may be an option.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swollen Finger tip",
    "content": "It sounds to me like a simple skin infection.  For any number of reasons you can get bacteria into a tiny opening in the skin, not even big enough to notice.  Soak the finger in very warm water, pat dry and apply an antibiotic ointment such as Neosporin, then cover with a bandaid.  Most likely it will heal itself.  The green is the infection gathered together with your body's immune system sending white blood cells to kill the bacteria.    Some people get a little relief if they can lance it with a sterilized needle and allow the pus to drain, but again if you do that, be sure the finger is very clean and apply the ointment and bandaid after the pus oozes out.  It is important to keep it clean while it heals.  Change the bandaid periodically so you can do this and examine the healing.    If it gets worse, the infection seems to spread, or you notice fever, streaks moving up your fingers, etc. be sure to see a doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dyana,  Your symptoms certainly could be caused by an autoimmune disorder.  Your labs are very non-specific and do not necessarily suggest anything.  ANA is positive in some rheumatologic diseases but in many others it is negative.  Add to this that a significant amount of the normal population will have a weakly positive ANA without having any disease and your left with a test that is only helpful in certain instances.  The ESR is mildly elevated (depending on your labs normal values) and can be elevated from almost anything as well.  With acute flares of rheumatological diseases it will often be much higher (but doesn't necessarily have to be).  Unfortunately, based on these labs, I think you're basically exactly where you started.  The labs don't rule in or out much.  However, joint pain and stiffness very much suggests a possible rheumatologic condition so I agree with your doctor about seeing a rheumatologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old caucasian female who is otherwise quite healthy.  However, for the past three or four years I have been plagued with hands and feet that will feel like they are on fire, swell, throb, get red for no apparent reason.  Symptoms first appear in the morning upon waking.  Then they seem to come and go throughout the day.   This is pretty much a 365 days a year condition.  Many times people I know, as well as perfect strangers, will comment on the inflammed appearance of my hands -- at times it can be that noticeable, and always that painful.  I have been tested and re-tested numerous times for all the obvious conditions, such as RA and Lupus, but my blood levels are all within normal range.  I always have normal blood pressure, heart rate and temperature.  My hands and feet do not get blue or white, or go dead cold, so the docs have ruled out Reynauds.    No joint deterioration was shown on x-rays and an EMG test was negative.   After many visits to the Rheumatologist I am still without a diagnosis.  Symptoms do not really respond to NSAIDs.  While I do seem to get mild relief from the pain with Prednisone, the symptoms themselves do not subside.   My primary doctor prescribed Lasix to see if the swelling could be controlled.  I've lost tons of water weight, but no difference in the overall swelling, throbbing redness or pain.    Does anyone have any suggestions, ideas...anything?  I am at a complete loss.   Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "There are no proven methods that you can buy through the internet and no known supplements - natural or otherwise - to help your growth.  Good nutrition can do as much or more than anything else.  I would recommend lots of vegetables in particular.   Height is mostly genetic and in some cases human growth hormones are needed if there is truly some type of problem restricting the normal growth and maturation of organs in the body.  This is by prescription for those who require it.  You are wasting your money on the products advertised.  Some males do continue to add inches into their early twenties, though most have stopped growing by around age 16.    The one way an inch or two can be added is surgical bone lengthening - a tedious and painful process for only an inch of height.  I hope you will come to realize that your value has little to do with your physical stature.  You can increase your muscle mass through body building and this can be a tremendous psychological boost to a man's image and attractiveness.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Gages1982,  I cannot comment regarding issues of malpractice since I do not know all the facts and this forum would be an inappropriate place for such discussions.  I can tell you some about gout, though.  Gout is a condition where uric acid crystals form and deposit in various places, most commonly the joints-particularly the big toe joints.  These crystal deposits cause tremendous inflammation and pain.    Treatment depends on the phase of the illness.  During an acute pain episode, treatment is with anti-inflammatories such as high dose non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDS such as ibuprofen, etc.).  Prednisone would act as an anti-inflammatory but does not provide pain control so it typically is not favored over NSAIDS.  In between attacks, treatment is aimed at reducing uric acid levels to prevent crystallization and attack occurrences.  This is often done with a medicine called allopurinol.  I am not familiar with any difficulties with prednisone and ethanol.  However, I am not an addiction specialist so there may be issues with prednisone and recovery that I am not aware of.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "At first glance I would wonder about fibromyalgia.  It is not a specific disease but a syndrome of problems that interfere with functioning as you would like.  Generally it is described as being widespread pain with or without other symptoms.  It might feel like muscle soreness that would come after exercise but this comes without actually doing it.    There are screening procedures to diagnose but no specific definitive single test.  Sensitivity at certain trigger points cause one to lean toward this diagnosis.  Treatments aim at improving comfort and often consist of moderate exercise, and sometimes medications such as antidepressants that tend to help you sleep better.  Sleep impairment is a common symptom and it is not known if the pain is aggravated by not enough rest or if the body is unable to rest due to the pain.  Kind of a chicken and egg situation.    A rheumatologist would be the specialty area you should seek, although a family doctor might be good at diagnosing this as well.  A person may suspect it but it takes a doctor familiar with this condition to give a more sure diagnosis.  If you find this is what you have you may also benefit from a support group where others who suffer share what works for them.  I have focused on fibromyalgia because this is one fairly common cause of muscle pain.  That is not to say there might not be other problems causing this.  Other conditions include lupus, arthritis, and other less common problems.  Good luck in getting to the bottom of this troubling concern.\n\n",

You may need some more specialized nerve testing.  Unfortunately I really can't explain what may be causing your pain, especially with a normal MRI.  If it has been a little while repeating the MRI may be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Most of them are tiny dots, but there are a few that are a few millimeters thick. If I poke them, they pull back into the skin, then come back out in a few seconds. They are not raised. I'm just wondering what these things are. They have been there for a while now. I do have high blood pressure. The only place I've seen them is on my upper arms. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Stjimmy,  If I am understanding you correctly, when you press on these dots they loose their red color then subsequently regain the redness.  This is called blanching.    If the spots blanch they are likely to be either a rash or possibly some capillary beds that are near the skin.  Given that you say they have been present for a while I suspect that these may be small capillary beds near the skin (known as capillary hemangiomas).  These are harmless.  I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at this when you're in the office next time.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi-    I am 33 years old and after having my 2nd child at the end of January I developed pain in both of my hands/wrists to the pint that I could barely hold a fork.  It lasted maybe a week and went away, so I ignored it.  The pain came back about 2 months later and was also in my feet/ankles.  Went to my doc and they did bloodwork which showed a lyme positive titer--2 IGMs positive and 1 IGG.  Tried Ceftin which was hard on my stomache and switched to amoxicillin (TID for 2 weeks) as I was breastfeeding.  Symptoms went away and came back in late June and I was treated with the same regimen.   Hand pain/stiffness returned in late September as well as feet/ankles, but hands are the worst.  My knees sometimes ache as well.  I am stiff as a poker for a few hours when I wake up and heat seems to help the most. Went to my new doc as we moved and she was concerned about RA as she felt my knuckles look red/puffy.  All of my bloodwork is normal now except for 2 positive IGM lyme bands.  Went to a rheumatologist and he is unsure as well.  I have lost some dexterity in my hands now and drop things, as well as have trouble opening things, turning door knobs , etc.  Could this just be lyme arthritis?  Thanks--I feel like I am 90!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tempifern,  The usual treatment for lyme disease is an antibiotic called doxycycline although amoxicillin is considered an acceptable alternative.  Occasionally, in more severe cases some doctor would recommend 14-21 days of IV antibiotics to fully treat the infection.  Lyme disease is well know to cause severe joint pain.  Rheumatoid arthritis also does fit your symptoms.    You may want to see an infectious disease specialist to get an expert opinion about the lyme disease issue and seeing a rheumatologist can help answer the RA question.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Now it seems my entire body is falling apart..I ache all over and my thighs ache and burn. What is this? and how do I make it stop since I don't have back-up to do the physical things here I just can't get \"old\". I had my thyroid removed a couple of years ago and I am doubtful I am getting enough meds for that. Armour 60 mg.daily and Sythroid 25 MCG.  I did feel better on 90 mg Armour and no Sythroid but my dr. insisted on adding Sythroid and reducing the Armour. He said I would have a heart attack if it stayed the way it was when I felt better. Finding a doctor who prescribes on symtoms and not blood tests is a very impossible task. I do take neurotin for back pain since i had two surgeries. This person living in pain is not me since as my family says or said about me \"to get her to sit still we would have to tie her to a chair\". I am not over weight at all so it can't be stress from weight on the joints. Can these ortho or arthritis issues just appear after years of not dealing with them?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Btdawgh,  Unfortunately our bodies wear out over time.  It is certainly possible that now your joints are beginning to wear out and cause pain (termed osteoarthritis).  It may also be that your body is attacking itself such as with a condition like rheumatoid arthritis.  Having low thyroid makes everything work poorly so I would recommend you have this evaluated.  The best measure of proper thyroid levels is the hormone TSH.  If your TSH level is normal you are getting enough/not too much thyroid hormone.  With my patients I generally use levothyroxine (synthroid) and not armor, simply because of a choice I have made, so I am not familiar enough with Armour to comment on its side effects.  I would recommend you see your primary doctor for a general evaluation to work this up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Unexplained Hand Pain and more...",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 31 year old male computer progrmmer in reasonably good physical shape.  No family history of any illnesses. Not on any long term medications, other than a multi vitamin.  12 years ago, during a period of heavy computer use, I experienced severe pain and loss of function in both hands that come on over a period of 3 days.  A general practice Dr. thought it was Carpal Tunnel, and Ortho thought RA was much more likely.  At the time I had no health insurance and did not follow up for more diagnosis.  Braces on the wrists had no effect, but a 2 week dose of prednisone relieved 90% of the symptoms.  I have had manageable hand discomfort ever since, never quite enough to make me seek treatment.  Discomfort does occasionaly extends to the pinky area, but never past the wrists.  My hand strength is \"ok\", but not what it should be.  It is always best in the morning, and my hands get worse in the evenings.  I don't have effects from the carpal tunnel hand position tests.  I've never had any hand coordination issues.  3 weeks ago,  I noticed wrist sorness and then a lump/cyst/nodule coming out of my right wrist between the thumb and the pulse location.  It is bone hard, immobile, and does not hurt when it is pushed.  At the same time I started experiencing bilateral pain in both hands very similar to what happened 12 years ago.  In addition, for the past month I have had several periods of just not feeling great.  Almost like I'm coming down with something, but never get sick.  I've never measured a fever.  Went to general practice Dr, who put me on 1 week of prenisone and did general arthritic/lupus/liver tests.  Within hours of taking the prenisone I noticed a reduction in hand pain and an increase in hand stength.    After a couple days, however I started to notice spreading of symptoms.  Pain spurts I have never had before from my ankles, a couple knuckles, stiffness in my knees, and a shift in pain of my hands to a more wrist centric pain.  I don't have morning stiffness, in fact I feel almost normal in the mornings but by lunch it is bothersome, by 5pm I have significant pain.  Every day I was feeling worse than the day before.  I did take 4 days off the the computer during this period.  I don't have any visibly swollen joints or other visible signs other than the cyst/nodule on my wrist.  At end of prednisone dose, went back to the Dr. for the blood test reults.  Everything in my blood work perfect! He couldn't find any issues at all!  It was very frustrating for me, because the doctor didn't seem to have any idea and even seemed to suggest it might be in my head!!  In the one week since then, I still have most of the symptoms, although they have not worsened further.  I'm finding that alcohol has an almost magical effect on my pain/stiffness and have significantly increased my consumption.  I have a followup with an Ortho in 1 month, he wants me to see a Neurologist, but I have to have the ortho refer me for it to be covered.  I am having a very very hard time performing my job right now and just don't know what to do... :(  Thanks for any advice...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Island_Thinker,  This is a bit puzzling.  The diffuse symptoms and response to prednisone do fit a rheumatologic type of an illness; however, these diseases are almost always much worse in the morning-particularly rheumatic arthritis.  You may have some inflammation of the joints that is slowly irritated as the day goes on with continued use of the joints.  This could still potentially be a rheumatologic process.  Seeing a neurologist is reasonable.  I would also recommend that you see a rheumatologist for further evaluation of this.  I cannot explain why alcohol would improve the condition.    I really can't come up with a cause that fits your symptoms well.  I wish I could be of more help to you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good morning. I'm a 48 year old female with diabetes (last A1C at 6.0 three months ago) that has had a problem during the past month with my left thumb locking up, almost feeling out of joint, while I sleep. There is no pain involved, just a 'heaviness' in the joint that sometimes I can pull to pop it, but other times it remains that way for a few hours.   I thought it may be from the way I was sleeping in bed, but last night purposely slept on the recliner and awoke this morning with the same thing. It is not 'locked' in the sense that I would consider locked. It just seems to feel out of joint.  Unfortunately I have no family history as I am adopted, but as a child broke all of my fingers (and toes) being very active in sports.  I am right handed so my left is not used as much. No changes in my physical activity have recently occurred. I'm on Weight Watchers (for the past year) so my diet consists of a lot of whole foods and good nutrition with only good fats to facilitate my body. The only thing that has changed is that I have stopped working in the corporate world and am running a very small business with my husband - enjoying every minute of it!  As this is my first post, I've included everything that I can think of. I'd appreciate any information that you can give before I see a doctor - if I need to. I see so many specialists to keep my diabetes under tight control that I thought I'd try this avenue first.  Thanks so much for your expertise!!  Sharon\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sugarsharon,  I'm not sure exactly what may be causing this.  The description of it happening in the mornings sounds suspicious for rheumatoid arthritis but it seems that it would be an odd presentation to just affect one thumb and not have pain.  Similarly, osteoarthritis would be expected to be painful.    There may be a problem with one of the cartilage pads of the joint that is getting \"caught\" in the joint creating the locking sensation.  I would recommend you discuss this with your primary doctor.  A good place to start would be doing some x-rays of the thumb to see if there are any bony problems.    Seeing an orthopedic specialist may also be beneficial.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 year old female that has been experiencing many many almost disabiling symptoms. In January I began to notice that it felt as though my right leg would go to sleep, this would happen everyday. Then in February, the end of February, I noticed that it went to sleep, and it seemed as though it stayed that way for weeks. I also suffer with swallowing difficulties, not only when medication but things such as breads, cereals, chips and certain meats. I now have burning sensations almost all over my body. At first my doctor (general practitioner) was afraid it could have been lupus or ms. I have severe headaches, achy joints in every possible place, swelling in my right leg and ankle, slight fever, swollen glands, elevated blood pressure, difficulty urinating (I urinate maybe 1 time a day), severe brain fog, and problems concentrating and with memory. I also have trouble at times turning pages in books, buttoning up clothes, picking things up without dropping them. I also keep all kinds of upper respiratory things such as rhinitis, pneumonitis, and bronchitis. I also have trouble actually getting up after sitting or laying down for some time, I have been tested for MS, and it is always consistent and negative, so my neurologist referred me to a rheumatologist, but it is not until October 23rd. With this in mind, I went while I had pneumonitis and asked my GP to do bloodwork, the results are as followed.   ANA -- 107  ESR -- 8  ASO -- 515. 5  C REactive -- 1. 5   It is possible for me to have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis. My GP is really scared that I might have both after the bloodwork, so he referred me to a different rheumatologist. This rheumatologist was excellent, not as good as my GP, but good. He did more testing for RA and SLE. He also diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia, Myonclonus, and Hypermobility Syndrome. Please Help me.  I am now seeing eight doctors, one of which is an Orthopedist, and after my MRI of my spine stated he was concerned with either RA on Ankylosing Spondylitis.  Could it be either of these.  I also have a possible MCTD diagnosis, which one do you think is more likely?  And if MCTD which diseases would you suspect?  Thanks so much for your help.\n\n",

I had a blood clot in march or somewhere in that area that was taken care of by a shot of heparin, the cat scan showed I was clear of this.  Right now I have a rotating joint pain, never last too long in one area, goes from knees to arms to back to chest.  I have severe pain in my chest when laying down or standing on both sides of the chest.  I have a sore on my nose and any time I eat anything that is hot not spicy just hot, I feel like my whole face is on fire.  My skin feels like it is on fire from my shoulders to my fingers, it feels like I am burning from the inside out.  It is burning so bad that since 8pm last night I have drank 8 bottles of water and it is not helping.  I have not eaten anything spicy and have tried heartburn stuff but nothing helps.  It is almost like a rash is breaking out and feels like a sunburn on the inside.  I have suffered from this for a long time but it has got worse the past few days.  It burns so bad and I don't know what to do.  I am in so much pain but have not been able to get help from anywhere, I am hoping that you can help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ny2125,  It may very well be that you have injured a muscle or tendon in the hand causing your pain.  With rest this should improve slowly over several days to weeks.  If the numbness/odd feelings involve the thumb, index, middle and 1/2 the ring finger (the side near the middle finger) you may have some compression of the median nerve in the wrist (carpal tunnel syndrome).  This should be evaluated for by your doctor if you think you may have this.  Anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, can help reduce swelling, pain and inflammation but be careful not to over do it while the pain is blocked from the medicine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "This might not be the right area to post this topic so feel free to move it to the right forum. I'm a 21 year old female with a lot of medical issues since i was a baby to the point that I was tested for Alport and Turner syndromes which both came negative. I have diabetes [diagnosed at age 20] and Celiac diagnosed at same age. After being diagnosed with Diabetes I began having leg pain which was diagnosed as neuropathy simply because I have diabetes. One doctor saw me and reviewing my past diagnoses of having neurodegenerative disease he said he did not think it was neuropathy and that he thought this was something related to the spine. After that I began having pain on my left ribcage, at first it was a pinching pain in the front of the ribcage every now and then, eventually i realized the left ribcage seemed to  have come off its place basically it looks as if there was something swollen underneath that is pushing the rib out. I was put on heartburn meds which did not help much, eventually i ran out of meds and didnt take them anymore. Now after a year the pain is getting worse and worse and I have noticed that [on my right leg which has \"neuropathy\"] the pain comes from the back and runs down the buttock  and i have started getting that same feeling on the left leg at times as if the nerve was being bothered.   Now i have constant lower back pain, back pain at the same region where my ribcage hurts and only sometimes pain by the shoulderblade on the back, my left arm seems to have been affected also as it feels weaker than the right arm, i've also experienced some neck pain and in the past few days pain on my side between my ribs and the hips sometimes radiating to the hips... what bothers me the most though is the ribcage which is very very painful when i lay on it as if it were pushing on the inside organs... what is the smartest test to have done for this? should i have an MRI or CT scan to rule out any internal organ inflammation [such as spleen] or does this sound more like a spine problem or bone problem? would an MRI also check for spine problems? please let me know what this sounds like or any idea as to what it could be.   Also, could such a pain be from an ulcer and not related to the leg pain? it seems like the sharpest pain is relieved by antacids now [but not in the beginning when i was taking prevacid] but even with antacids there is still a great deal of pain.  thank you AJ\n\n",

If imaging is needed an MRI will probably be most helpful.  It may be that your rib pain is due to a nerve issue similar to your leg pain.  The neurologist should be able to help sort this out.

    "content": "Hi Acousticgurl,  Most people use a set of 11 diagnostic criteria to diagnose lupus.  Having 4 of the eleven is considered diagnostic.  The ANA being positive is only one of the criteria.    Most people with lupus do have a + ANA; however, it is possible to have lupus without being ANA +.  Based on your description it sounds like you have the following criteria met: 1) arthritis 2) mucositis (based on the sores in your nose/mouth) 3) a malar rash (butterfly type rash on the nose and cheek bones)  There are a few others that are less certain but you may also meet the finding of photosensitivity (although a strict definition of this is getting a rash in sun exposed areas).  I would recommend that you see a rheumatologist for further evaluation.  There are some other lab diagnostic criteria (including other antibodies and changes on the CBC) that should be evaluated for also.  Getting a rheumatologist's opinion will be the best way to formally make this diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, i am a 24 year old female that has been experiencing many many almost disabiling symptoms.  In January I began to notice that it felt as though my right leg would go to sleep, this would happen everyday.  Then in February, the end of February, I noticed that it went to sleep, and it seemed as though it stayed that way for weeks.  I also suffer with swallowing difficulties, not only when medication but things such as breads, cereals, chips and certain meats.  I now have burning sensations almost all over my body.  At first my doctor (general practitioner) was afraid it could have been lupus or ms.  I have severe headaches, achy joints in every possible place, swelling in my right leg and ankle, slight fever, swollen glands, elevated blood pressure, difficulty urinating (i urinate maybe 1 time a day), severe brain fog, and problems concentrating and with memory.  I also have trouble at times turning pages in books, buttoning up clothes, picking things up without dropping them.  I also keep all kinds of upper respiratory things such as rhinitis, pneumonitis, and bronchitis.  I also have trouble actually getting up after sitting or laying down for some time,  I have been tested for MS, and it is always consistent and negative, so my neurologist referred me to a rheumatologist, but it is not until October 23rd.  With this in mind, I went while I had pneumonitis and asked my GP to do bloodwork, the results are as followed.  ANA -- 107 ESR -- 8 ASO -- 515.5 C REactive -- 1.5  It is possible for me to have lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.  My GP is really scared that I might have both after the bloodwork, so he referred me to a different rheumatologist.  This rheumatologist was excellent, not as good as my GP, but good.  He did more testing for RA and SLE.  He also diagnosed me with Fibromyalgia, Myonclonus, and Hypermobility Syndrome.  Please Help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Thester6474,  Your symptoms do sound suspicious of a rheumatic illness.  I'm not convinced that it is SLE nor RA at this point.  From your description it doesn't sound like you meet criteria for SLE at this point.    Seeing a rheumatologist will be quite helpful in figuring this out.  These illnesses can be quite difficult to identify and a specialist is often needed.  I'm a little suprised that your CRP and ESR are essentially normal.  With most rheumatic diseases the inflammation in the body is significant causing these values to go up.  A post infectious reactive illness is also a possibility although the time course seems a little prolonged.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "First off , I think this is a wonderful site and thanks to all of you who take the time to answer our questions.     My problems consist of a disease that i contracted sexually from a woman about 9 years ago, I didnt know it at that time because whatever it is that I have takes along time to start showing.The reason i know that i got from her is because she looked awkward.now 9 years later i have the same awkward physical charateristics that she had. I wish i can show you all a before and after pic of me.     Many months after I slept with her i started developing canker sores around my legs and buttocks area and I didnt go to the dr. so it got worse. To the point that they were baseball sized soars and deep wounds goin 1/4 of an inch into my skin!      I didnt think it was an std cause ive been tested for them on many occasions and always came out negative , finally i went to the dermatologist and they said it was foliculitus and gave me amoxicillin 500g like twice a day or something. The soars cleared up but then internally everything went downhill.     I don't want to make this too long so ill try to sum it up in a few paragraphs. As time went on i was diagnosed with rhuematiod arthritus cause of my joints. My skin started changing(more freckles more wrinkles)Im 27 I contracted this when I was like 17 this has been going on for that long. Ive been to mayo clinic 2 years ago and they did nothing for me because my blood work would come out good,and physically i still looked normal.  HERES THE CRAZY PART--- after i left mayo they gave me antibiotcs to fight a stomach virus i had. So i was taking it and one day i took two of them at once and they got lodged in my throat! so after awhile i started puking and a couple hours later. I looked up at a window cause it was still daylight, and youll never believe this, I seen a worm,.......I freaked! now this was about two years ago and i still see them now but they look exactly like a parasite when you look through a microscope. they are somewhat  transparent wich tells me theyre very small. I see them clearly when i look at white or bright backgrounds(the sky, a white paper,snow) I went to an optamologist and of course he couldnt see it.           He asked me questions like have i ever been to africa and all that.  They tried to write them off as floaters. I know what floaters and i know what worms look like! I have so many physical symptoms that i wont get into becuase the forum says try not to make this topic too long.  so anyways its gotten worse, a more recent rhuematolgist diagnosed me with \"ehlers danlos syndrome\" I believe he is close and he says ill live till im 80, i look like im 50 years old right now!i know what it is ,its  a virus that feeds on my connetive tissue but i cant prove it!! and i plan on going back to mayo because my appearance and rapid deterioration is undeniable. Now ppl actually stop in their tracks just to look at me. Im looking like a monster, my face is saggin my body skin is just dangling from my body it looks like i got shoulder pads on because i do labor work and its pullin my shoulders apart.Im a man and my chest is starting to look like breast! im near the end and contemplating giving up. Im sure anyone else would  if they were in my position.   how can i prove this to these dr.s is there a reason why this virus doesnt show in my blood test. did all the antibiotics ive taken masked this disease.Is there a way that i can test my connective tissue. does the  optamologist need a stronger microscope to see the virus.  thanks again for your time and for reading all this I look forward to your response.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your quick response, I appreciate your help.   I also never heard of an std like this. Like I said its never showed on any std tests that Ive taken. Around 4 years into this disease I met my wife. At that time I knew something was wrong with me but I had taken proper test that said I was clean. So i went on with the relationship not knowing that is was transmittable. Now ive never cheated on my wife and ive changed my life 100% since being with her. Now she is displaying the same symptoms I displayed in the early stages of this disease. I figure once its obvious enough in both of us noone can deny whats happening but will it be too late?   Also a woman ive slept it before I met my wife displays the same physical characteristics. This virus attacks the connective tissue , is that the reason why it doesnt show up in blood test?   I had a skin biopsy along time ago by a dermatologist when they diagnosed me with folliculitus but i believe they were looking for skin cancer.    whatever it is that i have i know that its rare and hard to detect. i will work on gettin a skin biopsy test.   Thanks again Dr.\n\n",

Current medications include Synthroid, Toprol XL and Yasmin.  I have difficulty swallowing as well as other syptoms which include: dry mouth, dry eyes, frequent mouth ulcers, chronic sore throat, fequent headaches, metallic taste in my mouth (sometimes), white tongue (sometimes), achy joints, feeling as thought I am short of breath and fatigue.  I have seen many different specialists and had many tests which include:Barium swallow, modified barium swallow, endoscopy, lip biopsy and laryngoscope.  All results have been negative.  I am currently seeing a rhuematologist and am waiting for blood results.  My previous blood work showed elevated ANA 1:640 speckled and 1:320 centromere.  I was tested for Sjogren's but of course that was negative. The difficulty swallowing is more of a hesitation at the onset of swallowing.  I can swallow, but sometimes I have to concentrate and remind myself in that moment that I can.  I have lost about 14 lbs. from not being able to eat at times.   This has been going on so long that I wonder if anyone will ever figure it out.  I have no family history of anything remarkable.  My mother has OA and fibromyalgia. Any help will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "bulging disc C6/numbness of left arm/burning sensation",
    "content": "I am a 33 year old female. I have been diagnosed with a bulging disc at C6 that is impeding on the left root nerve and slightly into my spinal cord. This was caused by a rear end car accident on April 4th of this year. I had \"whiplash\" as well. A possible concussion, an MRI was done on both brain and neck which revealed the bulging disc and possible concussion though I was told it was an old injury. The MRI also shown that C2&C3 are fused into one, presumed congenital fusion.   a short medical history which pertains to the neck and brain...  at age 4 I was struck by a car on the left side of my head resulting in a broken jaw and an unknown brain injury.  I know that I was unconscious for 3 days I do not know the full details. I also received over 1300 stitches in cosmetic reconstruction to the left side of my mouth and chin Was diagnosed with dyslexia after the accident.  at age 16 was taken to emergency room for muscle spasm on the left side of my neck and back. Was put on skulaxin for a year.  at age 22 I had a mild Seizure and syncope while in line skating.  I saw a neurologist after EEG he found a slight aura in the brain. An MRI was done to rule out a tumor as the cause the MRI was \"normal\" I was not diagnosed with epilepsy and was not prescribed anticonvulsant medications   at age 24 started seeing a chiropractor because of migraines and pain in my neck and shoulders. the fused vertebra were discovered at this time but no cause, I though it would have been from the first car accident, was told differently by the chiropractor  The rest of my medical history includes at least 3 other surgeries, 1 non-surgical hospitalization for 1 week with influenza, bronchitis, and another illness I do not recall it's name.   The Current injury:  I was first seen at the hospital right after the accident was given diagnosis of cervical sprain and released with pain meds and ibuprofen.  I then after the intense pain over the weekend went to see my chiropractor, whom has been the sole care provider of my current injuries. He has not referred me to anyone else. I'm not sure I have been given a full prognosis as I feel he doesn't want to influence my recovery. He has put me on home neck traction with an inflatable device which I use for 20 mins then icing the area for 20 mins. I sometimes take ibuprofen but am reluctant to take it more than once a day because it upsets my stomach when I am on it for too long. I often ask my mother who is a BSN and also has a neck fusion at c6 and c7 how she deals with her injury [her neck was broken in a car accident]. I try not to burden her with too many questions but most of her answers lead me to believe there really isn't much else I can do.   Moving into the 4th month after this current accident I am feeling a lot of numbness, tingling and burning in the left side of my face and ear, neck and arm and hand. I feel the sensations in my arm on the topside of the arm not the underside. The burning is currently radiating out of my neck where the injury is located. The more active I am the worse it gets, driving makes it worse because I have to use my left arm more and look to the left to change lanes.  I have trouble lifting more than 40lbs at the gym , if I go over 40 my hands both right and left go numb, my grip is not what it used to be in both right and left worse in the left.   Everything I read online tells me that any symptoms lasting after 6 weeks equals need for surgery. Though I feel most of these sites are pitching a surgery for profit. I do not want another surgery. My mother's surgeries left her with numbness and some pain. I've read and talked about steroid shots to reduce the swelling, but only as a temporary fix.   My questions:   Can I expect this to improve with what I am doing or do I need to see an MD?   Are there any homeopathic remedies [non-surgical] that I can utilze that might relieve the numbness, tingling and weakenss in my arms?    If I leave things as they are are there any long term effects I need to be concerned or aware of like nerve damage in my arm?   If I need to see a specialist which one?  What questions should I be asking of the chiropractor and or an MD?   I am assuming at this point I am looking at a permanent injury. I just want to find some relief and a prospect of less rather than more discomfort. Any ideas answers or suggestions are greatly appriciated. I do understand that this is for advice only not diagnosis and treatment. I need some direction to be sure I am getting the full picture of treatments that are available to me.   Thank you very much, Tammy\n\n",

    "content": "This must be very frustrating for you.  I will give a few suggestions here.  When it comes to taking ibuprofen, you are correct that it can cause stomach trouble.  But, when you take a dose that is too low to do any good, you are exposing yourself to the stomach upset without getting the benefit of the drug.  If you want it to work, you need to get it in the therapeutic range.    An alternative to this might be another anti-inflammatory such as diclofenac sodium (Voltaren) that is available by prescription but which may cause less stomach irritation.  You could also try alternative medicine such as acupuncture.  Many people are finding this to be helpful for chronic pain and some insurance companies are even starting to cover it.    Steroids are an option and if you don't find relief with one or two they would not pursue that line of treatment anyway because it is not recommended repeatedly.  But, it is possible that a couple of these could help.    There are also specialized physical therapists who sometimes have success even when others have not.  You would have to ask your doctor if he/she knows anyone like this.  It's all about experience and specialization.  Some are better than others for particular problems.      Chronic pain clinics also can sometimes help in cases such as yours.  You may try calling a local hospital to inquire about whether or not there is something like that in your area.    Doctors to consider would be orthopedists, neurologists and rheumatologists I would think, along with any who specialize in chronic pain issues.  I would definitely investigate some of these options.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jackindabox,  Compartment syndromes often will develop from overuse injuries of the muscles.  If caught early, physiotherapy and complete rest may be helpful.    Unfortunately, with each episode of acute pain the inflammation that results can cause the fascial layers to thicken, worsening the problem.  In chronic cases, physiotherapy is less likely to be successful.  In these cases surgery often becomes necessary.  I would recommend you see an orthopedic surgeon for an evaluation if you are able.  Until then, resting as much as possible will minimize worsening of the compartment syndrome.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife is 23 years of age. She has been diagnosed with Insulin Resistance, and although she has not been diagnosed with PCOS, she does present all the symptoms of PCOS. She is taking metformin for her Insulin Resistance.  Now onto the undiagnosed problems she has been having. Around when she was age 19, she had started getting pain in her right hip. The pain was there off and on laying down, walking, ext... Then around age 21.. she developed back pain along with her hip pain.. Now at age 23, the pain is just about everywhere, but still the hip and back are the most dominant of the pain. The pain even goes to the wrists sometimes, and of lately she gets pain in her tailbone, which makes it hard to sit. The dr she has been seeing ran  blood tests in the past 2 years that she has been seeing him. He has yet to give a diagnosis for this condition.  Here is what was high on the blood tests : CRP: 1/27/06 - 1.21       MG/DL                        3/31/06 - 1.06       MG/DL          12/21/06 - 1.12     MG/DL  Uric Acid : 1/27/06 - 9.4    MG/DL                            3/31/06 - 8.4   MG/DL                   12/21/06 - 10.0 MG/DL    SED Rate:  12/21/06 - 38  MM/HR  MPV : 9/24/05 - 12.2      FL           1/27/06 - 13.4      FL           3/31/06 - 11.8      FL           12/21/06 - 11.8    FL           2/02/07 - 11.3      FL   As you can see by the blood tests CRP and Uric Acid has been steadily high for nearly 2 years. SED rate has only been checked once.  Her pain, which she is not sure if its joint pain and/or muscle weakness. She feels sometimes that she has weak muscles which appears seperate from the joint pain. Also cold weather appears to make her hurt worse. When ever she goes to the store with me, she can only walk maybe 10 to 15 minutes at the most before she needs to sit down, because she says her back hurts. She describes the back pain as feeling like someone is snapping her spine. The pain almost makes her want to pass out if she doesnt find a place to sit down quickly. It is driving us crazy not getting a diagnosis for this. And we have done so so much research for all of this, because the dr is not helping. We have strong speculations of what she may have, but I rather not say it here because I want to hear what you have to say about this.  As for family history, her dad and her grandma both had diabetes. Her mother is still living and recently was diagnosed with Lymphoma.  We are at the end of our wits and appreciate any help you can give us.. We don't have insurance and cant afford to go from one dr to another. So if you speculate any diagnosis please do let us know so we can get some idea of what is going on.  Once again, thanks for taking the time to read this and I eagerly wait your reply!  -Eric and Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 year old bi-racial female (black &white) with severe burning sensations throughout the entirety of my body.  I first started experiencing problems in January with my right leg going numb/sleep everyday for hours at the time.  In mid January, i noticed that my right leg went numb and stayed that way for about 2 or 3 weeks.  Eventually it subsided.  However, in late february it started again, and this time it was my entire right side.  I went to my GP, and he stuck me with the tips of 2 q-tips, one was sharp and the other one smooth.  He said on my right side I got each test wrong.  I was unable to distinguish between the sticks on the right side, but could on my left.  He immediately referred me to a neurologist asking if I had any relatives with MS or Lupus.  My symptoms soon worsened.  My right side began to have extreme burning sensations.  I also began to have problems with my grip, memory, word recall, blurred vision, severe headaches, trouble with concentration, fatigue, extremely painful menstuation lasting 7 to 8 days, and nausea.  After months of going to a neurologist he refers me to a rheumatologist stating that my illness  was out of his field of study.  My last MRI states I have I have mild focal kyphosis of the cervical spine, mild loss of intervertebral disc signal intensity suggesting mild early degenerative disc desiccation, mild central canal stenosis secondary to mild annular bulging.  I also have been diagnosed with osteopenia and scoliosis.  He has started me on B-12 injections stating my B-12 levels were extremely low.  Could this be a possible rheumatic or neurological disease.  I have an appointment with a rheumatologist, but it is not until October 23rd.  We do not have many of them in southeast Georgia.  I also have started seeing a second neurologist, which has an brain MRI scheduled for this friday afternoon stating that MS is his main concern.  If this is a possible rheumatic condition, which one(s) does it fit?  I really need some help.\n\n",

I was told this was probably RA and given NSAID's and Lasix for it.   The first couple of years the symptoms seemed to come for a few weeks or months at a time and then disappear. Since November of 2006 it is constant and seems to be getting much worse.   Over time I now have a sudden weight gain of 20 lbs in 3 wks (in Feb) though I am very active and eat well. I have extreme muscle weakness, fatigue, muscle and joint pain, nerve damage (hands, arms, feet and legs), stiffness and joint swelling at wrists, elbows, knees, constant low grade fever, edema, dizziness, lack of concentration, poor circulation resulting in my feet turning cold and blue at times and my toe nails turning black and falling off, mood swings, very low blood pressure ranging from 90-100 over 50/60.  I get strange rashes that come and go mainly on my lower legs, arms and sometimes face. I have recently missed 2 wks of work for being too weak to walk at all and move my left arm, leg without assistance, accompanied by 2 days of slurred speech and confusion.   My labs are a positive ANA, anemia (Hemoglobin is 9.2 on a 11.5 min.range) , high Sed Rate. All others are fairly normal. My sugar is always normal. My cholesterol is low. I recenly went to a cardiologist and have a heart murmer with an ejection fraction of 54 my stress test was normal.   I am currently taking Lasix 20mg, Synthroid .88mcg, Lodine XL 600mg, all 1 tab daily, Topamax 50mg 1 tab nightly (for Neuropathy).  I can not seem to get a diagnosis for this, I get a lot of maybe's but nothing solid. Does this sound like Lupus or something else?\n\n",

    "content": "Female 27 yrs.  HI sorry for the length of my post :-)  I have been having pelvic, back and neck pain for around 2 yrs now. Has been bearable but now as it is causing a lot of pain nausea and dizzyness depending on how I position my back, pelvis & neck! The first time i experienced pain was before I gave birth to my daughter in 2004. My GP advised it was siatica. I went on to have a forceps delivery and epidural pain relief. Before the epdiural was administered the anaesatist commented how he wasnt sure he could do it as it looked like my spine wasnt lining up correctly. He made me drop one hip lower than the other in order for the correct position to be adopted and then it was done. After the birth I had trouble walking for around three months as it felt like my pelvis was going to crack!!! As time went on my walking was ok but regular pain of the pelvis bone and pain exactly where to epidural was put in (not the bone but the space inbetween). It is only recently the pain seems to travel to my neck and I get the dizzyness - like when you are about to faint. Looking down often sends me dizzy, as does sitting with my legs crossed. When I have the pelvis pain it feels like my legs are going to buckle under me as the pelvis feels so painful and like a lead weight.   I had an accident when I was 15yrs old where I slipped and landed on my coccyx. I never had an xray but spend 4/5 months unable to walk. Could this have contributed to what is happening?  I have been referred to a neurologist and due to have an MRI scan of my head and neck due to the dizzyness. My GP mentioned the sensation of my legs buckling under me but did not mention the pain to the consultant. I will do so when i return after my scan.  I appreciate anyones comments?  Lindsey   As time went on\n\n",

    "content": "It is very possible that you developed a fracture or misalignment due to your fall several years ago that now is causing some arthritis and irritation of nerves in your back.    You may also want to check to see if your legs are the same length.  In some people, the legs are just slightly different lengths.  This, over time, can cause significant pain and alignment problems with the spine.  Fortunately, the leg length issues can be corrected with orthotics.  Along with an MRI of the head/neck you should probably have an MRI of your lower spine/hips as well to get a good look at what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I could really use your expert opinion.  I live in a shared space community where almost everyone loves gardening and landscaping.  However, there is a woman with lupus who claims that mold in everything from soil to mulch gives her trouble.  She's asked for some accommodations that reduce the amount of landscaping projects near her home - especially those that are in the path of the main wind patterns.  She claims she cannot be on steroids because of her intolerance to synthetic pharmaceuticals and the long-term dangers and risks.  Some people here really want to consider her health whereas others don't think that the gardening, etc. harms her as much as she claims.  Could you answer a few questions?  Can a person with lupus/MCS get headaches, tissue pain, rashes, congestion, facial pain, swelling, insomnia, respiratory problems and bleeding in the lungs from the mold in exposed soil?  Could these symptoms continue beyond the day of exposure?  Can wind affect these reactions?  Can straw,  mulch, compost and composted manure cause these reactions?  Isn't spring already so moldy that adding these sources wouldn't do much to her?  She claims to have so much pain and we're wondering if she's exaggerating.  Can you clarify this mystery?\n\n",

    "content": "This is a tough case.  A solid argument could potentially be made for both sides of the issue.  Allergens, such as molds and seasonal allergies, could potentially induce the immune system to make more antibodies and as such worsen the rheumatic diseases.  I am not aware of any data showing this to be true; however, theoretically it is possible.  The flip side of the coin is that there is mold basically everywhere and attempts to reduce it are generally unsuccessul, so would gardening or landscaping worsen the issue?  It is difficult to say that it would and just as difficult to say that it would not.  Here in Arizona, we have a fungus known as coccidiotis immitis (valley fever).  The fungus lives in the soil and infection cases increase significantly following windy conditions or in places where the dirt is being disturbed (such as in construction areas).  Regarding the inability to take steroids, this is an issue I cannot comment on as I do not know this patients medical history.  In general, intolerance of steroids is very rare but does exist.  Best wishes in resolving this issue.\n\n",

Got a steroid shot in the foot, and was started on Prednisone 30, 25, 20, 15, and then 10 mg daily until my next appt in 2 weeks.  Says it's RA since I don't have psoriasis or crohn's disease.  Can anyone tell me what to expect next?  Is prednisone usually given long term.  I don't really think I want to take it for very long.  Is it just for acute flares and then maybe Methotrexate?  I've heard it is very hard to get off prednisone once it is started because the swelling returns.  Anyone with any experience with newly diagnosed RA, I would love if you could tell me anything you can.  Or any MD's/ RN's out there I hope you will respond.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 22 year old female and when I was 15 years old I was told I have Fibromyalgia and was put on pain killers and they really seemed to help me and I was also getting Massages. The whole time though I have felt acid in my muscles. When I was 18 years old and moved to a new state I went to the doctor and was told that I was just a drug addict and was taken off the medication. My feelings were so hurt because I felt like nobody understood my pain and that it was not my fault that teenagers taking pill was that big things in high school. I have not gone to a doctor since I was 18 years old and I have lived in pain everyday since. I take hot baths, getting my boyfriend to massage me and I take advil but nothing seems to help. I feel like I am really at the end of my rope and I want to go to a doctor for help. However I am scared that they will also feel that I am there just looking for drugs which I'm not. If a doctor was to tell me to stand on my head for 2 days and all of my pain would go away I would do it. My question is how do I get a doctor to see that just because I am 22 years old that I can be in true pain and really get some help?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Spark, It would help possibly to know some other details about you and your normal state of health.  How old are you?  Do you have any medical problems? When you say physical activities,what kind of activities are you referring to? Muscle strains can cause muscle spasms.Deficiencies in certain electrolytes in your system can contribute (you hit part of that one on the head by eating bananas). Supplemental magnesium, calcium and potassium as part of a healthy vitamin regimen can help alleviate some muscle spasms.  Overusing a particular muscle that is not used to it can cause a strain that takes time to heal.  Certain medical conditions, and sometimes certain medications can have symptoms or side effects of muscle spasms.  If the spasms continue, you may wish to consider being seen at an urgent care center, local health clinic, or your private doctor if you have one.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi...I'm 29, female, and live in a violent household, which results in making me shake from getting nervous. Yesterday, there was another 'situation', and I got so nervous, that it was as if I was suddenly struck with my legs being too weak to walk. I could walk, but oh the effort it took! Today I woke up, (the 'situation' is now over--for the time being, anyway) and my legs hurt so bad that I limped all day at work. (Secretary, not a strenuous job.) I feel like I upped and ran a 20-mile marathon! My arms hurt too, (not as much--the right one is worse than the left) and when I move my abdomen muscles, they feel sore as if I've done situps!! This is so weird...the pain is pretty bad, not minor. The act of sitting and standing is really painful; in my legs, the worst pain is in my thighs.  I had a blood test in Feb, which showed my hgb (1 point) and hct (2 points) above the normal range, (which happens more often than not with those two) and surprisingly, my potassium was half a point below the normal range. The blood test I had before that (Nov) showed my platelets 4000 above the normal range, though they were normal in the Feb test. I have asthma and take the 2nd-level advair.  I just sat up from my bed to get these tests out of a nearby drawer, and could hardly indian-cross my legs from the pain. Any idea what this could be? Seems odd that 'mere' shaking could really cause this. My body feels like someone beat me to a pulp! I couldn't run right now if my life depended on it!  Thank you so much for your forums!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear D, I would be interested in knowing the results of your blood count tests over a period of time.With the limited information you are able to provide, i am considering polycythemia vera as a possible cause of your mixed complaints.  Polycythemia is a usually inherited disorder whereby your body manufactures more blood cells than normal. This could account for your elevated CBC and platelets, and the bone pain. There are simple blood tests that can help your primary MD to diagnose your disorder.  And there are treatment options available.  Therapeutic phlebotomy is one of these.  This is a simple procedure similar to donating blood, in which a unit of blood is withdrawn from the body for the purpose of lessening the amount of red blood cells in circulation.  In severe cases, more than one unit is withdrawn.  Your primary doctor can arrange both the tests, and if positive, the treatment.\n\n",

The good news is that  there are treatment options available now that can extend this time frame 10 to 20 years.  The complications of PV include the possibility of the development of  thromboses (clots),  hemmorhage, as well as pancytopenia.  It would be wise for you to secure medical intervention as soon as you are able.  A hematologist is the specialist you need to consult - as soon as possible.\n\n",

My arms feel very weak, and i feel like i need to have them rested alot.  It feel like i've constantly been lifting alot of weights.  The feeling is a little the same with my legs, but it's so little that i'm disregarding it.  I am not under any medication.  I feel tired alot, and unenergetic.   What could be wrong with me? Could it be due to the fact that almost a year ago, i lifted a very very heavy mirror with my husband? I remember that right after lifting it, my arms felt so heavy, almost dead.  I couldn't lift the lightest thing.  Any input is appreciated, Thanks\n\n",

I do not have any skin involvement at this time; but there is always \"sine scleroderma\". My question is, Should I be looking into other diseases other then scleroderma? The docotr has suspected lupus too because of the high ANA. If I have to start all over with two new doctors I want to make sure I am going to the right specialst. I will have to travel now because there are no specialist here now. Please help me with this, what other disease might have the SCL-70 antibodies other then scleroderma?

    "content": "I am 46 year old male with multiple symptoms that we are trying to get to the bottom of.  I have posted in the lymphoma thread because that's where my doctors were leaning.  I have drenching night sweats perhaps every 7 to 10 days.  I have daily ruq pain and fleeting luq pain.  I have splitting headaches, and neck pain.  I have had cat scans of the chest and abdomen,mri of the head and neck, hida test, infectious disease tests, and complete blood tests.  This is what they have found.  THree lesions of the liver, 2 hemangioma and one no dx, one lesion of the kidney no dx,  one hemangioma of the c6 vertebra, three hemangioma of the skull ( one was resected in Sept of 06 to relieve headaches as it was pressing against the dura ), one angioma of the temporal lobe, no lymph node involvement and no infectious disease.  The only thing that is out of the normal range is the ra factor.  It tested at 467 the first go round and 478 after the second test which was done to omit the chance of lab error.  I know this is a long drawn out process, but what could possibly be wrong with me with this ra factor test being the only thing coming back abnormal? My PCP is trying to get me in to see a Rheumatoligist but has not had any luck yet.  I have no swollen joints or joint pain but my hands do go to sleep especially the right one.  What questions should I have ready for the rheumatologist?  Current meds are 20 mg lexapro dailly,  lortab for the pain when it gets bad.  I don't drink and am monogamous.  Smoke about a 1/4 pack a day.  Thanks in advance for your response. Panaggie\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately I really don't have any great advice for you.  I have a few thoughts.  Rheumatoid factor is essentially a marker of autoimmune activity.  Several things can trigger it to be high.  Seeing a rheumatologist will be helpful to be able to get a better interpretation of what this means.  I am interested that you have so many hemangiomas.  There may be something to this that should be investigated also.  My last thought:  Where I trained, one of my mentors used to say \"If there is an issue, get tissue.\"  I suspect that the areas in your liver, kidney, etc. that cannot be identified likely hold some very good information for you.  You may need a biopsy of these lesions to help determine what is going on.  Best wishes.  I do hope you are able to come to a diagnosis soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I'm a 22 year old female and am desperate for an answer as to what's going on. (I posted a similar post in gastroenterology a while back)  I will try to make this as brief as possible, but here is my history:   *chronic constipation (My sitzmarker was normal though)  *Gastroparesis  *October of last year had my gallbladder removed. This was the toughest procedure of the surgery because it was badly inflamed. during this surgery I also had an enterocele repair, and a sigmoid resection/rectopexy to repair complete rectal prolapse  *13 days postop an MRI found many blood clots lodged in my hepatic portal vein. Put on coumadin until June  *blood test shows high amount of anticardiolipin antibodies, no C or S abnormalities  *In february began feeling mental symptoms: inability to concentrate, short term memory impairment, problems in judgement. went on zoloft to see if it was depression.  *all of the following tests were normal: liver panel, thyroid panel (done several times) BUN, blood counts, colonoscopy, small bowel transit, doppler flow ultrasound of the live, stool sample, and two celiac tests, ANA and sed rate  My question is: is there a chance I could have lupus or related disorder without a positive sed rate or ana? (I know this is rare)  my aunt, an arnp suspected it when I told her the state of my connective tissue in my abdomen. The surgeon described it as being \"pediatric\", extrememly weak.  In addition I have suffered crippling fatigue since my freshman year of college. I have chronic dry eyes, and vaginal dryness that is really bothersome  I also have patches of violet coloring on my skin...especially my legs. I believe this called purpura?  my fingers do occasionally turn blue but it's never as severe as what I've seen in other patients with reynauds  joint pain is very minimal: my fingers do get very swollen, especially in humid conditions, and they become very difficult to move. I get some mimimal knee pain but this is when i run, and my left elbow hurts upon weight lifting occasionally. I have back pain, always have abdominal pain. I get tingingling sensations in my big toes, and after working out I'll feel slightly numb in my legs. (it's not too bad though)  I am near-sighted and have very slight double vision.  I frequently faint for no apparent reason  I have slight alopecia (the dr does not think that this is coumadin-related but I don't know about that)  However, I have never had a mylar rash, never had abnormal kidney function, no heart abnormalities that I know of. My ankles never swell.    I take coumadin, zoloft, amitiza, reglan, miralax, and an antispasmdoic. Family history is mostly cardiac, with one aunt that has lupus. My diet is extremely healthy, I'm very active, and am not overweight.  would it be wise to seek advice from a rheumatologist?\n\n",

You are on several medications.  It is always wise to carefully review your medications and be sure that there are no interactions that may be causing your symptoms.  Having said this, your symptoms also do not rule out lupus or another rheumatologic disease.  The blood clots are unusual.  You may want to see a hematologist to look for any further coagulopathies that should be tested for.  It is important to follow up with your primary care doctor when you have a complicated case such as this.  This way your primary doctor can help coordinate the specialists you should see and make sure you are seeing the correct doctors.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I used amoxicillian and all the at home treatments. 3 weeks after I had it cut out I started to experiance pain from my lower ear down to my bottom jaw. I went to my dentist and he said that it was a muscle ache. It has been two weeks after that and I am experiancing pain in my ears, jaw, teeth and face. Everytime there is cold air it hurts so bad and I have taken alieve wich usually takes care of my knee arthritis but it just doesn't cut my facial pain. Now here is the strange part, the pain activates when I lie down to sleep. When I am up it still hurts but not nearly as much when I lie down. I thought it was TMJ so I bought a night guard and that only made things worse and I don't grind or clench my teeth that I know of. So my question is besides the obvious, What's going on?, is there such a thing as jaw and ear arthritis??? It sounds silly to me but that's the pain I would describe it as. A very sharp ache. I feel like I have a an ear ache in both ears and all my bottom teeth ache. I don't see my doctor until May and I would really like to know what I can do for myself and what this could be.

    "content": "The nerve that supplies the teeth is also connected (in a round about way) to the ear and jaw.  It is likely that your pain is in your jaw related to your teeth and is thus also causing some ear pain.  There are a few possible reasons for this.  It may be still related to your wisdom teeth surgery.  It may also be an indication of an underlying infection in the area.  It would be relatively rare to actually damage the nerve since it basically runs inside the bone of the jaw.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  If your pain worsens you should request to be seen sooner.  Also, if you can get in sooner it may mean the pain can be treated sooner.  In the mean time, antiinflammatories such as ibuprofen are likely to help the most.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Increasing body pains - fibromyalgia?",
    "content": "I sure hope I put this in the right place im sorry if I did not.  I am a 25 year old female.  I will start with my history.  When I was 14 I was diagnosed with Mononucleosis, this had me down for several months.  After recovering I noticed I was bleeding easily.  After several months of testing I was diagnosed with ITP (idiopathich thrombocytopenic purpura).  My platelets always ranged between 5 and 25k.  I was giving IVIG, gamma globulin, steriod, ect.  Nothing worked.  In the process I was tested for Lupus = negative.  I tested positive for cytomagalovirus though, which I guess is pretty common.  After two years of low platelets and no resolve they dropped to 1k and I had an emergency splenectomy.  It seemed all was well but I havent felt the same since.  And as time goes by I feel worse.  My platelets are staying at a cool 350k which is great though.  Last year after two years of soar throats and white patches in my throat I had a tonsillectomy.  And over the past 5 years I have had body pain all over and extreme fatigue.   Starting about two years ago it got much worse, the pain was becoming very intense.  After blood test and doctors visits I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia, which didnt surprise me since my aunt has it as well.  But over the past 6 months it has just felt like something more is going on.  I have been getting intermittent headaches, the body paints are becoming yet more sever, and my soar throat is back, im even more exhausted then usual.  This past week the headache has not stopped and my neck is so stiff as well as my back.  My hands and feet have been becomming numb easily.  And I have an area on the back of my neck that feels like two swollen lymphnodes.  I have been scheduled for a ct scan but I just feel like it will of course be fine and I I will never figure out what is going on with me.   I had a blood test two days ago and had a high wbc count at 13.8 high lymphocytes at 5.54, high monocytes at 1.34 and high eosinophil at .45. The pain is just becomming intollerable and I feel like I will never know what is going on.  Is it all just fibromyalgia??  Why would my neck be stiff and I have swollen lymphnodes (they have been this way for the past 6 months but are becomming more sensative).  My head is constantly pounding and I feel unable to even stay awake even when moving around. Any help or advise would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you so very much.\n\n",

At 25 you have learned more about your body and the medical challenges you have faced than many seniors!  I am not a rheumatologist or hematologist, however in my nursing practice I have seen much.  Has your primary MD sent you to a rheumatologist?  This is a person who may be best able to diagnose such elusive and pervasive diseases as Lupus   - in its many forms. I venture to guess there is a commonality between all your earlier clinical problems and your current concerns.  On the surface of the information you provided, it is difficult to come up with a differential diagnosis.  It seems prudent to me for you to pursue specialists in hematology/oncolog, or rheumatology; and consider doing the CT that was recommended - or an MRI if indicated. The sooner that the common factor can be identified means the sooner appropriate therapy can begin.\n\n",

I had normal range cbc, cmp, esr, ana, and rhuematoid factor in jan. He feels there is no need to recheck these and stated that \"blood values do not change in the course of a few weeks or months.\"  How long does it take before you would expect to see changes in some of these levels? I know cbc levels can change in days due to infection and such but what about the other values?   He seemed pretty irritated when questioned this statement and said that I had heard conflicting information before about blood values. HELP>\n\n",

I am otherwise healthy.  6'2\", 195 lbs, bike, surf, hike regularly.  Typically, swelling would flare up in September, gone by February.  Swelling would start in right thumb or right big toe, move to left elbow, then right knee and left knee.  Never in two joints at once.  Can be debilitating when in the knees.  Last about 1-3 weeks per joint and will visit some joints twice.    Happened every year I lived in Sacramento (5 yrs), most years I lived in San Diego(5 yrs) and never in Lake Tahoe until now (5 yrs) I had assumed that low altitude was a contributor but obviously not any more.  2001-2004 (Sac) swelling would start to occur in Jan or Feb, 2005 & 2006, no swelling (Tahoe) but this year just started in March up here.  Have been through rigorous testing at Scripps in San Diego and Kaiser in Sacramento..  Kaiser felt this was a palindromic RA but none of the medications (Lodine and other nsaids)  have any positive effect on my symptoms. Huge doses of ibuprofen (2000 mg) help the pain but I try not to do it. Scripps had no confirmed diagnosis after blood and stool work.  I need HELP!  Will try anything.\n\n",

However, there is a small percentage of the population that will have a positive ANA without any underlying disease.    Several other rheumatologic diseases can have a positive ANA also.  If you are completely asymptomatic it is possible that you are one of those with an incidentally positive ANA.  It is a good idea to see the rheumatologist anyway to have a thorough evaluation.

In fact, it is one of the most common arthritis types that manifest with hip pain.  Regarding a flare up due to anesthesia, I was unable to find any information on this in the literature.  My inclination is to say that it is unlikely for anesthesia to induce a flare up; however, I have no data to support my thought.  It will be important for your anesthesiologist to know that you have rheumatoid arthritis.  RA can present some challenges to the anesthesiologist so he'll need to be prepared for this.

    "title": "anti-smith, lupus, strange symptoms",
    "content": "Since June 2004, I have had severe edema in my feet, ankles, legs.  (Prior to that, in January 2004, I had pneumonia, and in February 2004, I was put on Advair 500/50 for asthma that I have had since I was a kid. I mention these in case they are relevant.  I quit Advair in February 2006 but went back on it on & off in about June 2006.  As of December 2006, I haven't taken it again because I believe it contributes to my problems.)  In June 2004, I was tested for various things, and my ANA and rheumatoid factor were negative, sed rate low. I had low blood protein and low albumin, but nothing was considered to actually be wrong with me.  This condition got significantly worse, and more things started to happen.  At times, my legs swelled up to be hard to the touch and painful.  I developed a rash on both feet that requires a steroid cream to get rid of.  It has been painful to walk since this all started, and I have major pain in my feet. A podiatrist diagnosed me with tendinitis and gave me orthotics. These help.  My edema in my feet and ankles is now permanent, it seems.  I also have it in my face and arms and chest but not as bad.  My joints hurt on and off.  In November 2006, I gained a pound a day for no apparent reason until I had gained 20 pounds. I have only been able to lose 8 of them so far.  In November 2006, I developed severe pain in my left hand, especially the fingers, for no apparent reason.  The hand swelled up. Over a few weeks, the pain went away, but the swelling remained and still does.  I also got two swollen spots on my arm- they look like those bumps that are found on some elderly dogs, but they're not as obvious.  I then noticed I have two of them on my neck- one in the front, and one on the side.  I have a persistent swollen gland on the right side of my neck.  In January of this year, I have had two Excruciating cases of ankle pain (one was bilateral, one was right only) that made it virtually impossible to walk. These events happened for no apparent reason with no injury.  They resolved on their own.  In October 2006 and January 2007, I had incidents where I had severe pain in my left eyeball.  Later when I looked in the mirror, I had a hemorrhage in the eye, but the pain was gone.  Recently I have found it difficult to hold onto things, such as a mixing spoon when cooking dinner, because my muscles in my hands hurt so bad. I find it very difficult to lift things like a pot of water because it seems far too heavy.   I also have Reynaud's phenomenon, which seems to be getting worse and sometimes is unbelievably painful.  Finally at times I get hives on the bottom of my feet for no reason, and I have sores on my scalp that I have had for about 20 years.  I am 33.  Something is wrong with me.    I have had a lot of bloodwork but nothing obvious showed up.  In November 2006, I had more bloodwork. This showed a positive ANA of 1:80 with an anti-Smith of 98.  DNA, SSA, SSB, and RNP were negative.  C3 & C4 were normal.  The doctor did not consider this to be a \"disease process,\" but I have since looked up anti-smith, and it looks to me to be indicative of lupus.  On 12/29/06, I had bloodwork with a different doctor, and ANA was still 1:80, but there was no anti-Smith, and the others were normal too. My C-reactive protein was 12.5, whereas it was .8 in November. My sed rate was 14, when it was 6 in November.  I had urine tests both times, and there were 2-4 red blood cells in November but none in December. That was the only abnormality.  I did have 2-5 red blood cells in my urine in July 2005.  My BUN & creatinine are normal. The blood protein was last tested in July 2006 and was low as usual.  Albumin was ok at that time.  My white blood cells have been high since 2004.    I have had an ultrasound of the heart to rule out congestive heart failure, a cortisol test to rule out Cushing's syndrome, and ultrasound of the legs to rule out issues with the veins/arteries. I had a CT scan of the abdomen in October 2006 to rule out blockages, tumors in the abdomen.  All of these tests were normal. My TSH has been tested several times, and it is currently 3.093. In the past, it has been lower.    My question is twofold: One is how can you have positive anti-Smith one time and then negative another time? What exactly IS anti-Smith? I thought it was found only in people with lupus. My other question is, what kind of testing do you recommend I get now, if any? No one has given me any meds, and I am at my wit's end. I feel like my feet/ankles may be ruined forever now.  I do participate in physical therapy to try to remove the swelling, but it has a very limited effect.  I have been doing this since November 2006, and it takes a lot of my time each week but doesn't have a lasting impact.  Thank you so much for your help!!\n\n",

    "content": "The Smith antibody is an antibody that is very specific for systemic lupus erythematosis.  It is positive in about 30% of SLE cases.  When positive it is highly indicative of SLE.  I do not know exactly what the smith antibody is directed against.  Having said that, it appears that none of your other labs are consistent with SLE.  The ANA antibody being positive at 1:80 still overlaps with a level found in a small percentage of \"normal\" people without SLE.  Other antibodies commonly positive in SLE are anti-double stranded DNA and anti-phospholipid antibodies.  Your mention of low protein and low albumin has me quite interested.  Low albumin leads to low oncotic pressure in the veins.  This can lead to edema.  Do you know how low your albumin level was?  Generally, albumin is low for only a few reasons: 1) loss through the kidneys-this should have been seen on a urinalysis.  I am assuming this was not seen as you report two normal UA's.    2) through the GI tract-you can have a test of your stool for alpha-1-antitrypsin.  This is a protein that is not found in food but is found in the body.  If it is found in the stool it confirms protein loss through the intestines.  This would be a condtion known as protein-loosing enteropathy.   3) The liver has stopped making as much albumin/protein.  This can happen for several reasons including malnutrition or chronic inflammatory states (such as inflammatory bowel disease or other ongoing inflammation source).  While your ESR does not support ongoing inflammation, it is interesting that your CRP was 12.  This is elevated.  CRP is a more rapid responder to inflammation that ESR; however, once elevated, ESR tends to stay higher longer.    I would recommend that you have follow up labs for your albumin level.  If this is still low it is very likely to be the cause of your edema.  If you can determine why it is low and treat that it is very likely your edema will resolve.  You may also consider seeing a rheumatologist to help interpret your antibody results.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I am very confused and hoped somebody may be able to shed some light on this whole thing for me.  I have been unwell for the past 5 years and I always beleived I had CFS. About 18 months ago I had some more blood tests done and I was refered to a Rheumatologist due to a positive ANA and elivated ESR. They did many tests on me and I had positive anti double stranded DNA IgM. In the past I have also had a weakly positive lupus inhibitor which i guess went negative again in other test and the same thing happend with a weakly positive anti cardiolipin antibody. The consultant said I did not seem to show any symptoms of lupus and she didnt know why i felt tired, achey, swollen glands, sore throat etc etc all the time. I asked her if it is possible I had M.E but she said there was no such thing. I was diagnosed with Undifferentiated mixed connective tissue disease but she said from the results they have had back it doesnt explain why I have had these symptoms for the last 5 years. Is it possible to have CFS and UCTD? I also have boderline pernitious anemia. Any help would be much appreciated. Thanks Charlotte\n\n",

    "content": "Rheumatology is a difficult field because for many of the diseases we really don't understand them well.  This area is basically the specialty of autoimmune diseases.  Your positive antibody tests are laboratory evidence for Systemic Lupus Erythematosis.  However, laboratory data is really only one or two of the diagnostic criteria for SLE.  There are about 11 different criteria and from your description it sounds as if you do not have many of the others (all actual symptoms or signs).  The term undifferntiated mixed connective tissue disorder is really a grab-bag term that includes all the diseases that we have yet to be able to diagnosis or differentiate from one another.  Often it may take several years for these diseases to fully present themselves.  It is also possible that you have CFS.  Follow up with your doctor/rheumatologist is important.  Keep them aware of any new symptoms you develop as these may help in the diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 36 year old male. In december I experienced extreme muscle cramps on the left side of my body mostly in the back muscles and side muscles around my rib cage. I was having them so bad that I had to go to the emergency room. I couldn't even take a deep breath without muscle contraction. The ER doctor checked me out and basically told me that it sometimes just happens. Gave me flexeril for the cramps and sent me on my way. I haven't had any more until 2 days ago, which weren't near as violent as the first time. Any ideas on what could be the cause for this? I was in a traumatic accident in 2005 and almost died twice as a result of injury and infection. I am currently on Propranolol for blood pressure and is the only med I have to take now.\n\n",

    "content": "Muscle cramps can occur due to trauma as well as other causes. Recurrent muscle cramps may be due to low potassium levels.  Your doctor can test your potassium levels as well as your other electrolytes.  A simple test at home would be to try eating more potassium rich foods such as bananas.  If the cramps go away it was likely that.    Several viruses can cause an inflammation of the muscle that may induce some cramping as well.  Sometimes heat and massage can help alleviate muscle cramping.  Stretching often helps as well although it's tougher to stretch those particular muscles.  Deep breathing can do so a little.  Focus on stretches that involve bending forwards, backwards and sideways as if to stretch the back.  This will also help stretch your rib cage muscles.  If the muscles aren't feeling better soon I recommend that you see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Background:  28 y/o female, 5'0, 150lbs.  diagnosed with \"hypothyroid\" though \"Hashimoto's\" is the label frequently used in office by Endo and Rheumatologist.  Recently diagnosed with Fibromyalgia after running tests to clear Lupus and other like autoimmune diseases.  Not really feeling better yet.  In fact, feeling worse.   Symptomatic Manifestations: Mitral Valve Prolapse, digestive symptoms, severe chronic symmetrical arthritis of metatarsal region in feet, chronic cystic acne (last ten years), headaches increased frequency and intensity, menstrual changes, severe anxiety attacks, waking up in the middle of the night for sugar, severe chronic fatigue, especially after eating, \"brain fog,\" unrefreshing sleep, blurry vision without apparent physical cause, high cholesterol despite dietary restriction, and forty pound of weight gain in abdominal region (arms and legs have not shown proportionate gain).  Family history of similar symptoms.   Medication: I have been on 75mcg of Levothyroxine, 5mcg of Cytomel and 1200 units of vitamin D per day for the last six months (previously just 50mcg of Levothyroxine).  My numbers: Initial Diagnosis, 165 lbs., 06/13/05:  (TPOAb) 5908 H IU/ml  (0-34 ref. interval), TSH 2.189 uIU/ml (.350-5.500 ref. interval), Total Cholesterol 233 H mg/dL (100-199 ref. interval) LDL 163 H mg/dL (0-99 ref. interval) I restrict foods high in animal fats, and had for the previous two years-- family history of high cholesterol and other symptoms.  Most recent test, 150 lbs. 02/06/07:  2141 IU/ml  (0-34 ref. interval), TSH 4.157 uIU/mL (ref. interval .350-5.500), (No lipid panel for comparison)     Questions: I suspect that my problem is related to the pituitary, something like Cushing's. What exactly counts as \"significantly elevated\" for Thryoid Peroxidase (TPO) Ab? Should I be tested for Lyme's, Cushing's?  What else should I be aware of?  Where do I go next?  Thank You...\n\n",

    "content": "Specific numbers for reference ranges of your tests vary from lab to lab; however, a TPO antibody level in the thousands will be high for any lab.  This is consistent with the diagnosis of Hashimoto's thyroiditis.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis can have various stages.  Initially it may present as hyperthyroidism as the thyroid cells are killed by the antibodies causing them to leak their hormone into the blood.  Overtime, essentially all Hashimoto's patients become hypothyroid.  It appears that you are in this stage since you are taking thyroid hormone.  TSH should be followed and kept in the normal range for your lab.  If TSH begins to rise it is an indication of a need for more thyroxine.  There is a saying that autoimmune diseases travel in packs, so since you have Hashimoto's thyroiditis you are at risk for developing other autoimmune diseases as well.  Most of your symptoms are non-specific to any particular illness, making the diagnosis difficult.  You may consider having your insulin levels checked.  Insulin resistance can cause some of your symptoms.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23year old female.  When I was about 10 years old I got sick, was shuffled in and out of several hospitals who treated me for the flu. I had stopped eating and would vomit after drinking just water. Eventually I was vomiting blood, couldn't move, was completely incoherent.  After being told it was the flu several times, and not getting better I went to the Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia.  I was given several tests, including a spinal tap, and found out I had Viral Meningitis and Bell's Palsy, caused by Lyme disease.  It is unkown how long I had the Lymes, and was given normal antibiotics for a few weeks and sent home.  Years later I am experiencing symptoms I cannot get diagnosed. I have had joint pain over the years (which I know could happen as a lasting effect), and am currently feeling it worse than ever before.  In addition, I am constantly tired, have intermittent bowel problems (diarrhea), migraines almost every day, and can eat but don't have an appetite and don't feel right. My memory has always been bad but I feel like I just can't think anymore.....Do you think it is possible the Lyme was never treated correctly due to how much was not know about it back in the early 90s? Recently I've read that Lyme disease which was caught somehwat late should be treated with months of antibitocs, not the 2 weeks or so that I had. I cannot get an answer and have a feeling it is somehow related to it. What do you think I should do as a course of action? It seems like every doctor I've seen said nothing is wrong, when my body is telling me something is surely wrong.\n\n",

    "content": "Late manifestations of Lyme disease are similar to what you describe.  Joint pain, particularly of the large joints like the knees is most common.  Headaches are possible.  Bell's palsy is common during the active infection.  Typically, treatment for 14-21 days is sufficient.  Many studies have shown no benefit to more than 4 weeks of therapy.  In the case of meningitis, some will treat for 1-2 months and initially treat with IV antibiotics.  While it is possible that your symptoms are related to lyme disease, if you were treated for 2-3 weeks its fairly unlikely.  Many of your symptoms are somewhat nonspecific and can be related to a number of causes.  I would recommend discussing your symptoms with your doctor and getting some screening labs (such as a CBC, ESR or CRP, and possibly a \"mini\" rheumatic work up including an ANA).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Possible Polymyalgia",
    "content": "Yes, you could possibly have polymyalgia rheumatica, since the ESR is helpful in diagnosing this disease as well as temporal arteritis and, possibly rheumatoid arthritis. However, moderately elevated ESR can also occur with inflammation, anemia, infection and old age. In addition, females tend to have higher ESR during menstruation and pregnancy.    The typical symptoms of polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR) are aching and stiffness around the upper arms, neck, lower back and thighs. Symptoms tend to develop quickly, over a period of several days or weeks, and occasionally even overnight. Both sides of the body are affected. Involvement of the upper arms, with difficulty raising them above the shoulders, is especially common.  Aching and stiffness are worse in the morning, and tend to improve gradually as the day goes by, but periods of inactivity, such as sitting too long in one position, will cause stiffness to return. Stiffness may be so severe that there is pain at night, difficulty getting dressed in the morning, or difficulty getting up from a low chair. Occasionally, aching occurs in distal joints such as those of the hands and wrists.  The \u2018clumsiness\u2019, tender joints all over and sensitivity to touch could also be caused by rheumatoid arthritis or fibromyalgia (since the joint pain is bilateral). I\u2019m also concerned about the long-term prednisone treatment due to the many possible side effects of prednisone. Possible side effects of prednisone include muscle weakness, steroid myopathy, loss of muscle mass and osteoporosis. Make sure that your physician monitors your electrolytes and bone mass.  Your doctor will make a diagnosis of Polymyalgia rheumatica only after ruling out other possible causes for your pain and stiffness. Your doctor may order a rheumatoid factor test, which would identify a protein found in patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Or a complete blood count (CBC) to check for elevated white blood cells and platelet count.   Since your symptoms are muscoskeletal, I would suggest that you make an appointment to see a rheumatologist.\n\n",

The pain is so horrible that I can hardly move my head after I've pulled my ear from the pillow. I gently rub and pull on my lobes and wait for the blood to flow again.  The pain subsides after that, but it isn't immediate. I often have residual pain well into the next day and beyond. About a year ago I started using one of those memory foam pillows and I've notice that this ear pain occurs almost nightly. I assume it's due to lost circulation, but I would expect to feel numbness rather than severe pain. As I said, I remember this going back to my childhood, but it's just recently that it has escalated.  Thanks.\n\n",

(went away) *Next night woke up in middle of night with upper lip swelling - went to ER - said it was allergic reaction. and treated with epi, benedryl, and steroid *Next day pain in back - went to dr. said I had UTI and put on antibiotics *couple days later - lip swelled during day for about 2 hours went away (can't find a common food or allergen?) *Few days later woke up feeling VERY fatigued, weak, palpitations, stomach pain on right side and some on left side, numbness in lips and mouth - went to ER - couldn't find anything - did a CAT scan of head and bloodwork. **Ever since then I have felt VERY fatigued - cannot hardly do anything (things I normally do., weak, cannot eat much - naucious feeling (lost 12 lbs in 2 wks) tingly in fingers, toes. Intolerant to cold, cold fingers, headaches - history of migraines, also back of head pain and neck and jaw feel funny, I feel like my head is \"heavy\" but at the same time I feel lightheaded and dizzy. Also, have gastro symptoms - burning pain top of stomach, lots of gurgling, constipation on and off.  Extremely irratable, loud noises bother me.  Muscle sensations and twitches. Also, have trouble concentrating and I keep forgeting alot (more than normal) Sometimes I actually start to feel pretty good and then I get a \"spell\" where I start feeling weird and then feel bad the rest of the day.  Doctors been to:  Primary Doctor - bloodwork turned up normal Allergist:  did bloodwork again - normal.  not done allergy testing yet. Cardiologist:  Stress test, ECG, ultrasound of heart and gallbladder, hide a scan on gallbladder, bloodwork - everything came back normal. (hemoglobin a llittle high?)  My primary said to see a Rheumatologist and my cardiologies said to see a Gastroentologist?   So, where do I go from here?  Also - seeing my symptoms do you have any ideas - I would like to find the answer so I can get back to a normal life. Thank you very much!!\n\n",

The glucose tolerance test is a bit more sensitive...  If it is a diabetis then an endocrinologist would probably be very helpful, and if you have prediabetis i believe they can also treat that with medications.   Best wishes -Nicole\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm an 18 year old male from Australia. I have no history of muscle pain and I have never done any surgery. Not sure about family history with muscle pain and I'm on no current medication.   Basically what's been happening is my left arm has been hurting in variable spots with varying amounts of pain at varying times. Sometimes it doesn't hurt at all for a while, but mostly it hurts slightly, though every now and again it becomes excruciating for an amount of time, also if I lift my arm into certain places it seems to lose strength. I usually do Aikijujutsu but we've just had a Christmas break so I haven't been exercising much lately. I've tried stretching my arm around and using it and stuff but to no avail. And this only in my left arm, the rest of my body is fine.  Any idea what is up?\n\n",

With you description of the weakness, it is also possible that you may be experiencing some nerve problems-possibly a compressed spinal nerve from a slipped disk or other process.  Nerve pain typically is described as burning, tingling or shooting pain.  It may or may not be accompanied by weakness.  I would suggest that you be evaluated by a physician.  There may be a specific treatment to help relieve your pain.  Also, if there is some nerve compression, physical therapy may be of some benefit.  Your doctor can help in getting this set up.

    "title": "24 years of unexplained joint pain",
    "content": "I am a 26 year old female. At the age of two I began to have extreme pain in my knees. My doctor told my mother it was \"growing pains\". It has over the years spread to my ankles, hips, knuckles, wrists, elbows, jaw, and the base of my skull (where it meets my neck) and all the bones in between. The only joints that are pain free are my toes. I have been tested for arthritis and told I don't have it. Heat makes it better, icy hot does too, there is no swelling, or redness. My skin feels warm to the touch, but if you actually grab the joint and squeeze you can feel the coldness almost as if it were beneath my skin, coming from the bone or joint itself. It occurs anytime I get cold or sometimes the day before it rains. I've found I can predict the weather. It's winter where I live now and the pain is constant and each doctor I see just sort of shrugs at me. My grandmother has arthritis that she developed as she got older, and my first cousin (who is ten years my senior) has it in her hands to the point that it has become debilitating. I have trouble typing (which is a requirement of my job), and driving (because I find it hard to grip the steering wheel when my hands hurt), and even walking is a challenge. I\u2019ve tried every home remedy I can think of, but of course all I can really do is treat the symptoms, I don\u2019t even know what the cause is. After 24 years and countless doctors I\u2019m at my wits end. Do you have any clue what they're missing? Or if there is a type of specialist I should see? I guess I should also mention my unusual health history. I have the Sickle Cell Trait, have had surgery to remove a cyst from my breast, 5 from my tailbone, 1 from my ear, and a sty removed from my eye, and I also have two large fibroids in my uterus. I also have hematuria, and after a year my urologist still has no clue what\u2019s causing it. Anyone with any clue; I\u2019d welcome one.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although sickle cell trait usually is not considered as a disease that requires treatment since its complications are usually mild and uncommon.  There certain factors that transform the silent disease into a syndrome similar to sickle cell disease.  These factors include: - hypoxia, cold weather and decrease blood flow may cause  hypoxia in tissues - dehydration, - hypothermia by it self trigger the transformation  Under these unusual conditions serious complications take place like:  - urinary tract infection in women,  and gross hematuria,  - life-threatening heart and other system complications after exercise - avascular necrosis  -arthritis of joints  -splenic infarcts  I advise you to follow with your doctor (hematologist) and to discuss with him this information. Keep us  updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am 28 yrs. old and mother of three children. I and two of my three children are very flexible and after a lttlle research I realized my children and myself are having similar symptoms though they are not suffering much as of yet. I have been having dislocations or what feels like dislocations in my knees , jaw, shoulder, and hips and my back and neck are always out of whack according to a chiropractor. We are always having leg pains and we bruise quite easily. I myself got almost no stretch marks during all three of my pregnancies and they told me i must have really elastic skin. Though now I am feeling stiffness and tightness in my right arm and hand and having wrist problems. I also get pleuritic type pains in my chest on the back under my shoulder blades and it gets hard to take even shallow breaths for days. I am also always(ALWAYS) constipated. I don't even feel the urge to defecate even after a couple of weeks.I am tired and after a little strenuous work at school I am stiff and sore and usually bruised and swelled up somewhere. My daughter is seven and had numerous ear infections, hearing problems and in my opinion she is growing very slowly(looks five and is seven) and developing (socially) slower than other children. My son who is eight is also of short stature and has the flexibility and the aches and pains but is overall healthy. We have no insurance till may but I need to know what anyone can tell me and if I need to get to a specialist for me or my children? Any advice would be welcomed. Thanks so much. [/i]\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply first of all, I appreciate it. Since I posted this we got insurance again and I got in to see a good doctor though as of yet I am still clueless. I had a colonoscopy and endoscopy done first since my doc was most concerned with those symptoms. I had a H. Pylori infection and ulcers but as of yet no fix for the constipation and no blockages causing it. The joints are still messed up and with the heat wave the pains and stiffness and swelling seem twice as bad. The kids are healthy and growing now( they have each grown two sizes in clothes) but are still extremely flexible and I am afraid what is happening to me will eventually happen to them. The question I have now is what type of doctor should I take them and myself to see without a referral that would know if this is a major problem or not? My docotor seems to think it is not that serious a problem, for me anyway but I think my constipation is caused by a muscular problem. I have read in some places that the intestines are like other muscles in the body and can be slow or stop if there are other musculoskeletal problems or diseases. Is this true? Any info you can give would be a blessing. Thanks again.\n\n",

The brachial plexus is formed of an arrangement of a plexus of nerves that come out of the spine (vertebrae C5-T1), passing through the neck and the axilla , to the arm.  Electromyogram (EMG or electromyography) is helpful in the diagnosis. X- Ray and MRI are used to detect joints and vertebral lesions that could be the cause.  The outcome is variable and depends on the nature of the underlying  injury, patient age and the followed of procedure.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear superwheeler,  It would be helpful if you can informs us the cause of being on wheelchair, as it may help you in the explanation of these symptoms.  However, for the lower limb symptoms, It sounds like Sciatica, Sciatica occurs due to a nerve root (sciatic nerve) compression in the lower (lumbar) spine. The condition is due to a herniated disk in most of the cases in the low lumber spine.  This compression results in pain along distribution of the muscles innervated by that nerve, so the pain radiates from your lower back to the buttock down to the back of the legs.   This commonly happens in people who sit for prolonged periods. The pain can be in the form of mild ache to a sharp, burning pain, discomfort or electric shock. Prolonged walking may aggravate symptoms in some people.  Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but in many cases it is secondary to spinal or bone problems.  For the chin problem it seems that your muscles are very weak or there is cramp on pressing it needs direct examination .\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Creatinine clearance normal range: 90\u2013140 milliliters per minute (mL/min).  Low creatinine clearance indicate kidney damage. Kidney damage can reversible or chronic.  Chronic renal damage is diagnosed if the findings that support renal damage persists for more than 3 month after conservative measures.  Damage of the kidney is generally due to either reduced blood flow to the kidneys, or urinary tract blockage.  Indomethacin and NSAID are commonly used medications and can result in reversible renal damage in the majority of chronic users. Being hypertensive is another additional factor or by its own can cause renal damage.  Careful attention to renal function  in patients receiving indomethacin and other NSAIDs should be taken, it is advisable to measure the serum creatinine in high-risk patients weekly for several weeks whenNSAID is started.  Measurement of creatinine clearance with 24-h urine collection is considered as an adequate estimate of GFR.   People with GFR above 60 cc/min are considered to have mild form or renal damage that warrants considering  preventive measures that should be recommended by the nephrologist.  In general individuals with mild renal damaged are advise to keep their: BP < 130/80  ACEI (lisinopril) or an ARB medications may be preferred agent for patients with HTN and kidney disease, as you are doing LDL and HDL management to avoid cardiovascular problems Vitamin D level > 50 (may use ergosterol)  Echocardiogram.  Serial estimation of GFR and creatinine clearance are very important to monitor the disease progression.   Disease-modifying antirheumatic drugs (DMARDs) may be considered in such situations to control the RA.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 54 year old female diagnosed with GERD, sliding hiatal hernia, laryngospasms, allergies/asthma (mild), and IBS.  In 1999, I had my gallbladder removed and wound up in the hospital 8 days.  The surgeon said \"It was a mess in there.  The gallbladder was attached to your omentum.  Are you going to have any further testing done?\"  Foolish me, I did not go in for my final visit with him so I never asked him why he thought \"further testing\" should be done.  I did tell my primary physician this but nothing ever came of it though I repeatedly ask him to check into it.  I have since had an MR of the abdomen and nothing was noted other than three small kidney stones.    My question concerns \"incidents\" that began about six months ago.  The first time I was walking out of a store laughing.  I leaned forward only slightly and was suddenly \"grabbed\" by the most SEVERE pain in the middle of my chest right above my sternum.  The pain was so severe that I could not move.  If I moved my hips (attempted to walk) the pain intensified.  If I moved my neck or arms, the pain intensified also.  I felt as though the pain \"stabbed or grabbed\" me.  Breathing was possible but painful.  The SEVERE pain lasted for well over a minute.  It finally lessened to a point to where I could very slowly take baby steps to reach our vehicle.   The pain lasted about five minutes.    I have had this pain at least four other times.  It seems to hit me when I lean back.   Once I was attempting to raise my hands and \"stretch.\"   Two days ago, I leaned my head back under the shower to wet my hair.  It is very painful and this time, the pain only radiated down my arms, possible because I did not attempt to move as I was fearful of making the pain worse.    Any ideas what could be the cause of such SEVERE pain?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jazzijunk,  The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux). When the upper part of the stomach prolapses through the diaphragm (where the esophagus pass into the abdomen (esophageal hiatus- opening) into the chest, the condition is known as hiatal hernia.   In this condition people will experience one or more of these symptoms, chest pain, especially at night while lying down,  swallowing problems and GERD with or without heart burn.  The size of a hiatal hernia and the severity of the symptoms are not correlated. The presence of hitaus hernia aggravates the GERD condition. Acid reflux causes severe pain and discomfort in the chest.   Esophagitis is a known complication of GERD and can lead to esophageal spasm, that can alone give similar clinical picture.  Prokinetic drug that strengthens the sphincter and improves the gastric emptying. When there is an acid reflux it is not enough to treat the symptoms with one drug instead the addition of Anti acids, Acid H2 blockers or proton pump inhibitors mat help to control the symptoms.  Certain foods are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them. These include chocolate, beverages containing caffeine, fatty and fried foods, garlic and onions, spicy and tomato containing foods.   Surgery is considered only if lifestyle changes and medications did not improve the condition or if complications are present.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 25yr old female and just had an ablation done for SVT 3 months ago.  Well, over the last 2 months I've been experiencing muscle spasms in my legs and left shoulder.  I called my cardiologist a month ago and he advised they weren't heart related (probably related to stress) and they would go away, but they haven't.  I'm not experiencing much pain, just a little in my left shoulder, but nothing bad.  I'm concerned that these muscle spasms have something to do with my heart.  If not is it possible that I am deficient in some sort of vitamin/mineral?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would have bean easier if you could inform us more about the character of this pain, like the onset, the course, if it is related to certain movement or at rest, what aggrevates, what help alleviate.  - In most of the cases strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause. This usually results from wrong or heavy lifting, or following a sudden improper movement or wrong posture.  Muscle spasm alone can cause the pain which can be an unidentified cause.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial. If no improvement, other causes like arthritis should be investigated.  - In your condition if the pain is related to activity and it stops you from working, I would consider the exclusion of Intermittent claudication and vascular causes, a possible complication of the Radiofrequency Catheter Ablation.\n\n",

    "content": "After successfully losing 25 lbs last year using RELORA (magnolia extract) I began having morning hip joint pain (both hips) that goes away after 5 minutes of moving around (starting morning routine).  When I wake I roll over (usually sleep on my side) and straighten my legs to stretch.  When I straighten my legs they will tremble as I do so. There is no pain involved with stretching.  I would describe the hip joint pain as a 3 on a 1-10 scale.  Oddly I've noticed that when I sleep on anything softer than my own bed (quite firm) I do not seem to have either of these two symptoms.  It does not seem to be worsening and in fact it seems less painful than it was in the beginning.  I used to awake around 3:00am from the discomfort.  I was on Nabumetone (500mg) before going to bed, but no longer need it to get a good nights sleep. Haven't used it for months.  Lately my legs don't tremble as much when I wake and stretch, and occasionally not at all.  I'm not limping, it's just uncomfortable for 5 minutes or so.  I get up and walk normally. No other pain, stiffness or other symptoms.  Can gout give this indication?  A friend suggested gout but I thought that only caused swelling and pain in the ankles.\n\n",

It is commonly caused by skin bacteria that passes through the damaged skin after trauma, like nail bitting or wrong ctutting.  If the redness extends into  entire finger a condition known as a felon, or an abscess is formed you have to seek direct medical care. An abscess should be drained by a doctor to attemt  drain the pus at home.

It is a constant debilitating pain almost like an electric shock at times. Heat seems to relax it but it does not go away.  I've recently started taking Naproxen for lower back pain (on left side) with only constipation as a side effect.  The Naproxen has helped loosen dull finger joints probably due to inherited arthritis.  PUt it is the pain in my upper arm that continues into my chest and up to the base of my neck that I am worried about. Because I work in healthcare I asked several nurses what they thought it might be - ie: shift of the heart, pinched nerve, and some say artery clog.   I'm hoping it's none of the above and is due to the damp, rainy cold weather we have been experiencing these last few weeks in Eastern Ontario.   If you have any suggestions please help.  Thanks!

I have since toned down my activity, thinking that it is just a classic case of shin splints.  I have been told, though, that the pain from normal shin splints should actually disappear after a few minutes of warm-up instead of worsening as activity continues like the pain I experience does.  Also, the skin immediately over the muscle that hurts becomes numb when the pain begins, and there are spider veins in the general area of the pain that have existed for months.  I am worried that if I continue to run, I might cause nerve damage.\n\n",

The pain is due to pressure imbalances between blood flow to the muscles and the pressure of the tissue that surround the muscles.  Parasthesia in the leg or the foot may occur. The pain is relieved only by rest within 30 minutes in most of the cases. Direct measurement of the pressure in the compartment is a diagnostic tool.  If conservative medical approaches like physical therapy, stretching exercises, and anti-inflammatory medicine fail to improve the condition, Fasciotomy for surgical correction is considered.  Other causes like stress fracture, tendonitis, muscle hernias, sciatica, entrapment of one or more of the leg nerves and vessels should be considered too.\n\n",

The pain you have described is similar to pinched nerve due to disc prolapse.   If you mean that the pain is felt in the apical chest, then Your symptoms are very likely to be due to Pleurisy. Pleurisy is an inflammation of the pleura, the double layered membrane that covers the lung. In your case it is the apical pleura. The condition is due to viral infection in most of the cases.  The pain is felt like sharp pain on one side or less commonly in both sides, it increases with deep breath. The pain usually stops once you hold your breath and results in rapid, shallow breathing.  Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the past 1-2 months I have observed an occasional mild pain cropping up in the lower left side of my stomach / abdomen. Until now I have ignored it, thinking it irrelevant and that it will go away. As an 18 year old male college freshman, I account this pain to excessive consumption of fatty foods and one too many alcoholic beverages; however I always try to eat as much fruit and veg. a day as possible. Deduced from this, my diet consists mainly of: a sandwich at around 2pm, 3 pieces of fruit in the afternoon following this and in the evening something like a couple of hamburgers or pasta. Following this I consume another 2 pieces of fruit. The main evening meal is often consumed late, at around 10pm, as I do not feel any particular appetite at around the normal dinner time. I have no past diagnoses of any particular medical conditions, nor have I undergone any form of surgery. There is a genetic history of heart disease, however I do not consider this to be of significant importance in this case. I do not consume any current medications at the moment, aside from the odd aspirin / ibuprofen when I have headaches, which are not frequent. Perhaps noting is the fact I have undergone a lot of stress recently.  Any help or advice is very much appreciated.  Thank you very much for your time.   Mark A. Fulton\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abdominal pain is a nonspecific symptom for many medical conditions. Associated symptoms would help to reach the diagnosis.   In general pain felt in the lower left side of the abdomen can be due to many causes including: - Excess gas and distension  - Indigestion - Colitis due to Infectious or inflammatory causes, in most of cases there is also diarrhea.  -  IBS in which the diagnosis is mainly by exclusion of other causes. - Renal problems cause colic and is associated with urinary symptoms like frequency and dysuria.  - Recurrent abdominal pain can be  a  somatization for emotional or psychological problems.  Stress increases the frequency and the severity of symptoms in almost all cases.   Upper left abdominal pain of GI origin is commonly related to gastritis (in frequent analgesic users) and GERD.  According to your presenting history, It sounds to be related to GI causes and your dietary habits. Try to modify the style of your life (exercise more) and your feeding habits.   .\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 43 yr. old overweight woman, newly diagnosed with RA and have past history of slight herniation of L5-S1. My hips have been a bit more sore these past few days, but nothing unusual until today. While standing and waiting for service at phone store pain on the outside of both hips increased tremendously, felt nerve related (some tingling in my feet), but with sciatica I am more accustomed to pain down through one side of buttocks and my back itself did not feel so bad. I am not sure whether it is more RA related and I should see Rheumatologist or back related and should see orthopedist who has previously treated me for back problem? I currently take plaquenil, methotrexate and voltaren on a regular basis. Thanks for your time and response.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mstbio,  Sciatica is felt as pain in the lower back or hip that radiates down to the back of one thigh and the leg. Sciatica in some people is felt like leg cramp that can last for long time, it may also result in limb weakness, numbness, or a burning or tingling sensation down the leg.  In RA, morning muscle and joint stiffness are the main symptoms and occur after periods of inactivity. During disease activity, there are other symptoms like fatigue, low grade fever, muscle and joint aches as well as other generalized symptoms .  Since you have new symptoms that occurred while you are in treatment you have to consult your physician and be on follow up with him to see if there is any progress in your medical problem or you need to change the dose or the type of your medications.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cindo825,  Numbness and tingling are often felt in the hands, feet, arms, or legs due to abnormal sensory function.  Causes include:  -Nerve injury  -Diminished blood supply or improper circulation like in cases of atherosclerosis in the lower limb vessels, that result in pain in the legs with  numbness, and tingling on walking. (Intermittent claudication.)  -Spinal nerves compression in cases of  herniated disk.  -Carpal tunnel syndrome which can cause numbness or tingling in your wrist, fingers, hand, or forearm.  -Commonly in association with systemic medical conditions like diabetes, thyroid hypofuntcion,  -Vitamin B-12 deficiency and metabolite disturbances.  -Transient ischemic attack (TIA) or stroke  -Certain medications.   Causes of joint paint are different and in old age is more likely to be due to Osteoarthritis.  Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disorder that causes the body's immune system to attack the bone joints. It is diagnosed by certain clinical criteria and serological examination.

    "content": "Hi.  I am a 23 year old female who just had a baby 3 months ago.  I am on Nexium, Prilosec, Colac, Ortho tricyclen lo, and I just started taking Centrum and Viactiv.  I have a hiatal hernia and was diaganoised with IBS 3 years ago.   I had a very easy pregnancy.  My IBS really didn\u2019t bug me.  A couple weeks after my baby was born my stomach has upset me a little, but nothing real bad.  My question is actually about some aches and pains I have been experiencing especially in my legs.  This started before I started taking my birth control pills.  I get pains in my legs mostly my calves.  My ankles feel like they are swollen, but they don\u2019t look swollen.  Sometimes it feels like I have ran the mile w/o stretching.    Sometimes it feels like my bones hurt and sometimes my muscles.  The pain is sometimes in my knees and sometimes in my ankles.  My shoulders feel tingly and hot, kind of like a burning senstation.  I feel like I am being weighed down by something in my shoulders and arms occassionaly(this has only happen about 2 times).    None of this is too painful.  More achy and uncomfortable.    I am overweight by probably 50 pounds, much due to my pregnancy.  I do not exercise as much as I should and when my IBS isn\u2019t bothering me, I don\u2019t eat the best.  I am trying to improve on this.    I went to my Dr. office and saw her PA.  He thought it might be my thyroid, because that can act up after pregnancy and do weird things to your body.  HE did blood work and I don\u2019t have thryroid problems or Rhueuatrad arthritis.  So, it was diagnosed as fibromylagia.  Which my mom has and keeps telling me is my problem.  Anyway, he put me on Cymbalta, which is an antidepressant.  He said this should help with the fibromylagia and my IBS.  I was wondering if you think this is a good assestment.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear llm8221,  \u2018Fibromyalgia Syndrome\u2019 (FMS) is to be considered in your condition. It affects many people and results in generalized muscular pain.  The pain affects also the spine area or the neck or front of the chest, or middle or low back.   There are other associated chronic symptoms which include, mood disturbances, fatigue and sleep disturbances.  The underlying cause is not known, however many other conditions can trigger the pain like stress, liver problems, thyroid problems, bowel dysfunction and allergy. Other diseases like Rheumatoid Arthritis should be excluded since they are associated with similarly symptoms to FMS.  There are no specific treatments however, general recommendations can help alleviate the pain, these include:  Suitable nutritional advice as well as supplements like potassium and other minerals are very important. Avoid the triggering causes and treat them like: allergy and GI problems. Regular exercises programs like yoga. Some herbal preparations can help improve the liver functions and the blood circulation. Other medications under the supervision of your doctor can help to improve sleeping problems and anxiety.  It might take  three month to see the improvement in these symptoms after following the proper medical care. To have more information about FMS you can visit our web site on: http://www.doctorslounge.com/rheumatolo ... yalgia.htm  I advise you to be on follow up with your doctor. You have to inform him with any new symptoms. Some specific causes may be preceded by non specific symptoms and for a long time.  I hope you find this information useful  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "following a bad viral infection (at least thats what the doctors called it because they couldnt find anything) in which i had bad stomach pain and complete loss of appetite for 2 weeks, i started getting flashes of being lightheaded.  after a few days of these flashes, it suddenly became constant.  i originally described it as vertigo, but i am not dizzy, i just feel as if I am medicated or disconnected from the world.  Brain fog is the best term i can find as i just feel \"off\" and have difficulty doing things that i could normally do with my eyes closed.  this has been going on for 2 months now, and it is frustrating.  concentration is difficult, and i feel as if something is definately wrong with me.  also, this past week i have started to get tingling sensations in my forehead area.  these come and go and seem to be random.  I have seen an ent doc, as well as a neurologist, and my next stop is a cardiologist i believe.  below are some tests that i have had done.    ct scan of head (came back normal) MRI (awaiting results) blood work (came back normal - multiple times) hearing test (normal)   anyone with similar symptoms?  before anyone asks, i don't have any problems with anxiety or stress as i am one of the most laid back guys that you will ever meet.  i just cant shake this thing.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bren,  Pain is not normal and if you have any pain then there is something wrong going on. If you have bipolar disorder and during the depressive phase, if you feel any pain, this might be a physical expression of your emotional pain.  This being said, however, we have to absolutely make sure that your pain has no other actual physical causes before we say it is because of depression.  The way you are describing your pain makes me think of a condition called fibromyalgia, it is a condition where there is a lot of tender points all over the body and i think the best thing to do is to be seen by a rheumatologist who is the best specialist to evaluate you for this if after you see your primary care physician, he/she thinks that you might have fibromyalgia.  You are on lipitor and lipitor and the like medications are very notorious for causing muscle inflammation and breakdown and i strongly urge you to ask your doctor to have a muscle blood test done if you have not already have one.  If after all the venues are exhausted and no actual physical cause of your pain is found, we can then say that this might be due to your depression and you might want to discuss it further with your psyciatrist about going up on your medication dose if appropriate and indicated.  Having back pain after standing for a long time is sometimes expected. And the knee and the hip pain is also expected if stand too long and start to have back pain. So, may be you ought to have a ct scan on your back and may neck spine also to make sure that you don't have any problems with these as well.  When on lasix, and you feel dizzy when you stand up fast, this might be an indication that you are dehydrated, so you might want to talk to your doctor about this and see whether or not the lasix dose should be lowered.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old woman who began having serious problems in January. I gained 20 pounds over two months with no reason. I exercise daily and eat very healthy foods.  I am experiencing edema and stiff joints in the morning in my hands and feet.  Also, I have been sweating constantly, even when It is cold outside.  They have tested me for Thyroid, and hormone problems with negative results.  I have had multiple blood work done.  My doctor thinks it could be Lupus.  In addition, going up a flight of stairs tires me out and my heart beats rapidly.  My doctor has scheduled an echo and a respiratory test.    This happened to a lesser degree last year and we thought it was caused by the mold in the building I was in.  It stopped once we moved.  I am now in a new building.  Does anyone have any ideas.\n\n",

    "title": "Minimal OA...Maximum Pain",
    "content": "Hello, I'm 44 and female, have never had arthritis symptoms before a fall I took about a year ago, have a mother and fraternal aunt with arthritis (both I believe are OA) and am currently only taking Lexapro for depression and Advil/Tylenol as needed for pain. After my fall I found out I had advanced DDD and spondylitic changes in my neck as well as OA in my left hip which they say is mild. I had trouble with hypermobility (I think that's the right word) in my SI joints and a twisted sacrum, thoracic and lumbar strains and pain, and occipital headaches after I fell. Most of the problems have resolved for the most part with PT but I also found out I can't take several prescription anti inflamitories without stomach issues...had major abdominal and chest pain with Aleve as well. I have major pain sometimes, especially after being on my feet or sitting for any length of time, mainly in the groin area from front to back and my hip sticks and pops quite a bit. My right hip has, in the last 6 months, started feeling like my left one did about a year ago and my lower back can be aggrivated again from limping because of the hip pain. My therapist says it's bone on bone after doing a grind test (knee to chest) so I'm obviously loosing cartalidge and I'll most likely have to have hip replacement earlier than most...somehthing I'd like to avoid as long as possible.  My questions are...what kinds of treatments are available that can help with the pain, slow the progression of the OA, and help keep the hip problems from aggrivating the other problems again? And...is the progression of the OA being so rapid (or at least it seems it is to me) something I should be worried about?  Thank you so much for taking the time to offer this service and for any suggestions you might have that I can discuss with my doctor.  4PtSake\n\n",

In fact, there are only pain killers like NSAID that can be used. In some cases, if OA is activated, some doctors are using hydroxychloroquine. The sad thing about this is, that the possible effect will take 3-6 months.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have mild lupus and have had migraines a large part of my life. Recently I had a 3 day migraine and the day it finally went away I had lightheadedness (usually get that) and dizziness. Later in the week I had a slight headache and the next day the dizziness returned but it was gone the following day. I have sinus problems and recently a ct scan said I have polypoid tissue in over 50% in both maxillary. Can that be caused by lupus and causing the symptoms to become worse? I cannot find anything to explain what that tissue is.  I saw my rheumatologist during my migraine and he ran some tests and my c3 and c4 are slightly low. Would it indicate the migraines can be part of my lupus? The dizziness came after my appointment, should I call them back?  I am 43, female, have mg and lupus and past thyroiditis and goiter. My brother has ms and cns lupus and I take mestinon for mg and prevacid.  Thank you, MissPlaced\n\n",

After having the baby I was asked to see a Rheumatologist and was first diagnosed with Collagen Vascular Disease. My brother has active chronic lupus and after further testing I was diagnosed with inactive lupus. The only thing the doctor has me on is a baby Aspirin since people with this immune disorder are more at chances of blood clots. I have always been very healthy. I have never had one complaint on any type of pain or symptom related to Lupus or any disease in its family, but now after 4 months of having my baby I am going on 3 weeks of head aches and dizziness. I also feel my legs just a slite bit numb and minor tingling at times sitting.   I am not sure if this is something I should be concerned about.  Could my headaches and the legs be Lupus that was never active and now after the baby decided to wake up.   I fear it to be, and am very sad to hear that I probably would need to think twice on another pregnancy when I would truely love to have another baby in the future.  I had a prefect healthy one and never any miscarriages.  Can anyone give me some facts on cases such as mine.  I cant help being worried.  Thank you in advance for your responses.\n\n",

But, it is correct, thtat you and your doctor have to think about lupus evertime when you have any new symptoms.  Headache might have many reasons, but one reasons might also be lupus. I\u00b4m wondering, why you are getting Aspirin if lupus is not active. Do you have any antibodies that might clot yout blood like lupus phospholipid antibodies ? Those are sometimes correlated with migraine or other sorts of headache in lupus. Tell your rheumatologist about the fact and ask if he thinks you might need an MRI.   Beside the things today, you should not panic about other pregnancies. Depending on the next months and the time right before the next possible pregnancy, it is not excluded that you will have no poblems with any other pregnancies.\n\n",

For the past year, whenever the weather changes, a golf-ball sized knot appears on his right wrist and renders him helpless.  I have read that these cysts are generally painless, but his is excruciating.  He has never been to a doctor, but we contacted a doctor and they said he most likely has a ganglionic cyst, and no one in his family has ever had anything like this.  He has taken tylenol, advil, and asprin, but nothing helps with the pain.  We currently don't have insurance, so neither of us can afford to go to a doctor.  I was wondering if there is an over the counter product that can help manage the pain or help reduce the size of the cyst.  He works in a warehouse and it is imperative that he uses his hands.

    "content": "Hi Joelle, i'm replying in m husbands name - he posted here recently about the lump on his foot which we have since learnt is also a ganglion cyst.  The NHS here means that we can pursue removal through our local hospital and that seems to be the only solution available - although my understanding is that that may not be a permanent solution either.  A little internet research has revealed that these used to be called bible bashers or something similar due to the old custom of whacking them firmly with a bible or similar large hard object which coudl sometimes make the fluid disperse.  They are generally only painful if they are pushing against a nerve which is more likely to happen the bigger they are.  I don't recommend striking it with force, but applying a very firm pressure to the lump can \"pop\" (for want of a better word) the cyst and allow some of the fluid to drain away.  Do keep in mind that whilst that may bring relief, the cyst will refill with fluid eventually.  Hope that helps anyway.\n\n",

The symptoms are not specific for lupus, that means that you can have the same symptoms in many other diseases. But (!), indeed, what you are telling sound very much like lupus, especially if the ANA is positive. Therfore, I would suggest to visite a rheumatologist and ask for help. Some doctors think if some other lab results (like dsDNS) are negative, lupus can be excluded, but that is wrong. Take your mum and look for a rheumatologist closed by.\n\n",

    "content": "Greetings,       I have Chronic Fatigue, hypothyriodism, metabolic syndrome, IC, Mild Adrenal Hyperplasia, Raynauds, ADD, yeast, grass, weed, dust, birch, oak and orange allergies and it seems like every year I get some more added to the list.   I have been trying to figure why I have so many illnesses, since I no longer take Dexamethsone for Hyperplasia, things have gotten worse and I can barely stay awake.  I stopped because I was told I may not have the Adrenal Hyperplasia.  I was happy and lost a ton of weight off the Dex.  I was recently going through my lab work and CAT Scan, all point to Adrenal Hyperplasia.  I feel that it is most likely that 0.75 mg of Dex was a very high dosage and that may have been what was causing the weight gain.  I didn't have any allergies and wasn't nearly so tired as I am now.  Maybe you should have your adrenal gland looked at for adrenal deficancy, cortisol levels checked to make sure they aren't too low, that can effect your immune system. Also, I can't convert T4 to T3, so I have to take a T3 medication and since I was told to stop for now, I am falling asleep at my desk withing 3 hours after waking up, even though I take 30 mg of XR Adderall, imagine that.  I have to take short acting Adderall just so I can pay attention to the kids.  I also had a sleep study test done and was told I am sleeping fine, yet I could have swore I didn;t sleep all night.  I am hoping that I can find a doctor here in Georgia that is good with Adrenal stuff.  Well, I hope that helps some, let me know how things are progressing with your recovery.  Please have that adrenal gland checked out, if anything it will be something you can check off your list.  Gloria\n\n",

At the beginning of the season, my right hand hurt a lot and in the mornings, I couldn't grip my toothbrush it hurt so bad - after a while, this bad pain went away, but I am experiencing numbness all the way up my arm and hand while I sleep now. I am also a cyclist and frequently have to shake my hand out from becoming numb while riding.  When I work, my arm and hand are fine - it's usually the night of or the next day that my hand is swollen and I can't make a fist.  I had a physical therapist look at it and she said it was not CTS - it didn't hurt tapping on my wrist, etc.  I now have a little pearl-sized bump that has developed in my right wrist below my thumb.  It is not painful, however.  The physical therapist didn't say anything about it. She said I needed to work on strengthening my lower back to take pressure off of my arm...???  I may well need to be stronger there, but it just doesn't seem like this is the culprit.  I am physically fit, a triathlete and have never had any other arm problems.  Do I see a \"arm\" specialist, surgeon, who?  Not sure what to do.\n\n",

All of my lab tests are normal with the exception of the SED rate. I have more symptoms than those mentioned above. My question is since this is so rare, how do I find a physician to diagnose it? I live in Kansas.   I know I feel a lot better when I am on higher dosages of prednisone. The cardiologist just diagnosed me with pericarditis, as well.

They gave me a diagnosis of \"collagen vascular disease\", but that alone can be a loaded diagnosis with not a lot of information, that I have read. I have been bumped up to 40 mg/day of prednisone. Today and yesterday the chest has becoming increasingly tighter and beginning to run a low grade temp, so actually expecting a flare up again.   By the way, doctor, I did see an ENT for my ear. He said I did not have polychondritis due to the lack of redness in my ear and that it was related to the TMJ. I have had TMJ for over 20 years and this is new. It is definitely the cartilage, not the ear itself. Can the \"collagen vascular disease\" be affecting my ears without it being polychondritis?\n\n",

Therefore it is very important to serach for the main reason. As i have described before today, chrondritis might be only a symptom of any other disease. Therefore it might be beneficial to look very carefully for other symptoms or pathological changes. Sometimes it is only a symptoms of spondylarthritis, hat might be treated by celebrex like you do it. I would suggest to go the way together with your doctor with celebrex but to visite your doctor  regulary or if any other symptoms might be present just to exclude that other reasons are overlooked.\n\n",

I have no symptoms of polychondritis and my spine is not bothering me at all.  I have had all blood tests and x-rays required to check for abnormalities.  It is a localized inflammtion in costol cartilage in the center of my ribs above the nipple point in my chest. The inflammation has put pressure on the nerves in my chest so that I feel numbness in my left arm and a burning and tingleness in my back and neck.  I have read that if therapy with antiinflammatories and cortosteroids is innefective that surgery to remove the inflammed cartilage would be benefitial and that the condition could get better.  Is this true or are there complications from removing this cartilage?  Thanks again  Edward Kirby\n\n",

Can you help me find out how to get a prescription legally for vicodin ES or Ultram (preferred)?  I currently have no medical insurance and do not have a regular medical doctor.  I have gone to the ER or have gone to walk-in-clinics for the past 4 years without insurance when things get out of control.  I graduate in May and will be an RN.

Fibomyalgia is very difficult to diagnose bacuse no laboratory investigation can help and no radiologic changes are present, so that the diagnosis should only be done by exclusion. But however,  depressions and fibromyalgia are often accompanied. Ultram is not the first line drug you should be prescribed for both diseases. In Osteoarthritis, if really present, NSAIDS are the right  way to treat it. On the other side acetaminophern is mostly not sufficient enough to terat fibromyalgia. We recommend to our patients amitryptinie that has impact on depressions, sleeping disturbances and myalgia aswell. For prescription you should present to a GP or any other doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Calling any doctor on the forum. I am a 50 year old female who was diagnosed and treated for seronegative nondegenerative inflammatory polyarthritis for five years. In this period of time due to location I have been treated by two rheumatologists who concurred with this diagnosis.  I recently moved and am seeing a new rheumatologist who concludes that the other two rheumatologists I have seen in the past were wrong and I have osteoarthritis.  After an MRI of my cervical spine due to numbness and radicular symptoms, a neurologist added the diagnosis of peripheral neuropathy and cervical spondylosis. Two questions. I.)  The radiology report states, at the skull base upper cervial spine junction, mild degenerative change effects the odontoid anterior arch c1 articulation with pannus formation. After research, I can only find the mention of pannus formation in regards to rheumatoid arthritis not osteoarthritis. Does pannus form in osteoarthritis? Could this be helpful in determining the type of arthritis I have? Question 2.)  At  level c4-c5 through c6-c7 inclusive  degenerative disc disease is present with desiccation of the discs, moderate loss of disc space height at the two most lower levels and abnormalities of the disc space at all levels. At level c4-c5, a mild 2mm bulge of the posterior disc margins is present with mild indentation on the dural sac. Foramina are patent. At level c5 - c6 2 mm broad-based bulge of the posterior disc margin is present with prominent degenerative osteophytes arising from the outer disc margin bilaterally, with moderate severe narrowing of the left intervertebral foramina and moderate narrowing of the right foramina. At level c6- c7 2 mm generalized bulge of the posterior disc margin is present with mild indentation of the anterior aspect of the dural sac. Degenerative change and osteophyte arising from the outer disc margin bilaterally leads to mild narrowing of the medial aspect of the intervertebral foramina bilaterally. I have constant occiptal headaches, muscle pain and guarding and numbness and radicular pain in my right arm and hands as well as numbness in my right foot. I have been treated with medrol dose packs, muscle relaxants and pain relievers and have gone to physical therapy for six weeks without significant change. At PT while working to strengthen my neck muscles the exercises cause a flare and I revert back to my original condition. PT included electrical stim. Sitting for more than an hour will bring on a headache. The muscle relaxants and pain meds work to alleviate symptoms but cause excessive drowsiness. This has been getting progressively more painful over the last six months. What other treatments should I pursue? I cannot work and will need to file for disability if this does not resolve itself. In your experience does this seem like a valid disability claim?\n\n",

Concerning this, I can state only some things in general:  there are defined differences between osteoarthritis and arthritis, also some people may have both. You are right that panus arround the dens axis sounds more like arthritis then osteoarthritis. Before giving an advise what therapy you should use, diagnosis should be done before. However, I would suggest to ask for rheumatoid factor, anti-CCP- antibodies, nuclearscan and an nomal X-ray of the hands and feets. Having this, one should determine if you have RA or OA. After having diagnosis, we can talk about best treatments.\n\n",

I have had an MRi with and w/out contast  of my hand when the first Rheumatologist wanted to confirm her diagnosis. They found minimal capsular thickening and edema of the 2nd and 3rd MCP joints with subtle enhancement of 3rd mcp joint capsule. Subtle synovial thickeneing or edema  at the PIP of the long finger consistent with mild inflammatory change  Two of the rheumatologists believed this to be clearcut evidence of nonerosive inflammatory polyarthritis. The 3d Rheumatologist says it means nothing. Is this MRI the same as a nucelar scan or would it give more information than this MRI? Susan\n\n",

But anyway, the symptoms are also possible in other diseases. My suggestion would be a re-test and further laboratory investigations like ANCA, Hepatitis C and B, ACLA, cyroglobulins, complement C3 and C4. This might help to distinguish between different possibilities. You are right that alle the symptoms together suggest that there is something happening inside your body that should be find out.\n\n",

    "content": "about 7 months ago i woke up with a stiff neck which lasted for about 3 months.  shortly after the stiff neck began, i started getting very bad headaches along with dizziness.  these symptoms have come and go in severity and frequency but are still occuring today.  i could better describe the dizziness as a cloudiness/ lightheadedness or a general sense of feeling funny.  a few weeks after the headaches and dizziness began i developed an enlarged lymph node behind my left ear.  after about  6 weeks it returned to its normal size.  my joint pain stated with a sharp pain in my left hip which lasted for a few weeks.  it later showed up in my right hip.  i then began getting pain which started in my right thumb and index finger and slowly spread throughout the hand and wrist and eventually to my left hand and wrist.  the best way to describe the pain is like nerves are constantly firing in my hands=(  this pain also comes and goes, and although it isn't as severe as it was, it's still occuring today.  and finally, my left knee has been bothering me as well.  I had some problems with it when i was training for a marathon, (just overuse, nothing serious) but it got better shortly after.  i haven't been doing as much exercise as i usually do, so i don'it think it should be bothering me the way it is.  basically, my body has been completely out of whack for the past several months!!  i have no prior health conditions, always been very healthy and take good care of myself!  I have been to several doctors, where i have given blood several times and everything has come back normal.  i had an MRI and i do they tested for RA and lupus.  i am just very frustrated and unsure as to what steps to take next!  i know it's not normal to have dizziness and joint pain for such a long period of time=(\n\n",

Anyway, I would suggest a presentation to the doctor every time when a new symptom is comming or if the other symptoms are persisting. Sometimes, lab results or X-ray and MRI will show pathological findings few weeks later, that means that a repeated investigation might be beneficial.  But on the other side,  lymphadenopathy might be a sign of a rheumatic disease but can also be part of many other diseases like infections or others. You sould discuss it with your local doctor what he thinks about to exclude infection diseases or about the presentation to a heamatologist. Don\u00b4t give up. I\u00b4m sure that someone will find the cause.\n\n",

They look like dents or dimples on her butt cheeks. She said it's caused by repeated injections while she's young because she would get sick often and she would get antibiotics injections. And after repeated injections, I guess the drug didn't get absolved properly and damaged the muscle tissue and it started to harden.   She's 32 years old now and I think it happened when she's 11 or 12 years old.   Is there anyway to rectify the muscle damage now? Thanks in advance!\n\n",

But there were certainly some muscle damages inside the buttock because that part of the muscle somehow shrinked and caved in. It looks like her butt cheeks sucked in in that area. It's not just on the surface, you can somewhat even feel the bone when you press in on the caved in area.    If that's the case, I'm wonder if there's any surgical or none surgical solutions to re-construct or revitalize the muscle. Thank you.\n\n",

The fire burns like crazy but I do find that daily walking and (believe it or not) Ben-Gay and/or Icy Hot work wonders.  I have tried many medications and found that the OTC med's are a good thing to keep on hand.  I am not saying to go off your medication, that would be foolish, and in some cases dangerous.  For temp relief and a good release of pain to get your joints moving, it works.  It also helps to be mobile during this, so if you have mobility problims, ask your doctor if this would be useful for you.  Also, AVOID CAFFEINE, it makes a flare up more intense and prolonges the pain.  If you need a beverage, try decaf herbal teas, they taste great, and have many flavors.  to spice them up try vanilla  or cinnanom sticks.  You don't have to live with RA, it has to deal with you!\n\n",

I sit at a desk all day, but so does everyone else in my office.  So why am I suffering?  I have been through several doctors, and my problem has been most recently diagnosed as being muscular in nature.  I have basically been told that the muscles around my left shoulder blade are often tense and become fatigued, causing a joint in that area to kind of lock up and stop functioning.  This causes a relatively low-level, but mostly constant pain.  I can exercise and do just about everything physically, and this pain sometimes lessens after certain activities. At other times, especially towards the end of a work day, the pain flares up and is very uncomfortable.   I am beginning to think that stress may be a significant factor in causing this, but I'm not sure.  nat82, have you had any luck in managing or eliminating your pain since your post?  If anyone else has had similar issues or just has advice about my situation, please post your thoughts.\n\n",

I just graduated college and my healthcare ran out, unfortunatly I can't get on another health plan due to the fact that mixed connective tissue disease is an auto decline for insurance companies. I need to treat this disease but I can't afford it.   Every job I apply for that offers benefits, I end up not getting. If anyone has any knowledge of free/ subsidized clinics that offer treatment of autoimmune disorders, could you please let me know! Also any information on how to see doctors for cheaper would be much appreciated. I live in the San Francisco bay area. Thanks\n\n",

The symptoms start off with pain and muscle stiffiness. When I move my neck during which time(s) that  I have this stiffness the vertebraes (?spelling) make a cracking sound. It is very painful.   I carry the B27 antigen that is linked to anklyosing spondalytis, but my rhuematologist says the gene is not active. I don't really believe that this true. Sometimes I take flexeril to take the pain away from my spine and neck as welll as over the counter Naprosin (?spelling). I am a 44 year old female, and I have been on disability for many years because of this condition.   I get headaches almost every day and an MRI showed a small venous angioma that is draining into the main artery.   Should I ask my doctor for a MRI of my neck?\n\n",

I wish to know what supplement and treatment will improve and not to come back.  I never have one in my life before these FIVE.  I'm 47 years old female.   Stopped all the heart and gastro medicines.  (heart still beats like crazy)  Would the muscular skeleton pain cause by too much drugs?  Toxic?  Recently has the \"blowing bubbles\" feeling in my chest, hands and legs (warm not cold).  It isn't like muscle spam.  It is softer than muscle spam and it is noisy, fast vibration and regular for more than a minute.  At the same time will get dizzy and nausea.  It happens more and more.  I wonder it is all related to muscular skeleton problem, age (too old), perimenopause or drug toxic?   I wish to get rid of these and hopefully they'll never return.  Any hope?\n\n",

It might be dangerous, because there is an effect calls \"rebound\" that might contribute to more severe heart rhythm disturbances. So get in connection with your doctor and ask about your medicine.

I have a pacemaker to backup so it supposed to take all the risk.  The sixth muscular skeleton pain is just right here at the right shoulder.  It associated with a very very mild fever.    In Oct-05, I had a Serum/Plasma done at ER.  Sodium, Potassium, Chloride, HCO3 etc all in normal range.  They didn't do the Calcium, Phosphate, Magnesium & Albumin.  Would it be these 4 minerals playing the trick?  If it is a cramp, I just rang half a glass of salt water and it heals or go away.  But afterwards the chest will has a nightmare tight like an elephant sit on there.  It is not the cramp.  Cramps are painful but this one is not painful, it vibrates/shake.  Hope I can get a further advice from you.  The muscular skeleton is painful.  It takes away my normal life.    Pika.\n\n",

However, it might be possible. Best way to see is if you are trying to relaxe with both hands, just to see what happens. Or you are ask you doctor: By blood investigation, ultrasound and other imagings it might be possible to differentiate between both. Anyway, if you have arthritis it would be good to know very early to prescribe medications that might stopp inflammation and damage in your joints.

    "content": "My Rheumatologist scheduled me for an epidural on the 23rd of this month.  I am a 51 year old male with moderate to severe Spondylosis , osteoporosis bulging and degenerated discs, and a small herniated spot as well as Osteoarthritis in my knees and elbows etc. Arthritis on the facets and endplates etc etc. My last MRI was in 2004.   I am hesitant to get the epidural because of the problems I had after a myelogram over 20 years ago. I'm not afraid of needles as I inject myself 2x a day to control my Diabetes.   Less than on hour after the procedure in 1983 my spine felt like it was scalded and on fire as well as the back of my head and every joint in my body was throbbing.. I puked and was dizzy. This lasted over two weeks as well as skin coming off on the inside of my mouth and feeling like I had eaten too much salt. It's been over 20 years and the pain and burning hits me a week or so every month. Now it is hitting me several days a week. The doctors I have talked to about this act skeptical.   I have problems with the lumbar area that at times make it too painful to walk and the thoractic area and when this area feels inflamed I can''t draw a full breath because of the sharp pain. When I complain to my rheumatologist she will probe my spine with her fingers and then she pounds on the sore spot with her hand. I get sharp pain that I can tolerate but then the area will start throbbing and usually ends up with the worst burning and throbbing. that lasts up to 2 weeks. I complain that when this happens the combunox and ultram seem to have no effect at all.   The burning and throbbing have been reoccuring since the myelogram in 1983.   Will the epidural cause the same thing as the myelogram did?   Is the epidural the end of the road or are there other treatments or is there a drug that will put the fire out and stop the throbbing????   I'm not sure how much more of this I can handle and I need to know if there are other options?????   Bill.\n\n",

Besides feeling way to old for my age (52)  these days with bent arthritic fingers, someone recently asked if I had scleroderma because of the lines around my lips. I just thought these were from age--I used to smoke, and my mother has these kind of lines. The onlyscleroderma symptom that my doctors have noted is the skin on my forearms, which is tan looking and, apparently, thicker than normal (something I would never have noticed myself). Am I in denial when I think that maybe it's not scleroderma and that it won't get worse? Is there something I can do about this? Can I have injections like collagen to fill in the lines?

Both therapies may have severe side effects, because of have to ask your the doctor if it might be usefull in your case. Beside the skin, there are many therapies for the other symptoms.

    "content": "Dear xxsmellyokellyxx,  The usual cause for muscle spasms or cramps, especially at night is low calcium. You can start by increasing your calcium intake or supplementing it. High protein diets tend to throw our calcium consumption off and they are the big \u201cfad\u201d right now. The other end of the spectrum is too much calcium, this causes muscle cramps also. Stop taking calcium supplements or consuming so much and increase your vitamin C consumption.   We have many muscles, tendons and ligaments in our feet, you may have an irritable flexor or extensor muscle that may be able to be exercised on a regular basis.\n\n",

For a specific rheumatologic disease like rheumatoide arthritis, there have to be more complaints. Likewise back main may be a rheumatic complain but can also be a symptom of other non rheumatic diseases. Other laboratory results like rheumatoid factor, ant CCP-antibodies, HLA-B 27 and many others may be usefull to differentiate the cause of the pain and the ESR. Also a x-ray may be of benefit.\n\n",

They only occur when start a sudden movement, for example when i stand up from the sofa or when playing sports if i suddenly break into a sprint from standing. They are very annoying and embarrassing as I literally cant move properly for aobut 30 seconds with my fingers jarred open.  I asked my own doctor and he said it was a lack of calcium and i should drink more milk, this didnt work.  Does anyone have any ideas what it could be and how i could prevent them??  Thanks\n\n",

About 6 or 7 months ago I started getting pains in my kness and ankles and my legs would swell.  I though because I am overweight that it was probably because of that.  Then a few weeks later my arms, elbows, wrists and basically everywhere else started to hurt and swell as well.  I went to my dr who suggested I have blood work.  The test results came back slightly high for RA factor.  So my dr sent me to a specialist.  This dr would not listen to what I had to say at all.  He walked in and suggested that b/c I am overweight that all I had to do was lose weight and my problems would go away.  Then he told me my elbows hurt because of tennis elbow (whatever that is) and that my wrists hurt and swelled b/c I have carpel tunnel in both.  He told me to take vitamen B6 and to lose weight and everything would be fine.  Now I have been trying to lose weight but you know its not that easy.  As for the vitamens I have been taking them for weeks and nothing has changed expect that I don't get my period anymore.  I am in constant pain and very frustrated.  I don't know what to do.  Please help.  Any suggestions would be apperciated.  Thank you :)\n\n",

    "title": "Pain, Upper right side",
    "content": "First let me say that I am 28wks pregnant.  So far it has been uneventful, w/only a sinus infection, and the flu a few weeks ago.  Everything else is fine, and the baby is fine.  This is my second child, the first was born in '95 via c-section for \"failure to progress.\"  I am currently taking Zantac for heartburn/acid and that has taken care of all my problems in that area.  My only concern is the pain I have had in my upper right side directly located by the last couple ribs on that side.  Sometimes it feels like a \"pulling\" sensation of pain.  I wouldn't really call it \"stabbing\" but its definetly nagging.  Its been gradually getting worse for about a month maybe two.  Is it possible it could be muscular if just located in this one specific spot?  I am worried its something horrible.  I normally wake up pain free.  Usually after being out of bed for 30 minutes to an hour the pain starts to set in.  It starts gradually and gets worse, usually sitting in front of the computer makes it worse, perhaps this is due to bad posture?  Leaning back helps to relieve the pain enough to continue sitting here.  Sometimes I can feel the pain around my backside in the same spot, but its worse in the front.  I have been using a heating pad while sitting on the couch with my feet up and a pillow behind my back and this seems to help better than other things I have tried, such as lying down in different positions.  The other day I did some housework and spent a lot of time on my feet, the pain wasn't too bad during all this, but the next day when the pain set in again it was worse.  I went to my OBGYN and she pressed around the area and it was tender only in one spot, right by my rib bones.  I sat around on the couch for the rest of the day with the heating pad and eventually I felt much better and got a good nights sleep.   My OBGYN had me go in for a gallbladder ultrasound today, but I won't find out the results until Monday.  This has me very worried, as they look at pancreas, liver, kidneys, and gallbladder during this scan.  I have no other symptoms.  I had the flu a few weeks ago, a few days after my daughter came down with it, I did as well..  I had a fever, slight cough, congestion, sore throat, hoarseness, fatigue, just general unwell feeling.  I feel completely recovered now.  My energy levels seem fine, I don't feel weak or sick, I lost 2 pounds when I was ill, but I have gained them all back now and I have a very hearty appetite.  I hardly get nautious now in the 3rd tri, but every once in a while I do get sick, maybe once every other week or so.  Slight headaches every now and then, nothing some tylenol hasn't fixed.   I am very stressed and worried that something drastic might be wrong with me because of this pain.  I see my OBGYN on a regular basis and go threw all the normal tests on a regular basis, urine, blood work, all that, and everything is normal there as well.   If anyone can shed some light on this it would be much appreciated.  I know I shouldn't stress so much but anxiety has always plagued me.  I am really scared of cancer and surgery and such.  I am 29 yrs old.  I should also mention that in the last few days similar pain is also very lightly on the left side, in the exact same spot, leaving me to believe its muscular from the weight of the baby...again any insight is helpful, as I am very worried what they can/will find on the RUQ ultrasound this morning.\n\n",

    "title": "? TIETZE'S SYNDROME",
    "content": "The right upper quadrant of the abdomen is the anatomical location of the liver and gallbladder, therefore your doctor was right to request an abdominal ultrasound. However, acute gallbladder disease usually presents as a severe pain in the right upper abdomen which radiates round the margin of the right rib cage to the scapular region and may last several hours. This is associated with sweating, nausea and vomiting. Many attacks of pain in acute disease occur at night, but you are pain-free during this period. In chronic gallbladder disease,  the pain is situated in the centre and right side of the upper abdomen and is accompanied by distention, flatulence and intolerance to fatty food. Your symptoms are not suggestive of acute or chronic gallbladder disease.  The location of pain on the rib, the positive sign of tenderness over the affected rib when your doctor pressed it, the relief you obtain with a heating pad, and a subsequent  pain of similar nature on the left rib cage are all suggestive of a condition known as Tietze\u2019s syndrome, which is sImply an inflammation of the rib cage, over the junction of bone and cartilage. The cause is unknown and the condition usually resolves without treatment.     Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical  &  Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

I had developed severe pre-eclampsia that could not be brought under control.  At the end of my first pregnancy the pain went from nagging to unbearable.  It was so severe that the post op pain of the c-section wasn't even comparable.  My liver was so swollen that my uper right quadrant stuck out over an each more than the left.  My baby was premature (33 weeks) and very underweight (3.1lbs)  He is ok now but it was close.  I was then diagnosed with a blood clotting disorder and used heparin throughout my next pregnancy.  Although it still ended in a premature birth and emergency c-section the outcome was still better.  My 2nd boy made it to 37 weeks and 4.10lbs and is doing great.  The liver hurt with the second pregnacy but not nearly as much and did not swell.  Have you been tested for the various blood clotting disorders? Make sure they test for all of them.  Most doctors neglect to test for some of the rarer ones such as the factor II, prothrombin 20210A mutation. I highly recommend it escpecially if you have had preeclampsia or multiple miscarraiges before.  If you do have a bloodclotting disorder, treatment during the pregnacy could me critical to saving your and your baby's life.\n\n",

    "content": "About four months ago had my gallbladder removed after about a year of discomfort and sometimes alot of pain. I had no gall stones or obstructions and a three percent fraction. I am not overweight in habbit of eating many fried foods. However my stomach still bothers me just about everyday and recently including tonight have had pretty intense pain under my right breast and acrossed my rib cage. It is made worse by moving and exhaling. It reminds me of the pain i had about a year ago in my rib cage but worse. I started noticing this about maybe two weeks ago but tonight while out walking it hurt pretty bad. I guess it lasted about 30 to 40 minutes. To give you a little more insight i have a huge bruise under my right breast from where i was grabbing it. Does anyone know if this has something to do with maybe.. bile that my body maybe still producing too much of..or.. i dunno maybe they need to take my gallbladder out again, just kidding. The doctor told me to give it 6 months from the day of my surgery, but im thinking its not normal. So does anyone know what it could be or related to? Thank you.\n\n",

My pain is here everyday and I was wondering if anyone else has some other ideas to get faster results.  I have had all the tests done and nothing is showing up.  I also went to the chiropractor for awhile and I was hoping that would help.  I also have been using icy/hot.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have that grating \"crepitus\" sound  present in all of my joints in my whole body, not just one joint. It is especially worse in my hips and shoulders. I have intermittent sharp pains in my joints also, but no swelling or deformities noted.  I have noticed these changes over the past few years and they have been worsening.   I haven't been feeling as energetic lately so decided to investigate if this could mean anything.  What diseases/ conditions  are associated with these symptoms or is this a normal part of aging? I am only a 31 yr old female. The only thing I could think of is Rheumatoid ARthritis.   Is crepitus generallly an indication of only a joint problem? OR could it be something bone related, or system prob? THanks\n\n",

Pain is only sharp once in awhile, more often achy. Snapping and clicking is ever present.  Ankles, knees  ( started in the knees, since I was a teenager actually), shoulders, lower back, hips. I hope you get an answer soon. It is weird because I feel as if I am falling apart, but it is surprising because I don't think I am old enough to feel like THIS. I also wondered does this happen to everyone? Is there some point you reach in life at which you ache all over all the time, to some degree or another, and never feel free of it again?\n\n",

Your physician can identify if this is actually the cause of your pain and tenderness by your signs and symptoms as well as a physical evaluation. Treatment may include pain relievers or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications. As always discuss the use of these with your physician.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

In the winter time, when I go out and clean off a car, or even play around in the snow for a short time with siblings.. my fingers and hands get swollen. The swelling can't be seen as much as it can be felt. My fingers get very tight, sometimes I can't bend them too much. They feel very tight and solid to the touch.   It's a really uncomfortable feeling. Sometimes it gets painful, but usually not very much, if at all.   It does happen with my toes a little, but they have to be in the cold a lot. My legs get sort of the same, but not as bad.. they get really itchy instead.  So, I dunno if any of it's common because I've never really asked anyone, it seems sort of weird to me.\n\n",

I was tested 4 years ago following a miscarriage and the ANA was negative.  Is this a one time test? Meaning if you test negative once, you never need to test again?  I have had pleurisy twice, once at age 25, and once just again a month ago.  I occassionally suffer from pain and swelling in my feet and hands, making it painful to walk.  I have severe menorrhagia, which 5 different OB/GYNs can't seem to find the cause for.  I have never had the butterfly rash.  I do have night sweats which keep me from sleeping.  I am really tired of seeing doctors and being tested for all these different and varying problems, and I'm inclined to just deal.  However, if there is something that could be done, I really want help!  I recently saw my internist and she suggested a lupus test, but I reminded her of my prior negative result.  Should I ask her to go ahead?  Or if you test negative once, you are always negative.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34 year old mother of 2, and live in southern US. No family history of nero. diseases, but have extreme family hisory of RA on mothers side. No major health issues until now. About 5 months ago my left eye lid began twitching lasted about 2 weeks, then my right index finger started twitching toward my thumb a holding for a split sec., this also lasted about 2 weeks, then I began getting muscle twitches all over my body, big, small, visable, not visable, they began to keep me from sleeping.  I looked up twitched and really got scared!!  Went to my DR. he asked about family history, my symptoms, did some blood work(electrolites, blood calcium ect.) told me it's stress if I didn't improve in 2 weeks he'd send me to a nero. The thing was I did't really feel stressed but I tried to believe him.  2 weeks later no better went to nero., told him about twitches, fatigue, muscles tired out eaily an shaky.  He did a physical exam(all my reflexs, touching fingers to nose, standing on toe and walking on heals, and my eyes) all normal. He also did more blood work (thyroid, parathyroid, mineral levels ect.) all normal. He told me I had BFS (benign fasiculation syndrom) nothing to worry about call if symtoms change.  Waited 2 months to return in this time I began getting muscle cramping, twitches were much less but NOT gone, neck and back stiffness and pain, some numbness in pinky now and then, joint pain, muscle sorness, the backs of my hands very sore, chill bumps only below knees, but strangest is the jolts or shocks, their hard to discribe it's kind of like when you hit a nerve in your tooth, that surge but with out  the pain. They happen mostly at night, sometimes all over,  sometimes just in my hands, but there is not much sleeping when I have those. The nero. said sounds like fibro. I asked him how much pain fibro caused, because I do have pain everyday but it not unbearable, he said pain is releitve for each person. I also asked if the jerks, twitches and other stuff went with fibro, then he said it was probably BFS with a touch of fibro. Is  that posible? He didn't seem convincing. He gave me klonapin to help me rest, I do a little better when I rest.  He said if it kept up in  a month or so he'd send me to a muscle specialist.  Should I get a second nero. oppinion or see a ruem. or muscle specialist.  I had noticed being more forgetfull, gastro problems, and kind of spaced out but I've had that way way before the other things, so I'm not sure their connected!?!! Need some solid answers. PLEASE HELP!!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is my first time on a forum. I had an ANA test run~2yrs ago was +,  then went to a rheu.~4months later feeling much better and when results of blood work came back it was fine. Then I was diag. with hyperthyroid and treated for ~1.5 yrs,  normal now. All this time though still have fatigue, brain fog, muscle fatigue, chronic vaginitis/yeast infections, headaches, low grade fevers @ night, rec. diag. with arthritus, and get SEVERE and very painful canker sores in my mouth ( by the 100's) and vaginal ones too. Married for 8yrs faithfully by both of us. Vision has gotten bad, always had GREAT sight. I have finally found a Dr. willing to listen to me. She said to come in when I feel symptoms are bad and she will run some tests. In your professional opinion does it sound like I have Lupus? The only thing is I don't have the facial rash.  Thanks for your time,  animal lover\n\n",

    "content": "Could I find out where Lupus causes inflammation at in your body? Is this a disease that will mainly affect your organs or does it primarily cause muscle/tissue inflammation? I don't know if I have any tissue inflammation but I've had past ANA's of 1:320 homogenous, a negative one, then an ANA of 1:640 homogenous pattern last month. I've had trouble with muscle pain for 5 years but during the time of the negative test, my muscle pain was gone for awhile & only had back pain. It came back as widespread spasms, numbness & tingling. I've also had kidney pain for a year now with history of hydronephrosis of unknown cause. My insides seem to be taking an attack of inflammation lately. I have gastritis, duodenitis, esophagitis, erosions, sore throat, fluid in my ears, neck pain, swollen glands, oral Candida infections, repeated mouth ulcers & scarring on one of my lungs. I also have a severe IC bladder disease. Have had repeated UTI's, yeast infections, URI's and have been suffering from extreme fatigue lately & recurring headaches. And I've had alot of medications that seem to really flare my problems up which extremely concerns me. My doctors have been unable to tell me why. Does this sound like SLE? My pcp said I had FMS but the diagnosis was only because he couldn't figure out what else was wrong but the rhematologist I used to go to said I had UCTD & could later end up with Lupus if the ANA got higher but my PCP didn't seem to believe him. He also said not to worry about this ANA because I had past ones that was positive & he didn't see any need to go back to my rhematologist. I don't think he much believes me either. I would really like to find out if I have Lupus. Are there other tests that can be used to confirm a diagnosis?\n\n",

An ER doctor wanted to admit me in the hospital but I'll give you one guess as to who said NO. The doctor in his office that did the ANA test accused me of making up having the spasms, claimed there wasn't any tests to find out if it was even so and then proceded to tell me that people come in that office and make up having pain just to get pain meds like Lortab. My pcp would know that was bull as I never ask him for such meds but he's really ignoring my health problems. And that I just don't need!\n\n",

And it's more than just one doctor. I asked my urologist the other day why my kidney would hurt when I have the urge to go the bathroom. No response whatsover though he did seem concerned about it. I've asked multiple doctors why alot my medications make my pain so much worse. It's just like talking to the wall. I have no explanations to why I've had kidney pain for a year or why I'm having widespread spasms & numbness. I went until recently with no treatment for it whatsover. My neurologist told me today that I have connective tissue disease, said I meet the criteria but he didn't do any blood work to check the antigens to see for sure. So how am I supposed to think he even believes that? If he did, why wouldn't he check to see what kind of connective tissue disease it may be? He diagnosed me with MPS but I kind of already knew I had TMJ. This feels like a nothing diagnosis. It's not answering my questions at all. I called and made an appt with my rhematologist but it'll be 4 months before I can see him again. What in the world do you do when your doctors fail to do the appropriate testing to find out what's wrong? I really can't stand being sick like this and not knowing why. I had my ESR & CRP checked & they was in normal range. How could that even be possible when I have all of these inflammatory problems? I wonder if that's why my neuro didn't do any additional blood work.\n\n",

Last febuary I started getting spots on my legs. mostly lower legs. They are dark reddish varying in size from a speck to half an inch. I had two biopsies done. The first said vasculitis. I was then sent to pittsburgh to the upmc rheumatology clinic. They said the second biopsy was abnormal but was not specific. They had the first biopsy slide sent to their pathologist. They say both are abnormal but nonspecific. The dermatologist down there said they think lupus but the rheumatologist says nothing. I had a biopsy from my stomach because my abdomen constantly hurts. That one came back severe gastritis but they said it wasn't a good enough sample. I constantly have urinary problems. tests found blood one time. Have difficulty starting and flow starts and stops uncontrollably. Very frequent urge to go. No infection found. All blood test are normal. Also suffering from migraines,eyes blurring,fatigue,weakness,intolerable to cold,sick if in heat and sun for long,bowel pain and constipation,moodiness almost always irritated.

First it started with my left wrist then went to my right ankle then knees then right wrist then left ankle then hips. I went to the doctor and they took blood samples with negative results for anything, they also prescribed steriods and that helped but once I came off of the steriods the pain came back worse. I went on steriods again and the same thing I came off an it became worse. Eventually I just gave up and quit taking anything and I havent been to the doctor again because I'm frustrated. The pain I have now is in my wrists and knees. If I put pressure on my wrists they hurt but not as bad as when it first started and my knees hurt only when I bend down. Today my legs feel very tired and my knees hurt and now I have these red swollen bumps on my lower legs they do not itch or anything but they feel like a bruise when you touch it. I have noticed that when my legs have been overworked from standing or on my feel too much I did get these bumps once before same description as above. I have no idea of what it could be. I would appreciate any advice. Thank You\n\n",

The next day I went back because I developed a sinus infection and at that time they gave me a pack of steriods. The steriods are called methylprednisone (something like that) and they also gave me an injection of a pain killer. The steriods did help but when I came off of them the joint pain got worse, enough where I could barely walk. I went back the following week and got another pack of steriods and they also gave me a prescription of darvocet. Once again when I came off the steriods the pain came back. I then started thinking it was because of the steriods and all the other medicine I was taking. I then stopped taking everything and after a couple of weeks I started noticing the pain was less and less. I started working at a day care and had to be on my feet alot and then I noticed my joints starting to hurt again so I started taking the darvocet that was prescribed to me. It has helped but I don't want to keep taking the medication because I don't want it to hide the problem or make it worse. I also recently had a bone scan done but I haven't got the results back. What will that reveal if anything?\n\n",

    "content": "I have been mulling over the possibilities for this since yesterday.    The best suggestion I can come up with for you is to begin with a dermatologist to get a specific diagnosis on the sores.  As I stated earlier, the migrating arthritis can be a secondary symptom to many different ailments.  My questions were aimed at the first two things that came to mind which were psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease, but it sounds like the chances of either of these are minimal.    So start with the dermatologist and then go from there to find a mutual cause between them and the arthritis.  The steroids are commonly used for arthritis and for sores such as you describe.  BUT, steroids are nothing a person wants to be on the rest of their lives, especially at your young age.  Rheumatoid arthritis should also be looked into.  My suggestions of possibilities sound scary, but they are different things you can investigate on your own and discuss with your physician/s.  I'm sorry I can't be of more help, but hopefully I have given you some information to help you educate yourself.    I wish you the best!\n\n",

    "content": "I have a problem, and wondering if anyone out there can help. I started a weight loss program in May, and go to curves 3 times a week. I have lost 40 pounds so far. My problem?? I am tired ALL the time. I cannot stay awake some days, that I either don't go to work, or I come home early. My whole body aches. When I lay down the seam on my pants hurts the insides of my legs. When my granddaughter just sits on my lap, the least lilttle movement is painful. I am on Prevacid, synthoid, and Questrem(sp?). My doctor is taking me off Prevacid, to see if this could be a problem. I am at my wits end. Last night I was so exhausted it was even tiring to talk. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Well I am on synthoid because I have an underactive thyroid. and the qeustram(sp?) is because I have no gull bladder, and this helps with my bowels. When I wasn't taking it I had the runs all the time, but this helps to regulate me. I have been dieting since May. I have cut out all fast food. I usually have coffee and a bagel for breakfast, orange for a snack, lunch is a lean cuisine dinner, or leftovers, snack in the afternoon is yogurt or another fruit. Supper is usually meat, potato, or rice, and veggies. I do not salt stuff, and do not use gravy. I do take Cetrum for a multi vitamin, but not everyday, cause I forget. There, I hope I answered all your questions.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe chest pain sternum",
    "content": "I am a 54 year old female diagnosed with GERD, sliding hiatal hernia, laryngospasms, allergies/asthma (mild), and IBS.  In 1999, I had my gallbladder removed and wound up in the hospital 8 days.  The surgeon said \"It was a mess in there.  The gallbladder was attached to your omentum.  Are you going to have any further testing done?\"  Foolish me, I did not go in for my final visit with him so I never asked him why he thought \"further testing\" should be done.  I did tell my primary physician this but nothing ever came of it though I repeatedly ask him to check into it.  I have since had an MR of the abdomen and nothing was noted other than three small kidney stones.    My question concerns \"incidents\" that began about six months ago.  The first time I was walking out of a store laughing.  I leaned forward only slightly and was suddenly \"grabbed\" by the most SEVERE pain in the middle of my chest right above my sternum.  The pain was so severe that I could not move.  If I moved my hips (attempted to walk) the pain intensified.  If I moved my neck or arms, the pain intensified also.  I felt as though the pain \"stabbed or grabbed\" me.  Breathing was possible but painful.  The SEVERE pain lasted for well over a minute.  It finally lessened to a point to where I could very slowly take baby steps to reach our vehicle.   The pain lasted about five minutes.    I have had this pain at least four other times.  It seems to hit me when I lean back.   Once I was attempting to raise my hands and \"stretch.\"   Two days ago, I leaned my head back under the shower to wet my hair.  It is very painful and this time, the pain only radiated down my arms, possible because I did not attempt to move as I was fearful of making the pain worse.    Any ideas what could be the cause of such SEVERE pain?\n\n",

She has and had some of the same symtoms in which you are discribing.  Hope suffered for two years with intense migraines and loss of apetite, among other not so noticable symtoms.  After firing a doctor for telling me I had the crazy mother syndrome and my daughter was sticking her fingers down her throat did I found the right doctor who listened to the symtoms Hope was having.  He then orderd a hormonal chem panel (CBC blood testing was done numerous times with normal levels except high colesteral).  Finding the levels off the chart he ordered a MRI immediatly.  The MRI showed a large timor growing from within the pit gland to the stem of the hypothalamus.  It was taken out about a month later and now Hope indures nightly inj, chronic fatigue, and numerous medications to help keep her maintained.  We can't treat the condition we can only treat the symtoms. Hope takes Growth hormone inj, DDAVP, Synthroid, Cortisol, sleeping pills, allergy meds and is currently being diagnosed with depression.  This is the only adive that I can offer and I hope it helps you find a better way of living.   Kah\n\n",

    "content": "I am posting this to hopefully get some clues as to how and why this is happening.  This all started about a week ago.  My right arm and wrist started to feel weak, went to bed and the next morning and had severe pics and needles from my elbow to the tips pf my fingers.  After 3 days it went away but my arm still feels weak.. it is sluggish.  After  the tingling went away my left foot just totally went numb on the top (except for my 4th and 5th toe).  I am worried about this because I had gestational diabetes with both of my children and it has been less than a year since I had my last child.   I also have thyroid problems ( I was diagnosed as being subclinical with hypothyroidism and as having a goiter and nodules on my thyroid.)  Any info or thoughts would be appriciated.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Trauma to knee resulted in pain steadily diminshing, full range of motion almost present, 2 weeks post trauma.  Medial and proximal to knee, a pocket of flujid is becoming well demarcated, not by discoloration, but because all swollen tissue around it is getting back to normal.  No puncture ever occurred, pocket o ffluid is not infected.  Is this probably burst suprapatellar bursa? At what point would it need draining?  Should a knee presure bandage be worn?  Does letting the body resorb the fluid increase the changces af arthritis at a later date? Thanks. [/list]\n\n",

    "content": "I\u2019ve been experiencing a general decline in health in recent years.  I\u2019ve asked a couple of doctors and they can find nothing.  I\u2019m not looking for anything too general as was said by one tactless doctor, 'You\u2019re getting old'    .  Nor am I expecting anything specific.  Just some things to go on between these extremes, please.  Symptom 3 below is the real problem, 1 and 2 are just a bit of added info on the timeline that may or may not be related or helpful.  Symptoms: 1. Stomach Pain:   First ever stomach pain was about eight years ago when I tried some lecithin tablets.  I found myself bending in half on the living room floor in pain.  I didn\u2019t connect it to the lecithin at the time, but did so only later when I tried lecithin again.  Then a year and a half ago I had serious stomach acid  and even got a couple of over-the-counter antacids, which is extreme for me.  I can still feel the pain now at a low level, even as I type this.  2. Malaise:  About four years ago  I began to find that I liked doing nothing, just staring at the wall, out the window, whatever.  I've always kept busy before.  3. Muscles/Joints:   About a year ago I felt a tightness on the tops of my feet as I lay in bed.  Then, within a month or so my ankles and/or feet began to make cracking sounds while I was jogging, which I found extremely disconcerting.  At the time I was working out very hard, running around a local lake (3+ miles) and probably pushing it too hard on those hot summer days for my physical condition which is so so.  (I had no air-conditioning at home, and possibly some black mold about.)  I had been working out at Bally's for a couple of years, but definitely not as a muscle head.  After a few months the tops of my feet hurt, and sometimes I could hardly walk at work.  The same series of events then happened with my shoulders and lower neck (nine months ago), my knees then hips (six months ago. I stopped formal workouts then.), my wrists and finger joints and muscles (sometime more recently), and now I hear popping in my elbows.   Background info and risk factors that may or may not be related: I\u2019m male, European ancestry but live in Midwestern US,  43, 'young for my age' as they say, ten or fifteen pounds over ideal weight, smoked a pack a day of menthol cigarettes from 17 but cut to almost nothing during the last fifteen years, divorced, light to moderate drinker, wild dancer, cat owner, scientific professional with exposure to some non-polar solvents and chemicals not generally considered toxic.   If you can put some or all of this into some sort of medical order and point at something I would be greatly appreciative     Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "rheumatology appropriate?",
    "content": "Hello,   I'll try to keep this as short as possible I\u2019m a 35 year female and I\u2019ve had various aches and pains since I was about 16 but pretty much constantly over the last 9 years. Although most of the time the pain is tolerable and doesn\u2019t limit my movement in any way it has been getting slowly but progressively worse over time.  In 1992 I started to notice a \u201cclunk\u201d in my hip if I moved it in a particular way. I did not have any hip pain at this point however.   In 1996 II started to get constant  shoulder (around the shoulder blade). Felt like something just a bit \u201cout\u201d.. had to constantly move and crunch it. I returned to college this year to complete my MA. GP said it was wear and tear. It would get worse during my lifetime, wouldn\u2019t refer me to physio and just told me to take ibuprofen. On completing my MA severe left shoulder pain, shooting right down to my hand, arm numb at times (due, I presume, to many hours spent at the computer). Various alternative therapies helped. A Chiropractor who actually was more concerned with my hip. This surprised me as I had no hip pain at this point.She also said my shoulder blade pain was \u201cribs sticking out\u201d, pushed and shoved until I felt something move. I had about 3 days pain free and the shoulder felt loose. Soon I was back to \u201cnormal\u201d pain. Over the next few years my left Hip/ lower back pain started, as did my left wrist and ankle.  2000 I Fell down some stairs landed on my bum and  felt pain shoot right up my back into my neck. I was x rayed which showed nothing. Saw a different GP, again suggested ibuprofen and massage\u2026.   2001 I was pregnant with my first baby and (like all pregnant women I guess) I had  a lot of low back pain. This eased a lot after the baby was born. However when she was about 3 months old I got trigger thumb on my right hand. It was x rayed which showed nothing Iin all this time the \u201cbaseline\u201d shoulder, neck, hip pain continued. My left wrist and ankle continued to be,\u2026 not really sore, but just felt \u201cout\u201d\u2026 needing to click and crunch them all the time.   In 2002 I tried physio. Again he was more concerned with my hip and lower back. Exercises and traction eased the pain. He seemed unable to see the problem was with my neck and shoulder. in fact thought my right shoulder seemed worse.  Despite some neck work the pain continued.   In 2004 while pregnant with my 2nd  baby I suffered v bad low back/ hip pain to the extent that I couldn\u2019t walk for more than 5 mins. After the baby was born it eased gradually although remains worse than pre pregnancy.   This year I\u2019ve found that all my pains are increased. From April to June I  suffered from constant and severe headaches. I had blood tests including  ESR, CRP etc which were all normal. GP concluded that it was from my neck and prescribed cataflam when needed and exercises and book (Robin Mc Kenzie).  The headaches have gone now  although I still occasionally have shooting head pain when I turn my head in a particular way.  Neck and shoulder pain increased however and my neck is really annoying me at the minute. When it\u2019s really bad I take the cataflam which takes the edge off but doesn\u2019t get rid of it. I also have some pain down my left arm.. right to my middle finger.  some days my left hip( or lower back.. not sure which ) really bothers me. Pain half way down my buttock and sometime on the inside of my thigh... occasionally shooting pain if I turn quickly.  So 9 years of daily (though mostly tolerable) pain and I don\u2019t really know what is causing it. Is it some kind of arthritic thing or unavoidable wear and tear like that first GP told me.  Do you think these symptoms warrant a rheumatology assessment.  I have never had any joint swelling. When I stand up after sitting for a while or getting out of bed in the morning I am stiff and it takes more than a few seconds to straighten up but that is all. My father has had similar symptoms since his twenties and has seen various specialists but never a clear diagnosis. We both wondered about fibromyalgia but concluded that we\u2019re not actually sore enough!  Would the ESR a couple of months ago have been elevated if it was some arthritic condition?  Alcohol (not that I often have any!) makes all my pains much worse... that's been the case since I was 17. I have also had restless legs at night for years.  Apologies for the epic. Thanks for bearing with me! Any advice welcome.  Pauline\n\n",

    "content": "I don't necessarily disagree with Nurse2, but don't totally agree either.  A rheumatoid factor would certainly be in order, but an ANA, even if positive won't explain your symptoms.  Another ESR and CRP would be helpful to determine the degree and length of your inflammation if that is your problem.  Fibromyalgia is somewhat elusive to determine even though the ACR came out with diagnostic requirements about 10 yrs ago.  Your shoulder could be thoracic outlet syndrome or even a brachial plexus problem.  Have your doctor give you a medrol dose pack and see how much relief, if any, you get from it.  If you get a lot, then your problem is inflammatory in origin.  You should also have plain films done of your spine, etc. to see if you have any osteoarthritis.  Dr. C\n\n",

I\u2019ve had to give up boxing, one of my favorite pastimes, as any attempt at bagwork causes this knuckle to creak and groan sickeningly during motion afterwards. Also, I\u2019ve had intermittent pain in that finger and knuckle since the injury. There has been little or no improvement in condition over this entire period. Have I done some injury to the associated ligament? If so, can it be repaired? Can I risk ignoring the injury and returning to practice, or will this cause permanent injury?

    "content": "I am 50 years old and very athletic. I have been experiencing lower back pain for about a month. I can not remember a \"pull\" or an event to which to attribute a possible injury. My pain worsens when trying to sleep and hurts most when first getting out of bed or standing up and trying to straighten the back. I can not sleep the whole night and I must change my sleeping posture several times a night from one side to the other to be comfortable. After a few seconds of standing, after \"things seem to be more in alignment\", the pain subsides into a dull pain in the lower back. After standing up and starting to walk I have pain in trying to straighten the back but after a few steps the pain lessens and I can walk upright. Exercise makes the pain lessen and actually sometimes causes it to go away completely. The pain returns soon after rest whither sitting or sleeping. Sometimes the pain seems to be on the right lower back and sometimes the left.    I may be mistaken but sometimes it seems there may be a little different sensation when I urinate. Not necessary painfull but maybe a little burn. Sometimes I may feel a little discomfort in my testicals. I recently had a vascectomy so perhaps these are symptoms of it. My urine is not bright colored. Having a bowel movement seems to lessen the pain temporarily.\n\n",

If either of the latter two, then I understand because they can cost as much as $15,000 a year out-of-pocket.  If it is methotrexate then iit isn't that expensive.  If it is one of the expensive ones, he can ask his doctor to contact the drug rep for papers to fill out to see if he can get it free.

    "content": "After a recent elective 8 hr. surgery, my 54 year old husband developed severe pain in the heels of his feet. The doctor and the hospital seem to be stumped to what may of caused this.  He cannot walk without a walker nor take any pressure, even slight, on the bottom of his feet. He is nearly bed-ridden with depression setting in and living 24/7 on strong pain killers, which are the only things that allow him sleep or relief of any kind. His surgery was on Jan. 9th and I am very concerned about the large amounts of medicines they have him on while we are in this 'wait and see if time helps' stage.  No one seems to be able to put a name to this condition nor give us any answers about it or what to expect or even if he will recover from this. Has anyone ever heard of anything like this? I would appreciate any info that could steer me in the right direction to find some answers, whether it be an informative website, a name for this condition, or a specialist that we might seek out for help? We are desperate for any kind of information and would appreciate ANY imput you could share with us.   Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "JP, I would have to guess at this one.  There are many structures attached to the heel bone (calcaneus). The two structures primarily associated with heel pain are the plantar fascia (band of connective tissue along the bottom of the foot that supports the arch) and the flexor digitorum brevis muscle.  The causes of heel pain are many but most commonly:  Traumatic to the plantar fascia or the flexor muscle or the tissues in the heel area.  Entrapment neuropathy in which a nerve is compressed by surrounding tissues ,   Disc disease in which a disease of the vertebral disc causes compression of a nearby nerve that carries pain sensation.   Arthritis and connective tissue diseases can also cause pain in the heel. Tumors, infections and bone problems (calcaneal apophysitis) can all cause heel pain.   But none of these causes quite fit the description you stated. Most of these causes are chronic diseases except for trauma (which is easily excluded). We are left with one possibility and I must warn that this is only a thoery. One of the rather rare causes of heel pain is vascular compromise.  Now lets talk a little about abdominoplasty:  Several large studies address the issue of complication in liposuction patients:  Teimourian (1989) conducted a national survery of 935 plastic surgeons who performed 76,000 \u201cmajor\u201d liposuctions from 1984-1989; overall complication rate was 0.1%; 2 deaths, one from pulmonary embolism and the other a fat embolus.  Free fat can be found in the blood of all patients undergoing more than 900cc liposuction, according to one study.  This is usually subclinical.  Fat embolism syndrome is a separate entity that was first described in 1861, classically from a long bone fracture.  Symptoms generally occur within 24 hours, they are tachycardia, tachypnea and fever; hemoptysis if there are pulmonary fat emboli, and neurologic symptoms if to the brain \u2013 the smaller fat globules go through the lung. The point is that an embolus which starts in a vein is usually caught up in the lung vessels before it goes to the heart. As I just stated if the embolus is small enough it passes through the lung vessels and reaches the heart. Once it reaches the heart there is no telling where it could end. So to state this remote theory clearly: The fat embolus from the abdominoplasty passed through the lungs to the heart and from there ended up in the heel vessels where they caused ischemia (or loss of blood to a small area in the heel). Ischemic pain is very painful and causes substantial compromise.  I would advise you to discuss this issue with your doctor. He is in a better position to judge what causes to include and which to exclude. Please do get back here after your visit and let me know how things went.  Best of luck!\n\n",

    "content": "As of this morning, my husband went to his surgeon for a check-up. Everything is healing well except his heels. The doctor told us that he didn't want to say anything in hopes that the heels would mend themselves. I guess when they put the restraints on my husband for surgery, they didn't pad them. Being that he was under so long and in a head-down position, oxygen and blood didn't get to his feet-hence the sever pain. The doctor said because of what happened to my husband, hospital policy on this matter will be changed for future patients. He said if this doesn't clear up soon, he will have to perform another surgery and cut out whatever dead tissue is causing the problem. He never really explained tho, what we might be facing and if we will have a \"full recovery\". I'm not really sure how he can know the extent of damage done without some kind of test as I researched your response the best I could, being I by no means, understand most of this medical mumbo-jumbo :), but I guess some of my concerns were answered between you and what the surgeon had to say today. I can only hope that we can get him off these 50 or so heavy pain killers every 3 days soon and be able to put the walker to rest for good.It will be nice to have our \"Mr. Sunshine\" back instead of the mad-wheeling walker grouch. lol  In his search for youth, (have to LOVE the mid-life crisis thingee!), I personally wonder if it was worth the price. Thank you so very much for your concern, your prompt replies and for \"being here\" for us.  God Bless you and your staff.\n\n",

I am a foot doctor so i would hope that the services of a foot doctor (podiatrist) were considered for this patient.  Vasculalr etiology would make sense for acute heel pain but did anyone pay attention to the positioning of the patient during the procedure. Positioning that somehow compressed the feet, that is compressing the posterior tibial nerves or medial calcaneal nerves sould cause a suddnen onset of heel pain.\n\n",

The doctors at first diagnosed her as having lupus.  She did have hair fall out at some point in time, her lungs continue  to hurt, and her joints continue to swell.  As of now, doctors are saying that she has a mild case of lupus and now has rheumatoid arthritis.    She can't sleep with the window open because the joints on her finger will swell.  Also, her fingers also swell when there is cold weather.  In addition, both of her elbows do not bend easily.  She cannot straighten any of her arms.  Her elbows hurt when she tries to grab heavy items or tries to extend her arms.  Any idea, what she may have? What regimen can she follow in order to reduce the swelling and pain?\n\n",

You did not say what tests were done to determine the condition your sister has. I assume she had a positive ANA. There are many RX drugs that can be prescribed for her to treat both Diseases. you should contact your doctor and inquire about theses, In the mean time, there are many OTC rubs and creams that can alleviate the pain for short periods of time.

Now this pain is still with me, but has not gotten any worse.  It is a mild pain, one that I can easly live with.  I am however trying to get back into the military and I will need the bulging disk to go away.  Is this possible?    I tried PT once, did it 4 sessions, but never actually followed it, so I would say I have never done any thing to help the problem.  I just recently started correcting my posture, this seems to help some.  Now with PT and anti-inflamitories would this make the bulge go away?    I go back to a spine specialist on Aug 9th, but I want as many opinions as I can get.  Thanks, Matt\n\n",

If you don't have other symptoms and the pain is tolerable, i think that a trial of serious physical rehab and exercises to strenghthen the back muscles would be in order after which re-evaluation of the condition should be done.  Sometimes, the findings that are found on the mri have nothing to do with the symptoms. Meaning that you have a disc bulging between l-4 and l-5, if this disc is pressing on a nerve giving you pain, it should be in the distribution of that nerve, otherwise, you will be doing all kinds of things may be even up to surgery on that disc and then you will end up with the same pain that you had after surgery.  So, start with rehab and see how it goes.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "In Dec. 04 I stepped out of my home to shovel some snow and all I did was picked up a shovel and I hit the ground. My legs just gave out and I sat on my butt in pain. I also went for a MRI and I can\u2019t remember where the budging disk is, someplace low in my back,  but I live in pain almost every day. I did have the burning, and numbness going down my right leg and some days I still do off and on. I still have pain on a scale from 1-10 with 10 being the worst. The pain I have on most days run\u2019s from a 7 to a 10, so you can see that this is not something I can just forget about or work through. When I stand in one place for longer than a few minutes my stomach gets upset and I feel as if I\u2019m going to vomit.   I did the PT for a while but this is something that is hard keep up. I don\u2019t like to take pills to cover the pain, but I\u2019m getting to the point where I feel it\u2019s my only option. I seen a Dr. a month ago and he told me that surgery should be the last and final step. He talked about injections of some kind. I\u2019m going to be 37 next month and I can\u2019t take waking up in pain much longer. If I do something today I could really pay for it tomorrow.  Other than just doing the PT is there anything I could be doing that can relieve this pain or discomfort?   Jim\n\n",

    "title": "Head pain...Fibro or DDD?",
    "content": "I am confused about jaw and face pain I have been experiencing and would appreciate any input or suggestions on what is most likely causing it and how to ease it. I was diagnosed years ago with fibromyalgia and more recently with advanced degenerative disc disease, stenosis and spondylosis...mostly in C5-6 area. Lately I have been having trouble with pain in the area of the TM joint and into the jaw (almost down to my chin) on the left side and it is usually accompanied by pain in my temple, ear, behind the eye, sometimes the sinus, and the base of my skull (sometimes extending down my neck and/or up the back of my head). It seems to be mostly on the left but occassionally it effects both sides more or less equally. There are times when Tylenol or Ibuprofin will help take the edge off (and sometimes a heat pack) and other times when it won't even touch it...even after 3 or 4 doses. It usually lasts a day or two then disappears for a week or two and comes back. It's beginning to drive me to distraction because I can't think or concentrate and when I bend over (which I do frequently at work) it only makes it worse. I've read that TMJ problems are common in people with fibro but it's only been a problem since my neck became symptomatic...about the last 7 months. Could it be a combination of both the fibro and the neck issues or is it most likely one or the other? Or none of the above? Sincerely, Aimee B.\n\n",

    "content": "You maybe experiencing Myofascial Pain, common in patients with Fibromyalgia Syndrome. The main feature of this condition is pain arising from a distinct portion of the muscle, which is called a trigger point. Stimulation of the trigger point by pressure or by stretching the muscle produces pain.Tthe pain may be felt in an area that is some distance from the trigger point. Myofascial pain may originate in muscles anywhere in the body, including the back, neck, extremities, head and face. Other symptoms of myofascial pain include intermittent numbness, muscle tightness, pins and needles sensations, tingling, or hypersensitivity.  Temporomandibular Joint Disorder, TMJ, This is one of the most commonly used joints in the body. (It moves every time you chew, talk or use your mouth at all.) The displacement creates a painful pressure and stretching of the associated sensory nerves. You might have TMJ if you feel like your jaw is locking or clicking, if you have a problem opening your mouth fully or if you have frequent headaches or pains in your neck.   As you can see, your pain may be caused from either of these disorders. You should make an appointment with your dentist to rule out TMJ.  There are some things you can do for pain while waiting to see your doctor/dentist.  Local cooling of the muscle to reduce pain, place ice pack at base of neck.Leave on 15 min. Off 15. If cooling does not work for you, try heating pad, 15 on and 15 off.  Gentle Range of Motion to all upper extremities. Roll neck gently from side to side . Continue to take the OTC pain meds.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much Nurse2 for the response and the information.   I actually have talked to my dentist about it and he didn't seem to think it was anything to worry about. I  have had clicking on occassion, as well as feeling I can't open my mouth very wide, in the past but not so much with the recent onset of more extensive symptoms...so, from what you say, I'm assuming it's more likely MFP?!  Unfornately, my neck problems became symptomatic due to a fall at work so dealing with the situation becomes rather complicated. I do have an appointment with my regular Dr. for a physical in a couple of weeks so I may ask him for his input too. If he thinks it's more likely to be connected to MFP after examination then I can contact workmans comp about getting someone in the system to see me. If he thinks it's more likely TMJ then I can call my dentist and talk to him again.  One additional question...could a trigger point in the area of the neck or shoulders also cause dizziness? Seems like when my head and face symptoms kick up I tend to get dizzy much more easily...not a good thing when you bend over a lot on the job.  Thanks again for the information and for your time...it's appreciated. Have a great week. Aimee\n\n",

    "content": "My husband has had pitting edema in the left hand for 2 months now- He also had symptoms of carpal tunnel syndrome for years.  The doctors all agreed that the CTS was the culprit for the edema.  He was on two medrol packs and had surgery while on his last two days of the last medrol pack.  5 days post surgery- the edema reappeared.  Now...it is determined that the edema is another condition besides CTS.  In addition to the edema, he also has been having bilateral stiffness in both hands, groin pain, and general fatigue.  The doctor saw him and ordered CBC w/Diff, SED rate, RF.  RF was negative- SED rate 37, WBC's 13.9, elevated lymphocytes.  The doctor is now ordering labs to R/O Lyme disease and an Immunoprotein electrophoresis, w/immunofixation.  This all will be drawn on Monday.  We live in Florida.  Lyme disease is rare but can occur.  We do live in the country and he is outside alot.  One other culprit could be...he is on Crestor, but only 5mg.  Of course, that is what my husband thinks is the underlying problem to all of the joint symptoms.  No one else does though.  He is now on a 12 day prednisone regimen.  His edema and symptoms are obviously gone (as they were with the other two medrol packs).  He has been afebrile to our knowledge.  He does not do well on Prednisone.  He started with 60mg x 2 days, 50 x 2 days, etc. for 12 days.  He is on day number 4.  Any speculation of what else could be going on?\n\n",

    "content": "Psoriatic arthritis can develop at any time. On average, it appears about 10 years after the first signs of psoriasis. For most people it appears between the ages of 30 and 50. It affects men and women equally. In about one of seven people with psoriatic arthritis, arthritis symptoms occur before any skin lesions.   Like rheumatoid arthritis, psoriatic arthritis is thought to be caused by a malfunctioning immune system. Psoriatic arthritis is usually milder than rheumatoid arthritis, but some patients with psoriatic arthritis have as severe a disease as patients with rheumatoid arthritis.   Psoriatic arthritis can start slowly with mild symptoms, or it can develop quickly. It is very important to have as early and accurate a diagnosis as possible. Left untreated, psoriatic arthritis can be a progressively disabling disease. In fact, half of those with psoriatic arthritis already have bone loss by the time the disease is diagnosed.   It is important for people who seem to be developing severe psoriatic arthritis to begin appropriate treatment. Early treatment can help slow the disease, and preserve function and range of motion. Some early indicators of severe disease include onset at a young age, spinal involvement and the results of certain blood studies.\n\n",

Over the last few weeks my neck got very bad and in desperation I went to see a sports massage therapist last week and I am feling MUCH better.  Never felt so positive and with a much more freely moving neck than I have had in a few years (my husband confirmed this).  I have also had ams and legs very weak and not working properly. Oral steroids have alleviated the sysptoms but it all gets you down.  Find a deep tissue sports massage therapis and see if you improve - I really think you might wonder why no one has suggested it before.  I think many of my problems are due to muscles not working and others trying to compensate. Everyone attributed my pains to Anklosing Spodylitus but my sports massage lady said that it is no wonder I am in so much neck pain because many of the muscles are not working in my shoulders (my feet are feeling a bit better too and she did not do anything to them last week).  I have booked an hour session this week to work on my soulder and my legs/feet - I am very excited and feeling the most positive I have for ages. - let me know how you get on.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Rntdj ... I was beginning to think All the Drs? were on the 19th green.  Indeed as you are a nurse they may still be.  At any rate I'm appreciative of your reply.    I posed the question because I'm a 53 yr. old woman and I think I expierenced gout which is not new to my family ... indeed my dad had it and I seem to have his genes like none of my other siblings.  (That's because I have an inherited eye disorder that none of my other family members appear to have.)   Anyway, one night while sitting at the computer I fell asleep and I think when I woke up my foot was in the position of resting on the ball of my left foot then this incredible pain hit that lasted all weekend.  The pain had my screaming and moaning and thank God I had a cane around the house to assist my hobbling.  I accepted that it was arthritis (sp) or gout because my dad had gout and one of my brothers though 20 some yrs. younger than me also has had an episode of gout in the past few months.  The pain subsided over the next five dyas or so but even now there is a bit of ache if I position my big toe just right.  I then set out to learn about gout.  I read about uric acid and  water intake.  Other things as well, then I thought about the Diamox I have been taking for about a year.  I probably made all the wrong connections and that's why I posted here. To ask if there is some connection to gout being caused by extended use of Diamox.  To be fair I must say that I do experience that type of pain in my thumb joints at times.  I once read an online query about Diamox and its possibly causing a stroke because it takes water from the body therefore from around the brain.  There was no answer to the question.    Thank you, any / all who post to this.\n\n",

With that being said, there are multiple side effects that one may experience from the medication Diamox but to my knowledge a stroke has not been included in this list. Labwork is used to verify if Gout is suspected. If it would be diagnosed that your problem is Gout then I would relate the Diamox to worsening of symptoms but not the actual cause of the disorder.

    "title": "Sports injuries or arthritis?",
    "content": "SOrry this will be long, but I can't figure out how to condense it.  For the past year, I have been trying to come to an understanding of problems I have been  having.  The background is this: I am a runner and a pianist, and went to see my doctor about a variety of aches and pains I had been having in my knees, feet, hips, back, wrists, and fingers.  The thing that had fnally sent me there, though, was that I had developed such severe knee pain that walking was very difficult; I didn't make a habit of going to doctors about little aches and pains, or even high fevers or the flu.  I was hoping that she'd send me to my sports medicine doctor, but she did an RF test and then sent me to a Rheumatologist instead, because the RF was positive.  I saw the rheumatologist for two months, during which time he tested me for syphilus and inflammation, and decided based on that and the symptoms I was having that while he found osteoarthritis in my feet and the RF test he ran, too, was positive, there was no real evidence of RA, so he (finally, hooray) sent me to my sports med guy.  The sports med guy saw me for a while and prescribed some good - but ultimately ineffective - exercises,  and finally  determined that perhaps I should get orthotics.  I had to save up for those, as my insurance didn't cover them, but I finally did get them.  They didn't seem  to do much good, though, and so I decided to see a doctor again when the knee pain was getting worse again so that, if necessary, I could get a new referral to the sports med guy.  Also, I had switched GPs for convenience reasons, and wanted to meet my new GP.  In the meantime I had been feeling very exhausted, having problems with my hands and feet tingling, and had put on a bit of weight unexpectedly, and thryroid disorders run in my family, so I thought I'd get that checked out, too, while I was at it.  I met my new GP, and she ran complete bloodwork and asked me a few questions.  Everything came back fine except for the platelet level (slightly high) and the RF (still positive) and so she basically told me that while I could get a second opinion from another rheumatologist or go back to the sports med guy,  I should probably just accept that running was causing me to be in pain, and would continue to do so, and that if I won't stop running I should expect the pain to get worse and my joints to deteriorate, but that there was really nothing wrong.  That didn't make much sense to me; I know runners in their 70s, and they seem to still have joints, so why, if there is nothing wrong, would this be the case?  However, I do trust her opinion as she is the one who went to medical school, and she seems to be very competent.  At this point, I have decided that my best bet is probably just to keep taking supplements (I have been taking glucosamine and will start taking calcium, too) and ice a lot, stretch a lot, and accept things for what they are, but I am just curious if there is any other idea about this, or any advice about what I can do to avoid living out  her prediction - and that of all the other doctors, who also advised not running or playing piano.\n\n",

Not every runner is lucky enough to have good joints their whole lives; osteoarthritis happens to most everyone, especially people who put a lot of stress on them.  There are lots of low impact aerobic excercises to do that will keep your fitness level and help save your joints.  If you are truly asymptomatic with the rheumatoid and it is just osteo, you do need to stop impacting your joints.  The glucosamine and chondroitin is a good idea, but will only slow the degeneration, not reverse it.

    "content": "I am having leg pain on the inner and somewhat posterior side of my left leg that runs from just above my ankle to almost the top to my thigh. The pain feels like deep bruising, but no bruise is apparent. No recent exercise or injury to the area. Does not feel like a pulled muscle. I am 44 y.o. and am in the midst of an IVF cycle, have been on Lupron since Sept. 2, and estrogen since Sept 16. The pain started in my calf around Sept 14 and ran in a straight line up my calf. Woke on the morning of Sept 16 with a stronger pain running up my thigh. No discoloration, no heat, no swelling, no itching, no fever. Yesterday pain was not improved, and left leg felt slightly warmer along path of pain. Some pain seemed slightly more localized in a spot an inch or two above the knee- still inner and somewhat posterior side. Pain is minimal when sitting still, increased when walking, and even more increased when the area is pressed down upon. Still feels like deep bruising. (Also possibly of note, had an acupuncture treatment- lower leg & ankle areas only, on Sept. 15. Acupuncturist does not feel treatment could have caused these symptoms, but who knows?) Went to the ER yesterday to rule out DVT. Ultrasound done and no clots seen, but no explanation or advise was otherwise given. Last night I noticed a very slightly swollen area in the spot of localized pain near the knee- about 3-4 cm diameter with irregular edges, very slightly blanched looking. This morning that same area does not look raised, but still looks blanched, with a light pink/red spot in the middle, about 1 cm oval. I'm sure some the associated factors listed are red herrings, but since I don't know which ones, I include all that I think might be remotely related. Any ideas?\n\n",

Dr. has done tests for DVT, like you, with no evidence of clot.  No pain on rest, however, when walking it feels like an imaginary rubber band being pulled tight, making it very uncomfortable to straighten my leg.  My \"blotches\" started as a pinkish/red center and have spread into what looks like a clump of tiny veins.    I had blood drawn today for tests.  Dr. said he could feel lymph nodes in my groin area, but he is clueless as to what the problem is.  Sure would be interested to talk with you regarding this if you happen to notice my message.

It's best to see a specialist for depression - there are many treatments available if something doesn't work right or agree with you.  Don't give up on trying to help yourself.  Psychiatry isn't the same treatment for everyone who has depression like say, diabetes or high blood pressure.  It is more of an art, tailor made for the patient.  Go see someone who can maybe help you more, you will be glad once it's under control.\n\n",

    "content": "Is amazing, but I have very similar symptoms as yours.  I'm 31.  Have had the symptoms on and off for a year now.  I suddenly feel like I get dizzy (not vertigo, though) and like someone is pushing my back or pulling my legs down when standing.  I also can get dizzy when moving on bed, depending if I'm on back or on my side.  I also get very dizzy with flat 90 degrees chairs, like in restaurants.  That can be very distressing.  Have done all kind of tests (blood count, thyroid, A1C, blood sugar tolerance, ECG, Stress ECG, head MRI, body CAT scan), everything has come back normal or within ranges.  The only strange thing is my Liver Enzimes are somewhat (minimal) out of range, mainly Bilirribun and Uric Acid.  I mean 5 to 10% above the upper normal limit.  I believe this is something doctors still have no answers for.  Hope someone gives me the answer soon.  One suggestion: Exercise and GOOD diet do help.  Try to do the zone diet and exercise for 30 mins 3-5 days a week.  It has greatly improved my symptoms, although they don't go away.\n\n",

Testosterone is vital to muscle tissue, you can lose muscle or they will be weak with too little.  It's also vital to energy, mental well being, sex drive, etc.  Most of the newer tests show the lowest amounts to be 300 or more.  See a GU, a specialist in men's issues.  About your muscle pain, are you working out too hard for your limits?  Do you lift weights?  If so, how often?  Are you overweight? Do you have any other symptoms?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there! Two causes in your case can cause fatigue. First the hypothyroidism. Any time you are not properly controlled you will feel exactly as you describe. The other cause is depression. In this case it is not that you are taking too much of your medication or that it is causing the side effects. It may be that you need to take a higher dose of Zoloft to control the depression.  Both would explain your long standing fatigue: The depression would precede the initiation of your medication and the hypothyroidism can augment the symptoms. Please contact your doctor and discuss these issues with him as he alone can change your doses.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm new. I hope this is where I ask a doctor a question.  I started having problems a couple of months ago with my calf, first on one leg, aching, then swelling, then the ankle, foot, then the other leg - went back and forth. Feet swelled tremendously for a week, with no pain at all, then stopped just as suddenly as it started. Also, sometimes extreme fatigue and most evenings chills and a temp of around 100. Went to the family doctor.  Tests run were the Doppler thing for blood clots, and blood tests, which were all normal except my Sed rate, which is 38.  The doctor recommended me to a rheumotologist and gave me an anti-inflammatory medication, Tramadol.  He said he couldn't do anything else.  My appointment with the rheumotologist is in 6 weeks.  I looked all over and couldn't find any who could see me quicker.  I asked my doctor if I need other tests run to rule out things - since I have six weeks of waiting.  He said, \"let's see what the Rheumotologist says first.\"  My symptoms change every day.  They started in my legs, except for the fatigue and temp, but last night I suddenly got pains in my right side and back ribs, making it very painful for me to breathe.  I took a Tramadol this morning (don't usually take them because they make me sick the next day) and it really didn't do any good.  I think I have Lupus symptoms, but are there other things that I could have symptoms for?  By the way, I'm a 54 year old female, no smoking, no drinking, a little overweight but I take pretty good care of myself, a pretty good diet and exercise 3 times a week until I started all this and now I don't feel like it most of the time. Should I be having other tests run during this six weeks?  I have a business and support myself and two college daughters and I'm not even feeling like getting out of bed most days.  I want to know what I should be doing during all this waiting time.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there! There isn't much you can do until you see a rheumatologist. The problem is not what you should be doing during the long wait. The problem is there shouldn't be such a long wait. It would be impossible to even suspect lupus syndrome based on your description. In fact its usually difficult to diagnose lupus without the help of lab tests. Tramadol is probably not the best analgesic for your condition. Your chest symptoms are suggestive of pleurisy an inflammation of the pleura. Let me assure you that its a possibility that your symptoms will not turn up to be anything serious at all. One thing you could do during your wait is to seek another opinion. It would be a good idea to see a good internist. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, could anyone please help me about a pain I have been getting on my Left side - it seems to be under my ribcage on my back and sometimes I feel it on my side and it comes slightly to the front, where my ribcage is on the front. When I lay down on my left side, it feels very uncomfortable and it feels like i have knot or something underneath that hurts when i put pressure on it (from lying on my side on the mattress). The pain is usually constant, and ive been having it for almost 4 years now. Sometimes I have it for days in a row, then it goes away, but even if the pain is not there as much, if i bend forward and touch my ribs on the back, I feel there is a hard lump - or it could be a bone, but it hurts if I put pressure on it. The pain can be described as that of a toothache - dull and grinding. But sometimes I get sharp pangs of pain, but usually there is just a dull constant ache, which gets worse when I lie down on my left side. But the pain can be night or day. I only feel it more at night because then I am lying down on my side.   If you have any idea what this could be, please let me know! All knowledge and help welcomed. Should I see a doctor and get a scan?   Kind Regards, Camara\n\n",

Get your prostate gland tested simultaneously with a trans-rectal ultrasound of the prostate gland (TRUP).

    "content": "For a short while (month of so) now I've had this comes-and-goes sensation (luckily it's not painful enough to call it \"pain\" yet) in my lower right side.  I'd get it below the kidney at the top of the hip, sometimes it would be around the front, sometimes around the back, and now it seems to have settled pretty much right along the \"fold\" where my leg meets my lower abdomen.  It feels like it's deep inside the leg/thigh.  I'm baffled.  I have no Prostate Cancer symptoms and had a Prostate Exam (all clear) last year.  It's vaguely like a full bladder pain (but not really) but much lower in the body and it's still there when I've already urinated (and have no urinary tract symptoms).  I've had an umbilical hernia so I'm aware of the phenomenon of having a pain located somewhere besides the actual problem area; but this is right in the place where the leg meets the abdomen and I thought there was nothing there but veins (and my fat blubber, lol).  Does this sound familiar to anyone?  I've never experienced this sort of sensation/pain before.  The fact that it's now chronic makes me worried (my father's side has a history of circulation problems; two of my uncles lost a leg to circulatory disease later in life), but I haven't a clue what the cause might be.\n\n",

I hadn't considered a muscle or hip joint pathology, no - I don't even know what those are   (But I'll look it up)  Just wanted to add to what I said:  (1) There's no bulge or pain when I press on the inguinal area, so I don't think it's an inguinal hernia or similar.  (2) I feel the sensation (when it's there, that is) most when I lift my right leg to put on my underwear/pants (maybe I just need to do a lot of leg lifts?).  (3) I looked at a diagram of the area and my best guess at echo-locating the most common location of the sensation would be probably in the genitofemoral nerve region.  I do see that that's right above the actual hip joint, so I guess that goes back to your hip joint pathology recommendation.  Thanks very much for your quick reply.\n\n",

I went to the Dr. in July with the following symptoms: extreme fatigue (I have to nap at least once a day), periodical weakness, sore joints on and off, dizziness, inability to focus or concentrate, ongoing sinus headache, irritated stomach and nausea( especially after eating). She did full bloodwork and told me I was text book healthy. Everything in normal range and no signs of arthritis. Told me it was stress and being that I'm busy, I decided to take that into consideration. Well, 7 months have passed and I still feel terrible. I really am not stressed anymore than the average person. The fatigue and inability to concentrate is killing me.It really makes it hard to function on a daily basis. I am always cold, and my hairdresser has found a fairly large bald spot on the back of my head (the good news is the hair is growing back.) I forget what it feels like to go through a day and just feel normal. I walk every day (pretty much force myself), don't smoke, drink and I'm not over weight. I live in a very small town with a shortage of Dr's. The one I currently have is leaving in May. I would really like some suggestions if anyone can help me. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - For last couple of days, I'm getting acute pain in my left arm. Some of the characteristics I noted are - Pain starts somewhere around muscle below elbow and radiates through out the arm - couldn't find any specific pain point in the arm - Only the Left Arm has the pain. No other area reflects the pain - Pain occurs at some intervals only - ( say every 3-4 hours). Pain persists for few minutes 15-20 mins and disappears - Pain starts by itself. Not triggered by any specific activity :-( - It all started one night during sleep ( thought I was sleeping too much to the left side). - No injuries, stressful activities performed before the pain started.  It's bearable at this point. I can go on with my activities with out any impact, but during nights pain is little more to wake me up.  What could be the cause. And what kind of doctor I should be visiting?\n\n",

    "content": "I am assuming that you have no neck or shoulder pain which would exclude a cervical  or shoulder condition radiating pain to the left upper limb.  I am also accepting your description that the pain is only felt at the elbow and below, ie the forearm.  You have not stated if the pain is on the medial (inner) or lateral (outer) aspect of the elbow. One of the most common causes of elbow pain is tennis elbow and the pain is located on the lateral side of the elbow. The patient usually has difficulty in holding a heavy object at arm's length and there may be a history of recent excessive activity involving the elbow. If the pain is on the medial aspect, the condition may be golfer's elbow. Please note that the two conditions are not necessarily related to tennis or golfing activities.  It is advisable to consult an orthopaedic surgeon for diagnosis.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  about 2 years ago I was in a accident on a 4-wheeler.  I stretched my tendents and ligaments in my ankle and foot. Went to the ER.  I was put in a boot and on crutches. No weight berring for 3 weeks.  Then I could try to walk with the boot, for the next 3 weeks. After that I was put in a smaller boot until I could get around good. I was in physical therapy for about 4-5 weeks.  I went to my foot dr and told him I was still having pain in my arch.  He had a MRI done and it showed a small bone spur (or the ex-ray did) but he was not concered about it.  He gave me arch supports and said I should be fine.  5 months later here I am with a pain on the bottom of my foot( around the arch/right before my heal starts on the bottom.  I can push on it and find the exact spot.  It hurts to walk on it and if I have to stand I can not put any weight on it.  and it just aches and throbs after the end of the day. Has some swelling.  Do you think I should go back to make sure there is not bone spur or could it be something else?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Dear April: I am not sure if you are saying you have just knee pain or pain throughout your leg. If you are having pain limited to the knee with morning stiffness then you may have arthritis in the knee.  However if the pain is not limited to the knee joint and goes down the leg or if you have any numbness or tingling in the leg then you may have pressure on a nerve root coming from the spine.  Either way a visit to the doctor should be able to point in which direction to go to find out what is causing it.  There are mulitiple disorders that can have the symptoms you describe but without a thorough evaluation from your physician it would be impossible to tell you which one is your problem.  If it is related to a pinched nerve in the spine then you would need that checked right away before any damage is done permenantly to the nerve.  Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "ITP, a usually benign condition of childhood, can be the presenting sign of a more global autoimmune disorder. This is more common in adolescent females who develop chronic ITP. The most common autoimmune disorder associated with ITP is systemic lupus erythematosus. The development of ITP can precede the diagnosis of lupus by months to years. The patient in the case report does not meet diagnostic criteria for lupus but has two other autoimmune disorders. Repeated clinical monitoring for development of signs and symptoms of autoimmune disorders, especially lupus, is indicated for adolescents who develop chronic ITP.  The thing is that a positive ANA test which is very sensitive for detection of systemic lupus is not a very specific test. This means that most people with SLE will have a positive ANA, but not many of those with a positive will necessarily have SLE.   I wouldn't worry about it unless other features of SLE start appearing or the ANA test is continuously on the rise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Daisy Lou: This is certainly a common problem, seen mostly in the winter months, as a health care provider I have experienced it myself. There are some steps however, that you can take to alleviate the problem. One of the prime concerns of dry cracked skin, is that it becomes a potential portal of entry for microorganisms, thus leading to infection. As a food handler this can potentialy then be passed back to those consuming the food you have handled. So, as well as being painful for yourself, you can see how it can have further implications. The facility you work in should be taking some steps to help alleviate the problem, if not you may want to bring this point up to them. Firstly, do you wear gloves, and if so could latex be contributing to the problem? Having said that, gloves should be provided for employees, latex free if required, (it's better anyway.) Do wear the gloves as often as you can, while you will still need to wash your hands and change gloves after each task, they will protect your hands from harsh soaps and chemicals during washing up. Secondly, try to stay away from waterless hand wash solutions when possible, they usually contain alcohol which will contribute to the problem. Wash your hands in warm, not hot water, with a gentle antibacterial soap. It does not need to be anything harsh or for industrial use. It's more important that you wash your hands thoroughly for 10 - 15 seconds.  Lastly, moisturize, moisturize! You must get water back into your skin, not just on the top layer of skin. Find a good emolliant base moisturizer, and use it after each hand wash, (bring a bottle to work and keep it just for yourself.) At bedtime there are two things you can try, either one is very effective at keeping dryness at bay. i)  Apply a good thick emolliant base moisturizer to clean, DAMP, hands, then put on a clean pair of cotton garden gloves for the night.                                                                           OR ii) Soak hands in clear tepid water for 10 - 15 minutes, apply a good thick emolliant base moisterizer to DAMP hands, leave on for night. It is a bit time consuming to follow through with these suggestions, but there really isn't any other way to alleviate the problem. Whatever you do please don't skimp on hand washing at all, it is very important. I hope this will help you. Let me know if this is effective for you.  Sincerley\n\n",

I get these twitches almost everywhere, ie. my arms, fingers, legs especially and my neck. My neck also becomes very stiff at times, and when I try to move I get these tremors where my head shakes violently for 5-10secs or so. Perhaps this could be something to do with pain I've been recieving at the base of my spine as of late? I also become very light-headed and dizzy, almost to a point where I nearly fall. Frequent too, is that I feel as if I'm going to faint. I cant live like this.  I've been to the doctor and he perscribed me 'Aulin' which he claims are muscle relaxants, which despite costing me 60 euros have absoloutly no effect. I think this may be something to do with the base of my spine. My back is also quite stiff, and at times I have difficulty moving my arms and legs (walking is a big problem). I am very weak also, and hot flushes and head rushes are a daily torture too.  The only thing I can do at the moment is drink alot of water and continue taking the Aulin. If you could give me your thoughts on this and some advice on how to conquer this terrible affliction as soon as possible, I would greatly appreciate it. Perhaps it would be usefull to mention that I get what I can only describe as 'eyelock' where my eyes lock onto a specific location within the room and sometimes they shake furiously. Thank you.

    "content": "Dear Orphanearth,  i think that you are suffering from some kind of neurological disease affecting your muscles.  You have to be evaluated by a specialist in neurological diseases.  Since i am not familiar with the brand name of aulin, i looked it up and it is not a muscle relaxant but it is an anti-inflammatory drug.  You have to search for the correct diagnosis, all of what you are complaining are just symptoms of a disease. You have to be seen by a neurologist so that a diagnosis is made and once a diagnosis is made, the correct treatment would be given. Treating your symptoms is not going to make the disease go away.  Please, make an appointment asap with a specialist and if the health care system is going to make it longer for you to see a specialist, i would suggest that you go to the emergency department and be admitted to the hospital.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am new here!  I was diagnosed with Lupus (SLE) in Nov 2004 and have been taking Plaquenil 200 mg bid for 2 1/2 months now.  At first I had a lot of GI upset, but that has basically resolved.  I am seeing some improvement with the SLE symptoms but something new has popped up and I don't want to overreact.  I have been having terrible headaches daily, blurred vision, new nausea, ringing ears, a sensation of cold water down the back of my left arm for about 1 month now.  Tonight my head hurts so bad and I was rubbing the back of my head & neck and noticed a hard, round spot the size of a gumball.  It doesn't hurt at all, and is located under my occiput slightly to the right of my spine.  I was wondering if this is related to my Lupus or the medication I take?  Or should I be concerned?  Being newly diagnosed, I am exhuasted with doctors appointments and would like to avoid going.  I have been thinking about going in to see him for the headaches, but keep hoping they will go away.   Thanks for your time,  HartL\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hartl,  What you have felt is most probably an occipital lymph node.  i don't think you need to see your doctor on an emergent basis but just bring it up in your next appointment.  The symptoms that you have been having, the headaches, nausea, ringing in the ears and blurred vision can be caused by the plaquenil.   The problem is that lupus affecting the brain can present in the same way.  These symptoms have to be reported to your doctor immediately.  This being said, however, if you are improving clinically like you said in terms of the lupus symptoms and these symptoms started only after you started the plaquenil, then most probably these symptoms are most probably related to the plaquenil but i still encourage you to report them to your doctor.

There isn't any Plaquenil toxicity though, thank goodness.  I have CNS involvement with the Lupus, that's why I originally went to the doc.  I had not been to a family physician in years and my husband made me go (to a neurologist) because he thought that I had MS - I have left foot neuropathy and rt hand essential tremors (benign).  I have never had an MRI or CT of the head because the SLE was caught right away.  Should I get one done?  If the SLE is involving the brain, will the Plaquenil alone help slow the progression?

    "title": "Re: Lupus patient having problems",
    "content": "Dear Hartl,  From your description of your symptoms before you start the plaquenil, sounds that the symptoms that you are having now are different, so most probably they are related to the plaquenil rather than to the lupus.  i don't see a reason why not having a baseline mri or ct scan if your doctor thinks it is indicated, otherwise no need for either.  i am not a rheumatologist, but i think that plaquenil is usually used for patients who have arthritis with lupus and for some patients with rheumatoid arthritis (which you mentioned you have).  i think that any major organ involvement with lupus like brain, kidney, lungs, etc... is usually treated with either steroids (prednisone) and/or other immunosuppressives.  If you don't have an appoinment scheduled to see a rheumatologist, i would advise you to have a rheumatologist on board because you are going to need one with both the lupus and the rheumatoid arthritis and it is better that you be seen at the begining of the disease so that he knows all your history from scratch.

    "content": "Hi,  Just an update as promised: Per a phone conversation with my rheumatologist office, I stayed off the Plaquenil for one week and started back at a half dose of 100 mg bid on Sunday.  They wanted to *test* to make sure it was actually a reaction and that I wasn't sick with sinuses or something.  The same symptoms returned (but worse) and I called my rheumatologist on Monday (3X).  I then called him on Tuesday, again with no repsonse. The office said that the MA handles all his phone calls and patient concerns and isn't sure why she didn't call me back.  They said to just come in so I can \"make\" them address my adverse reaction.  My appointment was for today at 2:15, but I had to cancel because I was called in to work.  I am glad that I am not going because I think that the doctor alone, not his MA, shold be calling me or seeing me, especially when I am having an adverse reaction to a med that can cause CV Collapse.   I have not taken the Plaquenil since Monday and my main concern is that I am going without treatment for a progressive disease.  Can my internal med doctor treat me for Lupus?  He treated me for that lymph node that has not gone away either.  He is a great doctor - very professional. I am just confused and frustrated!  I am not one to run to the doc's office with every sniffle and when I do call, it's important. Thanks so much!   HartL\n\n",

    "content": "For two weeks I've had pain in my left shoulder area and this dull ache in my left arm between my shoulder and my elbow.  Some mornings I wak up and can barely mve my head at all.  Usually the pain in my neck/shoulder lessens however I end up with this painful sort of of ache in my left arm that even 800mg of Iboprofen does not help.  I have had several massages and been to see the chiro for an adjustment - none of which has helped - at all.  Another possible relative sympom is that sometimes while I am slepping, my hands \"fall asleep\" - that is I wake up and they are tingly and lacking of circulation.  The bigger problem is this ache that just doesn't let up.  I've been taking valium just so I can sleep at night.  My days have become totally unbearable.   Any thoughts as to what it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your hand 'falling asleep' when you wake up could be a manifestation of carpal tunnel syndrome. It probably is carpal tunnel syndrome if you have had this problem for some time (i.e. unrelated to the present arm/shoulder pain). If however, they are related then other causes need to be taken into consideration. Pain in the neck and shoulder that lasts this long could be the result of muscle strain from sitting infront of the computer for example all day. If again this is not the case an examination may reveal the cause, if not an x-ray is warranted.  It is important to note that if you had a recent injury involving the neck then it is normal to have neck pain as a result of the muscle spasm as well as the injury to the tissues. If this is not the case another possiblity would be a herniated cervical disk. The possiblity of carpal tunnel syndrome alone warrants direct medical attention. Please read more on info on our carpal tunnel syndrome page.\n\n",

It goes away if I lie down or while exercising I don't feel it.  While sleeping I don't feel a thing and when I get up usually 2 hours later it will come back or drift in and out.

    "content": "Dear Lorna,  This sounds like either  1. An irritation of the nerves supplying this area and since this does not sound like the distrubtion of one particular nerve, it could be either an irritation of the nerves supplying the nerves at the fingers or high up in the neck.  or   2. Local irritation of the skin of these fingers if they were injured simultaneously in any way like being soked in hot water, or slightly burnt by holding something hot.  If you have neck pain, then this is most probably a neck problem and you might want to discuss this with your doctor to may be have a neck x-ray.  If the pain has been there for a while and is getting worse, then you should be seen by your doctor to rule out the possibility of an ongoing infection in the pulp spaces of the fingers.

If I turn it to the left it doesn\u2019t hurt.  (Speaking of the right foot).  The left foot was like this, stayed a while (about 7 days) then went away.   I can\u2019t stand up on it either.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 32 year old female that feels like a 90 year old. I recently found out that I have several bulging disc in my neck and lower back. I also have had a MRI on my brain that showed some sort of spot, not sure what it is yet. I had bloodwork done that showed a positive result for rheumatoid arthritis and hvae been told that I suffer from migraines. Now knowing all the results of all the test has explained some of the pain I have, but not all of it. I have bilateral hip and shoulder pain. These areas feel as if the skin is scalded,very sore to the touch and at the same time there is a numbness. It feels like palces have been deadened for surgery and all you feel is the pressure of touch.Some of the headaches I have feel like lightening bolts striking in my head. I have a burning sensation in my lower back radiating into the buttocks down the outer thigh to about the knees. I also develop very sore places on my head that I cannot stand to touch, not even to wash my hair.My memory and thought process is really messed up. I forget things from 10 minutes ago and loose train of thought in mid sentence. I have been to a nuerosurgeon who said there was nothing he could do and my last appointment with my neurologists was very disappointing. I was told that I suffer from an aoto immune disease and that all I can do is treat the symptoms and learn to live with it. There is surely more that can be done I do not want to just learn to live with it. My life has taken a dramatic 360 in the past year and I would like to be able to get at least part of it back. If anyone has any information or advice, I gladly welcome it. Please help if you can. Thanks, Babyluv2004\n\n",

    "title": "Lupus",
    "content": "My younger brother has been tested for Lupus recently. I think the doctors were trying to rule it out, but I haven't heard the results of the tests yet. The thing is, he has what I've researched and found to be called a \"butterfly\" rash, which is why they decided to test for Lupus.  The reason I'm concerned is I've looked it up, and found that it can be hereditary. I'm curious if it could have something to do with MY physical health.. if i had it.  I've had chronic health problems since I was about 3 years old, mainly chronic sinusitis. I cannot remember the last time I felt just plain old \"ok\". I live daily with sinus pain or pain of somekind. I've been allergy tested and the results were conclusive that I wasn't allergic to anything. i am allergic to both sulfa and nickel though. I've been to tons of doctors all inconclusive, all just prescribed allergy medications. This is year round however. I guess to help out I will explain the symptoms (of what I don't know) that I constantly have: exhaustion (no matter how much/little sleep I get) dizziness (could be due to the anti-depressant I take, I don't know) numbness or tingling in my fingers and feet occasionally poor blood circulation in my feet and legs constant sinus pain but not always with congestion frequently feel hot, sweat a lot from my face but nowhere else daily stomach pain/nausea sometimes, was once diagnosed with \"an ulcer forming from stress\" ? bruise extremely easily scabs/sores on my scalp (scratch unconsciously and they bleed and cycle repeats itself), but not dandruff (the sores have been on and off as long as i can remember...) dry eyes and worsening vision (and eye doctor once told me my tear ducts didn't produce enough tears and considered silicone tear duct plugs) I know it sounds like everything is wrong with me and it can't possibly be, but that's how it is. No one has been able to give me anything that helps. I never feel healthy. I eat sensibly and excercise as much as I can, try to get enough sleep. I am just at a loss. And now I'm wondering if, since Lupus effects the immune system, maybe I could have it and just not know it. I hope I'm overreacting but I really need some answers. I've seen so many doctors and I just can't imagine I'll have to live the rest of my life not knowing why I always feel sick, when I'm not actually sick. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Sorry this was so long.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I see that you are concerned if all the problems you seem to have is some way related to immune system of the body. You could be right in that people whose family members have lupus have more chances of having autoimmune diseases including and other than lupus (systemic lupus erythematosus). The genetic predisposition alone does not cause the development of autoimmune diseases. It seems that other factors need to be present as well in order to initiate the disease process. It is important for families with members who have an autoimmune disease to mention this fact when another member of the family is experiencing medical problems that appear to be difficult to diagnose.  American Autoimmune Related Diseases Association  Sjogren syndrome is one related autoimmune disease that I felt you might find interesting to look up.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am 14 years old and I have just taken up serious rowing (both rowing and sculling). However, I am also a very keen piano and organ player. What I would like to know is whether or not rowing (about 2hrs/day 6days/wk) would have any negative effects on my instrumental playing. My piano teacher says that the actions of rowing would (amongst other problems) inhibit the fine motor movements in my wrists. Is this true?  Thanks very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Webbo,  I reckon your piano teacher may have a better idea than me...but here is logic would suggest...  Rowing produces enormous stresses on your joints.  Done at the right pace and intensity (and what is right varies from individual to individual) this will be good exercise and strengthen your wrists, and in fact your whole body.  While it is possible that the muscular hypertrophy may compromise fine motor skills done on its own, provided you keep playing the piano regularly enough, this should not be problem.  One problem is that strenuous physical activity is more likely to lead to injuries...and it is this that is mre likely to affect your dexterity on the keyboard...  Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

Since I had surgery last April and had a benign cyst removed from my left ovary I have noticed that sometime early in the morning I start having extreme pain in both of my leges.

It only happens after I have been laying down and usually  in the very early morning before I get up.  What do you think this is and what can I do for it?

However, there is no proof of a psychological cause, either, and until we have a better understanding of the disorder, it is likely to remain controversial.  There has been an attempt to create diagnostic criteria for this disease. Please refer to our fibromyalgia page for more info on these criteria and how to exclude this disease.\n\n",

    "content": "In March of 2003 i dislocated my knee.  I've been through all the physical therapy and I've worn all the braces and such.  Now I'm done with all of that -- no more braces and no more PT.  My (left) knee will still hurt sometimes -- it is worst when I try to drive stick.  Anyway, my concern is with biking.  I would like to go on lesiurely, 20-30 mile bike rides from time to time.   I've only dared go on two or three rides since i dislocated the knee. When I bike, I can feel my kneecap popping in and out of the socket, which is either uncomfortable or a little painful.  Most of the pain, however, does not occur during the bikeride -- it happens afterwards.  In fact, the knee continues to be sensitive for one or two days after the ride.  So my questions is: am i helping or hurting?  One side of the argument might be that I'm helping strengthen the knee, while on the other hand I might just be prolonging the injury.  Can my knee handle bike rides?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear PT Hunkie,  There are some reasons why someone would dislocate a patella and some consequences of the dislocation itself that one needs to understand.  The legs in a normal adult are as you will see in your own, angled outwards slightly at the knee.  The knee cap, sits in a groove at the end of the femur (the femoral groove) and slides up and down within this groove.  Because of the angle of the knee, the knee cap has a tendency to move toward the outside.  This migration is prevented partly by the depth of the femoral groove, the fact that the outer edge of the groove is higher, and the fact that you have balancing muscles on the inner side of the knee called the Vastus Medialis Obliquus (VMO).  The reasons to dislocate are thus an increased outward angle of the knee (women have a naturally increased angle and are thus more vulnerable), a shallow femoral groove, or weakened VMOs.  the consequences of the the dislocation are injury to the patello femoral joint, and to the VMO itself.  By the splinatge and bracing you had so far, you will allow the damage to the muscle to recover, although it will be very weak initially.  The damage to the patellofemoral joint recovers very poorly.  The latter will thus continue to give you pain for some time, particularly when you kneel, go up stairs, or get up from a sitting position.  The weakness of your Medialis must be overcome first, to reduce the impact of this.    Cycling is normally good exercise.  Cycling, as you seem to be doing, and the apparent subluxation that is occuring will harm your knee, by increasing the damage to your PFJ.  You must improve the function of your medialis sufficiently first.  Try this exercise religiously. Lying down on your back,  extend knee, turn your foot outards, and raise it up and down.  Do this for 10 minutes twice a day, increasing  gradually.  Note that this exercise does not bend your knee or increase the load through your knee.  It may be an idea, when you get back to cycling to raise the seat of your bike to reduce the flexion your knee goes through.  If this still leads to no improvement...it will be worth seeing a specialist again.  regards  Saif\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there Shyboy,  I read your mail, and I note that this was written in July.  How are things? still the same, better or worse?  there are a few solutions and I guess you have alluded to some of the possibilities yourself.  You do not say whether there was an injury that started this off  A lateral meniscal problem can give you such problems indeed, and typically this causes twinges of sharp pain, particularl when changing direction while walking, squatting and going down stairs.  Many people have degenerate wear and tear of the meniscus, and this can cause an aching of the knee.  However you are rather young and degenerate fraying is generally more common on the medial side.  A lateral collateral injury usulally follows an injury.  More likely at your age is perhaps a little bit of tendinitis associated with a structure called the iliotibial band.  This inserts just below the knee joint on the outer side of the knee, and can acuse an aching after a period of walking, and may respond to local interrferential treatment, such as massage and heat and ice.  On occassion a local steroid injection may be tried.  I hope however, that things have settled down by now, but please feel free to ask again if the problem continues or if you have any other questions  Saif\n\n",

It is still a little stiff.  About four or five days ago, I noticed a pain, almost like a bruise feeling, in the back of my ankle a little to the left of my achilles tendon (on my right ankle) I have been keeping an eye on it and it hasn't changed all that much but I was wondering if you could tell me anything.  It is a hard knot kind of.  Is it anything to be concerned about?\n\n",

    "title": "dealing with pain in my lungs since 1999",
    "content": "I have had alot of problems with my lungs over the years with allergies and lung infections. In 1999 I excerianced my first numothorax and first chest tube. To weeks later I was back in the hospital with Left lung. was then sent to Billings MT to see a specialist to see what was going on with my lungs he ordered a CT and the next day i headed back up there, well during the 90 mile drive the right lung went down again. Got my CT and then rushed into surgery they took a bit of the lung off at the top were it was covered by bleps. Then roughed up the sack and lung so they would heal together, this was also done to my left when it collapsed again. well since then I have seen doctor after doctor around these parts and a good pain doctor he looked me over and checked for chest pain coming from my ribs and didnt find no presure points that were not painful. we talked it over and he said it was not unheard of to have pain or the organs but no treatment at this time. my pain lever raises the more i do in a day say as in working. talking to much or laughing can get to me as well. I have been cut off from pain killers and this last year i have had to deal with alot of pain and playing the nasty game of over counter pills and how many do ya take before it unsafe. what im wondering is if i have missed a point of how to deal with this pain problem it rules my life some days and the last two years i get tired easy but lung saterationg is good around 98 to 94. I applied for SSI and all they told me was i was fine hmmm wish i was would love to have my life back the way it was    but i keep going hopeing one day the pain will just go away. they told me its a rare diesce (spelling) that is not much known about it but it eats the lung tissue and there is no stopping it and the pain might be because my lungs and organs are in a tight rib cage. doc said it was one of the smallest he has worked on. but anyways there is a story bit long and drawn out but not sure how to make it short and sweet  thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  What exactly is the name of the rare disease that your lungs suffer from? In any case, pain will not be part of any disease in this modern age. The arsenals to tackle pain are plenty and various. You might want to fix an appointment with a pain clinic to titrate the right amount of the right medicine for pain. In the presence of pain, some of the pain medications do not have a ceiling effect as to the limit to which the dosage of the medication can be increased. So, one needn't worry regarding the bad effects of drugs, as long as the person is still in the painful state.   Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "HI Bill  well the funny thing was they told me there was no name for it because it was so rare there was no research going into it, I know the pain is not from that but from the surgeries that were done and four chest tubes. all they could tell me was that it looked as tho it was something that i was born with........... i don't know im so sick of going to doc to doc and hearing the same thing about that. I am just sick of dealing with pain to the point of a very painful ordeal. my family doctor is the one that I have gotten into with pain pills and the such, I will never go back to him for this reason it was not like i was abusing them 30 pills would last sometimes up to 3 months i would only take them when i could not deal with the pain no more, lately I have not been as active but winter coming on is always my roughest time for the cold just makes things worse off. and this year I have had to do alot getting ready for winter so the pain level has increase the last few weeks but with no money im stuck dealing with it the best i can and taking over the dose of over the counter pills alot of the time. I just am at a point of frustration and with winter my depression will be coming back good and strong so thought i might see what this site might bring to my world of pain i thank you for your time but doctors at this point are not a opption till money comes back into my life\n\n",

All my therapy treatments have resulted in more pain and less flexibility.  No one can tell me what is going on.  I can't even walk for any length of time without being laid up afterwards.  The calves are the worst and everyday.  The hamstrings pop or pull if I due any exercise or running or jogging.  Quinine and potassium do not help.  Can you give me some direction on this?\n\n",

I am only 43.As long as I am sitting I am OK, but when Istand or am standing, the urge will suddenly hit and I may or may not be able to stop it. During the past few months it has gotten worse.Much STRONGER urges with accidents. My doc put me on Detrol la which has helped a lot. My problem is he is a GP and most of his experience dealing with FM has been with me over the years. I feel the FM is causing the strong bladder spasms . He isnt sure. Am I right is thinking the fm whcih causes muscle spasms elsewhere is also effecting the bladder?  Also, I feel I may have some insulin resistence. My father is diabetic. My fasting blood sugar has been in the normal range, But I occasionally have episodes of low blood sugar before lunch if I havent eaten small amounts before hand. I also have what appears to be acanthos nigricans (sp?), due to darkening and thickening of skin at back of neck and under arms.Also some beginning discoloration below cheekbones, and at corner of my eyes, and ruddy colored skin at edges of lips that is more prominent when exposed to sun.According to Doctor Devin Starlanyl's site, IR can accompany FM.IS this so? What causes it? and most importantly should treating this be a concern?If so, how?\n\n",

    "content": "I have had severe arthritic spurs of the spine, both cervical and thoracic since I was about 28 years old.  I am now 57.  I am very careful with movements such as reaching up high, etc.   Some days are worse than other days. I cannot play golf, etc. because unusual movements have resulted in home cervical traction on occasion. I have been lifting weights to try and stay toned and strong, (not extremely heavy), and am now in the process of moving and I am lifting and moving boxes, etc.  I've noticed that I get a little spastic nerve type pain under my left breast, kind of in the middle near the sternum and over to the left AFTER a day when I have lifted boxes. These spasms happen at rest.  The area is not sore to the touch at all.   It seems that the day I am moving boxes my middle back hurts. Then the next day,  my back feels somewhat better except that the left side under my shoulder blade hurts upon movement and I get these little spasms of what feels like surface pain under left breast area. The twinges last no more than 20 seconds or so and might occur about 10 times during that day. I have no other symptoms.  I have tried to keep note of when these spasms happen and it seems it is after I have lifted something heavy.  Can this be related to the spurs? I had echo cardiogram, ekg and physical last month and all was okay.   Thanks for any response!\n\n",

He then suggested for ultrasonic massage and advised wearing soft padded footwear. This was some two years back. My weight is around 70 Kgs, which I do not consider too much for my legs to bear.  I took the treatment for a month and my pain subsided.  I have also started wearing soft padded footwear.  Now, the pain has restarted. It pains while walking/standing for a long time. Pressing ankles also causes a lot of pain.  Kindly advise what has happened and what treatment should I take.\n\n",

It's not like I'm sleepy ,just tired, like jet-lag. Other symptoms are headache, front of head, insomnia, and trouble concentrating.  Career is very stressful right now but wasn't back in Nov/Feb.  I'm very active (triathlons/running) but I've cut way back on training volume for last 2 weeks without much effect.  Last thing, I turned 40 in Jan and had a physical, doctor said blood work was great - iron levels and he checked thyroid since my mother & sister have a condition.  He said fatigue was probably response to stress.  This all has me spooked especially when I get so tired I can't think at work.  Any ideas?  Thank you.\n\n",

I have had a number of ECG's and a stress test, blood tests, they all show up ok.  I have had my nerve reactions tested on the left side, a cat scan on the skull and even x-rays.  Other than scoliosis (minor) of the spine and some muscle spasms they tests all have turned out ok.  I am concerned it is heart related.  I do suffer from PAD/GAD and have since 1990.  I am at wits end, the pain leads me to think heart, the stress of that makes the aches worse, and so on.  I have told my doctor about the fear of the heart but he says that the tests are ok so far.  any ideas or suggestions?  I just want to feel normal again.\n\n",

The cause of pain during of after exercise is usually under training. The pain is caused by the metabolites that accumulate in the muscles and the cause of this accumulation is that the muscles do not clear them fast enough when they are under trained.  i would recommend that you see a personal trainer to see what he/she will recommend.

    "title": "Fibromyalgia or more? Advice desperately needed!",
    "content": "Last april i fell and landed on my upper back. X-ray, MRI, and EMG showed no damage. I went through physical therapy which made back pain worse and I also started hurting all over. I was diagnosed with Fibromyalgia.    I started having problems with my memory and balance and cognitive ability. As these symptoms worsoned my Dr. ordered an MRI of my brain. This showed a few plaques. The frontal lobes could not be seen due to artifact from my orthodontic braces. She sent me to a neuro who did another MRI which gave the same results. Report says possible Lyme disease or MS. I tested negative for Lyme disease. Neuro decided to wait and retest in 6 months. Well that MRI was normal. Neuro said nothing was wrong with me besides being majorly depressed. We went to the CLeveland clinic for a second opinion. Neuro said MRI's were overread and nothing was wrong with me other than possibly the Fibro.   Since that visit my symptoms continue to worsen. I have been to the ER twice in the past month.The first time someone bumped my foot which sent an electrical type feeling up my leg. My leg then went numb. ER said it was anxiety. The second time was due to the other leg feeling numb, hot, cold, and sensitive all at the same time. The other day at church someone tapped me on my left shoulder. A few minutes later my entire upper back went into a spasm and my left arm kept jerking. This lasted about an hour.   I have numbness and tingling that come and go all day long. I have days where I get this sharp burning pain that only last a few seconds but several occur in a row over different parts of my body. (for example the 1st will be in my arm, then my back, then my neck, etc). My short term memory is GONE. I have days that I can't cook a meal by myself because I can't remember how to do it. The one constant through all of this has been the back pain. I have had it every day since the fall. 99%of the pain is in my upper back right between the shoulder blades.   Everywhere I turn I am told it is Fibromyalgia and I am depressed. I am beginning to feel like I am crazy. Should I just accept this diagnosis or continue to seek help?  Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tiasha,  Chronic pain syndromes are difficult to deal with. They are usually associated with depression because of the chronic pain, the need to take medications and the inability to perform one's duties and responsibilites and being inactive because of the pain. And you are not crazy, the pain is real and this is not your fault that you are having pain.  i don't think i have much to offer except suggesting to have another imaging of your back to make sure that you have not had any new back injuries.  One more thing, most of the patients with fibromyalgia usually follow up with rheumatologists for adjusting medications.  There is one medication that i have seen rheumatologists use over and over which is amitriptyline at night. Also, patients usually go to water therapy as it was found to alleviate the pain better than the traditional phyiscal therapy.  i think you might also consider talking to your doctor about an antidepressant other than wellbutrin if it is not doing the job.

Thats when the pain spread throughout my entire body.   My pain managment Dr. specializes only with Fibromyalgia and Myofascial Pain Syndrome. He tried to add Elavil but it just made me so tired I couldn't function. At that time though fatigue was one of my worst symptoms. I think I am going to ask him if we can try it again.    I read something yesterday about Reflex Sympathetic Dystrophy Syndrome and wonder somewhat if this could be a possibility. I seem to have a lot of the symptoms associated with this.

    "content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with SLE in 1998 after my first son was born, then I had trouble conceiving but had another son 4 years later. Since then I have found it to be getting worse. Alot of pain and I seem to have alot of blood problems a high positive to lupus anticoagulant and a high positive for antiphosphoid antibodies, my rheumatologist has recommended that I don't have any more children, what are the risks? How will I know if I get a blood clot? This has scared the hell out of me and I should have liked another child unless something happens I don't get to see my doctor for awhile and he is 600km away and I don't like to ring up with my incessant questions it seems that no sooner do I ask them I have a hundred more - there is just so much to this disease. I am also on antidepressants for reactive depression to this disease but my thyroid levels are always on the border of the lower limit can this have anything to do with the depression? I've heard that it can. I appreciate any answers that anyone can give me!! Thank You so much\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Maree,  Lupus has lots of negative health effects on the body. Antiphospholipid antibodies or lupus anticoagulants have the negative side effects of causing blood clots.  From your profile, it does not look that you have active or severe lupus as you are currently not on any medication for active lupus treatment.  Aspirin is the way to go for anti-phospholipid antibody syndrome without previous history of blood clots.  Your rheumatologist's recommendation of not having any more children is understandable. Pregnancy makes women more prone to blood clots. You are already prone because of your condition and this means higher risk for blood clots than in normal pregnancies. There are other effects of pregnancy on the body that might be caused by lupus and this might give rise to confusion on whether this was caused by lupus or pregnancy.  Pregnancy might cause lupus flares, in the great majority of patients, flares are mild, but in a small minority they are severe.   There is a higher chance of abortion and still births.  There is a higher chance that babies born to mothers with lupus have neonatal lupus.  You will be getting subcutaneous shots of blood thinners all through your pregnancy.  You will have to be watched very closely and diligently during your pregnancy.  i don't think that there is a contraindication to you getting pregnant but you have to understand the associated risks, potential side effects and the things that you will have to endure and that the outcome might not be as favorable.  As for the symptoms of blood clots, it depends on the site of the blood clot. Blood clot can occur either in arteries or veins. If in arteries, usually the area supplied by the artery is deprived of blood supply and subsequently dies (an example is a stroke or a heart attack). If a vein is occluded, there will be enlargement of the organ that this vein drains due to blood engorgement and the consequences depend on the organ involved. The most common veins affected are the veins of the lower extremities and the symptoms produced are pain in the calf or thigh, edema or enlargement of the leg. If the blood clot travels to the lungs it gives rise to shortness of breath and chest pain and a variety of other symptoms depending on the size of the blood clot.  Depression can be caused by lots of medical conditions, i am not sure what you mean by your thyroid functions is on the lower limit of normal. There are two thyroid function tests one is called tsh and the other free-t4. Which one are you talking about? Because if have an underactive thyroid, the tsh is actually high and the free-t4 is low and vice versa if you have an hyperactive thyroid gland. The standard that we usually go by is the tsh, if it is higher than a certain level and the patient is symptomatic, patient is given thyroid hormones as replacement and the tsh is followed till goes to normal.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for any comments or concers.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ama_nan,  Neck pain has many causes.   The most common is most probably muscle strains from wrong positions taken by patient during their work or during their sleep.  A very common cause also, is arthritis of the neck but i think that you are still for that. Other causes might be secondary to inflammation or infection. Referred pain is also another cause.  For the time being, i would recommend following the pain and if it gets worse, i recommend that you contact your doctor to be have a physical exam.

    "content": "My son is 13 years old.  For the last two years he has complained of a pain originating in the outside heel below the ankle of his foot.  He complains that the pain radiates up the leg like a lightening bolt and then leaves him unable to walk without a limp.  He refers to it as \"dead foot\".  I have seen him walk down 3 steps and fall the rest of the way.  I have seen him walking along and drop to his knees.  He limps most of the time and this problem can affect either leg but is primarily in the right leg. It is random and inconsistent. He never knows when it will occur. Two months ago I noticed the same type of pain in my left inside heel. I too struggle daily with bearing weight on my foot due to lightening bolts of pain. We both tend to bruise easily and while I am grossly overweight, he is not. A recent urinalysis for my son revealed microscopic traces of blood in the urine. A nerve conductivity test showed a loss of conductivity in both lowe legs and a spinal MRI is scheduled for in July.  I have also seen him walk along and jsut drop an item he was holding in his hand without realizing he had dropped the item.  Do you have any suggestions as to what I as his mother should be doing?  Which doctor or test should I request?  I am very frightened.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Limping, at your son's age, makes me think of the entitiy called 'slipped capital femoral epiphysis,' which is the term for a commoner hip disorder in adolescents. It is usual for children with this hip disorder to complain of pain in the knee and to limp. An X-ray of the hip should help identify this. Has it been done?  The easy bruisability you share with your son, would want me to rule out hemophilias, the clotting disorder, which again can cause bleeding into the joints to cause symptoms. But I assume your doctor would have run a check on the bleeding tests.  The shooting pains are more in tune with neuropathic pain, and the origin at the spinal level should indeed be checked out, an MRI of which is already underway.  It is frequent for children to bruise their kidneys from falls and other traumas, which might result in microscopic hematuria (blood in the urine). But it would be prudent to rule out kidney disorders by an ultrasound, to find out if the kidneys are vulnerable to mildest shakes from trauma, which usually is the case in congenital malformations of the kidney. Then again people with severe hemophilias can present with blood in the urine.  The good part is that we have already begun the process of checking things out, and you can proceed according to your doctor's discretion and the test results.  Hope this helps,  bill\n\n",

    "title": "neck- / backinjury related muscular condition?",
    "content": "I have the following muscular condition (have had it for about +5 years now) :   my muscles can't stand maximum effort long without getting into a sort of a 'cramp', serious constant pain that doesn't go away by holding something cold on the hurting muscle or by laying down. The pain first occurs right after the exercise (I could probably push the pain quite long by continuing the exercise and make it even worse) and gets more severe the following few minutes and it takes up to almost 10 minutes to fully recover which of the first 5-7 are total pain. I have a long background in sports and it ain't lactic acid making me feel this, trust me..   I can get the condition to appear by i.e. running 400 meters once as fast as I can (or twice at 95% with a one and a half minute break in between) or by doing 40 pushups as fast as I can (not by doing as many pushups as I can SLOWLY).   My question is two phased - a) do you think it is possible (likely?) that this muscular condition I'm experiencing, could be because of a neck- or back-injury? To my understanding neural signals can cause cramps? ..and my lower back and neck have experienced quite a few slumps (snowboarding accidents mainly) and the timeframe might actually back this theory up considering the origin of both the back- slash neckproblems and the muscular condition are about the same. The neck- and backinjuries are not severe but exist all the same. They (neck and back) both are superrefracting if that means anything..   b) could you make any (possible) diagnose and is there any hope for me to get rid of this condition? It's a real pain in the ass for an athlete..   Thanks allready in beforehand..\n\n",

    "content": "The doctor (special sports doctor at a sports-doctor facility) ouldn't really say anything, only that I should make a 'maximumtest' where one runs (or cycles) hooked up to machinery that records everything to get some clues on what is happening at maximum stress. This was a year ago and since a) haven't had the money (approx 150 euros) & b) condition only appears at MAXIMUM stress and I really don't suffer from this ALL THAT much (it really doesn't hurt if I do stuff at 93%) - I still haven't taken the test..  Musculoskeletal pain?? Has something to do with my bones? You sure on this one? I'm really not feeling any pain in my bones.. I would really be more confident with a theory where some pressure on the spine causes some nerve-signals that then again cause a severe pain condition in my muscles. Actually, when I suggested this theory to the doctor at my visit a year ago, he outruled it basically only because he couldn't really think how my lower-back-injury could make ALL my muscles act similarly (not just legs). The thing is that for some reason I didn't mention my neck-injury to him then (suppose I hadn't thinked all through myself by that time), so I would really like to know what he would say about the same theory him knowing I actually have a neck-injury too..  Really, thanks for the reply, Bill. I'll try to read on this musculoskeleta pain you brought up but if this text brings up any further suggestions (or guesses, by all means!), please reply once more, I would really like to get my condition diagnosed some day..\n\n",

It's gotten no worse... but definately no better... so i'm hoping before I decide to go to the doctor maybe you can help.  On the backside of my left thigh, halfway down.. it tends to be sore... a little numb, and tingling... maybe a little itchy sometimes too.. It's like this almost all the time now, I believe it started when I started doing driving for my company. I since then have been promoted to purchasing agent.... So I still sit all day at work.... then I go home and sit at my computer.... in pretty much the same type of chair. I started worrying about maybe a blood clot or something.... it's always the same feeling in the same spot.   I also have some pain on the front of my left leg. Appears to be vericose veins, though havent had it looked at either. The vericose veins started before the thigh pain. The front of my left leg would itch pretty bad, and got a little stiff.... I should have a doctor examine these issues.... but like most men I hoped these issues would just go away.\n\n",

The torn tendon causes inflammation in the synovial (joint) membrane leading to increased production of the lubricant fluid in the joint space leading to Baker's cyst.  The removal of the torn ligament and the cyst should prove to be a lasting cure. Recurrences after surgery are usually very rare.  To find out more details check out our Baker's cyst page.\n\n",

After a consult with an orthopedic surgeon, x-rays and a ct-scan, it was found that I had, had bone spurs that were broken off from the force of the accident.  The debris was lodging in the ankle joint, causing it to lock up, and giving me intense sharp pains. I had arthoscopic surgery to remove the debris on Jan 9, 2004.  Despite doing all I was instructed to do post surgery, I am still having major pain when I stand or walk for any amount of time at all.  The ortho surgeon did another x-ray, and could only find that the cartilage had reduced.  I am wondering if there is ANY explaination for this pain? it's making it difficult if not impossible to work.  (Note: the ankle was totally NONE symptomatic prior to the surgery)  JustLee\n\n",

It felt as if something was getting lodged in the ankle joint.  Which it in fact was.  Apparently the force of the accident caused bone spurs (which I was totally unaware I had) to break off, and they were getting stuck in the ankle joint.  That is why the surgeon did the procedure; to remove the debris.  Does that help to clarify? Please let me know.  JustLee\n\n",

    "content": "Unless I'm walking the pain is normally minimal, scale rated at 1-2.  When I walk for any amount of time longer than 5 minutes, the pain comes and goes from a sharp intense pain of 10+, to just a constant ache of around 7.  The most common is the constant ache of 7 (again, this is when walking).  I do not work as a result of this injury, coupled with the work restrictions I was already on due to having a bad knee on the other leg.  The pain no longer bothers my sleep as it did for the first month after the surgery.   I normally do not take any medication for the pain, however when I do it is Ibuprofen.  At most it prevents the pain from getting worse, though it does not lessen it. I do have Loritab, however it makes me feel completely out of it and unable to function (as do most pain killers) so I do not take that. The pain's discription is a bit odd (to me any way) It feels as if a bone is broken (none are), and there are times now, when I have a burning sensation going up my shin (like shin splints).  This burning sensation has been happening more often in the last month, and is more persistant. Meaning, it doesn't stop once I sit down as the 10+ pain does.   I do hope this has helped rather than to confuse you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  In your position, even I wouldn't take pain medications more than my body would be comfortable taking. If I knew when my pain can be triggered, I'd probably take my favorite pain med half an hour before the triggering activity. Rather than decreasing the expected pain, I'd want not to expect it at all.  From your latter description of pain, I would imagine you to be suffering from neuropathic pain lately, for which the normal analgesics may not be sufficient. Do discuss with your doctor regarding medicines for such pain, next time.  bill\n\n",

    "title": "Is the chiropractor making me worse or better?",
    "content": "I was having hip pain that prohibited sleeping on my side.  Also, headaches and the feeling that my back was out of alignment.  (Also, coincidentally, a sinus infection)  I went to see a chiropractor who put me on a treatment plan of 3X/wk adjustments.  Apparently, I had subluxations in the top 2 vertebrae (which effect the sinuses), a couple in the middle back and a couple in the lower back.  I've been going 4 weeks now and after the first 2, I developed very big knots in my shoulders and back.  I started getting extremely bad headaches that started at the base of my skull and sometimes were accompanied by nausea and vomiting.   I was attributing them to the sinus infection that I've been on antibiotics for the last 2 weeks (also seeing an ENT).  But my sinuses seem to be getting better, and I still get the headaches every few days.  Nothing seems to help them.  (I've tried Ibuprophen, Ice packs, muscle relaxers, migraine medicine, tylenol sinus, and even vicoden)  I'm now having a lot of back pain, but it all seems muscular.  Except that many times I can't sleep on one side or the other because it hurts my neck and that seems structural.  Some days are better than others.  Sometimes the adjustments seem to make me feel better and sometimes worse.  The chiropractor says that he's adjusting me and that my working around the house is pulling me right back out again and that my muscles are just spasming because of that.   Should I be patient and rest or see an MD?  I've always had faith in chiropractors, but I'm too young to feel  this rotten!  Thanks so much for whatever thoughts you may have.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 18 years old. Off and on for about 2 years I rarely have instant pains or soreness that will last for about 30 minutes. I usually get these pains in the palms of my hands, mostly around the thumb and index finger area, and my knees. Lately, the pain is coming back more often and hurts more. When I close up something, zip up something, when I am holding something or just out of nowhere my hand(s) will hurt. When I sit for a long period of time my knee(s) get very sore, especially when I am sleeping. I do crack my fingers and pop my wrists (this was a habit growing up) and everytime I bend down my knees will crack. I also used to (and I am trying to get out of the habit of..) lock my knees when I stand.   It gets to the point that if I don't crack anything, it gets very sore and keeps me from sleeping. My mother had the same problem when she was my age, and she recently got her hip replaced (cartlidge was gone-bone against bone). I think I inhareted this, but is this early signs of arthritis? Should I see a doctor about this, or can I do/take any home remedies/home medicine for this?   Please help me understand,     Tanya\n\n",

It hurts when I walk for a long time or sit in a car for a long time -that is when I notice it the most.    My mothers diagnosis was \"severe degineris arthritis\" I am not a good speller.  My hand doesn't hurt like my knee does, sometimes the pain in my knee shoots up to my thigh.  The hand pain sometimes just comes out of nowhere and stiffins up real bad for a few seconds, but when this pain in my knee/thigh comes, it lasts for a long time.  I do not regularly exercise as much as I should and I do a lot of walking at work (restaurant).\n\n",

    "content": "I am in the midst of a bad flare up of fibromyalgia which I've had for two decades.  I've been able to go for long periods without significant pain, but this recent flare up is very bad and the pain has not abated despite regular exercise, yoga, careful diet, a tricyclic antidepressant that has been effective in providing regular deep sleep, and Etodalac.  In the last two weeks, my physical mobility has been affected though sporadically and for brief periods.   My job as a professor requires that I walk across campus, but that has been very difficult lately.  I'm resisting using the Vicodin I was prescribed when I'm working.  Severity of pain and exhaustion make it hard to get across campus without taking breaks to rest along the way.  Once at my destination, I'm fatigued.  The stiffness and pain in my lower body make me unsteady on my feet especially first thing in the morning and late in the day - I've come close to falling a few times this week, but I'm not unsteady all the time.  I'm adjusting by adding extra time to make it to class, but wonder if an assistive device such as a cane might be useful and allow me to continue to teach without using narcotic painkillers.  I do use them when my work schedule does not include active teaching.\n\n",

I blamed it on varicose veins...my grandma & mother have them...but mine are very thin and hardly noticeable...anyway, the doctor prescribed some stockings for that - but it didn't help.  I also get big, purple-brownish bruises on my legs for no apparent reason.  My left legs hurts much more than the right one, I am 5'6 and weight around 135lbs.  Thank you very much for all your help.  Sincerely,   Laura A.

    "title": "Re: Ongoing leg pain and bruises",
    "content": "Dear Laura,  Thank you very much for the update.  Are you taking aspirin for any reason? Are you taking any over the counter pain relievers? These can make your platelets dysfunctional and make you bruise easily.  Eating green vegetables makes you less prone to develop vitamin c deficiency and vitamin k deficiency which can lead to easy bruising (so you are good from this point).  Also, some antibiotics, will give you vitamin k deficiency and easy bruising (but you said that you had that even before the antibiotics).  Some herbal preparations also can lead to easy bruising by affecting the coagulation capabilities.  The liver synthesizes proteins that aid in coagulation, so if your liver is not functioning well, you  might have easy bruising.  Regarding your ongoing leg pain with the bruises, the explanation could be that you have bruises on the inside of your spine as well giving you this continuous pain.  i have not examined you, but sometimes, a ruptured Backer's cyst (cyst on the back of the knee), which is supposed to be usually evident can give the same picture but is usually more painful.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Laura,   Thank you very much for the update.  i would suggest to call your doctor to check about those test results.  If your leg pain is not getting better, and you still have the same pain, eventhough sciatica's pain usually starts in the low back, Ken's suggestion is very reasonable about this being sciatica and i would suggest to ask your doctor to have a ct scan of the lumbar spine. And ask your doctor about the possbility of this being a ruptured Baker's cyst.  How about the bruising? If it is not getting better, and unless this is an old problem and not a new one, i would suggest to discuss seeing a hematologist (blood diseases specialist) with your doctor and see whether he thinks this is a good idea or not.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 17 and have had irregular periods since the age of 14, always accompanied by mild to severe cramps.  During my last four periods I've had REALLY bad cramps across my abdomen, the flat wide bone that goes across my lower back, and all the way up the left side of my back.  During my last two periods it only hurts across my lower back and up the left side of my back.  It's the worst pain I've ever felt in my entire life, and makes me feel dizzy and I'm unable to stand up when it's really bad.  It also makes me feel like I'm going to throw up.  I noticed that when I pull my left knee up to my chest, I get a really sharp pain under my ribs on my stomach on my left side.  The pain across my lower back is different, it almost feels like it's inside the bone.  I also noticed a large (about inch long) swollen lymph node..erm...\"down there\" and my lymph nodes under my arms get swollen and hurt right before I get my period.  Bleeding is almost always very heavy (a super absorbency tampon and pad is not sufficient for more than a few hours) and my periods tend to last about 2 weeks and have irregular patterns.  (every 14 days, every 36 days, etc.)  I know this kind of pain is far beyond that of \"normal\" cramps.  Does any one know what's wrong with me??\n\n",

But associated symptoms like pain and nausea, and the increased flow may require medical attention. Oral contraceptives are one mode of treatment to regulate the menstrual cycle as well as lessen the symptoms. Anti-spasmodic pain meds during the cycle may also help. It is best to consult with a gynecologist for proper care.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

These bodies have concluded that aspartame does not cause cancer or other adverse health effects in the general population (Janssen, 1988; JECFA, 1980).   Does Aspartame Cause Any Other Health Problems?  The major health concern regarding the use of aspartame pertains to people who have a rare genetic disorder called phenylketonuria. Individuals born with this disorder cannot metabolize the amino acid phenylalanine, which occurs naturally and is found in aspartame. This disorder is usually detected at birth by a routine blood test and then individuals with the disorder are placed on a phenylalanine-restricted diet. People with phenylketonuria must therefore avoid aspartame in their diets.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  In any other situation, I would have advised you to spare the 'heels' and heal the toes.    But since you find it so hard to abandon your 'heels,' why don't you try some medicines for pain relief or muscle relaxant combinations to relieve you of the pain while you're at it? Buddy strapping of the toes may help in some cases. Using a tape strap the two toes together with a normal third toe, so that they don't bend upwards much. This is just a suggestion, but for further help, a chiropractor may be consulted.  And maybe rest can bring on your toes back to itself after using comfortable footwear for a certain period of time, after which you may slowly begin to use your 'heels.'  Hope this helps.

    "content": "Dear Mike,  This might be a fungal infection of the toes. Do you have white material inbetween your toes?  If this has been going on for a while, i would suggest going to the doctor for an antifungus medication. Usually, it is in the form of a cream or ointment.  However, this kind of infection is sometimes tough to treat because the main problem is that the feet are always sweating. Best thing to do is to make sure that your feet are always dry. i know it is not an easy job, but here are some suggestions. Wear cotton stockings, put powder in between your toes and try and areate your feet on regular basis if your working circumstances allow. Some people wear sandals.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 31 year old woman, non smoker, two drinks a week at the most. I have had many strange symptoms in the last 4 months.  I first noticed something when I climbed the stairs to my apartment, I felt like I wasn't sure where my left foot was, felt a little clumsy. That lasted about three months, now it seems better.   Sometime in the last two months I have lost 8 pounds without noticing. My appetite has been fine up unitl last week .  Under a lot of stress though.  Now for my real problem.  Two weeks ago  I went for a walk , by the time I got home my left leg was very weak, like I'd run a marathon.  At night my thigh cramped up and my lower leg felt very tight and the whole leg 'tickled' like it was just about to fall asleep.  My big toe was asleep and my leg was aslo tingling.  I stayed off of it for a few days and it stopped tingling but was still cramping, only less.  Also, my left arm felt cold and tight and a little heavy.  I did not feel any weakness in my arm it just had a funny 'slightly heavy' feeling.  The next weekend, same story only my face and arm were also tingling. I went to the hospital and they said the tingling in my face was from hyperventilation. EKG was normal. No answer on the leg issue.  Since I have one leg slightly longer than the other, they said it might me a pinched nerve.  Now my symptoms are getting worse.  I went for a 10 minute walk today, no more tingling, but tonight my whole left side was cramping, and also spasmed from my left eye (no change in vision) to my leg.  My left forearm also cramped. These spasms and most of the cramping mostly happens at night when I go to bed or is much worse at night.  A few other things that are concerning me, I have had really bad heart burn this week with dizziness and yesterday I woke up and was making the bed when I began gasping for breath and felt and strange weakness from my heart. left chest muscle pain and nausea.  I've been a little short of breath since then and no appetite. Please help me, I'm scared and I want an idea of what I could be dealing with. Thanks\n\n",

I did not seek medical help right away because I thought it was just a bruised/sore foot.  The problem did not get better by the 18th so I went to the Hospitals ER branch because it was late and the doctor was closed.  They took x-rays and said it was not broken, but I have a sprained foot ligament.  It is still not better today and it is the 22nd.  So it has been 11 days since the injury and no results, except some reduced swelling.  It is still black and blue the whole foot and painfull, and just below the ankle joint, on the left side I have a pretty big lump still.  That lump at the time of the accident was the size of and egg, it is half that now.  It is still painfull to put weight on it so I don't.      Do you think there could be something more serious here?  due to it not being healed yet, maybe nerve dmg?...or a such severe sprain that I need surgery?

    "title": "Re: Sprained foot ligament",
    "content": "Dear Blaxjax,  Hope you are feeling better by now.  It usually takes a while for sprain ligaments to heal especially if the sprain was severe enough. If the x-ray did not show any fracture the first time but you still have significant pain that is not resolving or may be even increasing, sometimes there is such an amount of swelling that the x-ray can miss a small fracture, so, sometimes, patients are adviced to repeat the x-ray after the swelling has gone down if the pain was not improving to make sure that there is not any thing that was missed the first time.  If you have a very severe sprain, i think the procedure is to put in cast not to operate and in your case i don't think that both are indicated since the swelling that you are having is improving.  If you had nerve damage, it would have been obvious from minute one and this is usually in the form of inability to move the foot. In the acute phase, if you have such tremendous pain, sometime, this can be a confounding factor as you will not move your foot because of the pain but usually pain medications can be given to make sure that this is not the case.  If you don't think that you have improved by now, go see your doctor and may i suggest a second x-ray on your foot to make sure that a small fracture was not missed the first time because of the swelling that you had in your foot.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

For treatment he advised me to get an ankle support and put me on 800mg Ibuprofen.  And to elevate it.  Only moderate use.  If the sprain does not seem to get better in two weeks he said,  come back and we will do another X-Ray.  Possibly some bone chips etc.     Thanks again for the reply, I thought I would just update.\n\n",

I have talked to my mom about going to the doctor but she doesn't want to take me yet. The last time I went to the doctor was for a school physical going into 7th grade because I had to I hate going to the doctor they freak me out and make me uncomfortable. Now im at the end of my 9th grade year. My periods have always been irregular about every 3 months but the timing is never the same. I have acne and I started to gain wait mainly in my stomach region around the end of 3rd grade. I also have skin tags and mood swings from what my friends tell me hehe. My older sister has also been diagnosed with PCOS and I was wondering if it is a hereditary thing? Are these cramps something I need to worry about? What should I do? Heather\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tammy,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Prolotherapy has been present for a while now. i think the first double blinded study (the kind of study which is supposed to give the best medical evidence there is if of course correctly conducted, etc...) on this kind of therapy was done in 1987 by the Sansum medical clinic. Their results showed that the group of patients who were injected the prolotherapy solution had statistically significant improvement in their condition. Personally, i have not read the entire study, but from what i read, there was no mention of what all the patients really suffered from. They only mentioned that the patients had chronic back pain for more than one year. Wether these patients or some of them had spondylolisthesis or not, i can not be certain for sure.  The question then becomes, are you a candidate for this type of therapy or not? i can not really answer that question but if your doctor thinks that you are a candidate, since he knows you better than i do, i would suggest that you follow his advice.  Are you going to benefit from this therapy or not? The answer is i can not predict, but there are many reports to suggest that it works really well for some people, so if you go for it, i hope that you are going to be one of those fortunate people.  If your doctor that you are talking about is not a neurosurgeon or a neurologist and you want a second opinion i would suggest that you see either a neurologist or neurosurgeon to see whether your condition needs a surgical intervention.

Since she was..maybe 54..., I have been hearing her complain about back aches and those things that, you know, old age seems to give. But after each year, I hear more ouches  . Well, right now she complains of lots of things. Here's my list: headache (almost everyday), backache (right outside the kidneys), lots of \"bruises\" (the black thing that colors the skin when you hit on something hard, although she didn't hit herself on anything), blurred vision (even with eyeglasses), sudden cramps on the knees, her left foot suddenly twists (and she fights it), swollen hands and feet, muscle cramps, stomach pains. And one more thing, she's got a big stomach. I mean she looks like a pregnant woman even if she isn't. We've checked this with a doctor before, even had her an ultrasound, but said it was nothing. Yeah, I know this is sooo long...but whoever read this one, thanks for having the patience to read it. I really need advice on which doctor we should visit. I just don't know where to start with all her complaints  I'm just sooo worried about her... PLEASE SHARE SOME INFO, PLEASE...Thanks\n\n",

However, for the past 6 months I have been very frustrated by severe, unexplained mental and physical fatigue.  My muscles and joints get unusually sore after moderate exercise and I feel like I am in a state of apathy from having a constant lack of energy.  I have been experiencing unrefreshing sleep and mental \"dullness\".    What is most troubling to me is that I'm naturally a postive, happy person and do not believe my symptoms are due to severe depression, boredom or increased stress levels.  I have been using caffeine and other stimulants to cope with these symptoms.  I have not reported this strange exhaustion to my doctor yet because I thought I might be bringing it on myself by exercise or by taking on too many responsibilities.    I realize that this is a complex issue and don't expect you to diagnose, but I would appreciate your thoughts on these symptoms and what I can expect at the doctor's office.\n\n",

    "content": "dandiedeb, I am glad you have reached a diagnosis quickly. As for your enquiry: I don't think the lumbar puncture had anything to do with it. Sciatica commonly refers to pain that radiates along the sciatic nerve and is typically felt in the buttocks, down the back of the leg and possibly to the foot. Sciatica is one of the most common forms of pain caused by compression of the spinal nerves, and the leg pain often feels much worse than the back pain.  Sciatica pain can result when the nerve roots in the lower spine are irritated or compressed. Most often, sciatica pain is caused when the L5 or S1 nerve root in the lower spine is irritated by a herniated disc. When this happens, pain radiates into the buttocks and back of the thigh and calf, and occasionally may extend down to the foot. Numbness, tingling, and/or a burning or prickling sensation are also common symptoms.   Lumbar puncture (spinal tap) is usually done between the L4 and L5 vertebral levels.  Where the needle enters the dura there are roots of the cauda equina (nerve roots suspended in fluid below the end of the spinal cord).  The chances of putting a needle into one of the roots suspended in the thecal sac are about as good as spearing cooked soft spaghetti floating in water with the lumbar puncture needle (or the prong of a fork)..   Theoretically speaking however, one rare complication of lumbar puncture is disc herniation. Did your CAT scan or MRI show disc herniation between LV4 and 5?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,         I recently had a MRI had was told I have a lateral degenerative meniscus. I am currently under county hospital care due to losing my job from difficulty walking and as grateful as I am for the treatment I have yet to get a possible cause from a MD. I am in my mid twenties and have had horrible back problems since I can recall, which recently include numbness in between my shoulders and numbness in my right fingers. I injured my right knee about two years ago and had sharp pain in the back of it (center only) with the snapping and after a few months it appeared to fine. So here I am two years later with a knee that has landed me in ER three times in addition to right knee trouble my shoulders, ankles, and left knee seem to crack/snap more each day. Now I can understand \"bones\" may make noises but this is all accompanied by severe a pain that lasts for hours, unlike any I have know. I have tried all treatment for my back trouble and now with the MRI results I am very concerned the cause is something more serious. If anyone could help it would be greatly appreciated! Thanks, CJ\n\n",

I have tried to speak w/ the doctors I have seen however @ USC County Hospital even w/ an appointment I usually wait 6-8 hours, the doctors there are very busy and everytime I attempt to discuss concerns or other symptoms I get a \"confused stare\" from them. Symptoms to me appear as an early on set of Osteoarthritis. My concerns are my legs, the days I cant walk terrify me. As sad as it sounds the pain I am use to, although I would give just about anything to have one week go by w/o vomiting from pain caused by neck/headaches. If I continue at this rate where will I be ten years from now? Once again thanks, much  appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "On Novenber 29, I had a discogram to confirn I would benefit from surgery to L5-S1 disc. An MRI showed disc degeneration, a tear and a small herniation. The results of the discogram confirmed I would need an anterior/posterior fusion. Since the Discogram my condition and pain has worsened a measurable amount every day to the point that I can not walk for more than 1 minute, and being bed ridden is not to far away. My surgery has been scheduled for Feb. 27, but I don't know if I can wait that long. More recently I have had some incontence (small amounts of urine 10-15 minutes after I urinate), a constant more intence pain in my lower back and buddock area, and my right foot has had pins and needles constantly for 3 days now. Is it possible that the discogram has done additional damage to the disc? Should I be concerned with the rapid rate my condition is worsening? My doctor tells me he can not reserve a operating room for me any earlier the Feb. 27. Do theese symptions warrant a trip to the emergency room, and the possibilty of an emergency type surgery? Any respose would be greatly appriciated as I am going crazy from this. Thank you\n\n",

As long as your ability to urinate remains, and as long as there are medicines for pain, I do not feel a need for an emergent neurosurgery in your case.   But I admit that I could be wrong, and a neurosurgeon would be in the best position to answer your query.  Warm regards,  Bill\n\n",

So i suggest if you still have problems with loss of feeling in your leg n pins n needles and some loss in your bladder control, its a serious probem thats needs to be looked at straight away other wise you might cause permanent problems, so why not take a trip to the hospital when itsbad n they should fix it.

There was also a steriod the doc gave me to help relax my lungs. This is not the first time I have had this , and am usually treated with prednisolone< (spelling). THe  major side effect I get is no sleep as well as severe cramps in my middle back and right below my ribs. This time the doc prescribed methylprenisolone which worked out really good. No side effects. Now that two week have passed and am feeling really good I am starting to get the same cramps as if I am on the steriod. This time it started in my legs while i was sleeping. I have not done anything different than my normal routine. ( no exercising, weight lifting , strenous lifting ,or strining myself) I have recently started taking a Male Multi Vitamin as I was told my Vit E, Magnesium, Calcium , or Potassium may be low. I double dosed between two mutli vitamins to get me jolted and now have been taking them for about a week and am still getting the cramps in my back as well as right under my ribs.

I have been taking it now for two full months at a dosage of 1500mg per day and it has done nothing. I suppose I should also mention that my current physician does not believe in Fibromyalgia....he thinks it is merely random symptoms to be controlled and is not a syndrome, disease or illness.

Your drug Lexapro could also cause paresthesia and pain in limb in 1 in 100 patients, as well as leg pain in 1 in 1000 patients. But to calculate the odds, perhaps switching over to a higher dose of a tricyclic antidepressant may be useful for neuropathic pains, especially if depression is an accomplice.   All this could very well be wrong without a clinical examination. Lack of sufficient blood flow could also hold responsibility. So I would suggest to let your doctor see your problem before you can discuss these aspects with him or her.  I hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "title": "Lingering Hamstring Pain from Cramp",
    "content": "this is my first post, please bear with me...  Last Tuesday evening upon exiting my car, I felt a cramp in the back of my left thigh halfway between groin and knee(I think the seat was pulled far too close to the steering wheel...I am a new and very nervous driver at night due to partial blindness). The pain was similar to a calf cramp. Twice during the night I awoke with severe cramps in my left calf. During the day Wednesday my left leg and foot would begin to spasm in different places.  When I awoke on Thursday morning my big toe was sore, and I had a numb sensation in my left foot arch. Living behind a rural hospital I decided to have this looked into. I was sent immediatly for a doplar ultrasound of my entire leg, which determined that I did not have a blood clot. The doctor perscriped massage therapy. I had my first session of massage therapy on Saturday, the therapist advised me that I would suffer some pain, especially in the siatica nerve. I have felt definate pain within my leg, today I have pain in the rear of the thigh (localized to the initial pain site from last week). I have been taking daily epsom salt baths. I should mention I do have a desk job, and foolishly thought my leg was better and was running with my puppy two evenings ago. I have just started taking calcium supplements, as the doctor suggested this may have been the cause of initial cramping (I am lactose intolerant).  Any thoughts are appreciated as to what I can do to get myself back to normal. I am a fairly active person, and this \"taking it easy\" thing is so hard to do!\n\n",

Treatments include medicine, surgery, and physical therapy depending on the response. RICE (Rest, Ice, Compression, and Elevation) is recommended.  I hope this helps.  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Anni, Its not easy judging here from the internet. At the same time your condition is very atypical. Believe me I have gone through a whole podiatrics reference in search for an answer. I don't get quite the picture: So it's not related to the tightness of the shoes or the fabric?  Anyways I could go on asking questions here forever. Here's my two cents:  There are many causes of foot swelling. If one leg is swollen, it may be caused by vein problems, blood clots in vein, infection, injuries, surgery, blockage of deep veins due to tumors, disease of the lymphatic channel, etc. Swelling of both legs may mean heart conditions, kidney problems, liver cirrhosis, malignancies, vein problems, or sitting in a wheelchair for a long period of time.  General podiatric care: Every time you buy shoes, measure your feet standing. Remember your feet change in shape and size during full weight bearing.  Let your podiatrist examine your new shoes for an approval before you wear them. You may not be able to feel the fit of the shoes as neuropathies get worse.  The shoe should be \u00bd inch longer than your longest toe. A shoe larger than this makes your foot slide back and forth causing blisters.  If you have feet of different sizes, get both pairs of shoes even if it costs you more.  Do not wear shoes with more than an inch heel height. With high heel shoes, there is increased pressure at the ball of the foot where foot ulcers develop most frequently.  Inner lining of the shoes should be free of in-seam lines which can be abrasive on the sensitive skin.  Do not wear shoes made of nylon or plastic. Leather shoes breath better and absorb moisture from perspiration. Deerskin and calfskin leather are recommended.  A toe box should be high and wide especially if you have bunions or hammertoe deformities. Your toes should not be squeezed from the sides nor pressed down from the roof of the shoes.   Go through the list of causes above and if you wish to discuss any points further go ahead. If you can send me a pic of the swelling, that may also be helpful.  Regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dizziness upon standing in your case seems to caused by postural hypotension. This type of dizziness, faintness or light-headedness results from a decrease in blood flow to the brain, due to a drop in blood pressure upon standing up.  At one time or another, we\u2019ve probably all experienced mild postural hypotension from standing up too quickly. As long as it occurs only occasionally, there\u2019s little cause for alarm.  But chronic postural hypotension can be a debilitating condition, associated with increased risk of injury from accidents and falls, and obviously is a cause for concern. Persistent light-headedness or faintness upon standing may be a symptom of a serious underlying disorder. Anyone with this problem should be seen by their physician.  Some causes of chronic postural hypotension: Dizziness upon standing, from postural hypotension, usually means that either something has gone awry with the circulatory reflexes, or for some reason, the body\u2019s fluid volume is depleted:  1) Blockade of the normal heart or blood vessel response: Some medications impair the circulatory reflexes by blocking transmission of the message from the involuntary nervous system to the heart and blood vessels. This is the mechanism of action of some blood pressure medications such as beta blockers and alpha blockers, and a number of other medications. Postural hypotension is one of the more common side effects associated with these types of drugs.  2) Involuntary nervous system dysfunction: Postural hypotension can be caused by a number of conditions and diseases which affect the involuntary nerves, such as diabetes, alcoholism, nutritional deficiencies, and other nervous system disorders.  3) Inadequate blood volume: If there isn't enough fluid volume in the blood vessels, then the circulatory reflexes can't restore normal blood pressure. This can happen in any condition which causes dehydration, which may be due to inadequate oral intake, vomiting, diarrhea, or other causes of excessive fluid loss, such as overuse of diuretics, failure of the adrenal glands, and blood loss.  Sometimes the cause of postural hypotension is unknown (idiopathic, Shy-Drager syndrome).\n\n",

    "content": "Last January I went to physical therapy for ITB friction syndrome.  When I was at therapy the lady noticed I have crooked shoulders. I don't have scoliosis.  She reset (i believe that is the term) my hip and massaged my back , and my shoulders were even.  She said she had noticed spasms in my back.  Even after the therapy, my ITB still feels real tight when I run and my shoulders are still crooked (they went crooked a couple of days later).  Do you suppose there is a connection between my crooked shoulders and my ITBs hurting?  Any ideas on this would be great.  Thanks\n\n",

I recently started walking - starting at 5 miles a day - but some days I go up to 15 - 16 miles.....Is it Ok to walk that much? (I walked about 56 miles in seven days)......Also, ever since before I started walking - I get this tingling sensation on my legs & arms - both get numb often & I suffer from Migraine headaches.  My hands & feet are very cold most of the time.  Do u think I have a circulation problem?....If so - would walking this much help?....I am doing this mostly because I want to loose weight.  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,   Laura A.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Laura, If you are going to walk this much then its really more of a sport than just walking. Like any other sport you should be equipped with the right gear. If your feet hurt then check if your sneakers need changing? Also get a good pair. Again, if you are going to be exposed to a windy environment or air currents while walking, you need to be equipped with that e.g. hood, scarf. I would advise you to go a step at a time don't rush into any sport, your muscles need time to adapt especially after a long period of lack of use. Keep up the good work! Regards.\n\n",

Starting at 5 miles a day is a little bit overdoing i guess. You can start at 1 mile a day for 2 days then 2 miles a day for 2 days and so forth but it looks like you are on the go and did not need the titration.   About the numbness and tingling sensation that you have this is most probably related to hyperventillation and i think that there is nothing to worry about.   It looks like you are a motivated person, so, keep up the good work.   Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Again, sometimes it takes a little experimentation with different brands and types of shoes(spending more money) to find what works for you......Possibly because of a compensation by your foot because of inadequate support or cushion or fit may cause your symptoms....   Do you sweat allot as you walk????  Remaining cool and well hydrated burns more 'fat calories' so don't overdress and bring at least a 24oz plastic bottle of water with you###-> stay ahead of any dehydration, especially on hot and humid days...If your mouth is beginning to get dry, then you are behind, drink and refill if necessary......The symptoms could also be related to a low electrolyte level(s), so taking a sports drink like Gatorade is a good idea====>I usually will dilute mine 1/2 water and 1/2 Gatorade and also make sure your diet supports your work-outs in replacing necessary nutrients.....\n\n",

I feel some swelling (moderate) on the outside of my throat in that area. I have tonsils but this doesn't feel like anything tonsil-related. It feels slightly lower than my tonsils in my throat, isolated only to my right side. Again, everything else feels fine. Head, sinuses, rest of throat feel fine . . . no burning or irritation anywhere else, no cough.  Any info would be EXTREMELY appreciated.

    "content": "Dear Smoosw,  Thank you very much for using our website.  In my opinion, swellings should be looked at before guessing so you did good that you are going to see your doctor.  Swellings in that area could be caused by any of the structures present there like: 1. Skin (since it is on the outside) . 2. Lymph nodes. 3. Salivary glands. 4. Blood vessels. 5. Muscles. 6. Subcutaneous tissues.  Most of the swellings could be identified by their history and then examination. If a swelling could not be identified clinically or is suspicious then it should be excised and analysed.  As regars the history you have not mentioned how long ago did you notice the swelling? How fast did it get bigger? When did you start having the swallowing problem and the pain? The answers to all these questions help as to find out the cause of the swelling.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Is like pulling teeth to get info to help myself take proper care of injuries.  At first was told no ice.  Then the next day yes ice but no, too late, only first 24 hrs.  Said use sling but am also using ace bandage.  Neither is enough to keep me from painful movements.  Prescribed Vioxx.  Hand and fingers are still very swollen, almost twice normal size.  One person told me it's not too late to use ice, is this true?  Another said it should have been advised I wear a splint.  Should I?  Finally with 2 sprains (typing w/ left hand only) how long should I expect healing to take?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear SpiritDaughter,  After a trauma, at the begining you can use ice to help reduce the possibility of expanding or worsening hematoma, you can use ice for the first 24 hours some say up till 48 hours.  After ice, if you have a localized swelling you can use warm foments to help the body get more blood supply to this area to absorb the swelling faster.  i think a sling is used for fractures and not sprains. Regarding the ace raper you can use but be careful because if too tight then it will make the absorption of the swelling sometimes slower.  How often it takes for healing, it differs from person to person and i can not make any guesses.

Meanwhile , you can try cold and/or (more preferred) warm compresses at sites of pain. warm baths, massage, and gentle stretching exercises after a rest period can be used as frequently as possible. These manouvers usaually help in muscle pain due to trauma. Regular exercise (slowly increased from very gentle to more vigorous) may help restore the proper muscle tone. And of course analgesics ahich you have exhuasted. hope to hear you recovered soon\n\n",

    "content": "Dear B. Kelly,   You have to go to your orthopedic surgeon and have him evaluate you, there is a chance that this may be  1. Blood clot in the leg since you have bee in cast which might lead to you being less active and the blood more stagnant and may be predispose to a blood clot formation  2. Infection of the leg (cellulitis).  The treatment for the former is blood thinners and the treatment for the latter is antibiotics.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
