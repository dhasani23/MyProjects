    "title": "Unexplained Fat Gain In Just Three Weeks",
    "content": "I know that you see a lot of posts about weight gain.  But, I am scared.  I am a 28 y/o female with no real medical problems in my personal or family history.  I have no known food allergies (only a drug allergy to some narcotic painkillers) and am currently taking birth control.  I have been on the pill for over 8 years now.  I recently travelled to Hawaii for work and and have been here for the last three weeks.  For my entire life, I have tried to maintain an active lifestyle and a decent diet.  Two years ago, I lost approximately 30 pounds and went from 145 lbs (at 5'4\") to 107 lbs (which was admittedly a little low for my body type).  In high school, I averaged around 120 lbs and maintain a pretty muscular physique.  When I got to Hawaii, I wanted to try and lose weight for my upcoming wedding and started focusing on working out, light lifts and lots of cardio.  I have been eating less than I did when I was back stateside and recently, I have seen myself developing a disturbing fatty layer in my stomach and just above my genital area.  The fat is different than I remember ever having and it has this permanent \"muffin top\" look to it (the two fat layers are separate) even when I am unclothed.  The fat in my lower abdomen is pretty jiggly and I can feel the movement when I run (which I never used to feel before).  The fat above my genitals is much thicker and has an odd consistency to it.  I have never seen my body look like this.  I understand that some of it is in my head... but not all.  This is starting to scare me.  I don't eat that much and I go to sleep feeling like a balloon that is about to pop.  It even hurts sometimes.  I can't get a good night's sleep.   I don't know if you need more information (I will be happy to provide it), but I am scared that there is something wrong.  And, I am even more scared that I won't be beautiful on my wedding day.  I would rather not get married than be fat in all my pictures.  But, most of all, I want to be able to run again without feeling my stomach jumping up and down.  I run about 5-6 miles 4-5 times per week and spend another 45 minutes in the gym on each day of the week.  Any advice, help, or explanations would be much appreciated.  I am scared for my health and for my wedding.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Although you have tried your best to describe the lesion, there is no substitute to a first hand clinical examination by a doctor. From the description given, one possibility could be one of several varieties of \"Panniculitis\" (inflammation of the subcuteneous fat).  This condition is classified in a number of different ways (clinical/microscopic). One such,classifies them based on the clinical presentation into - panniculitis with systemic disease and - panniculitis without systemic disease.  Several autoimmune disorders can be associated with panniculitis (ex., lupus erythematosus, scleroderma). One particular form is suspected to be having some unproven link to Electromagnetic radiation(Lipoatrophia Semicircularis).  Rather than to speculate, you should have yourself examined by a doctor to sort out this question. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 year old female and over the last few months I have been accumulating a lot of fluid in my legs, back and arms.  The weight gain has been over 40 pounds.  I have been seeing a doctor for well over a  year, and she has given me blood tests for thyroid and liver function and it has all come back normal.  No matter what I do I can not seem to shed this water.  I have followed doctors advise and walked half an hour each day, I have cut out all salt, sugary and fatty foods in my diet.  I have high blood pressure, the last was 149/91.  I was on hydrochlorothyazide, but as that wasn't working it was discontinued.  I have taken an herbal approach to try to control this along with the diet and exercise.  The previous medication I was on for 7 months (clonazapem & generic Ritalin) made me so tired all I did for several months was sleep it seemed.  The doctor said this is why I was retaining.  I am in desperate need of advise.  I have been drinking lemon water and regular coffee for days, I'm not sure about the blood pressure, but the swelling has not changed and neither has the numbness in my hands.  Anything you can tell me would be so greatly appreciated. Thanks so much\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Though I can not profess to have a solution to your unexplained edema yet can offer you some diagnosis based on a reference.Idiopathic edema is a pitting edema of unknown cause that occurs primarily in pre-menopausal women who do not have evidence of heart, liver, or kidney disease. Idiopathic edema: I. The occurrence of hypoalbuminemia and abnormal albumin metabolism in women with unexplained edema  Volume 52, Issue 4, Pages 444-451 (April 1972)John R. Gill, M.D.1, Thomas A. Waldmann, M.D.1, Frederic C. Bartter, M.D.1 The American Journal of Medicine. The authors have found a significance of reduction of Albumen levels due to abnormal level of degradation of plasma albumin leading to edema in women who do not have other cardiovascular or kidney disease. This reduction leads to lowered blood volume signalling the secretion of aldosterone which in turn conserves sodium leading to odema.  In this condition diuretics seem to worsen the condition.ACE inhibitors,bromocriptine are some of the medications apart from withdrawal from diuretics. Do consult your doctor for more details.Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 22 year old female in pretty decent health considering I'm overweight.  When I was a kid could eat fish no problem.  We even took a family trip to the east coast where we ate almost nothing but fish, and I was fine.  When I was in my mid teens, however, I started having problems.  I had a bit of salmon at a party (we later confirmed no other guests got sick, so no food poisoning).  I went home and took a nap.  A couple hours after eating I started feeling extremely nauseous.  It kept getting worse.  It actually progressed a lot like labor, with the waves getting closer together and more intense as time went by.  After half an hour I was just dry heaving.  After two hours of continued dry heaving, and developing diarrhea, my mom took me to the hospital where they gave me compazine.  Months later the family had fish for dinner.  My mom has trouble with sea food too, so we just assumed the salmon had been salt water and she got us both fresh water trout.  Same thing.  So my doctor just told me not to eat anything that spends the majority of its time in water.  Then it happened after I had buckweat pancakes for breakfast one time.  No idea if that's connected to the fish thing or if I'm just lucky enough to have two intolerances (I have no trouble with any other kind of wheat, and buckwheat was the only ingredient I don't ingest on a regular or semi-regular basis).  But the really weird thing is that I can eat fake crab just fine.  Which is most commonly pollock, although it can be other things too and I don't know exactly what type the restaurant where I've had it uses.  So apparently some kinds of fish are OK?  Is there any way besides trial an error to figure out what fish I can safely eat?  I'm moving to the coast in a year, and since fish is a good healthy alternative and I'm trying to eat better (I'm 10 pounds away from no longer being obese!), and since super fresh fish is delicious, I'd really like to be able to eat some.  But I don't really enjoy having to go to the hospital to stop vomiting.    I'm guessing this is something I should probably work with an actual doctor with, but the other problem is that I never got a regular doctor after I moved to college, so I don't really have anyone I can talk to yet.  Is there a particular type of specialist I should look for?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question about food intolerance",
    "content": "Hi, There are two main health related concerns with regard to fish consumption. - seafood allergy and - ill effects due to contamination(ex., mercury).  Of late, fish and fish oils have raised some concerns. One major concern is that the fish from which the oils are manufactured may be poisoned with heavy metals and other marine pollutants. Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury dioxins have been found in some species of fish.  It is well documented that both the atlantic and pacific salmon and other fish are increasingly being affected by marine pollution. Contamination by mercury has been a major concern. All salmonid fish require pure, well-oxygenated cold water and are one of the first species to suffer when water quality is degraded. Atlantic salmon are believed to be a symbol of clean, unspoiled waters that run wild to the sea.  Mercury has been noted to build up near salmon farms in fish feed and waste. Its biological availability is higher underneath fish-pen nets where ocean sediments become depleted of oxygen. This is thought to contaminate other types of fish as well.  The fish most affected by mercury contamination are those that eat other fish (piscivores), as living at the peak of the food web makes them vulnerable to accumulating persistent toxins like methylmercury. Mercury also has been observed to concentrate more in bigger fish.In one study among anglers in the 12 western states of the USA surveyed, fish such as rainbow and cutthroat trout were found to be the least contaminated of all. Only 2.3% of the stream lengths with members of the Salmonidae family contained fish too toxic for people to eat safely. Spencer A. Peterson, John Van Sickle, Alan T. Herlihy and Robert M. Hughes. 2007. Mercury Concentration in Fish from Streams and Rivers Throughout the Western United States. Environmental Science and Technology. 41(1): 58-65.  The symptoms of mercury poisoning include a metallic taste in the mouth, headaches, hearing loss, motor loss, and several others. Occasionally, it can cause irreparable damage to the heart and the nervous system.  In the east coast of USA, harmful cyanobacterial blooms (HCBs) have occurred in several large estuarine systems (e.g., Albemarle-Pamlico Sound, Chesapeake Bay, and Florida Bay). Cyanobacterial blooms are also serious problems in freshwater systems.They are known to occur in virtually every state in the US.They indicate excessive nutrient loading in water bodies.They have been found to be responsible for major estuarine fish and shellfish kills. In experimental studies, they have been reported to cause central nervous system dysfunction, including sudden rages and other erratic behavior, reversible cognitive impairment, chronic effects such as sustained asthma-like symptoms and suppressed immune system (may last for months to years).    Allergy to seafood (fish, crustaceans and molluscs) has nothing to do with iodine content. It is caused by specific IgE against allergenic proteins including, but not limited to, parvalbumins in fish and tropomyosins in crustaceans and molluscs. Cross-reactive allergy within each of these three groups of animals is common, but is less common between the groups. (Those allergic to prawns are often allergic to crab, but those allergic to crustaceans, are not usually allergic to fish.)While it is true that seafood may contain relatively high levels of iodine compared with other foods, the allergenic proteins are not iodinated and seafood allergy does not depend on the iodine content of the seafood.   It is also well known that stomach upsets are frequent side effects of fish oil supplements. Diarrhea may also occur, large doses capable of causing potentially severe episodes.There are also reports of increased acid reflux, increased belching, indigestion, flatulence and abdominal pain.However, mostly these side effects are associated with eating whole fish (potentially contaminated) rather than as the oil alone.  Your symptoms are more in favor of seafood allergy rather than mercury toxicity. It appears that you have allergy to certain fish, but not the crustaceans. You may even be allergic to salmon harvested from fish farms rather than the marine fish. I think that the local fisheries department may be able to provide you with more information. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason for the variation is because each individual is different in their metabolism and an estimate is the best we can do for people.  The idea is to get you into the ballpark range and then adjust as your needs require to lose 1-1/2 lbs. per week.  I would estimate this to be between 1500 and 1600 calories per day based on the information provided.    If you find this amount does not achieve the desired results, adjust it accordingly.  The goal is to have a healthy diet with the good carbs such as whole grains, fruits and vegetables along with reduced fat.  Make every calorie count for some good nutrition.  Also, be sure to drink plenty of water.  Your exercise regimen is quite good. Some aerobic exercises in the form of walking, jogging, bicycling or swimming would also help speed up your metabolism.  You should know that what you have done so far has already had a positive impact on your health so don't be discouraged that you aren't at goal yet.  Good luck in your efforts toward better health.\n\n",

    "title": "Can't Lose Weight - Sleep apnea, active, have seen 5 docs",
    "content": "The Issue: -I can't lose weight. For 7 months I have been trying, but after seeing 5 doctors, having my metabolism measured, exercising and dieting, nothing changes. I have apnea. Please see below for the whole story.   Background: -I am overweight (6'2\", 285 lbs) but with lots of muscle (~25% body fat)... I bench 285-315, my heart is pretty healthy (resting bp is 110/70 to 130/85)  -I exercise frequently (2-4 times a week of intense weightlifting for 1.5 hrs or interval training with circuits for 1 hr, plus morning walks (0-3x week), weekend hikes,   -At age 16 (2000) I was 215lbs and fit, from there, went to 250, then 280. 2005 went back to 260, then gained to 280. After college (2007) had reached 290. In 6 months, through moderate diet and exercise, lost 50 lbs, back down to 240. Got married, had a few months of bad eating and gained it all back (back to 285 in June 2009). Since then, stuck on 285.   -I was diagnosed with sleep apnea (moderate to severe: 22-55 apneas/hr) in 2004. After a septoplasty in 2004, I was functional and fairly symptom free until June/july in 2009 (before it I slept 12-15 hrs/day and still was drowsing in class, after I was sleeping 9 hrs and staying awake much better, though I did start taking provigil 200mg about 2-4 times/week until 2007)  -prescribed a CPAP in 2004 at 10cmH2O, but for the 3 months i tried, i woke up with it off every night.   -August/September 2009 I began feeling extremely lethargic, mentally dull, and felt like I was losing my passion. This has worsened drastically since. The last few months I have felt like a zombie at work, with much of my drive, excitement and energy gone.   -started seeing a sleep dr again in October 2009. told him the story and he adjusted the cpap to 13cmH20 without any evaluation. He prescribed me nuvigil (150mg), which made me functional at work (previously, I was drinking about 5-6 cups of coffee a day, plus caffeine pills).  -I tried the CPAP again for a month, but tolerated it worse... every time the \"ramp\" function reach full pressure, I would remove it, even in my sleep.  -Since January 2010, I've been keeping up the exercise, tried numerous diets in 6 week intervals (cycling ketogenic, low/no-carb, 1400cals/day, 2200 cals/day). Every time, I notice I'm the same weight as when I started, though cycling ketogenic worked briefly (12 lbs in 6 weeks) but was torturous. so, since January, I've maintained +/-5lbs pretty much consistently.   -Lethargy and \"blackness\" (not emotional like depression, but very physical, felt like my body was slowly shutting down) increased. Also noticed a shift in the perception of my tiredness... less physical \"sleepiness\" where I could fall asleep anywhere, and more of a pervasive mental fatigue.   -Starting in March 2010, I began seeing a bunch of new dr's because my primary gave me overly simplistic advice: \"do more cardio, eat better\". I saw: internal medicine, ENT, sleep, and nutritionist: -Sleep doc and internal medicine both said that the apnea starved my brain of oxygen, which it interpreted as starvation, so it stored everything as fat, making it extremely hard to lose weight beyond just the motivatioanl aspects of being tired all the time. -Nutritionist was amazed at how much I knew of nutrition and didn't really have any suggestions, other than to deal with apnea first, though she suggested the HMR program.  -ENT thought it was completely weight related. prescribed flonase for my nasal congestion.  -Sleep doc gave me a full face cpap mask (previous was nose only), ambien (10mg) and suggested I try the cpap again until a sleep study could see if there was something else they could do to make cpap tolerable. the goal would be to use it to get back to where I could lose weight. If that didn't work, surgery might be an option (MMA)  -I tried the cpap again for the last 6 weeks (with new mask), but the first 4.5 weeks I couldn't tolerate it... as soon as the full 13cm would kick in, I'd take the mask off (even with the ambien). My wife reported that after the cpap she heard me choke/gasp (apnea event) every minute or two  -Just a week and a half ago, I downloaded the clinician's manual for my cpap machine and I adjusted the pressure down to 8cmH2O. for the first time ever, I was able to keep it on overnight. I used the custom pressure adjustment to increment to 8.2 then 8.4, and I've been using it every night with 8.4 for the past week. At first I felt like a new person, but I feel more physically tired recently, though more lucid. I haven't noticed any difference in weight, but it has only been a week.   -Last monday (after only 3 nights of using the cpap), it was finally time for my split night polysomnography and titration. Something felt weird though and i woke up with my throat feeling abnormally dry and tight. normally I can get my throat tissues to collapse to simulate apnea when I try to explain it to be people, but when I woke up during the study I couldn't. I didn't reach the criteria for the titration portion (which is only 20 events/hr), and I felt very refreshed despite 6 hours of sleep. I went back home at 6am and slept for another 3 hours (sans cpap) and felt completely exhausted again, so I doubt this study will tell me anything though I wish I knew what made things different. The room was quite a bit colder, but that was it.   -this morning, I had my metabolism measured by respirometry. After 10 minutes sitting quietly reading, I breathed into the repirometer for a bit and got a reading of 2410 cals/day with a vO2 of 380. With normal activity but not exercise, the lady administering it said that should give me a normal metabolic rate (ie not just sitting still) of ~3000cals/day. This shocked me since I have not been eating anywhere near that, and with the calories i've been averaging, I should be losing weight even if I just sit in one place all day.   -I had several blood tests over the last year. see below for the results.  -two other peculiar observations I've had recently: -I've had bouts of intense gas pain and bloating. It's been more frequent recently. It partially matches descriptions for \"trapped wind\". I can't isolate what causes it... thought it was fiber, then dairy, then my protein powder, but it seems kind of random. I've noticed a change in my stools too... I used to have larger more solid movements, but recently, I've had more times when I felt like I had to go, but sat on the toilet only to release gas and more of \"greasy\" small bits or more explosive. (sorry if that's gross, but I figure more info is better than less). Sometimes extensive 'flatus' is accompanied by a greasy/oily substance that I don't know what it is. - a year or two ago when I lost the 50 lbs, I packed on muscle like crazy. Recently, despite doing my weightlifting alongside a bodybuilder friend, I don't feel muscle or strength gains at anywhere near the same rate (if at all) even if I push as hard as I can during a workout. In fact, I barely notice any gains at all, almost like my body isn't repairing my muscles to be stronger than they were, just the same.   My questions: -why can't I lose weight? do I just need to wait longer with using the cpap? am I not getting enough calories given my muscle mass and RMR? -If I do the HMR \"at-home\" diet (1200cals/day) will it help? is that too few calories? -Could this have anything to do with the intestinal issues? What can I do to address those? -is there any merit to the idea that apnea makes it hard to lose weight? -are there any other things I haven't thought of? I've felt so crappy from the apnea that I forgot what it feels like to feel good, so I think i tend to group things into \"oh it's the apnea.   Thanks so much for helping me! It's been such a frustrating journey.

    "content": "I have had relatively high cholersterol all my life -- presently 302.  I exercise daily -- walk 1-2 miles and bicycle 3 miles -- and eat healthy (mostly fruits and vegetables, some meat and starch, ande seldom a dessert).  I don't smoke, weigh 145 lb (5ft 7in) and still run, easily.  My average blood pressure is 100 / 65, and was able to get it up to 128 / 82 only after bicycling hard and running into Walmart to measure it.  Although my doctor recomments I take cholesterol medication, I REALLY don't want to.  Is it possible to live a long life -- over 100 years -- with cholesterol levels around 300?  I am 65.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high cholersterol",
    "content": "Hello, There are different types of cholesterol.  The HDL is considered \"good\" cholesterol and sometimes it is important to see which of yours is high because some amount of high total cholestrol will be balanced by a high level of the good kind.    There are multiple factors that come into play here.  A big one is genetics and some people are healthy with higher cholesterol.  We don't know why this is the case when it is typically a bad omen for a healthy heart.    Each person is unique and while we look at the majority in predicting mortality and morbidity there are always exceptions.  Nobody can accurately predict your life span.  I would continue doing what you are doing to be sure you are not adding to the genetic predisposition you may have.  Good luck.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 40 Day Fast",
    "content": "Hello salamashka,  Glucose is the primary fuel in the human body.  When the body doesn't receive intake of food providing glucose for more than 4 to 8 houors, the body relies on the liver to convert glycogen, or stored glucose, to glucose for fuel to support life.  Along with this, the body also uses small amounts of protein to supplement the fuel.  The glycogen may last for up to 12 hours; after that, the body uses glycogen that is stored in muscles, which will last for a few more days.  If glucose is still not provided, the body temporarily uses fat as the fuel source, by converting it into ketone, which is used by the brain as a fuel source.  When fat levels are low (less than 7% of body fat in males, or 10% in females), the body signals distress by an increased urge for food.  Taking medications during this time may have dangerous effects.  If fasting persists, starvation begins to occur, as the body uses protein for fuel.  Muscle wasting occurs, with continued weight loss.  Medical complications of fast-induced starvation include electrolyte imbalances, thinning hair, lanugo (fine, downy hair over the skin), cardiac arrhythmias, and kidney failure.  Death can occur if fasting is continued to complete starvation.  A complete fast, or abstinence of all food and liquids, can hasten starvation and the complications of starvation.  Delerium may occur.  The time to complete starvation will be influenced by the body weight prior to beginning the fast.  While I respect your religious convictions, I must point out that a 40-day fast has considerable health risks.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have herbal teas that I want to drink, one which is a colon cleanse and the other a detox tea. The colon cleanse contains senna leave and the detox buchu. I have done some research and know it is not good to drink the buchu while pregnant or breastfeeding as it might have a negative effect on the baby as it is a dieuretic. However, it seems to say that the senna leave should be taken with caution as it is also a laxative and stimulant.   Could you please give me your thoughts on this and whether it is best to avoid these these while breastfeeding as to not harm the baby. Should the breast milk rather be pumped out for a few day's supply and then it is safe to drink the tea?  Thank you for assisting me in my query.\n\n",

I would not think it necessary to pump and dump if you are only planning this for a short duration of use but I can't advise you absolutely.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Then the second symptom....  My throat starts to close up and I can't breathe normally.  It literally takes everything in me to keep breathing.  Obviously knowing this I do not drink beer and eat cheese ever.  But no and again we might be out to dinner and they forget I say no cheese.  If I take a benedryl it goes away after about 20 minutes but then I go to sleep.  So the question is there anything I can do or change to ensure that if I do have cheese and beer that I am ok?

    "content": "Hello,It would seem you have allergy to Tyramine.This is a chemical found in cheese like processed cheese,soy based cheese and aged cheeses.This can induce difficulty in breathing,hives,sneezing etc.Some beers also contain high tyramine.I guess that as a combination tyramine levels would reach high levels in inducing this reaction in you.You could possibly try a low tyramine diet to prevent recurrence. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Doc,      I did some research on the issue and I am most definitely not saying you are wrong but it just doesn't seem to add up to me.  It seems as though my symptoms should be more like massive migraines and rapid breathing rather than...labored, doesn't feel like I am intaking breath...breathing.  Is there a simple test to tell if this is really the case?  I also read that tyramine is found in most meats but I eat meats and drink beer all the time without this reaction.  Could it be anything else?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 yr old femail. I have a potential allergy problem.  Back in Jan '05 I went through Rast (blood test) allergy testing for several foods and environmental offenders.  All results were negative.  Later that year in September and October, I went through skin prick allergy testing for the same types of things.  I had all negative results.  In the fall of '06 I had repeat skin testing for nuts and various foods (most of which I had been tested before previously with negative results).  I became pregnant in December and I started to have more prominent type symptoms often times after eating.  I would get really jittery at times, sometimes my mouth or lips would itch, sometimes I would get an upset stomach, and sometimes I felt like my throat was tight, although there was no indication of swelling.  I never broke out into hives or wheezed.  Because of these symptoms, my doc performed another RAST (skin testing was out due to pregnancy) for various foods and environmental agents.  This time, the test did yield positive results, although primarily low.  I tested positive to tomato, green bean, and carrot; all Class I.  There was also potential for corn and potato, although it was \"unequivocal.\"  I also tested positive to Peanuts (class I) and Almonds (class II) along with Timothy grass (Class II) and Ragweed (class I).  Again, most of the numbers were very low and the doc was unsure about \"true\"  allergies.  He suggested avoidance for about a month or so and see how I feel.  I have been doing that, but still suffering some of the same symptoms.  But now I am a nervous wreck when it comes to eating.  I've researched and consulted others and the consensus seems to be that because my past RAST and skin testing was negative, the most recent test is likely not valid with a positive reaction.  I'm pregnant and concerned about nutrition and now when I eat, I just worry, wondering if I've consumed something bad  and now I'm hypersensitive to any body sensations.  I was allergic to milk as an infant, but other than that, I've had no problems with any other allergies my whole life.   What is your opinion of this situation?  Any input would be appreciated.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "The first thing you should do is to begin keeping a food journal or diary. Write down what you eat; including the amount of food you eat; what time you eat and how the food is prepared. You should also list any symptoms that occur and exactly what time the symptoms occur. This food journal will give you and your physician insight concerning what, if any, food is causing your symptoms. Your health care provider may use your food journal in their diagnosis. Speak with your physician and/or a registered dietician concerning your journal and the possibility of going on an Elimination Diet. Do not attempt an Elimination Diet on your own due to the possibility of nutritional deficits.  Concerning the tests used to determiine if you had food allergies: The RAST is used to test for antibodies to specific allergens.  Normal negative results indicate that you probably do not have a \u201ctrue allergy\u201d; however, the results of the RAST must always be interpreted and used with caution and the advice of your doctor. Even if your RAST test is negative, there is still a small chance that you do have an allergy.  Note that food allergy is an abnormal response that is triggered by the immune system. It is highly likely that you may have food intolerance, which is more common than food allergy. The immune system does not cause food intolerance even though the symptoms may be similar to the symptoms found with allergies.  There can be many types of food intolerance. However, the most common are intolerance to:  Lactose (cow\u2019s milk and other dairy products) Tyrosine Preservatives  Artificial colors Tomato Gluten Corn Nuts Eggs Seafood Wheat Flour Chocolate  There is no reliable blood test or skin test that can confirm food intolerance. If you do have food intolerance, remember that it is very unpleasant but rarely dangerous.  You can immediately begin reading food labels and avoid the following: Artificial sweeteners, MSG, Hydrogenated oils or \u201ctrans fat\u201d, Sodium Nitrite, Sulfites or genetically modified foods. Also, eat fresh organic foods in place of processed foods.  Remember, to consult with your physician and/or dietician regarding the results of your food diary.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply.    I actually already did keep a food diary, which is how the random foods were identified for testing.  I have not been eating the foods now for two weeks, but still seem to have some of the same symptoms.  I am keeping another diary.   Do you know anything about the \"levels\" on the tests and how likely a true allery exists based on those??  Also, what about the negative skin testing I've had?  Is it abnormal/strange to have negative skin testing and then have positive food testing?  Which should I rely on?    It's just difficult to know how to eat with these weird random symptoms and several negative tests, but now one positive set of tests.  Being pregnant also makes it that much more concerning.  Does pregnancy ever cause weird allergy type problems?  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey I'm female, 29, and I'm worrying about this dilemma I haveI went to the doctor I have been sick for a few years now catching alot of infections from kidneys to flus to Bronchitis infections, I have some kind of infection every month, this year has been the worst ever!   I've spent most of the year fatigued and really feeling out of sorts. I went to the Doctor last September when I first felt sick I had a really bad flu and I started to break out in rashes like hives. Since then I have been getting hives and taking anti-histomines prescribed by my Doctor. I had a blood test in February in hospital I had to go in I got really bad pains in my chest and numbness in my arm I found it really sore to breath but I got all checks done and they said my heart was fine and my 6 blood tests were clear.   I had my blood tests done agian 4 weeks ago and it came back with low Iron levels around 11.3 the nurse said it wasn't by much and I had high Cholesterlo at 5.1 I'm 29 and slender she also said this wasn't to worry about. After that test I got another blood test to test me for vitamin B12 deficiency and folic acid and coeliac test. After 2 weeks, today I got the results back that my vitamin b12 was normal and the coeliac test was under 12. The nurse asked the doctor and he told me to come back again in 3 months for another blood test.   I'm very frustrated as she gave me no information what to do. Do I stop eating gluten free products for the 3 months or do I keep eating as normal until then. I'd really appreciate advise on this. They are not forthcoming with information and I don't understand what's normal and what says I'm Coeliac. I've been suffering also with constipation for around two years and I am attending the hopital next month for a colonoscopy. I also have been suffering with haemoroids with blood every so often but not much and can be sore.   I hope this makes sense!!  I'm from Ireland and live in Ireland are the screening tests different is under 12 bad? I would just like to know if I am coeliac or what's wrong with me.  Can anyone help on this?   History and medications. I have an uncle that was coeliac when he was a child but he's in his 40's now and eats what he likes. I don't know of anyone else in the family they haven't been diagnosed if they have it. My current medications are: Xyzal antihistamine Movical for constipation Yasmin the pill I also have haemoroid cream. I'm allergic to penicillin and ceffalosporins. I also broke my left ankle in 1998 I have plates in it now. I had a cystosocopy last June 2006 results were clear.  I had an allergy test done by an allergist and yeast came up. She used bottles with liquid in them and I had to hold them in my hand.I'm sorry I don't know the name of the test.\n\n",

What you're describing is very very consistent with Anxiety and/or panic disorder.  I've had the same symptoms and at first I was told that its a caffeine allergy. I stopped drinking  coffee, tea, green tea and coke for months and the \"symptoms\" persisted.  Check with you GP the symptoms of anxiety and see if they match. I am pretty sure that since your physical tests were perfect then they must be psychological.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is not recommended that you take these two drugs together unless your doctor deems benefits to outweigh risks and monitors you very closely during a short-term period.  It should not be undertaken casually because of the similarity of action between the drugs and what could amount to an exacerbation of negative side effects.  Also, you should be getting some of the same results with the Wellbutrin that you would get from the phentermine so it is considered  Other weight loss efforts would be recommended.  You might do better with another type of weight loss drug such as sibutramine (Meridia), but it is important for you to discuss anything like this with your doctor since therapeutic duplication would be going on.  Wellbutrin SR itself has been shown to decrease appetite in many people, so adding another would not necessarily improve your situation.  A good eating and exercise program is essential for long-term success in weight loss.  It sounds like you are doing well in that way.  Weight Watchers and other programs have a proven success record but they require diligence over the long term.  Medication treatment typically only lasts for the duration of the treatment, which is not intended to be long-term, and rebound weight gain is the most likely result.  If you can meet with a dietician to create a good program and possibly join a gym with trainers to advise you, your goals can be met and you will be more likely to sustain the healthy changes.  Good luck.\n\n",

Any ideas?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ice cream intolerant",
    "content": "Hi, Commercial ice cream is prepared from a number of ingrediants such as   - butterfat,  - nonfat milk solids, - flavoring agents.  - stabilizers,& - sugar  Butterfat imparts its creamy flavor and texture. Butterfat gives ice cream its creamy consistency and texture. The nonfat milk solids make it smooth. Sugar and assorted flavoring agents provide sweetness and add to the ultimate taste. The stabilizers (gum /gelatin) , give the blend a smooth texture by preventing larger ice crystals  forming during the freezing.   Natural flavorings (whole/chopped fruits or nuts), may be added to add variety to texture.Some nuts (esp; the tree nuts such as wall nut, cashew nut) may be contaminated by a fungus(aspergillus spp).  Some icecreams may contain unknown ingredients which may be trade secrets.  Thus, if one is allergic to icecream, it could be allergy to any of the ingredients mentioned above. Best wishes!\n\n",

I have not changed anything in my diet or lifestyle.  I drink a lot of water. I have been having a horrible time with bloating which I have started to take some probiotics and simethicone with no effectiveness. I had been extremely tired in the last few weeks and have been sleeping alarming amounts of time.  I have been going to bed around 10 or 11pm at night and waking up in the afternoon!  My doctor checked my TSH, Iron, and RBC counts which were all normal.  I also had a pregnancy test that was negative.  I also recently had a normal menstrual cycle.  I have been starting to become really down about my weight gain and frustrated.  I have been on Zoloft for a few years now which has seemed to help with my situational depression.  I do not snore, gasp, or stop breathing during sleep.  I don't know what else to test or be looking for.  Any advice?\n\n",

I also have a dessert which is usually 1000 calories. I eat these high calorie foods as my active lifestyle requires it, although I am aware it would probably be healthier to eat more starchy carbs instead-but I love sweet stuff!

It is impossible to say which person will have long-term damage and which can use without it doing any noticeable harm.

I appeared fatter, much noticeably around the face, but I wasn't actually putting on any weight.  I've now been sober for over 15 months.  However, the fatty deposits remain.  This is true even if I lose weight - I'm now 40 pounds lighter than my usual weight pre-alcoholism, but my face appears fatter.  What's going on?  Are the changes that alcohol caused in my body composition permanent?  What can I do?  Thanks a lot, Curtis\n\n",

    "title": "\"Legal\" Testosterone Boosters....Safe?",
    "content": "Hello Doctors lounge,   I am a body builder/ strength athlete who trains many times a week. I am no stranger to \"legal\" supplements and testosterone boosters. I have never taken what you would call prohormones (and never will). I took a 30 day cycle of Novodex XT one year ago and have not cycled anything sense. I believe my question lies in the gray area of this \"legal\" topic.   GNC and every online supplement store has some kind of \"next best thing\" product so to speak. I recently came upon one stack that really caught my attention, especially the warning of possible kidney and live damage on the container. The stack was M1-BOL and 17-BOL by a company named Fizogen. I will post the link right here: http://www.supplementcentral.com/fizoge ... 200-caplet  This has the ingredient list and so on. My question and doubts play out in the sense that I could buy these products (for example probalin) at a local GNC and have to cycle on and off the pills and watch organ function, are these products safe? I believe I know the answer to my own question, it is however tempting to think I could buy an \"anabolic compound\" deemed \"legal\". Can we really know it its safe? Would I be harming my body or putting my future health at risk by cycling these products? Is there anything specific in the ingredients of the aforementioned M1-BOL that are red flagged as dangerous?  The only people I would trust this question with would be doctors as of course my health is their first priority, not my pocket book.\n\n",

    "title": "i hate eating.",
    "content": "I don't know, just from the title it may sound weird, but it's true, I hate eating.  I do eat, but I have a passionate hatred towards it. I refuse to eat if I'm depressed or overly stressed out, and last year I only ate on the weekends, maybe had a cracker during the week, but that was it. I don't know exactly why that is, I think maybe there's a reason for it, but I have no idea what it could be. I researched about different eating disorders, but I don't really fall into any of the ones I read about like anorexia or bulemia or binge eating. I especially hate eating in public or when people are around, I don't even know why that is, and lately it's been getting worse that I don't want to eat in front of my family (obviously, I live with my family). Things at home have been going terribly for the past month, so maybe it's because I'm depressed that I don't want to eat in front of them?? But what stumps me is that even the word \"eat\" or \"food\" makes my stomach turn (not literally, but it just makes me hate food even more) I don't even know how to explain it. I have an extremely long health history which includes Neuroblastoma cancer, twice, so I did have about eight different kinds of chemotherapy that have messed me up in numerous different ways, but this isn't really \"normal\" for me- per se, and I don't think that any of my treatment would be causing this. About four years ago I had no problem, but since then I just don't. Nothing really happened four years ago, just depression, but it wasn't related to weight or anything really. When I actually do eat though it's always very healthy (I'm a vegetarian), but still I don't even like eating healthy food even though I know it's healthy and won't cause me to gain weight. I do have a bit of a self-conscious weight issue, but I don't know, I don't really believe that could be the cause my dislike towards food.  Anyways, I rambled, what could it be? What do I do?\n\n",

When you say that you do not like to eat in front of your family or others, it really sounds a little like a true eating disorder.   Ok, now I must ask if you are depressed most of the time?  Are you having feelings of anxiety and sadness which is interfering with your life and relationships?  I know that depression can cause a loss of appetite.   Please do not go on this way without attention from a doctor in person.  You could have some long term damage done with the malnutrition issues. Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

I don't think that I'm really fat, but I don't think I'm skinny either. I accept it for the most part. I'm more concerned about my leg and hip that are different because of the cancer. I have been diagnosed with depression, I take Cymbalta daily. 30 mg. I was first on 60 mg., but I felt really blank, like I couldn't really laugh or smile or show much emotion, so we kicked it down to 30 mg and that's a lot better. I was off of it for about a week (my mother wanted to try to get me off of it) and I turned into a complete wreck, so I've been back on it for the past week so emotionally I feel a little better, but I'm still unable to eat. I just feel constantly nauseated and even the thought of food still makes me feel sick. I don't know why it is. I don't know what other possibilites it could be other than eating disorders- which I really feel that it's not that.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Natural breast enhancement",
    "content": "Hello, There are no known, proven breast enhancers aside from surgical implantation.  Fenugreek is a supplement commonly used to increase milk production in a lactating woman but I have heard no evidence that it enhances breast size aside from that possibility with the increasing amounts of milk the woman makes.    Most products touted as \"natural breast enhancers\" whether pills, creams, lotions or potions are scam attempts.    Overall weight gain efforts you can do would be to improve your intake of healthy foods and good fats (avocado, olive oil, fatty fish).  You don't want to damage your health by adding lots of unhealthy calories, refined sugars and saturated or hydrogenated/trans fats.  You could add some more dairy to your diet - ice cream, puddings, cheese can add to your calcium and bone health while adding calories.  Whole grains are healthier for adding carbohydrate calories.  You may want to meet with a nutritionist for a diet program that would be healthy and allow you optimal weight gain in a healthy way.    It is important for you to become comfortable with your body.  Larger breast size may be desirable to some people, but being small has some advantages too.  You might also be surprised to learn that, contrary to media hype, many men find small breasts very attractive.  So much of this is genetic, there is not much to change it.  But, when the time comes to breastfeed a baby, the size will increase naturally and the benefits and enjoyment that comes from this act will more than compensate one day.  If you choose to do surgical enhancement, you could interfere with this natural and amazing opportunity so think seriously before you make such a decision.  Some women are successful even after surgery but sometimes this is compromised.  Breast feeding is a wonderful experience worth protecting.  Best wishes.\n\n",

One concern would be that you are monitoring your weight due to your loss of appetite. If this is a concern for you, maybe you would benefit by seeing your doctor. There are types of relaxation techniques that may help with the anxiety and panic attacks, and if all else fails, maybe you would consider a medication to help relieve the anxiety. I would not recommend you to suffer from this event. you need to take care of yourself, and maybe you will only need something to get you through this period in your life.  Losing your grandmother may have stimulated more issues. I would definetaly get some help. Good luck to you...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello First of all, I hope you are able in such a case to share your mistake with someone to correct it in the patient chart.  Everyone makes mistakes at times and the chances of correcting any problem is much greater if you catch it early.  It would mostly depend on how much the scale was off and what kind of condition the patient had.  If it is something where close monitoring of fluid retention is indicated there would likely be daily weights taken and the pattern would be more significant than the single unusual number.  That would most likely stick out as a fluke or error (and as I said, there isn't a nurse out there who has never made one).    Many conditions would not be affected at all but some medications may be calculated based on weight and again, it would depend on how much difference there was and what medication, but most adult doses are similar and would be prescribed on the adult dose vs the size ratio.    Try not to be too hard on yourself.  This is not likely any kind of life and death matter.  Learn from the mistake and help others to learn by sharing.  If it happens to you it can happen to others.  So, if you see a process in the hospital that appears to be a likely cause of future errors, bring it to the attention of supervisors or hospital quality assurance committees.  Nobody wants to make an error that would cause harm to the patient he or she is trying to help.    I hope this helps.  Good luck with your future.\n\n",

Don't assume that his age would automatically preclude his abilities.    In addition, I would recommend seeing a dietician, like a diabetic patient would.  Insurance doesn't usually cover this but it would be money well-spent.  There are reputable weight loss programs out there.  Weight Watchers is one example.    Our sedentary lifestyle has definitely contributed to this universal problem so finding as many ways as possible to get more active can help.  In days past we were likely to be doing physical, manual labor (both men and women).  Now we are more apt to labor mentally and this is disaster for the body.  Thus, we need to get out and plan exercise rather than having it come as a side effect of the work we do otherwise.  This of course means extra time in an already overtaxed schedule.  It is a matter of priorities.  At some point we need to take responsibility for the condition and do something about it.  Maybe multiple channels would help - add a sports activity (hit a tennis ball, swim, ride a bike), take a daily walk either on a lunch hour or before/after work.  A brisk 30 minute walk can do a lot of good, especially in conjunction with other activities and exercise.  Then maybe consider taking a weekly class - Yoga, aerobics, water aerobics, dancing, skating, etc.   Sit on an exercise ball at your desk.  Vary your routine and find something that really interests you so you won't lose interest.  The bottom line is, the acai berry or other supplements will do little if anything if you don't alter your diet and activity.  As for interactions, it is hard to advise since the FDA does not regulate supplements.  They vary greatly in amount of ingredient used, active and inert, and they are not tested as other drugs are.  Without such scientific testing we don't always know what potential interactions might exist.  I would recommend asking your pharmacist for detailed printouts of the medications you are taking to see if any of them indicate a concern with herbal products.  As I said though, this may not show up because of the loose regulation of these items.  Good luck and congratulations on your desire to get control or your weight and health.  It is true that slow, steady progress will ultimately pay off so patience is a virtue here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Premature Aging Please Help",
    "content": "Hello,  First let me assure you that graying and thinning hair does not mean your body is aging faster than it should and it would not be considered premature aging.  It is a skin/hair/follicle/hormone condition with strong hereditary causes.  Other bodily functions normally affected by the aging process will not accompany this premature hair condition.    There are some health problems that can cause hair loss such as thyroid disorders, vitamin B12 deficiencies, poor nutrition, anemia, and other hormone problems, so a good physical exam with lab work would be recommended to rule out such things.  There are treatments that can help slow the hair loss even in the absence of a health condition, such as Finasteride (Propecia) and Minoxidil (Rogaine).  These don't work in every case but they do help some.  The process can often be slowed if it is started early enough so you should not hesitate to see your doctor - ideally a dermatologist.    Stress hormones can also contribute to hair graying as well as hair loss so consider your mental state as well as your physical health.  Genetics is a funny thing - you can get genes for traits that make you different from your parents.  You may have had a grandparent with similar characteristics.  Many men at least have spots of baldness in their 20s and the pattern of the parents often follows but not necessarily.  You get 2 pairs of every gene (one from each parent) You would have gotten it from your mother, because it travels on the X chromosome (supplied by the mother) and you get only one X chromosome.  If your mother happened to have inherited the gene for baldness, you could also have it with no dominant gene to overcome it (because you only have one X).  I hope this simplified explanation makes sense.  Whatever you do, don't be fooled by commercial websites and advertisements for products that are not approved by the FDA but that promise magic cures.  The American Hair Loss Association only recommends a few methods and as much as they would like to find a product that could prevent the heartache that comes to people who suffer from this disease, they have not endorsed any others besides those mentioned above along with some surgical treatments.    There may be some safe herbal remedies but these should not make extravagant claims or cost exorbitant amounts of money.  The \"snake oils\" on the other hand, likely will do both.  I know it is disheartening to think the you may look older than your years but many young men's  prematurely white hair becomes a symbol and is very attractive.  Examples include Bill Clinton, Steve Martin and Phil Donahue.  According to US magazine, many celebrities are almost totally gray.  As an old TV commercial says, \"only their hairdresser knows for sure.\"  If it is too distressing to go naturally gray, in spite of the \"distinguished\" look that often goes with it, you can do as women have for years - dye it.  Start with a color just a shade lighter than your natural and use only semi-permanent color.  Short hair almost always looks better for gray hair.  You might invest in a trip to a good stylist/colorist to advise you before you jump into something that might make you want to put on a hat.  The truth is, early graying is a bit trendy now so if you find it's just the luck of the draw, you may want to wear it with pride.\n\n",

Lost 5 lbs last August on WW.  I am retaining water as well.  My doctor tested me for thyroid issues and then just said that was all she could think of.  I know my diet is a good one - about 1200 cals a day, low fat - lots of fruit, whole grain (brown rice, etc), snacks are nuts, dark chocolate etc.  I have not lost one pound since starting my diet 3 months ago.  I have also done a 2 week colon cleanse (nothing crazy just a slow natural one) and tried 2 weeks of water pills (Ok'd by my doc).  Nothing....  I'm very concerned that something is wrong with me - glucose normal, a little high, other blood tests OK except a slightly elevated bilrubin which doc said is OK.  What type of doctor or test should I be asking for?  Someone recommended an abdominal scan - perhaps liver/kidney issues?  My stomach is very bloated, usually not like this.  No real digestion issues - bowel movements normal, regular.  I really feel that something is going on and don't want to just be told to keep dieting, etc. I want to rule out any other issues.  I would so appreciate any assistance - ideas - etc.  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Physically thyroid is the most likely culprit.  If that is normal, you really do have little control here except to continue to stay the course.  Sometimes we reach a plateau but if we stay with the program, eventually we break through.  Try to be patient during this time.  Your metabolism may be trying to keep you at a comfortable weight your body is used to.  I would recommend a high protein/low carb diet to see if such an alteration helps.  Increasing your physical activity is also good, even though you are making good progress on that end right now.    Since your doctor has checked your thyroid it seems unlikely it is a physical problem.  Perhaps seeing a counselor will help you to deal with your difficulties and meeting with a dietician might be helpful as well.  Sometimes we consume hidden calories that add weight faster than we can lose it so being strict with a food journal can help you to analyze  your intake and evaluate it better.  Your goals are commendable for helping you to become healthier.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not recommend steroids because of the potential for serious negative side effects that go along with them.  Many different body organs can be affected and permanent damage can occur.  Much of our metabolism is due to genetics and there is little that can be done to overcome your natural body makeup.  Just as some people find it almost impossible to lose weight; others are challenged by the opposite problem which can actually be more difficult to change.    I would recommend continuing good overall nutrition.  Be sure to take a good vitamin and mineral combination along with perhaps protein supplements containing certain amino acid combinations such as creatnine and glutamine.  If you haven't had a complete physical exam recently it is always a good idea to be sure there is no underlying problem that is causing the problem.  Chances are there is no problem other than your own body type but any progress you make will be slow so patience is important.  You cannot expect fast results.  Try weight lifting to help build muscle mass and stay with the program.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: underweight breastfeeding",
    "content": "Hello, Fortunately even underweight women can successfully breastfeed without harming the baby.  Everyone's metabolic rate is unique to them and you obviously burn calories easily.  Breast feeding does take some of those calories - around 500/day.  The important thing is that you are eating a healthy diet and meeting your requirement for calories and nutrients; not whether or not your weight is average.  It has been shown that even women who are in starvation can feed their infants.  Their own nutritional status may result in some bone loss and a loss of any fat stores, but the baby usually does fine.  It's one of those miracles of motherhood.    As long as you are making good food choices, I would not worry about what the scale says and recognize this is your body and the way it responds to energy input and exertion.  Of course it is wise to monitor your baby for weight gain and around six months you can add some solids to your baby's diet with cereal, then vegetables and fruit.  Continuing to breastfeed is recommended and will help your baby to be healthy in ways no formula can imitate.  Congratulations on your desire to give your baby the best.  Take care and good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to do this though evidence shows a slower, steady weight loss is more prone to be long-lasting.  If  you were to have weight loss surgery you could lose 1.5 - 2 lbs. per day and still be healthy but your body would be in a state of controlled starvation so when undertaking such a drastic effort you should definitely take a multivitamin and eat the right kinds of foods with extra protein; not just starve yourself to death which sometimes results in rebound weight gain as your body adjusts to the extreme cut in calories.  Your body conserves, detecting starvation.    If you do this under medical supervision there is a good chance you can do it without harm to  yourself.  It is a hard goal you are setting for yourself however.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello steponmi,  When in the wheelchair, does your aunt \"walk\" using her feet to get around?  If she does, she's getting adequate exercise of her lower extremities.  If she doesn't, then first ask her why she doesn't like to walk.  Does she have a cane or walker? Does she feel dizzy or unsteady?  Does it cause pain anywhere?  Does she figure that at 102, she can pretty much decide how much activity she wants?  See if she'll exercise in her wheelchair, by moving her legs by doing heel/toe heel/toe pedaling with her feet.  Will she kick a ball?  Before she gets out of bed, you could assist her in doing strengthening exercises, as pushing against your hand with each foot, while you put pressure against it.  She could do kicks while lying on her back.  If she simply will not cooperate with your ideas, there's really not much you can do about it, and perhaps not much you SHOULD do about it.  She knows best how she feels.  Good luck to both of you.  I hope she is able to see the benefits of exercise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  Anorexia is a complex problem which involves physical, psychological, and spiritual factors.    Certainly, the stomach cramping with diarrhea could be from a viral gastrointestinal bug which should resolve within seven days.  Maintaining hydration is important.  And watch for fever which may indicate infectious diarrhea.  Also, with the anorexia/bulimia, consider the amount of food she is taking in.  With decreased food intake or forced vomiting, the stomach and intestines may spasm.  And of course laxative abuse is common and can cause GI symptoms.   Another consideration is her menustrual cycle - which can cause abdominal cramping.  However, if she is very thin, she may have stopped menstruating.  A multidisciplinary team is important and should include family practice physician, gastroenterologist, dietician, and counselor.  Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is well known that excess weight can cause long-term health problems.  A BMI of 31 is not a good place to be.  There are many areas you may now be healthy, as evidenced by the blood work and blood pressure, but you are at risk for types of cancer, diabetes, pregnancy complications and future high blood pressure or cholesterol that can cause eventual damage.    I would recommend seeing a nutritionist or joining an organization to help you achieve some healthy weight loss goals.  Best wishes and good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 42 year male with HB ranging from 52 to 63, BP 140/88, ideal BMI and high Cholesterol level (high LDL).  When I was younger I used to cycle, swim and ski a lot. I was also doing some body building. For the past 10 years I have significantly reduced physical activities due to lots of obligations. Ever since, I have experienced occasional chest pain on the left side especially after long exposure to physical activities similar to wood logging.  Recently I saw a cardiologist who told me that I have well conditioned heart and that I should not worry about. He gave the following  Diagnosis: Neuralgia intercostalis in obs, Dyslipoproteinemia IIa by Frederiksen Cor comp.  Therapy: Sortis (atorvastatinum) 20 mg for 1 month and a cholesterol free diet.  I am looking for a second opinion since the chest pain is persistent.  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The FDA has been warning against the use of Ephedra for weight loss since 2003.   They can cause serious health concerns, especially in combination with vigorous exercise and/or in combination with other stimulants such as caffeine.    I understand you are frustrated, but there is no magic pill, potion or powder proven to be effective, especially in the absence of a low calorie, high energy-output eating and exercise plan.  There are some aids that may help to a limited degree but they are not going to do the job for you and the results will probably be disappointing if you are expecting miracles.   Phentermine works for some people but is intended for short-term use only.  Some SSRI antidepressants also cause a decreased appetite for some people.  You should discuss your concerns with your health care provider.  There is also a medication called Meridia (sibutramine) that helps and is available by prescription.  It sometimes raises blood pressure so you may not be a candidate if yours is elevated.  This medication is thought to affect your body as an appetite suppressant.  It should not be taken with other SSRI antibiotics since it works on neurotransmitters like they do.  Alli (Orlistat) inhibits the absorption of fat in the intestines.  You should limit your fat consumption to avoid unpleasant side effects (diarrhea).  It is available without prescription but is sanctioned by the FDA as safe.  There are also medically supervised mostly liquid diets that work for many people who need rapid weight loss.  Otherwise the tried and true methods such as Weight Watchers are about the best.    Whatever plan you choose, it can't hurt to take a multivitamin to help supplement your nutrition.  Good luck and congratulations on your desire to improve your health.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I usually buy kitchen sponges as these have the best texture. I could eat one of these in about a day and a half and occasionally even ate the rough bit on top of the sponge. I stopped about 5 days ago but i have been finding it so difficult. It is almost like an addiction and i am really really craving them. I have looked into pica but cannot find an answer on how dangerous it might be to eat sponge. I know that they cannot be digested. Oh also, I am not pregnant.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pica should always be evaluated by a doctor.  Sometimes people manifest nutritional deficiencies in this way, even though the craved item has nothing to do with the nutrition.  It seems our brain can't tell what is lacking.  If labs check out normal, you should see a psychiatrist since eating anything that is not actually food or supplements approved by the FDA or  other nutritional watchdog agencies, is potentially very harmful.  I can't say about the sponge itself, but you should not eat anything that is not intended for human consumption.  Therapy can help.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I really am stumped over this one, and it's tearing me up. I've been gaining weight since the end of January, about 10 lbs so far. I'm 5' and 126 lbs as of this morning. I normally weight 115-117 lbs. To add to this, I've had an enormous increase in appetite, esp in the past four weeks or so. I've been hungry pretty much constantly, and when I eat it rarely fills me up, and when it does only for an hour or two at most. Someone suggested I eat more, but given that I'm eating about the same (or more) amount I was 3 months ago, I don't know why I should, especially considering the weight gain. I laid off excercise for the past month, but could not get my appetite under control and was gaining weight still. This wasn't working so I've been hitting the gym/jogging this week, three times so far.  The base of my diet is typically a bagel+cream cheese or an energy bar for breakfast w/ OJ. Lunch is sandwiches- turkery or PBJ. Dinners are spaghetti,chicken, or bean burgers mostly. Obviously I eat more than that in a given day- I also eat lots of fruits, snack on nuts, eat my veggies, and stick to whole grains. I probably eat fruits all the time in hopes to fill myself up. I've eaten a lb of pineapple in a sitting and still felt famished. I can't believe how much I will eat now! I'm so unbelievably hungry (compared to my base line). I don't know how much calories this equals but I've ballparked 1600-1800 depending on the day. Maybe it's less or more, I don't really count calories.  My only medication is TriNessa (birth control). I've been or birth control for a couple years, and I think I've been on TriNessa since late last year. (No partner so pregnancy is definitely not on the table!)  I really need advice on how to stop this excessive hunger- either diet suggestions or possible causes outside of food consumption- and weight gain. It may not seem like a lot of weight to some people, but I've always been proud to be fit and healthy. Right now I can't fit into jeans I've been wearing for years and I'm feeling more depressed about it every day that goes by and my body feels out of control.   Sorry for the lengthy post, but I'm very frustrated and wanted to leave no detail un-discussed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have not indicated what your BMI is and whether or not your weight loss goals are realistic or idealistic.  Sometimes the body tries to reach equilibrium and needs more weight to sustain health, prepare the body for reproduction and other normal physiological processes.  We may want to be thinner than what our bodies need to be in order to be healthy so we can be fighting a losing battle to lose too much weight.  Of course I don't know if this is the situation with you but without more information, I realize it is possible.    I would have a physical exam with a doctor to determine what your weight loss ideal goals should be.  A dietitian could also advise you on that.  If your mental image of yourself is unrealistic, you may need to talk with a therapist about your body image perception.    Aside from the body's natural efforts to gain weight for health, if it seems you are truly becoming overweight by BMI, you should find out through the physical exam if there are issues with your thyroid.  Underactive thyroid gland can result in weight gain.  Eating healthy food, as you are doing, and avoiding junk food with empty calories is your smartest effort.  Congratulations on your physical activity.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, I\u2019ll give some background info.  I\u2019ve battled my weight since I was about 16.  When I was younger, I used to ride my bike & run A LOT.  Over the years I have always used dexatrim because my appetite always seemed to be so out of control.  Now that it\u2019s off the market, I went to the extreme of getting phentermine online (my regular physician does NOT know).  I did this for three years & it worked wonderfully until my tolerance built up so much I would have to take four at a time\u2026at that point I could not afford it anymore & realized that it had become a problem for me.  So, during those years, I wouldn\u2019t eat all day (because I wasn\u2019t hungry) but I always ate at night.  I\u2019ve been dieting and exercising for the last 2 years with no results and a steady climb in my weight.  At that point, I decided I wanted to do it the right way and not rely on pills, etc.  I\u2019m wondering if my metabolism is completely shot?  I\u2019m 32 years old so I know that a female\u2019s metabolism decreases as we age.  I\u2019ve totally overhauled my diet over the last three years, switching out white bread for wheat breads, eating tons of fruits and veggies, etc., etc.  My thyroid was check last year and everything was fine.  I know my body is VERY SENSITIVE to anything that I do, medicines, exercise (my body adapts VERY fast).  Walking (2 years, 2 times a day) did not do anything for me so in December I started running (20-60 min at least 3 days per week) & working out with the gym equipment for about an hour 3 times per week.  Although it\u2019s only been 3 months, my appetite is out of control, I\u2019ve gained weight & my clothes are fitting even tighter.  Help!!!!  What can I do?  I cannot afford to just accept this and buy a whole new wardrobe, in addition to the fact that now I\u2019m crossing the threshold of being considered \u201cobese\u201d by all the charts I look at.  I also journal what i eat.  The website I use tells me that for my height (5'3) and weight (145) i need only eat 990 calories per day to lose 2 pouds per week.  Am i eating too little and sending myself in starvation mode?  At this point, i am just afraid of food.  I know if I drastically restrict my calories, i will lose.  BUT i desperatly want to do it right this time & be in the best shape of my life & not have to worry about food on a daily basis. Do I just need to wait it out longer & keep doing what I\u2019m doing.  Can you repair a broken metabolism?  I worry that I\u2019ve done irreparable damage by yo-yo dieting and especially the phentermine for 3 years.  I'm very frustrated...maybe some understanding could help me be a little more hopeful & patient.   thank you for any help you can give me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can you permanently damage your metabolism?",
    "content": "Hi there --  There are a number of things which concern me in your post, not the least of which is the prior  phentermine use, and hope you will inform your doctor of this, perhaps as a \"confessional.\" Your doctor isn't there to judge you,  but to take care of you, and it's important that this information be entered into your medical record. While it (and the other things you've done) won't damage -- or permanently alter your metabolism, phentermine can damage other things. It doesn't sound like it has, but if there were some future problem and no one  knew about your having used it -- to excess for a while,too -- that could be a major clue lost. So think about that,  please.   Now then, the next concern: your height vs. weight: this sounds almost good! According to BMI calculations it is just at the bottom end of \"overweight\" and  nowhere near \"obesity.\" Nowhere.   You've gone into a crash program intending to lose weight, and you're doing everything right. One of the problems often encountered with this however, at least if done right (as you're doing it) is weight gain early on, due to increased muscle mass. Sometimes this can't be readily overcome, depending on the basic body phenotype you happen to have. At this point, other than the fit of your clothes and what that might cost to accomodate, you really don't need to be overly concerned about your weight. The fact that you seem to be concerns me a great deal,  because as a society we are plagued by a media inundation of skinny-worship.  You sound very healthy and the height-weight ratio, while it could stand some very minor tweaking (very minor) sounds very attractive, actually, so beware of body dysmorphia, the delusion that one is \"obese\" when in fact everything is just fine (or so close no one could estimate by eyeball alone).   The caloric intake you're considering is pretty minimal, but if -- if! -- it doesn't cause you to feel tired, overly hungry, or fatigued, then it should provide the minimum necessary nutrition. But if you're not enjoying life -- including eating -- and have no true obesity problem, then I hope you'll consider that while the metabolism can be altered through diet and exercise -- among other things -- it does take time, and again, you have to always consider which body phenotype you were born with and just maintain it in good condition while making sure you don't drive yourself crazy trying to meet some artificial \"standard.\" I have to repeat this: you are not currently anywhere near obese. If you were to lose a mere 10 lbs you would be well within the BMI \"normal\" range. Two pounds per week is also an ambitious goal for someone who is as petite as you are. Not terrible, but a lot to expect, especially if you happen to be an endomorph or mesomorph (two of the more \"squared off\" body types; the third is ectomorph, which would likely be taller, with longer long bones and naturally more willowy). You probably have a gymnast's body by nature, and that you can't change -- nor should you want to.   I hope I've been able to help you some with all this. It's a lot to take in, I know,and the pressure to be \"skinny\" verges sometimes on the pathological. It's one of our society's biggest ills. Give yourself a little time and hopefully the small amount you need to lose to be totally Within Normal Limits will also allow your wardrobe to stay where it is. But for goodness' sake, don't let that be your guide. You sound like a very healthy, attractive young woman. I hope you'll continue to take good care of yourself and again, please think about telling your doctor, just for the record, that you did use phentermine for a while. I think you dodged the bullet with that, as you probably couldn't do the exercise program you do now otherwise,  but it still should be in the record. Other than that it sounds like you're doing wonderfully. Keep up the good work and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kosh33,  Being infected with Hepatitis C would not, in itself, be a contraindication to fasting.  If, however, there was significant damage to the liver to the point where it were failing (end stage liver disease), this could be a contraindication to fasting since the liver helps maintain blood sugar levels.  It is very unlikely that fasting will affect your viral load, though.  A five day fast can have significant health effects so I would not recommend you doing this without consulting with your physician first to be sure it is OK for you.  Regarding the sugar, the main issue here is weight gain.  It is best to have a balanced, healthy diet but having preserves is not necessarily a bad thing as long as there is enough other foods to keep your diet in balance.  I am also not aware of any contraindication to eating carrots.  If one eats too many carrots, though, the carotene in them can deposit in the skin turning the person an orangish color.  Reducing the carrot intake will result in reversal of the coloration.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not expect these results with birth control pills, even the weight gain. Some women report a gain but usually it is only around five pounds and there is much debate about whether or not it is caused by the pill itself.    The amount of estrogen in each of these pills is similar enough that I would not expect a problem that way, though switching to a different brand is always one thing to try when you have side effects.    There are genetic conditions that cause high cholesterol even in people who are not at all overweight and who eat healthy food and exercise regularly.  While these measures (losing weight, eating well and exercising) help prevent high cholesterol and triglycerides, in some people there's more to it so you should have this evaluated by your family doctor, internal medicine specialist or other health care provider.  You may need medication to help lower it.    This problem can be caused by medications but it would not be typical with oral contraceptives so you should not have to discontinue their use.

    "content": "Hello, Adolescence itself often brings stretch marks because of the body changes that are occurring with rapid growth, even if you haven't had a marked weight increase.  There is also a genetic factor - some people get these and others do not.    Don't overuse any ointments containing hydrocortisone.  You may find you can disguise them a bit with fake tan and in time they fade.  Maintaining a healthy weight and doing toning will help to prevent excessive stretching of the skin in the future too.  I wouldn't expect much bleeding though so it would be wise to have a physical exam and ask your health care provider about it.    I do not recommend any \"magic\" stretch mark creams - they are costly and mostly ineffective.  It doesn't hurt to moisturize with a rich cream but it needn't be anything specific to stretch marks.

    "content": "Hello,  According to OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration), acute symptoms of cadmium toxicity include flu like symptoms (fever, chills, headache,muscle aches) or respiratory symptoms (cough, shortness of breath, wheezing) and potential progression to pulmonary edema and asphyxia.   Therefore, if you suspect acute exposure to cadmium go to the emergency department.   OSHA also describes that chronic exposure may lead to cancer (lung and prostate), emphysema, osteoporosis, and proteinuria (kidney disease).  OSHA lists the following work areas as potential hazards: repairing gas meter (cadmium dust) repariring aircraft (cadmium dust) shipyard equipment smelting operations handling of certain batteries, paints, and phosphate fertilizers.  Other sources of cadmimium are tobacco and certain foods (cadmium is absorbed into plants eg grains and vegetables through environmental pollution both air and soil).  Women are at higher risk for cadmium toxicity as iron deficiency increases cadmium absorbtion.  The medical literature reports that attempts to chelate (to bind a substance in order to eliminate it from the body) cadmium does not help and may in fact worsen kidney toxicity.  Treatment is mainly supportive ie treating symptoms for acute exposure and monitoring bone, kidney and lungs for chronic disease.  Vitamin D supplements to prevent osteoporosis.  Avoidance of nephrotoxic medicines and treating comorbid disease to protect the kidney and stopping tobacco use.    Lastly, the best intervention is prevention.  Decreasing environmental pollution, decreased use of phosphate fertilizers, proper handling of industrial materials, and for workers in high risk areas - respirators.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Healthy Diet to lower high cholesterol, IBS, Asthma & PCOS",
    "content": ". Hello, One of the best diets readily available would be Weight Watchers.  They have proven success and they prescribe healthy eating habits with a variety of foods.    For cholesterol reduction, you should of course also limit hydrogenated fats (often found in mixes, bakery items, etc), saturated fats (often found in fried foods) fatty meats, animal products such as whole milk and eggs  You should also increase the consumption of foods high in fiber (fruit, vegetables, legumes and whole grains like oats). Good fats such as olive oil, fatty fish, nuts, and avocado help lower cholesterol so these should be included in your diet.  As for IBS, each person is different in the way this interferes with life.  Some people find that specific foods cause a bad reaction; others find it is very unpredictable.  You would be wise to avoid or at least limit caffeine, carbonation, coffee (even decaf), high sugar foods, milk products, gas-producing foods such as beans, broccoli and cabbage, sorbitol and xylitol (certain artificial sweeteners which sometimes aggravate diarrhea).  If you eliminate the common offenders, you can try gradually reintroducing a food to see how you, personally, respond.  Add only one new food/week so you can track the effects without confusing it with other foods.    Eat slowly in a relaxed environment.  Drink plenty of water and get regular exercise which promotes good G.I. function.  Try to reduce stress as well.      I don\u2019t know of any dietary measures for general asthma (unless it is triggered by a food allergy) or PCOS.    Good luck with this\n\n",

I do not have any information on Duromine and can only assume this is a supplement, not regulated by the FDA.  I don't know specifically if this is a problem.  You can also consult with a local pharmacist since there could be other possible interactions not included in this general listing.    On this drug you should also not eat excessive amounts of fat since this will result in diarrhea.  If you eat no fat at a meal, you don't need to take your dose of medication since the action is to interfere with fat absorption.  Your fats should comprise no more than 30% of your caloric intake.  You should take a multivitamin to help compensate for the possible loss of nutrient absorption while taking this medication.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I understand your concern, but NO, that will not help and from a health standpoint this would be a really bad idea to intentionally regain the lost weight.  Even if you lose again, the \"yo-yo\" effect is bad for you.  Skin stretching that occurs with excessive fat causes the tissue to be sometimes permanently changed.  Sometimes surgery is the only correction and at times it is indicated.  As you age, wrinkles are inevitable so try not to stress too much over this.  Your health is much more important than your appearance so you have done a good thing to lose the excess weight.  Even if you can't remove the wrinkles, this is still a much better situation for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My thyroid levels were border-line to begin with and this medicine does not seem to have made much of a difference in terms of my energy, etc.  I have started a new diet and exercise program and would like to take some dietary supplements for energy, etc. My question is, should I worry about these things interacting with my Syntrhoid?

    "content": "Hello, Supplements are not regulated or studied by the FDA so information is limited as to their interaction.  When you know what supplement you will be using you might ask your pharmacist to check for any interactions with Synthroid.  He/she should be able to print a detailed list of things that should not be used with the drug and could explain how serious the interaction might be if the supplement contains any of those.  You can get this list online but you will probably not know how serious the response might be.  You can also discuss it with your prescribing doctor.     If the supplement is mostly vitamins, chances are it will be fine.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I would not expect any damage as a result of using dairy on occasion if you handle it OK.  If you had an allergy to milk, there is always the concern that you could have a serious hypersensitivity reaction so if you notice more than a rash, such as trouble breathing or feeling like your throat is swelling, you should see a doctor right away.

Try to get outside sometimes along with the injections for treatment.  I'm glad you have learned of this need so you can fix it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am so sorry to hear of your loss.  This is a very hard thing for a mom to bear.    Your weight loss efforts are already headed in the right direction since you are going to the gym.  Physical activity is such an important part of any plan you choose.  There are many that could help guide you.  Weight Watchers is a proven successful and healthy eating plan and they are available on the internet now.  There are also other online support systems such as sparkpeople.com.   These sites guide you about what to eat; what to avoid and can help jump start your efforts with ideas.  The bottom line is you need to expend more energy than you take in from calories, so more activity; less food - particularly empty calories (sugar, candy, soda, refined flour, cake, etc.) and high fat foods such as deep fried anything.  I suspect patience is what you need now.  Keep doing as you are and you will likely succeed in time.  A slow and steady course can be longer-lasting than a quick fix from a fad diet.  Vegetables and fiber must be part of the eating plan.   It has also been shown that an adequate intake of water is important.    Good luck in your efforts to achieve good health.\n\n",

Over the last 2 months I have put on 1 stone, and my weight at the moment is 15 st 4 (97kgs).  I am a very sporty person and I take part in vigourous exercise at least 5 days a week for approximately 2 hours a day.  I for the last 3 months have been eating a balanced diet to try and stop myself gaining weight.  If I snack, I will eat an apple or celery or carrot sticks.  I know that muscle weighs more than fat, but I know I havent put on a stone in muscle in the last 2 months.  I was tested for thyroid problems about 6 months after my daughter was born and they came back clear.  I don't know why I am still putting on weight.  Help!!!\n\n",

I would recommend a consultation with a registered dietician to evaluate your food intake and help you devise an eating plan that will allow you to be successful.  I'm glad you have had your thyroid checked to be sure this was not the problem.    In the meantime, don't give up on your exercise program and wise food choices.  Sometimes there is a lag between the efforts and results.  There are basic metabolic factors at play as well and each person is unique but as a rule, energy output exceeding caloric intake results in weight loss when exercise is part of the equation.  Good luck.\n\n",

Number 2, when I was in 3rd grade I was diagnosed as hypoglicemic. However I have never had to test my sugar or take medication. The doctor told my parents as long as I ate when I was hungry I would be fine. I started testing my sugar when I had the sudden weight loss. I would test it as soon as I woke up in the morning and about an hour after every meal. In the morning it was normally around 80, and after meals about 90 or 95.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know of no vitamin or supplement that will help this problem.  Some people do take nutrient drinks or shakes which are basically high in calories - the old energy in vs energy out idea.  The most important thing you could do would be to eat healthy food so the calories you take in also have nutritional value.  Dairy products are good examples - try to eat more ice cream, pudding, milk, cheese and yogurt.  Working out can sometimes help you build body mass as well and this can help your body image immensely.  You may also benefit from a nutrition consult with a registered dietician.  Some psychological support might also be helpful - perhaps even hypnosis.  Try not to dwell too much on your weight but live a healthy and happy life.  Making heatlhy choices will help down the road in other aspects of your life and health.  If you feel you have some tendency towards anorexia it might also be good to get some psychological counseling.  Good luck.\n\n",

Some patients cannot tolerate oats either.  You need to see a doctor about this.  Good luck.\n\n",

Being a backpacker as you can imagine I did not eat very much (always healthy stuff but not a great amount), when I returned to England I got a job in a hotel and still don't eat a lot or regularly because I am too busy at work, I am scared of vomiting at work as it is embarrasing and then by the time I get home its late and all I want to do is relax and go to bed. Problem is I cant seem to eat anything at all without feeling nauseous and bringing it back up. Even eating one banana for example makes me feel so ill. Its bothering me a lot, if don't eat I am not in pain but I have started to feel drained of energy and all I want to do is sleep all the time. (I go to bed as soon as I finish work and don't get up till about an hour before I start). I have gone from a sized 20 to a 14 in 2 years and while this is not a bad thing it has not been done correctly.  I don't want to go to my doctor as I don't really trust him and I cant talk to anyone as they will worry too much and that's not what I want. Please help me, I want to stop feeling so bad.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you have developed some anorexia and it is important to get help.  You probably have been OK so far since you had some extra weight to lose but your body went into starvation mode and you conserve energy and strength when caloric intake is too low.    Your doctor should do a complete physical exam to rule out any underlying endocrine or gastric disorders.  If this is OK, you should see a therapist or psychiatrist who treats eating disorders.  This is confidential so you don't have to discuss it with anyone if you don't want to.   Please see a professional as your electrolytes can be seriously disturbed and your body can fail with resulting serious illness or even death.  Let us know how it goes.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Poor Diet Causing Migraine?",
    "content": "Hello,  This past month I decided to do a digestive cleansing by cutting out all added sugar, fats and most oils. I didn't really feel a noticeable change in my body, maybe just less bloated.   This past weekend, however, my diet became very poor (thanks to Halloween and a wedding!). I pretty much binged on lots of sugary and flour-y junk food. Then on Sunday night I started to feel queasy. It wasn't a severe nauseau, it was more like a kind of car sick feeling. Early that Monday morning, I awoke to a violent migraine, which caused the shakes and nausea.   My migraine subsided after taking some Tylenol and sleeping, but I felt queasy all day. I felt fine when I woke up today, but the queasiness has since come back and is still in and out.   I rarely get migraines- they are very isolated and are usually caused by pms or sinus pressure. I am suffering from neither right now. I also tried to think of what I've been eating and found I have added nothing brand new to my diet. I then thought it may have been dehydration because I drank very few liquids this weekend, but I have been replenishing with plenty of herbal teas and fresh water since yesterday morning.   My question is, could this be related to my sudden drastic change in diet, adding sugar and unhealthy fats, or could it be related to something more serious? I wanted to wait an additional day before visiting with my doctor. Otherwise, I feel fine and do not feel like I've contracted a virus.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you have a sluggish metabolism so it might be worthwhile to  have your thyroid checked.  Many people suffer from hypothyroidism, which is easily treated.  If all checks out normal, it is likely just a matter of input of calories and output of energy.  You are doing a good job with exercise but you may need to actually count calories to be sure you aren't eating more than you think.  I'm sure the Asian choices are much better than the average diet so continue with lots of vegetables and try to stay away from the rice.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Being overweight can contribute to these symptoms but 20 lbs. is not what we would consider obese so it may or may not help with your cycle.  You should be evaluated by your gynecologist who may want to treat you with hormones or if you have PCOS (polycystic ovary syndrome) there are other treatments that can be helpful as well.  A good, reliable, and effective eating plan is Weight Watchers.  This is not new, not faddish, but it really works.  It is a healthy eating plan more than a \"diet\" and many people have been successful using it.  There are other plans of course but this is one of the most readily available that uses normal foods you can prepare yourself.  Their point system makes it easy to calculate when you eat out as well.    Of course exercise is an important part of any weight loss effort, besides being critical for good health overall.  At least try to take a 30 minute walk every day.  Congratulations on your desire to be healthy.  Good luck!\n\n",

There is a medication (Orlistat) which blocks the absorption of fat from the diet causing diarrhea in many people so they still must reduce the fat intake, but even this does not block any body accumulation of fat.  This has more to do with extra calories, lack of exercise to burn it off and genetics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Diet Pills (Alli - Orlistat 60mg capsules)",
    "content": "Hello, The way orlistat works is it blocks absoprtion of fats.  It works best with fewest side effects if you decrease fats from your body.  Because they aren't absorbed they often cause diarrhea as your body gets rid of the undigested fat.  This is the most common side effect.  If you are not willing to reduce fat consumption, you should not expect the pill to do the work for you.  Fats are also involved in gall bladder function.  After eating cholecystokinin release and gallbladder contraction might be decreased, with the possibility of an increased risk of gallstone formation.  So, you could have this problem again but it may be no worse than the risk you already have based on your history of gallstones.  There has not been enough study of this to know for sure.    There is also the possibility it could increase your risk for kidney stones.  You may have to decide for yourself if the risk is worth the benefit.  However, using it in conjunction with following Weight Watchers should not be a problem and will probably be helpful since it is important for you to eat a healthy, well-balanced, low-fat diet. Weight Watchers would accomplish this.  Best wishes and good luck in your goal to lose excess weight.  Don't forget to exercise regularly.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 31 years old, healthy and moderately active.  I have recently been having pain and stiffness that travels from my shoulder to my fingers, back to my shoulder, etc.  I was not sure where to post this in the other forums, so I am hoping someone will be able to help me.  Or if someone could point me in the right direction, that would be appreciated too.    The pain and stiffness I am experiencing is extremely localized to a certain particular joint.  At the moment, on my right hand, it is difficult to straighten/use my thumb due to the stiffness and when I move it the wrong way, it hurts extremely bad.  On the outside, the skin is red and a little inflamed.  I wake up in the morning like that and it generally lasts for two days or so.  The same type of symptoms also happen with different fingers and my shoulders.  I didn't notice any redness in my shoulders though, but sometimes I would have to use my other arm to push my arm up due to the pain I was experiencing.  I physically could have moved it, however, it hurt so much, I would help it along.  It continues to travel around, one day it could be my right shoulder, next couple days it could be one of my fingers.  Then a couple days later my left shoulder and so on.  This has been happening for about a month and a half.  But it seems that when the pain/stiffness goes away in one area, it comes back in another.  When I massage the area (thinking maybe it was a sore muscle), it seems to swell and feel worse/last longer.  Any thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Please know that medical professionals see people of all shapes and sizes.  It may be hard to believe but we truly are able to focus on the body part in need of exam without judging appearance and having inappropriate feelings about it.  It is most important that you have these important health screenings.  Try to see it as part of the healing process, so necessary to getting past the pain you have experienced.  I am glad you are getting help in this area.  Repression of such experiences is common but it is necessary to face the past and work through your feelings in order to go on and be happy in the future.    Try not to focus on what the healthcare provider is thinking about you; but think about how they might be able to help you to have a happier, healthier life.  Talk to your doctor, nurse, etc. about your weight management concerns.  They might be able to help you in that area also.  Obesity is an epidemic and your healthcare team wants to do what is needed to curb this growing problem.  It is not an easy road to travel but you must take care of yourself in all areas.  Let the doctor know you have concerns and that you suffer from PTSD.  They will try to make it as easy as possible if they know what you are worried about.  If you are more comfortable with a woman, that is fine.  There are plenty of good doctors, both male and female, who will treat you with respect and dignity.  Be open and honest with them and allow them to help in any way they can.  Good luck with this.  Many women have had these same struggles.  You are not alone.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't know anything about the diet you describe, but if your calorie intake is low, this will only serve to slow your metabolism down even more.  You said that you have headaches from your diet, so it sounds as if what you are eating is not nutritionally balanced enough to meet your needs.  If it is making you feel bad, and not giving you the result you want, why continue to do it?  I think the suggestion from your doctor that you see a nutritionist is a good one. Diets may help you lose weight initially, but you really need to think about what will work and promote good health over the long-term.  It may be that eating small but nutritionally dense meals frequently will be best in terms of activating your metabolism.  A nutritionist could certainly help you explore how best to get your metabolism going without sacrificing your health.  You also seem really focused on the the numbers on the scale and your BMI.  BMI is a useful tool, but it tends to overestimate fatness in people who have a lot of muscle.  Since you exercise daily I would expect that you probably have a good amount of muscle mass.  It may help you to determine your body fat percentage by a more reliable method, like skinfold measurements.    Also, try to be kind to yourself, and set a goal for better overall health instead of just a number.  You say you would feel great 20 lbs lighter, and while that may be a realistic and attainable goal, you should also feel good about yourself in the body you are in right this minute.  You deserve to feel good about yourself no matter what you weigh, and if you are struggling with this please talk to someone who can help.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi doctor, I have recently moved to another country. However, after a week of arrival I have been suffering from constant mild chills without fever for over a month and I feel especially colder when I sleep at nite, also there is no heater in the house like it used to be. I have never experienced this before. Also my lifestyle has totally changed, I used to workout before but have completly stopped after I moved and also the temperature here is much colder and humid and I used to live in a dry environment. Also the food I eat is different here. A month after I experienced the chills I have a bit of stomache and rash on the back of the neck but is not serious. I don't know if it is caused by stress or is another problem.  I used to be very heatlhy without any medical problems, please help me.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: i get chills after change of lifestyle",
    "content": "Hello -  It would seem to me that your symptoms are a direct result of the changes in both your lifestye and location/living quarters. It is natural for the body to take some time to acclimatize to a new and different environment, so hopefully the cold feeling and chills will slowly resolve. Make certain the ambient temperature in your sleeping area is at least 65 degrees, and if that's uncomfortable perhaps you can increase it a few degrees to near 70, which should, in time, help your body to become used to the change. Also, trying to become active once again will help because your metabolism is increased (and the body remains somewhat warmer) when you have been active for periods of time during the day, especially if you have the opportunity to do some aerobic activity (if only to take walks) and perhaps using some light free weights. This will actually help you not only to remain fit but also keep you warmer at night.  Good luck to you and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21, 5'10, 165lbs and have been for 4 years.  I am on my third round with a personal trainer (different trainer each time with the first two lasting 6 months each and the third is ongoing) and each time I have done everything they have told me to do with little to no success.  I go to the gym and do the workouts they outline for me and I also hit 5000-6000 calories a day right now, eating 5-7 meals a day.  I guess I fit into the category of a hard gainer.  I really am sick of the whole not being able to put on any type of weight.    Which leads into my question.  I am curious to know which of the following supplements are the safest because I have tried everything else without any luck.  I am curious about 4-Androstenediol, 1-androstenediol, 1-androstene-3beta, and 17beta-diol.  I have read up on these prohormones and from what I can tell the 4-AD seems to be the safest of the bunch, but I don't exactly understand all the chemistry when they are explained.  I am pretty sure someone who may answer this will probably say don't take any probably for possible liability reasons, but if that's the case hypothetically which one should I choose??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ddx50,  You're correct that I'll say don't take any of them-but it isn't for liability reasons.  These supplements get converted into hormones in the body and carry all the same risks as taking the hormone directly.  In addition, most of these supplements fall under the \"herbal\" classification and, therefore, are not regulated as tightly as \"medications\" are, even though they exhibit medicine type effects.  We don't really know all the long term effects of taking these medicines and it is very likely that there are side effects beyond what we know.  It is because of these reasons that I recommend avoiding them.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Since my cholesterol level was not that high to start with, I am now trying to avoid statins altogether. One of the cholesterol-lowering agents seems to be good old charcoal.

    "content": "Hello -  While math is not my strong suit, I think you calculated correctly, which of course is just one reason  why the charcoal therapy hasn't exactly taken off. Of course there is the option of charcoal in a colloid suspension which one can drink, but as you can imagine, this is incredibly messy at best. I'd suggest you consider, instead, slow-release niacin as an alternative to statins. The controlled-release type minimizes the flushing effect a great deal and some people have no problem with it at all. There are both over-the-counter and prescription versions of this (and of course the prescription type, while more expensive, is easier to measure results by).  I hope you find a suitable alternative to statins that you can use along with diet and exercise to manage your blood lipids.   Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Release of Toxins Stored in Fat?",
    "content": "Hello everyone, this is my first time posting so forgive (and please point out) any transgressions of forum rules!  I have recently began a diet and fitness program. I am burning roughly 1000 to 1300 more calories per day than I take in, according to my best calculations.  I have also been feeling strange. At first I thought it might have been the caloric shortfall, so I decided to ease off my diet for a day or two to see if that made any difference. It has not. I am drinking between 8 and 12 cups of water a day, eating a good carb-protein-fat balance, and exercising regularly, but I still have a strange feeling of dizziness mixed with fatigue (though I get 8 to 9 hours of sleep a night on a fairly regular basis).  I live in Beijing, and have lived here for four years. My apartment faces onto the highly polluted 4th Ring road, and I have lived in it for all 4 years. I remembered just now that toxins taken into your body are stored in your fat cells. Is it possible that burning fat due to my new diet plan could be releasing toxins that I have undoubtedly picked up by living in this city back into my system? Could that account for this feeling?  I have no idea if this is even possible, which is why I am asking you!  Thank you very much for your kind attention.  Tony\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Weight loss diets can cause side effects as you describe.  You should be sure you are getting enough calories for your needs, in a balance of protein, carbs and fats.  Too little can result in tissue damage, so I would recommend the consultation of a nutritionist or dietitian to be sure you are getting enough.  There is no magic calorie number for everyone.  Your own basal metabolic rate can vary and you could need more than your friend next door just to breathe and function at minimal levels.  I'm glad you are conscious of your water intake since dehydration is a serious concern, especially when exercising.  Again this is not a magic number, even though it is commonly said you need 64 ounces a day.  The water does remove toxins and waste so it is important but not enough is known about environmental toxins and the effect they have on the body.  It is known they are harmful but they are so prevalent it is hard to isolate the damage, or even all the specific toxins.  They are everywhere and likely cause us problems with our health in ways we may never know.    Of course there are other causes of dizziness and fatigue so a general physical exam might be in order, including blood work for thyroid, iron, etc.  Dieters do risk having electrolyte imbalance and nutrient deficiencies.  I hope you are taking in a well-balanced diet, even though it is low in calorie.  Good luck with your efforts to improve your health this way.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a huge challenge.  As we age, our taste buds and appetite both change and it makes eating more of a chore - aside from any other issues such as digestion, teeth condition, etc.  I am of the belief that you must do all you can to get some nutrition in there but forcing foods she does not like will not do any of you any good and may do psychological harm.  I think you have the right idea with small amounts of foods she likes.  If there's a way to supplement some of these with extra calories and nutritional supplements, by all means add these.  You might benefit from a consultation with a registered dietician with experience in geriatric nutrition.  There might be some ideas to help.  Some places also have aging services with nurses and other care providers who specialize in dealing with issues of the aging individual and helping the family members who care for them to find solutions to these challenges.   You might locate such services in your local community or public health agency.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, sugar alcohol is sugar and as such can affect your blood glucose but they are lower on the glycemic index and so they do not cause the same degree of fluctuation as some other sugars.  For example, maltitol has a GI of 36 as opposed to sucrose (sugar) with a GI of 60. Zylitol is only 13 so a much better choice for you.  Calories also vary.  But you must be cautious because these may not be as sweet as other sugars and you may find yourself using more to get the desired taste.    It would be wise to consult with a dietician about your diabetic needs to be sure you are taking care of yourself properly for optimal health.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you consistently eat a healthy diet with lots of vegetables, whole grains, protein, and dairy products, while avoiding a lot of junk food, you may not need an additional vitamin.  Most people, however, do not and they benefit from the supplemental vitamin.  It won't hurt to take them regularly but if you miss occasionally, that's OK too.  If you eat poorly, you definitely should take one every day of your life.  It is not a perfect substitute for healthy food but it helps.  The formulas you describe are adequate for most men.

Both showed, cotinine in my urine, a level a 4.5 (both tests)  I do not smoke, I never have smoked, and I'm not around any second hand smoke. I was around alot a second smoke growing up as a child, my father smoked alot, but that was 20 years ago. The only medication I'm on is Liptor (40mg) absolutely nothing else. I drink about two cups of coffee each morning. So, what could be causing this substance to be in my urine test?   Thanks,  Dale\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This product is sold as a supplement; not a drug.  As such, we have limited information due to lack of scientific, controlled studies and the only information we really can obtain is produced by the makers of the juice.  I will grant you that it is a well-known fact that fruits are healthy and none of us get enough in our diets typically.  Berries have been shown to be especially beneficial due to their antioxidant properties, anti-cancer benefits, many other vitamins and minerals (even fiber) and they are low in calories.   This juice is made up of many different berries.  As such, it won't hurt you but many people don't eat many berries, claiming they are expensive. Nothing is as expensive as paying someone to bottle up the berries, obtained from tropical sources, who then sell them in a muli-level sales organization with profit going to many different handlers.  Besides this, you miss out on the enjoyment of eating the luscious berries plain or enhancing other foods such as whole grain cereal, yogurt, nuts, etc. which boost the health benefits of the berries themselves.   This is no magical cure for everything that ails you as some distributors suggest.  If it were me, I would stock up on strawberries, blueberries and any other fruits and vegetables you like for the same benefit but giving you much more variety.  At $3 a day, one person can enjoy a lot of nice fruit.   With summer coming, fruits will be available at farmer's markets and local groceries at a good price.  Buy and enjoy fresh, which is known to provide the most benefit.  Freeze some more for the winter or buy dried or frozen later.  If you like a mixed berry juice, throw them in the blender.  I see nothing contained in this product that can be proven to have medicinal or weight-loss properties though we would all love to find such a thing.  I don't believe it is a scam unless you buy into the idea that it has magic properties.  I do agree it is an expensive way to get healthy berries into your diet.  People have the right to sell berries in any form as long as they are handled in a hygienic way.  We pay a lot for convenience foods and this may be seen as one of those, with the addition of some tropical berries that you won't find in the local grocery.    If those tropical berries were all they claim to be, don't you think major universities and researchers would have jumped on it and investigated those properties?  Mainstream medicine is as anxious as nutritionists to find cures for cancer, obesity, and other disorders.  I would be skeptical of exaggerated claims.    There are other similar products available as well - not just Mona Vie.  I would apply the same precautions to the others.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a certain amount of genetic predisposition for body size that is almost impossible to change.  If your body style is lean and thin, nothing you do will make a huge impact.  This does not mean you are unhealthy so as Dr. Lowe has suggested, making healthy life choices is the most important thing to getting the best body you can have, whatever shape that is.    Eating a nutrient-rich diet is the best thing you can do.  You may need to learn to accept your body type.  Many large people have similar frustrations as they diet and reduce calories drastically, often with limited results.  They just are not able to overcome their basic body shape, but they can become healthier with good choices.    You can build muscle mass with workouts.  You could consult with a personal trainer to optimize your results.  If you supplement, make sure you do it safely and don't expect a magic pill, potion or powder.  It doesn't hurt to discuss your concerns with your doctor to be sure there is no underlying physical disorder.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello James,  Penicillin is not ordered in the typical milligram dosing.  Instead, it is ordered in units and often a typical dose will be in the hundreds of thousands or million units.  It may be that the large dose you were given was actually a very appropriate dose.  It is very unlikely that you have had any problems from the penicillin, especially since the problem appears to be a little more recent in onset (rather than very soon after the penicillin).  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your doctor to help evaluate this.  If you have not had your thyroid levels checked I would recommend this.  If you are having any problems with abdominal pain, diarrhea or even constipation I would recommend you consider seeing a GI specialist for evaluation of possible malabsorption problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You definitely should see a doctor to see if there is some underlying physical symptom that is altering your appetite.  I assume this is a fairly new development for you but if you are new to the military it could also be related to your abrupt change of lifesyle, stress and increased exercise.  If you doctor finds no physical cause, there is the possibility is is psychological.  This does not mean it isn't real; just that the source may be in your subconscious mind or related to some unresolved issues.  In this case, therapy might be helpful.  You should be able to get both physical and psychological treatment through the military.  There are MANY possible causes for loss of appetite and sometimes your doctor must just go through the list ruling out each possible condition.  This can involve the endocrine system, GI disorders, drugs, psychiatric causes, kidney disease, diabetes and sometimes no cause can be identified.  In that case you must force yourself to get the nutrition you need with dietary supplements.    Good luck with this.  I am glad you are aware of this as a problem before the weight loss gets more significant and you put your health in danger.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Breast size is mostly determined genetically and affected at times by hormonal fluctuation so this is probably what is happening here. Usually your own breasts will be stabilized by six years after the menarche (start of menstruation).  Too bad we can't really manipulate it though because many women would like to be able to get a natural enlargement.  I would not be alarmed unless you noticed lactation (without breastfeeding happening). This could indicate a problem with a pituitary gland.  If you find you continue to notice changes over time, you should see your doctor to check out your hormone levels.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Isn't it frustrating that there is so much distress on either end of the weight spectrum.  People on one end (the majority) are fighting excess weight and others on the other side of the field are fighting to gain.  Just doesn't seem fair, does it?  For both conditions, heredity plays a very large role and this can make it most difficult to change the body type.    The best thing you can do is add healthy foods to your diet while exercising.  You aim for muscle mass; not fat, so exercise and body building are important even when you want to gain.  I would recommend a visit with a registered dietician to plan a good program for you based on your likes and needs.  Health food stores do sell supplemental protein drink powders that have a high caloric count and help some people.  I can't recommend any one in particular but you might inquire at such a specialty store.    Keep in mind though, it is likely that you will not be able to make huge gains here because of your particular genetically determined body type.  Rather than trying too hard to get a different body, try to be appreciative of the advantages your type has and be sure you are as healthy as possible through positive life choices, food choices and activity.  Then you will know you have done all that is possible.  I know many very thin people (as well as many very heavy people) who are comfortable with who they are and have accepted the limitations of their body type even though it is not what they have chosen.  This is healthy.   Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm concerned about my hip to waist ratio and how important my number is.  I'm 34, female, 5.4 1/2 tall and weigh about 123 lbs.  This gives me a BMI of 21.5.  This is considered healthy, right?  But when I do my hip to waist ratio, I'm considered obese.  My waist is 29\" and my hips are 33\".  This gives me a ratio of .88, and it is considered unhealthy to have a ratio larger than .75.    Should I lose weight to lower my waist to hip ratio?  My height is in my legs, and I have a shorter back and waist so I carry my weight in the middle.  What weight should I shoot for, or should I just try and loose weight until whatever weight brings me to a healthier hip to waist ratio?  I understand having a high ratio puts you at risk for heart disease, and this is the issue I'm trying to avoid.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amanda.marie73,  Both BMI and hip:waste ratio are guidelines to help categorize health risks; however, they both must be balanced with all the other health assessment factors.  I would suggest you talk with your doctor about your overall health assessment.  I would suggest you test your cholesterol to be sure it is at a healthy level.  Also, I would recommend you start or continue an exercise program.  Make sure your diet is healthy.    If you balance your diet, exercise, and the other health factors the hip:waste ratio and BMI become less significant.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Many factors impact this including illnesses and overall health status.  The difficult part is that there is nothing that accurately predicts survival.  Even those in poor health can manage to live well beyond the \"average\" life expectancy.  Other times, those in peak health die much before expected.  My best advice for you is to try to optimize your health as this will also optimize your life expectancy as much as possible.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Today, I noticed a very large lump, apox. 5 inches across , from my surgical scar running down to the pubis area. There is no pain, in fact the area seems numb, but the sudden appearence and hardness of the lump concerns me. Is it possible the surgical site herniated from the extremely excessive weight i carry?

I would recommend that you have this evaluated if at all possible.  While you may not be having pain now, if this is a hernia there is always the possibility that the intestines may become twisted.  If this happens it becomes a surgical emergency and the repair is much more risky than repairing the hernia before there is a problem with the intestines.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since this falls more in the supplement category rather than medication, the FDA has not issued a recommendation.  Nutritionists generally say between one and four grams daily is most beneficial but it varies depending on what health issue you are addressing.  That is a pretty wide range.  It has also been reported that getting this from food sources is actually better for absorption than supplements.  Of course in calculating the amount you need to take into account what you get from foods containing the Omega 3 fatty acids.  Fish are the best source for this but some large fish (Tile, swordfish, king makarel, etc.) have been associated with higher levels of mercury contamination so some caution should be used particularly in pregnant women and children but other than this I see nothing that warns of any need to restrict to every other day dosing in health individuals who do not have disorders involving bleeding, who bruise very easily, or who are taking blood thinners.  These folks should consult with a medical practitioner before taking supplemental omega 3 fatty acids.  If you are in the USA, keep in mind the FDA does not regulate supplements as they do other medications.  They have, however, acknowledged the important health benefits of a diet rich in the Omega 3s.   I have not found anything indicating the amount nutritionists recommend specifically for treating depression and anxiety.  The safest way to get this is in foods that contain naturally high levels of the nutrient.  There are other non-prescription treatments for depression and anxiety.  You may be interested in a book called, When Your Body Gets the Blues by Marie Annette Brown and Jo Robinson for other ideas.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

    "content": "The first thing that comes to mind is the possibility of anemia.  Women your age are susceptible and vegans are particularly so.  You should consult a good nutritionist if  you choose to eat this way because it is difficult to get all the nutrients you need - not impossible, but it takes great effort and planning.  Your doctor could do a simple test for anemia because you may need iron supplements as well.    Of course there are other common causes for tiredness such as thyroid disorder.  It is also known that most people do require at least 8 hours sleep regularly and most people do not get enough.    Are you taking any medications?  Do you feel prone to depression?  These can also have tiredness as a side effect.  As you mentioned, major life events can cause stress which may also be manifest as depression symptoms so if you have access to a counselor, perhaps through school, you might benefit from a psychological  evaluation as well.  Taking on an exercise program is commendable but it may take a while for you to achieve results.  Try to stay with it and lengthen the time gradually until you build up to a good, regular pace.  I could also recommend a book, When Your Body Gets the Blues by Dr. Marie-Annette Brown and Jo Robinson.  They offer some excellent ideas to help yourself through some of these symptoms.

    "content": "My son is 5 years old and was born with hypotonia and is gross motor developmentally delayed.  The cause of the hypotonia was never found although we were seen by a genetisist, endocrinologist, neurologist, cardiologist, you name it we were there.  He was born large at 10 pounds 8 ounces and 22 and a half inches long.  It seems that every year he goes through a tremendous weight gain between the months of September and January.  Last year during this gain (I believe he gained 8 pounds during that time last year) he was tested for thyroid disease and diabetes, both were negative.  This fall it started again with a total weight gain of 10 pounds from his July physical until now.  Obviously this is alarming.  The pediatrician suggested a nutrionalist.  I have an appointment for next week but in the mean time was told to try to cut calories.  This child does not over eat.  He doesn't snack on chips or cookies.  He eats raw peppers, grapes, stawberries, things like that.  He doesn't eat a lot of fast food, he can't even finish a happy meal from Mc Donalds.  He does eat a lot of pasta in his diet.  The hypotonia has affected his mouth and tongue and he has a really bad gag reflex and poor chewing ability so pasta was always easy for him to handle.  I spoke with a nutrionist over the phone who said that his poor muscle tone may be causing hypometabolism.  Have you ever heard of that?  I would appreciate any suggestions on how to cut calories without starving him.  He is currently 70 pounds and 4 feet tall.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jacluc,  Your description of your son makes me wonder about a syndrome called Prader-Willi syndrome.  Has he been evaluated for this?    Regarding the hypometabolism, if a child is undernurished (even if he is eating a lot) the body can start to move into a starvation phase where it will slow down its metabolism.  At this point, it takes less calories to meet the body's demand so any excess calories will be stored as fat for later use if the starvation continues.  If, by chance, your son is deficient in protein, etc. and mostly getting carbohydrates (from pasta) then it is possible that he has become hypometabolic.  However, this usually occurs in the case of total undernurishment.  If he is still getting a lot of calories but is missing only one part (such as protein) he is much less likely to move into this state.  In this case, other symptoms would begin to develop such as abdominal swelling from excess fluid in the abdomen.  Seeing a nutritionist is a good idea.  I think it sounds like your child needs further evaluation medically as well.  I would recommend he have speech swallow study to see if he is able to safely eat various types of food (solid, liquid, etc.).  He may also need evaluation for a G-tube to help give him nutrition that is properly balanced if he is not sufficiently able to do this orally.  Follow up with a pediatrician is very important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thank you for the reply.  My son was tested for Pradar Willi syndrome when he was 2 years old.  It was negative.  We saw a nutritionist and she said she believes he is insulin resistant.  She said that she is basing this on the facts that he does not over eat, all of his weight is around the belly, from behind you wouldn't know he is overweight, and he has a large dark patch on his arm that appeared about 2 years ago and no one knows why.  I am trying to add more fiber and protein into his diet.  The nutritionist said that the reason we see such an increase during the specific months that we do is because of the activity drop between summer and the beginning of the school year.  Also she said the fact that he does not chew his food (or he does very little) is adding to the problem because he is not getting the initial phase of digestion which begins in the mouth.  Before the diet change, he was eating little if any breakfast each day (I would try, he would refuse), he would eat a good lunch (usually some sort of pasta), and then eat a few bites of dinner.  He is not a big snacker but his diet really did consist of pretty much pasta, fruit, and some vegetables with the pasta being the heaviest component.  This all makes sense to me but I am not a doctor.  Does this sound like we could be on the right track?\n\n",

    "content": "I am stationed overseas, we are having alot of service and family members go to a weight loss clinic for treatment. I don't feel there is much regulation over here and wonder if it is safe. Screening consists of a machine that measures body fat (hands and feet) a few questions by a Doctor: smoking and eating habbits etc and a simple diet. I received a list of what they say they are giving. People receive about 20 injections on each visit 2-3 times per week and are around 1/2ml each (thats a guess) directly under the skin into the fat this is about $20usd. The following is what they say is in each shot. Pentoxyphylline Buflomedil Lidocaine Saline The pills are a mix for lunch and dinner 1-2 hours before the meal and consist of the following. I'm not sure on the translation. Cost is about $26usd for 7 days. Nw (10)? Nefuis-s or Nefcis-s? Yuncphen or Yunphen? Well? Famotidine People say they have trouble sleeping and loss of appitite and tightness in the injection area. The Pills and shots do work I have seen people loose allot of weight but I am concerned at what cost. Any recomendations would be appreciated, Thank You\n\n",

I have become quite leary about anything that appears to be a quick and easy fix for weight loss.  It take work, self-control, exercise, sensible dietary changes or surgery in the case of morbid obesity.  Anything else seems to be temporary.  I would suggest you discuss with the doctor in detail about the risks and benefits of this treatment and learn whether there are good scientific studies to support the treatment before embarking on this course yourself.

    "title": "Re: questions concerning liquid diet for weightloss..",
    "content": "Hello, It just depends on the diet you are using.  There are very effective liquid diets that are available by prescription which are complete in nutrition and can cause rapid but safe weight loss.  They are prescription to be sure they are used under a doctor's care, who can evaluate your physical health and determine if you have any underlying conditions that would make this risky.  Three weeks is a pretty safe time frame and if the liquid diet contains the nutrition you need, it should be safe.  Any time you make such a drastic change in your diet, your bowel function can be affected.  Constant diarrhea could put you in a state of dehydration, which can be very serious so drinking lots of water would be essential.  I would recommend a medical evaluation but if you are in good health, the limited use of this product is likely to be perfectly safe.  Long-term might be another story. If you need a kick-start for rapid loss, this might be an answer.    As an alternative, you could probably be just as successful with a very strict diet that is high in protein and almost zero carbs (except those you get with vegetables).  Eat strictly lean meats, beans and vegetables with limited fats and eliminate refined carbs completely (breads, starches, sugars).  That will give you a good jump start on the weight loss.  Then you can gradually add whole grains after the three week period.  For long term success, you would be wise to avoid the processed and refined sugars and breads for en extended period.  Your body does not need these.  Note, I am not saying you do not need carbohydrates but vegetables supply ample amounts for a healthy diet.    Best wishes and congratulations on your desire to obtain a healthy body weight.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How can I gain Height?",
    "content": "Hi, Most boys stop growing in height around age 16 but there are exceptions.  I know of some boys who added inches when they were 20 but this is not the norm.  Genetics plays a large role in this and nutritional status contributes as well.  I also know of some boys who ate extremely healthy meals as a child who surpassed their parents' height be quite a bit.  Is it the diet?  Nobody knows for sure but we do know it plays a role so you can't lose by adding lots of vegetables, fruits, and dairy products to your diet.  We have recently learned how really valuable this is.  The average teen's diet is not rich in these nutrients since french fries hardly count.  Other than an overall balanced eating plan, I know of no supplements that will increase your growth.    It is possible for you to have a checkup with your doctor to evaluate if you have a human growth hormone deficiency - not because greater height is desired, but to determine if there is a lack that could affect other aspects of your health.  In order to affect height, treatment for this disorder begins at a relatively young age so I'm not sure how you might relate to this but an evaluation by a doctor is recommended for boys your age anyway.  Please schedule an appointment for a complete physical exam with your pediatrician or family doctor.  Explain your concerns to him or her.  I understand your desire to be taller but I hope you will also focus on other aspects of your mind and body, realizing that the size and worth of a man go beyond his appearance.  You can also work to develop your muscles and this will help your self image.  I don't mean aspiring to be \"Mr. America\" - just strength and muscle in place of flab.  It will improve your overall health too.  This goes a long way to being physically appealing.  As a short person myself, I do realize the areas of frustration but don't let your quest for inches become the dominant force in your life.      Best wishes for your successful future - in all your endeavors.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You may need to take a laxative such as milk of magnesia.  Sometimes impacted bowels must have manual removal of the feces.  A glycerine suppository can help soften the stool.  A gloved finger is used with a lubricant such as mineral oil to prevent trauma to the rectum.  Gentle prodding is used to break up the stool into manageable bits. It is difficult to do yourself and may require the help of a healthcare provider.    Prevention is the best cure.  Changing diet (avoid starch and meat, increase whole grains, fruits and vegetables) and adding lots of water along with fiber supplements such as Konsyl (psyllium), Metamucil and Citracel can do a lot of good.  But you must deal with the problem at hand.  The blood is due to trauma in the attempt to pass the large stool or from hemorrhoids which are also caused or aggravated by constipation.    I have never heard of orange juice curing this condition but the extra fluids and fiber won't hurt. Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: excessive hunger",
    "content": "Hello, This is a very frustrating problem.  There are hormones and chemicals in the body that affect a person's metabolism and fat accumulation.  This is one area of life that just isn't fair.  One person will fight to gain, while (more often) others fight to lose.  A good, well-rounded diet is your best option but sometimes you can kick start with something like a high protein/no refined carbs program.  Avoid all sugars, processed foods and take in lean meats, beans, vegetables, some fats but avoid grains, flour (breads, etc.)  You can get your body into ketosis where fat stores are used and it helps get things started.  Later you can carefully and gradually add back in dense carbohydrates such as a few whole grains.  You might consider joining a program such as Weight Watchers where you can also get emotional and social support in your efforts.  These are safe diets and when followed along with exercise produce good and lasting results.  The problem is people give up on these plans too soon.    As for the hunger that comes \"too soon\" it could be you need to break your meals down into small servings that you take more frequently.  You do want to avoid the ravishing hunger that can come from waiting too long.  Have some healthy snacks (especially vegetables) handy to eat when you get that sensation.  Also, drink lots of water!  Many times our body is craving water but it feels like hunger.  Good luck.\n\n",

So this can be helpful in conjunction with a good diet program.    Sibutramine (marketed as Meridia) is also effective for many people but it can raise blood pressure so some are not candidates for it.  Also, this drug is used as an appetite suppressant in conjunction with a weight loss diet and some people find it's effects to be temporary so it is best used in weight loss needs of maybe up to 50 pounds in a dedicated dieter.  Once the effects are diminished as the person develops tolerance, the weight may come back on unless good eating habits have replaced the old ones.    I'm sure you are aware that FenPhen should not be used but some people do find success with just the phentermine, which is safe (half of the combination).  The use of the two together was found to be damaging to some people's heart valves.    There are also some drug studies going on to try new medications so if you have such research agencies in your area, that might be another route to try.    Whatever you do, combine it with an exercise program for greatest success.  If you are morbidly obese you might also consider weight loss surgery such as gastric bypass or gastric banding procedures.   Programs such as Weight Watchers, TOPS, Overeaters Anonymous, hypnotherapy, etc. are also shown to be quite helpful.  You may find a multi-disciplinary approach to work best.  Best wishes for improved health through your diligent efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The products you inquire about are not actually in the category of medications as in drugs regulated by the FDA in the U.S.  They are supplements and as such there are not strict testing requirements for purity, consistent product content, evidence of effectiveness and safety.  While I am not saying that the FDA is perfect in its regulatory capacity, at least there is more consistency and we can be more sure that a product is what it claims to be.  Supplements fall in a different category and Information about whether or not these work for weight loss could be coming from their own manufacturer and may not have been proven scientifically so use at your own risk.  Many people are confused when something is made from \"natural\" ingredients.  Because it occurs naturally in nature does not guarantee its safety when ingested or otherwise introduced into the human body.  This is not to say that supplements are not safe but you must do your own investigation and I would encourage using only brands from reputable supplement manufacturers to best assure that you are getting what they claim you are.  Random checks have revealed a wide array of ingredients and amounts included that are not what they claim.  So, when dealing with a drug that is not regulated (supplement) you must be more careful.  I know this is what you are asking for here, but without sanctioned, unbiased studies of large enough magnitude to be reliable, we cannot advise.    Here is the information I found:  \"Do not use 5-HTP is you are currently taking any of the following medications: Anti-depressant drugs; Monoamine oxidase inhibitors; Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors; Tricyclic medications; Weight Loss medications; Anti-parkinson medications; Barbiturates and other tranquilizing drugs; Antihistamines and cold medications; Alcoholic beverages; Intravenous drugs; Cancer chemotherapy or antibiotic medications.  Warning: Dosages of 5-hydroxy L-tryptophan (5-HTP) greater than 100 milligrams per day should be taken only under the guidance of a physician.\"  Ginko Bilboa is not listed here so evidently it has not been found to be a problem to date.  Use caution whenever you take medications, including supplements.  Don't exceed the recommended dosage, report supplements you use to  your doctor just as you would other drugs when asked what you take as part of your health history.  Use reputable brands you can trust and inquire through the nutritional suppliers about any testing they can report so you can make an informed decision.   This is about the best you can do since we can't tap into reliable regulatory information sources on these drugs.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I eat better and excercise more than all of my friends, and yet, they all have a much healthier weight than me. People have suggested that I'm eating too little and my body thinks I'm starving, but when I do eat more or excercise less, I gain weight almost immediately. The only time I was able to lose weight (to 145lbs), I was eating about 1000 calories and working out for about 5 hours a day.  I don't have the time to spend all day everyday working out. By my calculations, my body should be reflecting all the work I'm putting into it. What's going on?  Thank you for your help!\n\n",

There are several brands that make multivitamins specific for women in menopause (which may be contributing to her symptoms).  Usually, the generic vitamin brands are just as good as the name brands.  If she is wishing to find something that can help minimize her symptoms she may want to talk to her doctor about hormone supplementation.  There is some newer data suggesting that this may not be a safe thing to do in some cases so it is important for her to discuss this with her gynecologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Avdb_,  I suspect that you have a viral infection causing your fatigue.  The classic viral infection causing fatigue is mononucleosis (caused by Ebstein Barr virus).  Anemia and hypothyroidism can also cause these symptoms.  Another possibility would be that even though you are sleeping at night you may not be getting quality sleep.  Conditions such as sleep apnea can rob a person of their sleep so that, even though they are sleeping, they don't get a good solid sleep so during the day fatigue sets in.  I would suggest you see your doctor for an evaluation and possibly some screening tests to help figure out why you are feeling this way.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Assuming 40mg/can, drinking 5-6 cans will give 200 to 240 mg/day.  So, the caffeine content of either method is going to be about the same.  Taking the caffeine pill and drinking water is probably better from this stand point since drinking soda will also give other compounds that would not be present in the water.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am here because I need advice for the time-being.  My hair is falling out, mainly when I shower, but not in 'normal' amounts.  I have thick hair so I have always dealt with this, but for the past few months I have had hair fall out in large chunky strands which look like it was cut out of my head.  This is so scary that I nearly start crying, and do freak out I suppose I could say.  I have been bulimic for over a couple years, but like most bulimics my BMI does not put me at normal to overweight.  (My BMI is 17.3-17.5, and I know that is not very low.)  I can guarantee I am low in potein, iron, potassium, and many other things my body needs.  I have not been responsible, but cleary that is not something to come easy since I neglect my bodies needs in the first place.    I need to know which vitamins I can start taking immediately to guarantee my hair loss will lessen in a less dramatic way.  Obviously a multi-vitamin would be good, but I would love any additional advice!  -Femail/21 years old/bulimic/no medications, but I am a laxative abuser\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are most likely losing hair because of the bulemia.  You said BMI of 17 is not low but it is definitely underweight and your body is perceiving malnutrition.  When it does this it conserves the minimal energy it has for the more vital organs - brain, lungs, heart.  It will sacrifice the organs that are less critical - hair, nails, even fingers, toes, etc.  So, the best thing you can do is get treatment for your bulemia.  See a psychiatrist immediately if you haven't already.    There are no magic vitamins that can completely replace nutrition through eating.  Many ill patients in the hospital have to rely on tube feedings and they too lack what they need for optimal health.  The liquid vitamins they receive in the hospital are the best that are available but they still don't really cut it.  It's better than nothing but their bodies suffer in many ways.  The B vitamins are usually implicated for hair and nails but again, if you don't get adequate caloric intake and your electrolytes are messed up through vomiting and/or induced diarrhea you will not be able to compensate.  There is no magic bullet, shampoo, treatment or potion that will fix this problem.  There are other causes of hair loss such as alopecia arreata but with your history, I would first suspect nutrition.  Please get the intense therapy that may be required to lick this problem.  My prayers are with you for success in this difficult situation.  Best wishes. Debbie\n\n",

My faimly history contains stroke on my fathers side and some breast cancer on my mothers side. I am currently taking Tri-Nessa bith control.  I began having my symptoms in the summer or 2006, always wanting to eat even after large meals and wanting to sleep for 14+ hours at a time. I went to my family doctor who told me it was completely normal and said it was just stress from my upcoming marriage. I was told that  it would clear up after the wedding was over and the stress had let up.   My first anniversary is coming up next month, and the issues haven't cleared, if anything they have gotten worse.   I will eat a big meal, feel full, but in less than an hour I want to eat again. I have gained 30 lbs since my wedding. I was told by a nurse friend that my birth control might have something to do with my weight gain. I tried to get my prescription changed to another form of birth control but was refused this request, being told I just need to try a better diet plan. I have considered going off  the pill completely but there is an issue with this. I have been taking some form of birth control since before i was sexually active for period regulation. I didn't have weight issues with my previous pills but I'm not sure what type I was taking.  I had believed that my sleep issues might have been caused my my sudden shift to a 3rd shift sleeping schedule but even swapping back hasn't helped. I can sleep for 12 hours, and am ready to go back to bed after only a few hours awake.  I'm hoping that by posting on these forums someone can point me in the right direction. I would like to go to a doctor about this but am not sure if I should go to a specialist or not. Can someone please PLEASE tell me were I can go for help with this? The excessive sleeping and eating have been putting a strain on my marriage and are starting to make me depressed.  I thank you for any information you might be able to give me.

    "content": "Hi, Congratulations on your desire to lose weight prior to pregnancy.  If you can, it will greatly decrease your risks of complications.    As for Alli, this is a very new drug to assist with weight loss and I doubt there is enough data to know how pregnancy will be affected by this, if at all.    Since drugs are not tested on pregnant women, the only way we can get data is by collecting information on women who have taken the medication while pregnant.  After following the pregnancy, along with thousands of others with the same situation, we are able to get a pretty good idea of safety (at least if it raises the risk of birth defects beyond the normal 3 - 5%).  New drugs such as this one will be limited in information but if you have a local teratology service, such as otispregnancy.org you may be able to get some information, if somewhat limited.     If your weight loss attempts are not successful, I would keep gastric bypass in mind as a good alternative since it has been shown to be very successful in the long term, but it is recommended the patient does not become pregnant until they are at least 18 months post-surgery.  So, if you are planning pregnancy soon, this would not be a good time for the weight loss surgery.  Good luck in your efforts\n\n",

    "content": "I have always been up and down with my weight. Over the last few years I have gained and lost 40lbs, gained it back, lost 20, gained it back, etc, changing sometimes within a few weeks. More recently I gained 30+ lbs in less than 2 months, 20lbs was in 2-3 weeks.   I am seeing a therapist for the reason behind this binge eating/compulsive overeating to dry to find the reason behind it, its obviously not b/c I am hungry.  However, I now feel my body is paying for it. I am 5'5\" and at 195+lbs. I feel pains now in my lower right back, especially when I breath, general shortness of breath, rapid heart beat (especially when I binge).  I am afraid this rapid weight gain and influx of bad food may have cause damage. Obviously if I keep on this path, I will have the general problems that go with obesity.   But for now I just want to know, given that I do not gain anymore, should I see a doctor to get tested for immediate risks (e.g. have I potentially harmed my heart, liver, kidneys, etc.)  Thanks in advance for your guidance.\n\n",

The most important thing for you to do is see a doctor about this problem and they would be able to evaluate your labs to see if there is any obvious problem at present.  I am glad to see you are in therapy for this as well.    It is also possible that something is going on unrelated to the weight fluctuation and binging so seeing a doctor to rule out such possibilities would be wise.  Any time you experience breathing difficulties or heart racing, it is good to have it checked out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Weight and Depression",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 21 year old female with a weight problem. I'm 5'6 and weigh a little over 220 lbs, (varies from 218-226). Growning up, I never had a huge weight problem, I ate whatever I wanted and exercised only when it was required by the sports I was involved in. My parents were both a little overweight, but it was becuase of their unhealthy habits... a little extra mayo hold the work-out. I was married in 2004, and within the first year of my marriage I gained 80lbs. Since I got married, I was eating nothing but nutritious foods and exercising 4-5 days a week. I was more healthy then, than I was in my entire life, and yet I was gaining weight! I went to see a nutritionist to see if I had a thyroid problem, or another explaination for my delimma. I did all kinds of tests, blood work, & food and exercise journals just for the huge dissapointment of hearing 'it all looks good, I don't know what to tell you'. I continued to watch what I ate and exercise every time I got a chance, but I was maintaining my weight, at best.     I moved about a year ago and was getting really frustrated with my self image. Never do I want to be a barbie doll, but I want to look healthy. 160lbs would be just fine with me. It was keeping me up at night until I would cry myself to sleep in anger and frustration. Finally I decided to see another nutritionist at my current location. Again, we did the logging, the blood tests, the works. I was eating less than 1000 calories a day (of only whole grains, mostly fruits and veggies and lean meats) and running 30 min each morning mon-fri then doing a gym (40 min cardio and 20 min weights) work-out on mon-wed afternoons. Logic would only deduct that if you consume less calories than you burn, you will loose weight. Well, that is not working, and the doctor saw that. Though the tests all came back normal, again, he gave me the option of perscription medication. I am on Phemtermine now. I told my doc here that I did not want anything that would suppress my appetite, as I was already not eating enough. However, with phentermine, I am eating less in a week than most people eat in a day. I consume less than 500 calories a day, (though I think thats a high guess as I will go a couple days in a row without consuming anything but black coffee and water) honest-to-God. It's not that I choose not to eat, in fact, I am never hungry. I eat the 500 calories that I do because I force myself. I still have the same workout schedule, and yes, it is rigorous, if I'm not sweating, I push harder. Though the Phen has worked a bit, it is with little result.    I don't know what else to do. I have gone into a really deep depression. I don't feel comfortable in my own skin. I sleep for 4 hours a night if I'm lucky, and I hide myself from the world. I have always been a happy-go-lucky person. I've lost interest in so many things. I am trying so hard to lose weight to be at a healthy weight but nothing works. If I cannot find something that works, I fear I won't be around much longer. This is not by any means in terms of suicide, but eating so little and working out so much cannot be good for my body. I fear I will do permanent damage to my body if I do not find a better solution soon.    Help, what can I do? I need to loose weight because it prevents me from doing things I love, and it does not look professional. What else can I possibly try to get this weight off?  P.S. I'm also on minocycline for acne, which has only made it worse, and prilosec for heartburn.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can certainly understand your frustration.  It sounds like you have some kind of genetic predisposition to weight gain.  It is possible you might be a candidate for weight loss surgery (Gastric bypass of one type or other that inhibits absorption; as opposed to limiting amounts like the lap band would do).  You may not meet the criteria and insurance coverage varies since some consider this health issue to be merely cosmetic, but it might be worth looking into.      It sounds like you have tried everything to no avail.  I would also recommend you get treatment for the depression.  This is very real, no matter what the triggering event is.  It results from inadequate neurotransmitter function and often needs medication to get better.  Seeing a therapist about this could also be helpful.    I assume  your doctor has also checked you for PCOS (Polycystic ovary syndrome).  This can result in unexplained weight gain.  Acne is sometimes caused by this as well.  There is a relationship with insulin and other endocrine functions but it might be worth checking.  I would also recommend a book called, When Your Body Gets the Blues by by Marie Annette Brown and Jo Robinson.  While the book discusses overeating, it is excellent in terms of tendency to gain weight and the depression that often accompanies it.  Please let us know what you find out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry to hear you are experiencing negative side effects with this preparation.  As for flushing out, I know of no answer there other than allowing your body to rid itself naturally over time.  How long is anyone's guess.  By way of information, herbal products and supplements are not regulated and tested by the FDA in the U.S. so there are not good studies to show safety.  When a product in this category claims safety, it is by its own standards and it may or may not be safe.  There is no tru regulation of this industry to guarantee even that the product is what it claims to be.  As for diet pills, there are hundreds on the market because everyone is trying to get on the moneymaking bandwagon that has resulted from our obesity epidemic.  In truth, if there were safe and effective diet pills without side effects, we would be all over it.  The doctors would prescribe it because they want their patients to be healthy and overweight is not healthy.  I would recommend staying away from these oft-advertised gimmicks in the future.  Consult with your doctor about weight loss alternatives or use a tried and true method where a prescribed diet of less calories than what you expend are taken in, combined with a regular exercise program.  This is the only real way to lose weight safely.  If you are morbidly obese, there are other options as well.  Your doctor will know about these too.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "You are right that for teens to use alcohol like this is a bad health choice.  Several reasons come to mind.  You mentioned cirrhosis - yes definitely such long-term exposure is likely to catch up with them and damage their livers.  Liver cancer is also likely.  Also, the adolescent brain isn't yet \"finished\" and taking any drugs, alcohol included, can permanently damage connections that are still maturing.  These connections help adults to be able to make good decisions.  The immaturity of this system is one reason teens often use poor judgment.  Their brains simply aren't yet functioning at full capacity.  Insulting the growing brain with alcohol can have lifelong negative results in the areas of cognition and judment.  In the short-term, coordination and reflexes are decreased, making the teen more prone to accidents, including motor vehicle accidents and death.  It can also distort the vision and cause memory lapses.  When under the influence, judgment is impaired and inhibitions are lowered, making the teen more susceptible to poor choices and risky behaviors such as sex with it's potential for disease and/or pregnancy.  Even if one teen in the group is not drinking, he or she is subjected to the poor self-control and decreased abilities of the friends as they drive in vehicles or experience violence as a victim or witness.  Decreasing teen alcohol use and abuse has many short and long-term benefits to society.\n\n",

Not nuts and milk (Nor eggs) individually as I can eat them both separate and be perfectly fine, but when I eat nuts and milk within a few minutes of one another I become quite ill the following day. However, it is not solely just milk with nuts, even chocolate and nuts gives me the same symptoms. It appears to be something in the milk, which is also contained within chocolate as chocolate is made partly from milk, that is causing an unfavorable reaction to the nuts. Within an hour of consuming the nuts and milk product together, I can smell a very unpleasant odor in my breathing. The smell is too difficult to explain so I won't attempt it. Though it is definitely a gas of some sort that is emitted when I exhale. The day after I would be vomiting and also have diarrhea. This only tends to last for the morning and by the afternoon/early evening my body is typically back to normal. I do try to avoid the nut and milk combination as much as possible. I thought it was just chocolate and nuts that caused the unpleasant reaction so I learned after a couple of instances not to mix the two. However, a couple of days ago I had some popcorn (Nut product) and milk, this caused the exact same reaction as nuts and chocolate. Even chocolate bars that contain both nuts and chocolate -- such as Snickers, leads to the same reaction. This leads me to believe that other people do not have the same reaction as me else there would not be a Snickers bar. I eat chocolate very rarely which helps me avoid these nasty situations. The rest of my body feels perfectly fine, all apart from my stomach. No malaise, headaches, drowsiness, etcetera... I would really like to know what specifically is causing this reaction. What in the milk is causing a reaction with something in a nut?  Any response would be greatly received.\n\n",

    "content": "I am not familiar with this type of allergy, but you have essentially done an elimination type diet where you have been able to determine the offending foods so, odd as it seems, if it works to avoid this combination, then by all means, avoid it.  The body's hyper-immune responses are hard to understand sometimes so if it offends you, listen to your body and work around it the best you can.  Keep in mind that allergies to such things as peanuts can become severe.  If you ever have breathing difficulties, be sure to see a doctor or emergency clinic.    There are some natural food nutritionists who subscribe to the concept of certain foods eaten together or problematic.  I don't know if they have ever encountered such a problem as you describe but I know they advocate avoiding certain combinations and encouraging others.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm female, 40, and have used L-Phenylalanine for assistance with memory, and better brain function.  It was getting harder to concentrate, remember things (I'm an actor, need to remember lines!).  I read a nutrition book and under amino acids it listed what L-Phenylalanine does.  I've been taking it regularly for the past 3 years, with only a short break here and there of like a month or so.  When I first started - because I was in a play - within a week, I totally noticed the difference to the relief of the director and cast!    My question is, is the long term use of this suppliment going to be harmful?  Are there other recommendations?  And this makes me wonder also about \"nutritional aids\" for athletes/ gym rats like myself.  Often amino acids are supplimented and I was wondering about long term effects.  Thank you very much for making this service available.\n\n",

The only real contraindication is that it should not be used by people who have phenylketonuria or some other conditions (schizophrenia, hypertension, hyperthyroidism, history of melanoma).   This falls in the category of alternative medicine so we really don't have scientific studies to back it its use or to document problems.

    "content": "My partner a 40 year old female 5 ft 3 ins has been on a diet after a hernia operation. She was 22st to start with and is now 10st 6lbs. She has done this with diet and exercise all on her own mostly by reducing fat in her diet.  Her problem is now she has bags of loose skin on her legs stomach and arms and her breasts are just empty sacks. The skin just wobbles and doesnt seem to have any substance to it.  She ideally needs to loose a few more pounds but she is ashamed at her loose skin. Will the skin go back as she looses more weight or is the only option to have surgery?  She had a terrible experience when having the hernia operation and is petrified of surgery.   Is there anything she can do or take to help the skin tighten? She eat well with lots of fruit and veg and very little fat but she has trouble going to the toilet and only goes once a week. She has lost the weight slowly over a year average of 2 lb per week.  Does she perhaps need more protein so she can build more muscle?\n\n",

The website for Hoodia claims that there is no interaction.  It's statement that the mechanism of action in the brain means it has no effect on birth control should be taken with caution.  The mechanism of action of a drug does not, in itself, preclude interactions/interference with other medications.  In fact, most of the time the interaction is unrelated to its mechanism of action.  So I can't answer your question definitively.  My best advise would be to be very cautious as an interaction and lessening of effectiveness may occur.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Has the damage already been done, or will it get worse with continued exposure?  also...by \"family history of allergies\" do they mean food allergies specifically, or ANY allergies? My husband and I have allergies to pollen, dust, etc..but not to foods that I know of. how dangerous is it for me to keep eating peanuts, now that I already have?  thanks for any info you can provide!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Isthedrin,  Unfortunately, there really isn't a lot of research currently available about the risks of eating peanuts during pregnancy or breastfeeding.  For those that are allergic to peanuts or have close relatives that are severely allergic to peanuts it may be advisable to avoid peanut consumption.  For those without this issue, eating peanuts is probably safe.  Generally, when the studies look at allergies in the mother or direct relatives they are looking at peanut allergies, not allergies in general.  Overall, I think that your risk is very low from eating the peanuts/peanut butter.  We do know, based on history, that mothers have been eating peanuts for countless numbers of years in the past and the rate of peanut allergy is only about 1% now.    I think it is very unlikely that you have caused any problems by eating peanuts during your pregnancy.  In fact, they are a good source of folic acid that can help support pregnancy.  I'll keep an eye on this subject to see if any new data becomes available.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "This sounds like a very healthy diet.  I think you are to be commended.    It is difficult to get too many fruits as long as you are in good overall health (without diabetes or other chronic condition relating to digestion).  Fruits and vegetables along with whole grain cereals make up an excellent diet.    But, fruit can be difficult for some people's digestion, acting more like a laxative.    Some people have found that they do better if they eat fresh fruit 15 to 30 minutes before eating other foods, rather than eating the fruit along with the meal.  It is common to eat fruit as the dessert - on top of the meal - but this may add to your digestive troubles so try eating it on an empty stomach, then waiting for the rest of the meal.    Raisins are not fattening and they are a good source of iron.  Cereals are also an important part of good nutrition.  This may not be the answer to your problems but it does address the question of fruits.  If it doesn't improve, you should see your doctor again.    Best wishes\n\n",

I just started using Tetrazene ES-50, I have used it for 2 days now and iam not feeling anything bad other then some added energy thoughout the day. My concern is that I have read some mixed reviews about this product and its side effects. I was woundering should I be worried about and anything if iam planning on using this product for about 30 days and using it correctly? it seems to be working.\n\n",

    "content": "Can someone please help me!!  A few years ago I went to my doctor with complaints of constant fatigue so bad that I could not function, debilitating periods(i can't leave the house), pain that feels like bruises on my legs and arms, bee sting sensations on my shoulders and neck, hair falling out, and well, pretty much all the symptoms of hypothyroidism.  My tsh levels were checked and I was told they were in the normal range but could be considered slightly elevated.  My prolactin levels were very high, but I don't have a prolactinoma.  My thyroid is slightly enlarged and I am increasingly depressed mostly because I am thirty pounds overweight, and I go to the gym every day for three months and I have not lost a single pound.  I am constantly bloated and it is painful and and I am so tired all the time that I can't do every day tasks.    I was put on an antidepressant that made me gain more weight, and 25 mcg of levoxyl which made no difference in the way I felt except for the first time I could actually sweat but  the tingling in my feet and hands was still there and my thumbs were still going numb. At eight weeks after diagnosis, I went in for bloodwork and explained that I didn't feel better, I was told that my dose of levoxyl would remain the same because I was in the normal range.  What can I do?  Why can't anyone help me to feel better?  I am literally at the end of my rope.\n\n",

    "content": "Your situation is similar to mine. I had all of the classic symptoms of Hypo they did blood tests but my TSH were elevated. I was put on Synthroid which didn't change any of my symptoms but since my levels dropped nothing was done. i was actually pulled off when the levels dropped to 1.5. Still i did not and do not feel any different. I commend you for going to the gym like you did. I am extremely tired and I sound like I ran a marathon if i walked to the mailbox or up our stairs. I tried exercising 6 times a week and completely changed my eating habits and after 4 weeks I couldn't even stay up at work so I had to stopped. I lost no weight at all. But there is a silver lining; my doctors sent me to take some sleep tests and they showed that I am excessively sleepy (Idiopathic hyperinsomnia) so I was placed on Provigil 400mg and Adderall Xr 20 mg. Am I still sleepy? yes, do I have any energy to exercise or do anything still?  no, but I have lost 20 lbs within the last 2 months.  Also ask your doctor to check your B12, cortisol, Acth, TPO, Estradiol, Calcium,Iodine,Magnesium, C02,Free T3 and Free T4 levels. my B12 were low so I was given an injection. B12 injections also help you lose weight you can't take a B12 pill, it must be in liquid form. My cousin bought the B12 liquid from GNC for 7 dollars. She's lost 4 lbs already within 2 weeks. I know it's not a lot of weight but if you don't have the energy like me, what do you do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mad-rocker, If your weight is just under 6 stone (approx 80 lbs. if I'm correct) then you are very petite indeed. Regarding your sleep pattern, did it become altered after you began the antidepressant medication? If so and you are taking the medication in the morning, you may want to change it to night time or vise versa. Depression may induce a lack of appetite, or increase appetite causing one to be underweight/malnourished, or the opposite, overweight as each persons reaction is a little different. One of the best things anyone can do for themselves whom are suffering from depression is exercise, i.e., walking. This increases chemicals in the brain that reduce depressive episodes. I have the impression that you skip many meals and are essentially anorexic. I would encourage you to seek out a dietitian/nutritionist for a healthy meal plan to assist you with an increased healthy weight. I would also suggest that you discuss with your physician/mental health professional regarding the effectiveness of lack of, antidepressants to see what other options are available. Now for my opinion, each are put on this earth for a purpose and reason. None of us know how long or short of time this may be. We are granted a celebration of living, make the most of it, make a difference. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I have had 8 years of a huge list of symptoms. all seemd unrelated and I started feeling like it was me making it up. I have recently found out the I have a Vitamine B12 deficiency. I am not anemic though. My doctor is Dutch and has limited English. He has told me it is quite a nasty defiency; level 8 (which means nothing to me), that he is worried about it  and that I need injections for the next 6 months. I am not a vegan but have a history of eating dissorders, ( which i am not entirely sure are over with) and can only assume that that it stems from that.  I have tried to read up on this deficiency but I have not found much to help me.  My symptoms over the last couple of years, after numerous tests, have been put down to stress. these are the symptoms; Fatigue, dizziness, no appetite, weight loss, extreme nervousness, numbness in my fingers, back probs, depression, sight probs, head aches and  have become very emotional. I also seem unable to fight off any bug going around and seem to keep it twice as long as anyone.   It has effected my school life and now, with my little girl, I am finding it hard (at 23!)  to keep up. Getting up in the morning is very hard beacuse I am so tired.  After this long story (!) I was wondering if there is any info out there for me which is clear. I am worries about my nervousness and inability to speak without feeling rushed and confused and stuttering. Is it me or are these things related to the defficiency? At what point would one worry about neuroligical damage. ( my doctor says unless I start walking around like an idiot, there is nothing to worry about, but there is a noticeable difference in my behaviour.)  I hope after all that, my questions were clear and perhaps someone has some info for me!  Thanks,   Philippa\n\n",

    "title": "restlessness and vitamin deficiency, please help.",
    "content": "Ok, I have had severe restlessnes symptoms, pretty much every minute of every day for 3 months straight. Sometimes with it I have fast heartbeat. I was also depressed. I went to my doctor thinking it was akathisia from amed that I stopped taking, he said he thougth I was depressed, anxious. I KNOW it is not anxiety. I take zoloft anyways. I have a long history of depression and anxiety, and I know this is different, this feeling is almost liek a buzzing restless feeling throughout my whole body, more specifically my legs and chest. I have had some blood work done, but my doc is pretty adamant on just diagnosing it as anxiety. After research I really truly believe I have adeficiency in vitamins. I started taking vitamin b complex 100 and the symptoms went away, I had such relief, although I had side effects of headache, sleepiness and nausea. I kept it up though happy to have fixed th eproblem, well after about aweek, the symptoms returned, so I wondered maybe I need a b vitamin but am not getting enough? With the more research I do, the more vitamins it shows that I have symptoms of a deficiency, magnesium, iron, vitamin b's, calcium, vitamin d. So now I am taking the b complex, vitamin b 12 on top of it, and amultivitamin, and sometimes a calcium magnesium, which I stopped taking. Since taking the b12 ( about 1000mcg's) I am feeling a bit better, but still a bit restless. I just don't get what is wrong. Why would the feelings go away with the b complex and yet return. Do you know what vitamins would cause a restless feeling that is severe, with rapid heart beat? Should I just give the vitamins some time to work, if I was deficient, would it need time to repair, before the symptoms went away? I am truly sorry my doctor isn't of much help, and this feeling is truly driving me crazy and I can't take it anymore. I am not going to stop treatment of zoloft, or anything, I just need to know what vitamins could cause this feelings, other than anxiety, like I said I am 100% sure. I am sorry this is so so long, but wanted to explain the situation. ( I have IBS, possible celiac disease, diarrhea alot of the time, and possible absorbtion problems? I am also a vegetarian, I don't eat eggs, and lactose intolerant, I also take beano) Please let me know what you think, and then maybe I could go to my doctor with that info and ask for other testing, or vitamin dosages? Thank you so much in advance, Carolee\n\n",

    "title": "PCOS and cant loose weight. What else can I do?",
    "content": "I'm a 29 yr old female diagnosed with PCOS last summer. (The syndrome with no cysts) no other known medical conditions. I had my appendix out in '99 and my wisdon teeth in '97ish. Family history of PCOS (1/2 sister), heart pblms (grandparents), lung cancer (mom) Fybromyalga (mom and sisters) thyroid (mom, and aunt on dads side) Currently taking Yaz and a multi vit. Let me give a tad of background then ask my question, please. I am 5'2\" 230 lbs (my BMI is like 42 my body fat depending on how its calculated about 35-38%.) New regulations for the job I used to have now require a BMI of less than 40. (previously it was body fat% and an agility test which I passed) So I was told to loose 30 lbs to be below the max BMI to qualify for the job thats opening in the next month) I have been dieting and excersizing as per my family doc with limited results. I have lost inches and body fat % but not weight. Until a couple weeks ago when I got a really bad cold, I was running/walking 45min to an hour 5 days a week, walking another 30 everyday and doing some video excersizing (dancing) 30min when I couldnt get outside to run, also pushups and sit ups with a yoga ball. I am starting back on this now that Im not sick. I have been eating between 1200 and 1500 cal a day with very few exceptions and never ever more than 2000. All of my last bloodwork (september) was good. BGL 79, total colest. 145, and BP was normal.  the obgyn and my family doc said all my blood work was normal, including thyroid.  Since I started Yaz 3 months ago for PCOS, Ive lost no weight, but Ive lost inches and Ive kept at my diet.  My family doc and my obgyn said Im doing everything right, eating ballanced meals, and working out properly but they cant figure out why its not helping.  We've tweeked it more workouts or less calories a couple times in the last year and even tired a precription diet pill and got no results.  The Yaz has made me have my peroid again, stop loosing hair and some of the extra body hair has stopped. They tried me on Nortel 35 for 2 mos before Yaz and It made me so tired I couldnt function.  My Question:  What else can I do to loose weight? Ive had tons of blood work done and all kinds of tests that come back normal. My family doc said there is nothing else that can be done, but he wants to try me on metaforin for the PCOS. Before I was on birth control for the PCOS, I was gaining weight at 1200 cal a day with excersize.   Im going back to my family doc tommrow. Is there anything else I can do? Is there anything else I need to be checked for or that I might have going on thats causeing this?  At this point I'll do or try anything.  Thank you all so much for your time and effort. have a great day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nikki5,  Sudden withholding of Caffein is not good for your body which had become dependant on its effect. you are experiencing  headaches as a result of the lack of caffein your body is now not getting. If you want to be successful in eliminating the use of Caffein in your every day diet, you need to gradually ween your body off of Caffein . Totally eliminating Cafeine all of a sudden is not reccommended and can result in major health problems.  I suggest you do a process of elimination Start out drinking 1 to 2 cafene drinks a day for a week , then the next week drink 1 a day for the rest of the week, and perhaps by the 3rd week consume a caffeine beverage every other day until  your body becomes less dependant on its effects.\n\n",

Even when it didn't seem to be having much effect it kept me from gaining weight which is another reason i kept taking it. My doctor told me when he gave me the original prescription that it would stop working after a while of using it or it would slowly decrease it's effectiveness with time. He also said when that time came switching to a different pill may be the option if it no longer works.As far as a weight loss reduction plan, no i guess i was not. i was just given the pills to reduce weight.   i have been doing my best with excercising more and becoming more active which is why i probably didn't gain the weight back once i stopped taking the pills about six months ago. but the reason i am looking to start taking them again is because i cannot control my appetite. i think i also eat when i am tired, or stressed out, and i feel if i can get control over my appetite again, i could probably make some healthy changes in my lifestyle for the better.\n\n",

I would really like to lose some weight and have found that phentermine worked very well for me in the past but I believe I have become immune to it because it no longer works for me. My question is, if I take another prescribed diet pill such as bontril, will I be immune to it as well, or since it is a different pill will it work for me? I don't want to invest the money in it if it's not going to do it's job. It had been almost 9months between the last time I took the phentermine and I can't believe within that amount of time that I would become immune to it. I guess I took it for to long a period of time. Anyway, should I go with the bontril, if not can you suggest another diet pill? Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sonshines33, The medications that you are inquiring about would be inadvisable to be used in conjunction. Please consult your physician regarding this matter and also inquire about a nutrition and exercise plan. The following information is provided by the drug interaction checker on Click here!  \"Drug-Drug Interactions phendimetrazine and sertraline (major Drug-Drug)  Description:  GENERALLY AVOID: Several case reports suggest that patients treated with serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) may exhibit an increased sensitivity to sympathomimetic agents. The mechanism of interaction is unclear. The reaction has been reported when fluoxetine was used concomitantly with phentermine, amphetamine, or phenylpropanolamine. Additionally, some sympathomimetic agents (e.g., amphetamines) may possess serotonergic activity and should generally not be administered with SRIs because of the additive risk of serotonin syndrome, which is a rare but serious and potentially fatal condition thought to result from hyperstimulation of brainstem 5-HT1A receptors. The interaction occurred in a patient treated with dexamphetamine approximately 2 weeks after the addition of venlafaxine. The medications were discontinued and the patient was given cyproheptadine for suspected serotonin syndrome, whereupon symptoms promptly resolved. A second episode occurred when dexamphetamine was subsequently resumed and citalopram added. The patient improved following cessation of citalopram on his own, and residual symptoms were successfully treated with cyproheptadine.  MANAGEMENT: In general, amphetamines should not be combined with serotonin reuptake inhibitors. Close monitoring for enhanced sympathomimetic effects is recommended if these agents must be used together. Patients should also be monitored for signs and symptoms of excessive serotonergic activity such as CNS irritability, altered consciousness, confusion, myoclonus, ataxia, abdominal cramping, hyperpyrexia, shivering, pupillary dilation, diaphoresis, hypertension, and tachycardia\".

    "title": "ketosis",
    "content": "I have just started a diet that promotes ketosis as the key to rapid weight loss. This is day 4 and my fingers have become swollen. I had a check up right before I started this diet that included a bone density test, blood work, thyroid, and heart check. Everthing is fine. I am 36 years old and NEED to lose 80 lbs. I began to put that weight on after the birth of my first child, 5 years ago.  I had a second child 13 months later.  Before children, I was extremely active and my average weight was 115 lbs.  I believe that the weight gain has been a product of serious life changes (stay home mom now) and some depression issues.  Are my swollen fingers a serious symptom? I am told that the feelings of weakness and hunger will subside but no one has any info on swollen fingers.  Also have been getting killer headaches.  How long is it safe to do this?  The first 2 to 3 days I felt pretty good until I tried to work out.  My work out seemed to go fine...but afterwards I felt nausea and shaky for the rest of the evening and today...swollen fingers!\n\n",

    "content": "Ketosis is not a natural state the body wants to be in... in fact, in diabetics, a prolonged state of ketosis can result in ketoacidosis, which can be life-threatening.   For the rest of us, ketones are used for energy when glucose (which is the preferred source of fuel for the brain) is insufficient/unavailable because of carbohydrate restriction...  so that might explain the headaches. Also, are you sure you are consuming enough calories in general and drinking enough water?? It is especially important to make sure your fluid intake is adequate when following a low-carb diet because consuming (and digesting and absorbing and utilizing) an excessive amount of protein generates a lot of nitrogenous waste products, which must be flushed out; just keep in mind that there has not been enough research to investigate the effects of excessive protein consumption on kidney function and the renal system as a whole.   Speaking of renal problems, as for the swollen fingers, I would suspect edema (water retention)... and believe it or not, one of the best ways to relieve this problem is to drink more water!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ketosis",
    "content": "Low carb (carbohydrate), high protein diets are the latest dieting craze. However, before you jump on the band wagon, you may want to consider a few things:   Low carb (ketogenic) diets deplete the healthy glycogen (the storage form of glucose) stores in your muscles and liver. When you deplete glycogen stores, you also dehydrate, often causing the scale to drop significantly in the first week or two of the diet. This is usually interpreted as fat loss when it's actually mostly from dehydration and muscle loss. By the way, this is one of the reasons that low carb diets are so popular at the moment - there is a quick initial, but deceptive drop in scale weight.  Glycogenesis (formation of glycogen) occurs in the liver and muscles when adequate quantities of carbohydrates are consumed - very little of this happens on a low carb diet. Glycogenolysis (breakdown of glycogen) occurs when glycogen is broken down to form glucose for use as fuel.  Depletion of muscle glycogen causes you to fatigue easily, and makes exercise and movement uncomfortable. Research indicates that muscle fatigue increases in almost direct proportion to the rate of depletion of muscle glycogen. Bottom line is that you don't feel energetic and you exercise and move less (often without realizing it) which is not good for caloric expenditure and basal metabolic rate (metabolism).  Depletion of muscle glycogen leads to muscle atrophy (loss of muscle). This happens because muscle glycogen (broken down to glucose) is the fuel of choice for the muscle during movement. There is always a fuel mix, but without muscle glycogen, the muscle fibers that contract, even at rest to maintain muscle tone, contract less when glycogen is not immediately available in the muscle. Depletion of muscle glycogen also causes you to exercise and move less than normal which leads to muscle loss and the inability to maintain adequate muscle tone.  Also, in the absence of adequate carbohydrate for fuel, the body initially uses protein (muscle) and fat. the initial phase of muscle depletion is rapid, caused by the use of easily accessed muscle protein for direct metabolism or for conversion to glucose (gluconeogenesis) for fuel. Eating excess protein does not prevent this because there is a caloric deficit.   When insulin levels are chronically too low as they may be in very low carb diets, catabolism (breakdown) of muscle protein increases, and protein synthesis stops.   Loss of muscle causes a decrease in your basal metabolic rate (metabolism). Metabolism happens in the muscle. Less muscle and muscle tone means a slower metabolism which means fewer calories burned 24 hours-a-day.  Some proponents of low carb diets recommend avoiding carbohydrates such as bread, pasta, potatoes, carrots, etc. because of they are high on the glycemic index - causing a sharp rise in insulin. Certain carbohydrates have always been, and will always be the bad guys: candy, cookies, baked goods with added sugar, sugared drinks, processed / refined white breads, pastas, and rice, and any foods with added sugar. These are not good for health or weight loss. However, carbohydrates such as fruits, vegetables, legumes, whole grain breads and pastas, and brown rice are good for health and weight loss. Just like with proteins and fats, these carbohydrates should be eaten in moderation. Large volumes of any proteins, fats or carbohydrates are not conducive to weight loss and health.   The effect of high glycemic foods is often exaggerated. It's does matter, but to a smaller degree than is often portrayed. Also, the total glycemic effect of foods is influenced by the quantity of that food that you eat at a sitting. Smaller meals have a lower overall glycemic effect. Also, we usually eat several types of food at the same time, thereby reducing the average glycemic index of the meal, if higher glycemic foods are eaten. Also, glycemic index values can be misleading because they are based on a standard 50 grams of carbohydrate consumed. It wouldn't take much candy bar to get that, but it would take four cups of carrots. Do you usually eat four cups of carrots at a meal?   Regular exercisers and active people also are less effected by higher glycemic foods because much of the carbohydrate comsumed is immediately used to replenish glycogen stores in the liver and muscle. By the way, if you're interested in lowering insulin levels, there is a great way to do that - exercise and activity.    Much of the weight loss on a low carb, high protein diet, especially in the first few weeks, is actually because of dehydration and muscle loss.   The percentage of people that re-gain the weight they've lost with most methods of weight loss is high, but it's even higher with low carb, high protein diets. This is primarily due to three factors:  1. You have lost muscle. With that comes a slower metabolism which means fewer calories are burned 24 hours-a-day. A loss of muscle during the process of losing weight is almost a guarantee for re-gaining the lost weight, and more.  2. You re-gain the healthy fluid lost because of glycogen depletion.  3. It's difficult to maintain that type of diet long-term.  4. You have not made a change to a long-term healthy lifestyle.   Eating too much fat is just not healthy. I know you've heard of people whose blood levels of cholesterol and triglycerides have decreased while on a low carb, high protein diet. This often happens with weight loss, but it doesn't continue when you're on a diet high in fat. There are literally reams of research over decades that clearly indicates that an increase in consumption of animal products and/or saturated fat leads to increased incidence of heart disease, strokes, gall stones, kidney stones, arthritic symptoms, certain cancers, etc. For example, in comparing countries with varying levels of meat consumption, there is a direct relationship between the volume of meat consumption in a country and the incidence of digestive cancers (stomach, intestines, rectal, etc.).  Sorry to be so winded, but wanted to answer all of your questions.  MaryAnn RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lilysuzanne, I sure do.  Xenicall is the drug that was just approved by the FDA.  Xenical, known chemically as orlistat, blocks intestinal enzymes. So instead of being stored on people's hips, 30 percent of the fat eaten passes straight to the colon for excretion.   In studies, adding Xenical to a diet let people lose about 71/2 pounds more in a year than diet alone, the Food and Drug Administration said.   Because of the way it works, Xenical can also cause intestinal cramping, oily spotting, gas, fecal urgency, and oily or loose stools. Some 27 percent of Xenical users had at least one episode, although the side effects tend to wane the longer people take the drug.   But medical experts warned the drug -- the first that works in the gut instead of targeting the brain to suppress appetite -- is only for obese people on strict diets and can cause unpleasant side effects, especially if someone pops a pill just before indulging in a greasy burger.   Xenical also decreases absorption of the important fat-soluble vitamins A, D, E and K, so users should take vitamin supplements two hours before -- or after -- swallowing Xenical.  All in all, is sounds like a very messy solution.  MaryAnn RN\n\n",

    "title": "Overweight with a physically unique condition",
    "content": "Let me introduce myself.  My name is Thomas, I am 34 years old, and live in Ontario.  Last year, (2004) I weighted in at 570+ lbs, and I was using the hospital laundry scale to get my weight.  I have since dropped to just over 500lbs, about 512lbs at my last weigh in 2 months ago. (Why 2 months ago?  read further, and no vehicle to get to a fairly distant hospital)  I do not consider myself to be unactive, however for the most part, perhaps I am, I sit in front of the computer for over 3 hours each day, and about the same for the TV, if not more.    My intitial weight loss, was using the so called celebrity hollywood diet, homestyled, I couldnt afford the $30 per bottle mix, and found comments online about using 100% pure citrus juices as a subsittute.  From that point, I was reglious about doing this 'diet', and from February 2004 to july 2004, dropped almost 60 lbs.  Became employed, and while attempting to continue the fasting schedule I had given myself, it slowled pettered out.    For over 3 months, this was my schedule, fast 48 hours once a week, fast 24 hours once a week.  I would Variate the days from week to week, occassionally fasting for 2 48 hour periods instead of the above.  Yes, I know it wasnt exactly healthy to do that, however my family DR said, when I told him what I was doing said.. 'right now, it doesnt matter what you do, staying how you are is unhealthy.'  Sometime in the last 5 years, I started to develop a large abdominal lump.  My Family DR has no idea what it is, however his initial thoughts have been discounted, due to 'presentation'.    The lump tends to the right, and is not attached to the penis, it just decends over it.  When I sit in a normal chair, the lump decends, and often reachs to just below my ankles.  (I am 5' 11\").    The skin along the top is while smooth, is harder, and I feel no pain, or substantially less pain then one would expect.  The underside, is 'lumpy' and I have periods where it 'leaks' or 'bleeds' various fluids.  While washing one day, one of the lumps 'opened' and I bled profusely, the hospital packed it up after it was cleaned out.  (I felt a light probing from the sterilizing needle to clean the inside of the wound, but was at no point in discomfort except due to the normal state of my obese body and the small tables in the hospitals.. <G>)  The packing lasted about 12 hours, and the wound closed itself up naturally.  I have extreme mobility problems, and now walk with a cane, which while allows me to walk faster, and further more often, my back is still in pain when I walk, stand (for more then 5 minutes) or sit (longer then 2 hours)  I have had my blood pressure checked, and even had a 'partial physical' and I have a 'clean bill of health' with the exception of my weight.  My Blood pressure while 'high' is still considered high-normal.(I don't have the numbers, sorry..but I suppose I can get them for you if important)   Can anyone give me guidance or assistance in finding out what this thing is so I can help my Dr along?  I check in with him about once a month to see if he has uncovered anything new information wise with my condition)  I don't want a gastric bypass, that is quite simply, coping out.  Besides, it wont help, with my eating habits (I eat many medium-small  meals, more like snacking)  The lump on my abdomen, when weighed on the home scale, I can only guess at it being about 200 lbs itself.  Thomas  I just don't want to be over 500 lbs anymore, I would be in heaven to be under 400 lbs  p.s.  I will get some pictures of it online in a day or so, so please check back for a link.\n\n",

How much research have you done on Gastric Bypass? I know it\u2019s becoming very popular so I\u2019m going to write a little bit about it here incase others are interested in it as well.  Not only do they make the stomach smaller, they re-route the small intestine so that the caloric absorption is different. It also forces you to change the type of food you eat because your body has a \u201cdumping\u201d syndrome. When you eat food high in fat, carbohydrates or sugars, most people experience a bad reaction. You basically learn not to eat bad foods. People that have Gastric Bypass surgery usually have to psychologically qualify for it also by proving that they WANT to lose weight. Some people think they have to eat no matter how satisfied they are. They feel the need to PROVE that Gastric Bypass (or any other weight loss program) WON\u2019T work for them. They aren\u2019t good candidates for this and can cause injury to themselves.\n\n",

My suggestion to you is slowly change your eating habits, fasting is not a healthy way and chanes are, the weight lost that way will come back. You need to get in touch with a nutritionist. Also, start getting some exercize. Take a walk just to the end of the driveway this week. Next week, try to go to the end of the street, slowly increase how far you walk each week. Any exercise is better than none at all. Learn to eat 3 healthy meals a day with frequent HEALTHY snacks in between. fruits and veggies. A bowl of kraft mac n cheese now and a bowl in an hour is not healthy. If you eat the right foods, you can eat enough to fill you without overeating, although a part of wieght loss is learning to deal with hunger, as you stomache is streached very large now, of course you will need a lot of food to take away hunger, but over time, eating less will shrink the stomache.  Gastric bypass is not the easy way out. It is very hard to relearn the proper eating habits, since you can only eat very small amounts of food at a time.2 bites will fill you instead of 2 bowls. But you still have to fight the urge to eat constantly or gastric bypass will not work. Find a different doctor, talk to a nutritionist., and get moving, any exercise is better han none at all.\n\n",

I had no sensation while the scalding hot water was pooring over it for about a minute before the lower skin warmed up and I checked the water temp...  No Pain No pain 3 days into this (yes, I am cleaning the burn every day and placing ointment on it)  [Doing a quick read on edema now, and it sounds alot like what I have.. at least I have something else to present the dr with... going to continue doing research on it..]\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nobody, There is no point in hiding this from you doctor. I will recommend you to fully explain your doctor all medicines you are taking and also that you are starving. The pain is probably due to these reasons and if you hide them from your doctor , he will not be able to treat you at the fullest. I don't think he can judge right away from you physical exam what you have been taking or anything. But he might ask you questions like any medicine you are taking etc. You will have to tell him anyway. Don't work havoc with you health. Do tell about the progress. Take Care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,       I assume the stomach pains are caused from lack of food. Starving is the worst diet to choose because it completely slows down your metabolism, you need food for energy and nutrition. Excercise regularly and eat healthy or your favorite foods at a controlled portion. When you starve your body it will hold onto everything it has for survival because it thinks there is no food. My metaphor: If you don't put gas into your car, you're car will stop working.       Eating breakfast (healthy) is the BEST thing you can do b/c it jump kicks your metabolism, eat light and healthy, excercise portion control. Drinking Green Tea works wonders for your body as well. I usually buy my Green Teas from Stop&Shop which provides many tasty flavors such as blueberry, strawberry/orange, lemon/lime, etc. Green Tea aids in weight loss, heals the body faster from colds/wounds and is full of antioxidants. You can also drink it before bed and you'll find yourself waking up feeling lighter. Like with my metaphor with the car you NEED to fuel your body. When I was in highschool I would starve myself too to lose weight which is the last thing you want to do so I'm telling you I can relate that is why I giving you advice due to personal experience.\n\n",

    "content": "hi, i posted this before but got no reply for whatever reason, so im taking a chance and asking again.  I am a clothes model (im male) and i need to keep myself looking as good as possible. Im fit and healthy but my neck is sagging alot. I am 26 years old and it is NOT sagging because of fat or overweight. The skin is very firm, and there is no fat under the surface. I think it is just sagging because that is my genes, and because i am getting older.  I NEED to try to help this as much as possible and nothing i have done so far has helped. I have tried lots of exersises and none of them helped, and i also have no sugary or fatty foods but its making my slightly under-weight.  Please help if possible. This (sad i know) is one of the most important things in my life at the moment, and its alot more important than it sounds.  p.s. the only way i can better describe it is that my neck use to go UP from my chin to my neck above my adams apple. Then as i got a bit older, it went horizontal like this picture: http://www.nismat.org/ptcor/neck/neck_forw.jpg  and now i am older still it is sloping downwards like this picture: http://www.merryclinic.com/eczema/beforeafter/neck.jpg (but not saggy or wrinkled skin --- that was just an example of the shape)  (neither of those pictures are me, I just found them on the internet to help try to explain what i am talking about.)\n\n",

    "content": "The difference in a few pounds doesnt really change anything much, it brings you to 22.3. That is still within normal limits:  BMI Categories:  Underweight = <18.5  Normal weight = 18.5-24.9  Overweight = 25-29.9  Obesity = BMI of 30 or greater   I wouldnt take numbers that seriously. Now that you have started working out - you might even have a weight INCREASE. This is because muscle weights more than fat & when you start building muscle, you are going to read higher on the scale even though your body structure is changing. So thats the 1st step  -stop reading the scale.   The activities that you are doing are GREAT  The best thing for for weight loss, toning & conditioning is CARDIO CARDIO CARDIO. When you get to the gym 1st thing is get pumped up w/cardio. This can be some treadmill, a bike, stepper..whatever you prefer. Then you hit the circut (or go w/the big boys to the machines -but be careful on any machine that you use that you know proper technique). Every day you should focus on \"something\". So make yourself a schedule...today I'm working legs, tomorrow I'm working arms, next chest, next back..etc...(taking breaks here & there because overtraining will not help you - it will hinder & could hurt you too). This will train your body to know ooh, its Thursday, my body is supposed to be doing this today.  After you are done w/your workout, go back to cardio. If you can get a good 30mins or so on the treadmill as a big finish...you have really done a good workout.   Make sure you drink a lot of water all the time - not just when working out. Water is essential!!! You don't really need to calorie count - just watch what your putting in your body. More protein the better & don't cut your carbs out. A lot of people do away w/carbs all together. This is bad for you. You need carbs!! Just watch the amounts you are putting in you.   All these things together, eventually you will see results. It takes some time before you notice it, but one day your going to start feeling your jeans fit just a little different & you will know you are being successful.  Best of Luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Likes and dislikes for food vary between individuals. It is not because you have a problem with digestion that pineapples were suggested. Early and easy digestion of food helps early stimulation of the 'hunger center' within one's brain that helps people eat.  Basically, there are three 'centers' in the brain that regulate our eating habits. The 'hunger center,' 'appetite center,' and 'satiety center,' all situated within our brains. When the hunger and appetite centers of the brain stimulate the person to eat, the satiety center stimulates the person to STOP eating.   While the 'hunger center' stimulates the person to EAT, the 'appetite center' tells the person WHAT to eat. The 'orders' of the 'appetite center' are more in tune with the eating experiences of the person, including likes and dislikes. It is relatively easy to fight off our appetite center, but nearly impossible to fight off our hunger.   Since your problem seems to be with 'appetite,' my suggestion is to use the 'hunger' to control the 'appetite.' Pineapples apart, daytime fasting until you feel really hungry by the evening may help you determine what you miss most from your taste buds. You may thus discover your likings, discover your appetite.  Hope this helps  bill\n\n",

Its really nice to know someone is like me, thanks for posting!  Although your problem doesnt seem to be as bad as mine, because my problem is seriously affecting my health...i have VERY little energy and im tired ALL the time   At tea/dinner time my ENTIRE diet consists of 7-10 times, which im sure yours is atleast twice that size too.  It really bugs me too, then even though im 2 months off 18, people still think im just being a fussy child!\n\n",

There are many ways that you can take WHAT you like, along w/supplements to make it work for you though. My sister for example, she is a dairy freak, lol. She loves cheese & eats cheese products all the time, forgetting about other important things such as meat, veggies, etc. The way that we eventually were able to get her to eat properly was to make more of the cheese fetish & get her off the same mundain meal (mac & cheese). We started to switch it up w/other things like cheese bread, melted cheese on vegetables, meats cooked in sauces like alfredo chicken, etc. That, along w/a daily supplement did her wonders. She is now no longer under weight & is doing very well.   I would suggest looking into nutrional counseling. There you will be given many reciepe & other ideas to help widen the amount of foods avail to you.   Best of Luck\n\n",

    "title": "Teen, Using Supplements",
    "content": "Ok, I am a 15 year old boy and I am interested in doing some weight training. I have looked into BodyBuilding websites, I don't want to body build but I decided to look into their sites for tips and such, well anyhow they obviously use supplements and such. I am interested in using them to speed up my progress but I am not interested in harming myself so I wanted to find out what is safe for me to use. I have done some reading and such but I want an opinion from people who know about it. Here are some supplements, etc. I have been looking into:  Multi-Vitamins - These are obviously safe for anyone to take so I wont really bother, I just wanted to mention them to be used in conjunction with other stuff I list.  Protein - Once again, obviously safe.  Creatine - To me this appears safe as it is naturally occuring and such. I read that there are no studies proving it harms a teen but there are no actual studies on teens to know. Also it apparently (with current studies) has little to none long term effects, and the regular every day short term stuff.  Antioxidants - Im not sure I actually understand this one so any explaining would be nice. Apparently they consist of naturally occuring vitamin type items that are used to create superoxide dismutase (SOD), catalase, and glutathione peroxidase. These enzymes apparently help decrease damage caused by free radicals. These appear safe to me as well.  Glutamine - Apparently a amino acid abundant in the muscle that helps prevent muscle wasting. Sounds safe to me?  Anabolic Flavones - Non Hormonal Flavones that naturally increase protein synthesis, nitrogen retention, and muscle growth. Im assuming that anything natural should be fairly safe?  HBM - Metabolite of Amino Acid Leucine... Increases Muscle, Maintains Muscle, and Promotes Fat Loss.  ZMA - Zinc and Magnesium Asparate, I believe this is unsafe for me because t increases testosterone... Also increases strength, improves recovery and also sleep.  ALL Feedback is welcome and desired. Thank You!\n\n",

    "content": "Multi-vitamin - Good for you as long as they are the correct vitamins for your gender and age.  Be sure to take with a meal as these can cause stomach upset.  Make sure that your multi-vitamin does not contain the other supplements your are taking so that you don't take too much of a substance for your organs to metabolize.  Protein - 20% of total dietary intake is a recommended protein rate, even for bodybuilders.  Again, too much protein can put stress on organ function.  Creatine - Again, only take the recommended dose, possibly a little less until age 18.  5% chance of stomach problems.  Short term side effects are minimal.  It is believed 12 - 15 year olds are just too young to really be using any supplements. Of course, every person is different and it is best to make your decision with your doctor and parents.  Your body is still growing at least until you are 18.  Long term side effects could be organ damage if you take more than the recommended dose.  AND make sure that you acquire a high quality creatine product.  Antioxidants - Safer and easier for the body to metabolize when they are obtained through eating fruits and vegetables.  Simply put, you'll get better results with fruits and vegetables than you will with antioxidant supplements.  During normal cell metabolism, oxygen molecules (O2) are released into the bloodstream in a non-oxidized state. Known as free radicals, these oxygen molecules naturally want to oxidize and so look for other molecules to bind with. If no antioxidants are present they will bind with other molecules producing compounds, some of which are carcinogenic in nature.  So yes, antioxidants are important, but again better from deep-colored fruits and vegetables.  Glutamine - Glutamine has been tried as an ergogenic aid for bodybuilders, but two small trials failed to find any evidence of benefit.  (Candow DG, Chilibeck PD, Burke DG, et al. Effect of glutamine supplementation combined with resistance training in young adults. Eur J Appl Physiol. 2001;86:142\u2013149; and Antonio J, Sanders MS, Kalman D, et al. The effects of high-dose glutamine ingestion on weightlifting performance. J Strength Cond Res. 2002;16:157\u2013160.)  As a naturally occurring amino acid, glutamine is thought to be a safe supplement when taken at recommended dosages. However, those who are hypersensitive to monosodium glutamate (MSG) should use glutamine with caution, as the body metabolizes glutamine into glutamate. Also, because many anti-epilepsy drugs work by blocking glutamate stimulationin the brain, high dosages of glutamine might conceivably overwhelm these drugs and pose a risk to people with epilepsy.  Finally, in one case report high doses of the supplement L-glutamine (more than 2 g per day) may have triggered episodes of mania in two people not previously known to have bipolar disorder.  So again, only go with recommended dosage.  Anabolic flavones - Exceeding recommended dose will not improve results and may cause serious adverse health effects.  Natural does not always equal safe.  Keep within range for gender, age and physician's recommendations.  HBM / hydroxy-methyl-butyrate - Ineffective alone.  Again, recommended dosing only.  Zinc and Magnesium Asparate - Make sure these are not already in your multi-vitamins.  No, these are not recommended for teens for the reason you mentioned.  Wait a while on this.\n\n",

If you are healthy AND exercising AND eating healthfully, then perhaps the weight you are currently at is your new set-point (even if it isn't quite as thin as you were before the major changes in your life and lifestyle).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am sorry you are having this difficulty.  Below is the definition of food addiction:  Food addiction is a disorder characterized by preoccupation with food, the availability of food and the anticipation of pleasure from the ingestion of food. Food addiction involves the repetitive consumption of food against the individuals better judgment resulting in loss of control and preoccupation or the restriction of food and preoccupation with body weight and image.    Types of food addiction  Anorexia Nervosa is characterized by intense fear of gaining weight. Behavior includes excessive weighing, excessive measuring of body parts, and persistently using a mirror to check body size. Self-esteem is dependent upon body shape and weight. Weight loss is viewed as an impressive achievement and an example of extraordinary self discipline.  Physical implications may include disruption of the menstrual cycle, signs of starvation, thinning of hair or hair loss, bloated feeling, yellowish palms/soles of feet, dry, pasty skin.   Bulimia Nervosa is described as binge eating and compensatory behavior to prevent weight gain. Individuals become ashamed of their eating behavior and attempt to conceal symptoms through rapid consumption of food. They will eat until painfully full and stop if intruded upon. 80-90% of bulimics will induce vomiting. Other behaviors include, misuse of laxatives, fasting and excessive exercise.  Physical implications include, loss of dental enamel, increase of cavities, swollen saliva glands, calluses, scars on hands, irregular menstrual cycle, dependency on laxatives for bowel movements, fluid and electrolyte disturbance.   Compulsive Overeaters use food inappropriately and eventually become addicted to it and lose control over the amount of food they eat. Overeaters demonstrate uncontrollable binge eating without extreme weight control and see that behavior as normal. Overeaters present with moderate to severe obesity, with an average binge eater being 60% overweight. Bingeing episodes consist of carbohydrates and junk food with most binges done in scheduled secrecy.     Because food addiction can cause such severe physical, emotional, mental and social problems it is important to get counseling to understand what has led to this addiction and how to control it.  I recommend you ask your family doctor for a referral to a mental health specialist for help. I wish you success.   Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: There have been many studies done about diet soft drinks and so far they basically show that there is nothing good about them.  They contain a much sodium, which can increase your blood pressure, as well as aspartame which has been linked with cancer more recently.  Another problem of diet drinks is that they contain empty calories that are used to replace foods that you should be eating.  As a former coke addict myself (diet coke that is   ) I can testify to the addicting aspect of diet drinks.  Most persons state they drink them to help them lose weight, when in fact, it tends to do the opposite. The high sodium in them causes water retention which shows as added weight on the scale. By drinking them instead of taking in the nutrients your body needs, your brain causes you to crave food because it needs the vitamins the foods contain, so your appetite actually increases. Also by drinking them you probably are not taking in enough water which is really what your body needs to flush out the toxins that develop through the digestive processes.  I personally would recommend you at least cut down on the consumption if not eliminate it all together, which is what I did, because they have no redeeming qualities that I have found in my studies of them. Kind regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I am actually not a nurse or a health care professional, but I am a diet soda junkie too. I don't think most diet soft drinks contain an excessive amount of sodium (look at the nutrition facts, I think diet coke says 'very low sodium,' and while the use (and safety) of artificial sweeteners is controversial, diet soft drinks are labeled as such because they do NOT contain 'empty calories' or calories at all (or a very negligble amount, <5/serving). Some diet soft drinks contain caffeine, which is a diuretic so they may be dehydrating (though recent findings show that the diuretic effect may not be as significant as once believed). Also, certain types of diet soft drinks-- clear, citrus-flavored sodas in particular-- can contribute to erosion of dental enamel because of their acidity. And finally, drinking a 'diet' beverage does not negate the rest of the meal... that is, you can't order a super-sized fast food meal and a diet soft drink and call it a compromise!  FYI  an empty-calorie food is one that provides a lot of energy (calories) but is 'empty' in the sense that those calories hold very little micronutrient value (vitamins and minerals).\n\n",

Drink plenty of water to avoid that, it can greatly upset the balance of electrolytes wich are vital to heart, muscle and brain function.  If it doesn't come back at least a couple of pounds, see a doctor.  Rapid weight loss is very unhealthy, and a vegan diet is a great challenge to get enough protein and iron, not to mention the other vitamins and minerals.  It would be a good idea to take a one a day multivitamin.\n\n",

You still have to eat healthy even with the smoothie, you have to buy the supplements for appetite control (it's not in the smoothie). These are full of caffeine (green tea, guarana, etc.)  It won't work because you can't just replace meals with a shake and lose weight.  If you lose any, it won't stay off, that's why people who try these things (fad diets) are still overweight, or gain it all back.  Also, you can't stay on fad diets the rest of your life.  Do you really see yourself 5-10 years or more still living on smoothies?  You cannot lose weight effectively and permanently without smaller portions of healthy food, no junk and EXERCISE! (as long as you are cleared by your doctor).  If you do not adopt this healthy lifestyle, you will spend your entire life looking for that perfect diet.  I hope you take my advice and be well.

But, he always falls asleep after eating even very small meals. This can happen at any time of day or night, and may last for anything from 10 minutes to several hours and I can't wake him up. The doctors say that it may some form of narcolepsy and prescribes him dexamphetamine 5mg tabs but really this does not seem to help him much. He does have some food allergies and hay fever but I don't think that this is the problem as he is like this winter and summer. Any information would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You can start by ruling things out, try not to eat anything with sugar, fructose or carbohydrates (white flour, potatoes, oats, wheat, etc) in it for a meal or two and see if you get a headache. It might take a few meals before you start feeling a difference, give it a little time. Eat high protein for a day and see how you feel and than add carbohydrates into the next meal and see if you get a headache. Carbohydrates are sugars for our bodies and if you have hyperglycemia this may trigger headaches for you. The second thing you may want to rule out is salt, try eating low sodium meals for a day and see how you feel. The other thought I had is possible dehydration, this is one of the most common causes of headaches. Your Physician may allow you to have an order to get bloodwork done prior to your appointment so you can have the results for your visit, this will save time for you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I don\u2019t know if this will be much help to you but you may find it interesting. We have lean tissues \u2013 muscle, bone and organs and we have adipose or fat tissue. What you need to do, if you haven\u2019t already done this, is figure out your body fat ratio. The easiest way to do this is by taking a skinfold measurement; it is most accurate when done by a trained tester. A good percentage for most women is between 20% - 25%, when you start falling below 15% body fat (women) you can have disorders such as amenorrhea, osteoporosis and other hormonal related problems. As we age, our fat cells get fatter to hold more calorie storage so, to decrease your percent of body fat and shrink those fat cells down you need to cut the calories you consume and increase the calories you burn. Aerobic exercise is the most effective way to decrease body fat, work with a trainer so you can tone without gaining mass (unless you want muscle mass). As always, consult your Health Care Provider before you start any new diet or exercise program.\n\n",

I am curious as to if this Centrum Performance is causing my problems with sleeping--are there any known causes of this or interactions with Ginseng Root or any other ingredients in this Centrum Performance---although I take the vitamin around 1pm?  Could this be cause me to wake up in the middle of the night--I typically don't have trouble falling asleep, but staying asleep is a problem and have good prolonged sleep is a problem.

I would strongly suggest you contact your physician before making any changes in what you are taking.  You need to be under a physicians care and evaluated for heart damage and hypertension.  Your doctor will be able to tell you whether stopping the ephedra cold turkey or tapering off would be better.  Please let me know how it goes...I care. Carolyn\n\n",

I eat and eat and finally add a couple pounds and within a day or two I'm less then where I began. (I even planted fruit trees and berry bushes so I can graze while I work/play in the yard)  An example.  This summer I lost so much my hips and ribs were poking into my matress making sleep almost impossible.  I ate almost non stop and was very happy when I weighed in at 110lbs (this was 4 weeks ago). Sunday I was bragging to my inlaws about how well my weight was doing and jumped on the scale to see I'm at 101lbs (this explains why my pants have been getting looser again).  I got on the scale again today to find I'm down to 99lbs.  I had noticed phisically I was loosing again but having bought a new matress the pain was'nt there for me to realize how bad it was.   One month I look fine, the next my bones are jutting out and people are saying I look horrible.  I have no health problems.  I eat like a horse (not alot of red meats and I have a fondness for foot long Subway seafood and crab subs).  I take vitamins and while I don't excersise the way I should I do chase after 2 young children non stop.   My father is like I am with this issue but unlike myself I don't think he's in any danger of disapearing altogether.  My mother is short but by no means a small lady.  I don't think this is an inherited thing.  Any ideas??  Thank you in advance, Shannan26\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 19 year old extremely active male who is 6'6\" tall.  As you might imagine, I DO NOT wish to grow any taller.  I am also a college athlete (football) so I weight train year round.  The past 2 months, I have been taking a supplement of concentrated L-arginine.  This is the only supplement that I am taking at the moment.  I have heard that it is quite safe and that it is semi-essential amino acide that aids in protein synthesis in the muscles.  I have also heard that it has a variety of other benefits (all good).  Just recently I have heard that arginine stimulates the release of human growth hormone (HGH) resulting in higher HGH levels in the blood.  Is this true??  I know that HGH is responsible for a multitude of functions throughout the body including long bone growth.  As I said, I do not want to get any taller.  Will the L-arginine supplement result in increase HGH levels ultimately making me taller?? or do I have nothing to worry about?? If HGH is increased, is it significant enough to cause a problem?? Thanks, Tim P.S. I have heard that natrually increased levels of HGH are beneficial especially with regards to the aging process.....any comments??\n\n",

Some medical formulas use lean body mass for various calculations of organ function and medication doses. But it should have no concern to you.   You may wonder why your lean body mass goes up,  as your weight goes up,  even though your height is unchanged.  The reason is that the skeletal muscle mass tends to increase as body fat increases.  The body adapts to increased body weight (fat) through increasing muscle bulk.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all. I am not a specialist in this field. But you must watch the amount of proteins you are taking should be correspond to the amount of excercise that you perform. The problem with high protein diets is if you don't use them to build body mass they can get converted in the liver to fat. So it maybe that you are taking too much protein. Try reducing your protein supplements while maintaining your regular excercise. Don't over excercise either or you'll lose mass. Try to reach the appropriate balance for you. Right now it seems that you are taking too much protein than you transform to mass. So it would be a good idea to reduce that a litte.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nightstar,  Obesity is defined as a body mass index of 30 kg (weight)/meter square (height) or more.  Overweight is a body mass index of 25-29.9 kg (weight)/meter square (height).  A normal body mass index is 19-24 kg (weight)/meter square (height).  How to calculate body mass index? Divide your weight in kilograms by your height in meters squared.   In your case 128 pounds = 58 kg divided by 5 feet 1 inch = 1.525 meters (has to be squared) so 58/2.325625 = 25. Your body mass index indicates that you are a little bit overweight but not obese.  You can start an exercise program after consulting with personal physician to try to keep your weight.

But I seriously like how I look and I feel perfectly fine. So my question is how can I atleast gain 5 to 10 pounds without gaining FAT? This is my diet: Breakfast: Cornflakes with Skim milk, orange juice Lunch: 2 fruit servings (ex:apple and some watermelon)Dinner: normal (Ex: chicken potatoes and veggies or eggs toast and veggies, etc..)  ....Now my mom is trying to make me eat more, so I am adding one piece of whole wheat toast with a couple slices of ham on it for lunch. Do you think this will help me get my period back? What do you suggest? Please help me, thank you. :?\n\n",

If negative you have to know that if you loose too much weight, the brain thinks that you are sick so it stops making the hormones that regulate the menstrual period because it thinks you are not fit to become pregnant and in addition you should not be loosing all that blood if you are sick.  Though you look great and you like what you look lilke, your weight is abnormally low. At 140 pounds, your body mass index was perfect. You did not need to loose weight at that time.  You should abandon the diet regimen that you are sticking to but continue to exercise on regular basis.

However, you should consult a doctor before excercising as not every sport would be suitable for your age, and physique. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I heard on the radio today that the calcium in store-bought milk is not usable to humans because the pasturization process changes the calcium somehow.  I also heard that cooking vegetables at a temperature greater than 120 F likewise makes them far less nutritional to us.  Are these two claims nonsense, or are they true?  If true, why aren't we all dying?  (my guess is that the above claims are false).\n\n",

    "title": "Effects of cooking and pasteurization on food value.",
    "content": "Dear Jeff, Pasteurization slightly reduces the content of a few nutrients, but this reduction has no significance in people's overall diet. The claim that pasteurization reduces the availability of calcium is false.  As for cooking and boiling they may lead to denaturation of certain vitamins. For example:  Vitamins D, E, K are not stable on heating Vitamins A, C, Thiamine are relatively stable and not denatured by cooking.  Cooking does have certain advantages: it improves digestability in certain types of food, and likewise increases palatability. One of the main arguments of raw versus low-temperature cooking is that heating above 104\u00b0F (40\u00b0C) results in progressive enzyme damage; hence, even if you steam your vegetables, your food is \"dead.\" However, such arguments are invalid, and that dietary enzymes have a very minor role in our health, if any.  So to conclude it would be best to eat raw whatever is palatable in that form and not to overcook anything.\n\n",
