    "title": "Differentials for these symptoms.",
    "content": "While answer some questions in some other medical forum over internet there were certain set of symptoms suggesting me a rare disorder.The symptoms are as following- Subject of 16 yrs and weight 118 pounds is presented with chest pain ,frequent palpitations,shortness of breath,pain in back started few days back. PE reveals-Flat feet,protrusion of the spine out ward and sternum(unknown to what degree),wears glasses for myopia. Vitals-Pulse 90 while sitting,124 upon standing.Doraslis pedis pulse is hypovolumic.RR-Normal. patients says he has got low exercise capacity and gets too tired after simple work.Family history of father with structural deformity in chest(don't know to what degree) LAB investigations suggested-ECG,CxR,ECHO. reports are as following-ECHO says LVEF is greater then 65%  Trace mitral regurgitation  Mild tricupsid regurgitation  Estimated RVSP is 34 millimeters of mercury  All of the chambers were a normal size  The aortic root was 27mm  There was no percardial effusion .  Does this report seems to have anything abnormal with the heart suggesting the diagnosis towards rare disorders like Marfans(mostly) and dysautonomia or POTS (Partly)which are also presented with some symptoms mentioned above?Ive answered back to the patient suggesting him to under go General Physical Examination with all lab tests for Marfans and POTS like tilt lamp test and slit light test.when the patient was aware of such disorder he inquired the doc about it and the doc replied You less likely have it.So did not prescribe any other test to him.But still the patients needs help to draw a conclusion.  what does the reports say?what is an explanation for this?Any of the explanations and possible differentials and other inquiries required to help the patient are very much welcome.What else is needed to draw a final conclusion about this patient.\n\n",

    "content": "So, I am a first year medical student and I'm getting these case studies every week in my courses. I am stuck in determining what my patient has and I cannot narrow down the disease/symtoms this patient is having.  Here's the case: 60 year old male with a nose bleed and post operative bleeing. His Thrombin test is 11 and bleeding time is 4 minutes. Normal pool and Asborbed pool corrected his PT and APTT values, which were high in the beginning.  I could only narrow down to the patient is taking a drug that is causing his clots not to form within his body. There's no history of a heart attack but surgery indicates he could just had heart attack.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.   Savanna\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for the delay.  You've probably already figured this out by now.    As this is an assignment, I don't generally give answers but I'll give you some help that may put you in the right direction.  First, considering that the PT and aPTT were both abnormal, this excludes anything that would cause an isolated elevation of one or the other, essentially moving the issue down to the common pathway (with a few exceptions).  The normal pool and absorbed pool blood refer to mixing studies where the patient's blood and the control blood are mixed together.  Then the clotting times are tested.  If there is something in the blood that is preventing clotting then this compound would not be removed by doing the mixing study and the clotting times will not correct. If there is something lacking in the blood that is needed to clot, the normal blood will have it and will allow the clotting time to normalize.  Does this give you some ideas about how to proceed?  Best of luck in medical school.  Medicine is a wonderful career.\n\n",

Would you tell me how the potential emotional effect of traumatic events on individuals is diagnosed?  2. Can you tell me in what way are the effects traumatic events cumulative?  3. Can the emotional impact of crises be weighed against each other (for instance can people say that a death in the immediate family is more stressful than loosing a job)? Are there any statistics measuring the emotional effects of various stressful events that you can post or email to me?   marburns@iupui.edu\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Marvin ,  I am sorry I am not qualified in this branch of medicine however, I can tell u some general information from my readings and personal experience for the emotional effects of traumatic events.  The potential emotional effects of traumatic events can range from minor symptoms as an extension of normal sadness to more severe symptoms associated with discrete disorders( affective disorders).  Sadness or simple unhappiness affects us all from time to time. Its reasons are usually known and symptoms disappear with time or with disappearance of the reason. Grief is a more profound sense of dysphoria which follows sever loss or trauma. It might procced to a major depressive syndrome however, when time distance the event , symptoms disappear.  Affective disorders are either minor or major.  Minor disorder in response to trauma is usually a minor depression disorder which is a chronic disorder of low mode and or anhedonia. In which symptoms are intermittent in at least 2 years. Major depressive disorders are more sever symptoms and signs of depression. Both require treatment.  Somatic distress include sense of weakness, shortness of breath, tightness of throat, weight loss, palpitations, etc.  As you can see the effect of trauma can be diagnosed clinically by symptoms and signs the individual complaints. Also we can say that there are some scales that determine depression severity that can also test for changes over time with treatment (Beck depression inventory of 17 questions and the Hamilton rating scale of 17-21 questions). There are also non-specific blood tests for serum level of hormones like ACTH, TSH, their metabolites in urine and dexamethasone suppression test. What is very interesting is the effect in the immune system in the form of decreased immune function and natural killer cell activity. Increased rate of heart disease and malignancy and death in the first year after loss are common. Keep in mind that some people might react to stress with hypomania or bipolar disorders.  I have no statistical data to tell.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "tylonol contains diphenhydramine (an antihistamine) and acetaminophen. Acetaminophen is more of a pure analgesic or pain medicine and is not a non steroidal anti inflamatory (NSAID). The good thing about it is it can be mixed with NSAIDs to get extra pain relief. Acetaminophen is safe and effective,but it does have limits. You can take regular-strength tablets (325mg.) every four hours to a maximum of 12 in a 24-hour period,or extra-strength tablets (500 mg.) every six hours,to a maximum of 8 tablets in a 24 hour period. Be careful about exceeding those limits,a serious overdose can cause permanent liver damage which is morelikely to occur with drinking alcho. Acetaminophen recently,has been shown by recent tests,regarding high doses#i.e., 2 to 4 grams of it per day,can actually cause bleeding ulcers and stomach problems at high doses,which is a new finding. It was previously thought that acetaminophen was perfectly safe on the stomach.Tylonol has mutiple-strength tablets,with the stronger ones having codien-base in them. Tylonol is harder on the stomach vs acetaminophen. i really have no good idea about its use in anorexia however its rule as analgesic is well established.[/size Thanks for using our website.www.doctorslounge.com\n\n",

    "title": "liver functions",
    "content": "Liver functions:  Protein metabolism: NH3 liberated from protein catabolism is toxic to cells and is transformed into urea in side the liver cells to be excreted in urine. Live represents the main site for elimination of ammonia. Deamination of amino acids and their conversion into other compounds like carbohydrates or lipids takes place in the liver and to lesser extent in other tissues. liver is the main site of synthesis of plasma proteins( globulin, albumin, fibrinogen, lipoproteins and other coagulation factors). All non essential amino acids are synthesized in the liver. Defect in liver function leads to increase of amonia level and amonia encephalopathy however, this is feature of late liver disease with liver failure.  Carbohydrate metabolism: liver is the main site for glycogen synthesis and storage. when the level of glucose is elevated glycogenesis takes place. While during fasting glycogenolysis which degrade glycogen provide blood with glucose. Moreover in prolonged starvation liver is the main site for gluconeogenesis. By which amino acids, lipids and other carbohydrates are transformed into glucose. So liver maintains steady state level of glucose important for cell energy and nutrition. Lipid metabolism: liver is the main site for synthesis of fatty acids from carbohydrate and proteins. It is most active site for B oxidation of fatty acid and formation of acetoacetic acid from acetyl CoA (which is more water soluble) to drive tissues with energy during starvation and or physical exercise. 80% of cholesterol is converted into bile salts in the liver. Synthesis of phospholipids and lipoprotiens occurs in the liver which are essential components in the cell membrane structure.  Synthesis of bile slats and bile secretion: bile acids are synthesized in the liver from cholesterol. Bile secreted from the liver is mixture of bile acids 65%, phospholipids 20%, cholesterol 4%, proteins 5%, billirubin and bile pigments 0.3%. bile acids are in  conjugation with glycine mainly and tuarine (bile salts). 50% of secreted bile is H2o  that contains equivalent amounts of Na and K to that in the plasma however, HCO3 is the major anion while in plasma Cl is the main one, so it is isotonic,. Bile acids are important in lipid digestion and absorption. Also all fat soluble vitamins are absorbed by the aid of bile salts. Defect in bile secretion leads to coagulation defect in few days because of lack vitamin K and subsequently deficient coagulation factor synthesis by the liver. Storage site: liver is the principle storage site for iron, vitamins(A,D and B12). It also synthesize transferrine and transcobalmine which are important in iron and vitamin B12 absorption and transport respectively. Liver synthesises apoferittin protein which form ferittin the storage form of iron in the liver So it protects the body during temporary states of lack of these vitamins. The reserve for vitamin B12 allow the body to stand it is lack in diet up to 4 month.. Billirubin exceretion: Every 120 days RBCs gets more fragile and hemolysed in the reticuloendothelial system(spleen). The heme part is further metabolised to billirubin which is carried by albumin into the circulation to the liver. Then conjugated with glocuronic acid and to lesser extent with sulphuric acid to be secreted in bile. Most of it is excreted in stool. About 5% is converted in the intestine into urobilinogen that excreted through the kidney. Small amount of the unconjugated billirubin circulate in the blood. With conditions of excess hemolysis the amount of billirubin exceeds the capacity of the liver to get rid of it, billirubin may be elevated however, in obstructive disease in the billiary tract the elevated billirubin is the conjugated one. In liver disease both are elevated. And also this is feature of liver cell failure.  Hormones and drug metabolisms: drugs and hormones are either activated or degraded in the liver to be excreted in bile (degradation through oxidation, hydrolysis, carboxylation,, methylation ). These end products may also conjugated or not to be excreted outside the body either through the bile or into urine. Toxicity and or defective action of such compounds results from impaired liver function. Phagocytic function: Von Kupffer cells are one of the reticuloendothelial cells that have phagocytic function . it engulf more than 99% of bacteria reaching the live sinusoids from the intestine through portal circulation (filter system). thanx\n\n",
