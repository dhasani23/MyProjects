    "title": "Coombs Test False Positive (?)",
    "content": "Hi,  I\u00b4d be really grateful if some hematologist gave me a full explanation of the issue I\u00b4ll explain below.  My blood is A (-). My husband's is A (+).  When I was pregnant with my first child, my Coombs Test was negative, and the baby\u00b4s blood was 0 (-), so there was no need for me to get the anti-Rh vaccine.  I had never had any abortions, miscarriages or blood transfusions of any kind.  I am now pregnant with my second child. I'm in week 27. The Coombs Test indicated by my obstetrician in the first trimester of my pregnancy was negative.  When I was in week 25, my obstetrician indicated a new Coombs Test, to see if everything was OK.  Apparently it was not: this time the Coombs Test was positive. I quote what the report says:  \"Coombs Test: POSITIVE. For this test, a commercial pool of antigens containing the antigen D is used. MILD AGGLUTINATION IS PRESENT BUT ONLY IN THE UNDILUTED SAMPLE\".  My obstetrician read this report with a \"I don\u00b4t understand what's going on\" face, and immediately assumed that the result was a false positive, maybe because the Coombs Test results in the first trimester of the pregnancy were negative.   He told me that the Test should be repeated, this time in another laboratory. When I commented the situation to the hematologists in the second laboratory they told me false positives were common, and they also said: \"Who knows which technique they used in the other laboratory\" --which, of course, eased my nerves as much as if they had told me \"Your blood group and Rh factor will depend on the technique used by the lab where the test to find those data out is performed. In one lab you may get an a A (-), and in another maybe a B (+).\"  Coming back to the main subject, yesterday I was given the report of the second Coombs Test, and this is what the report says:  \"IRREGULAR SERUM ANTIBODY DETECTION:  ABSENT*. (*) Commercial Immucor panel, batch No 12359, in Coombs-albumin and PEG-antilgG media.  My next appointment with my obstetrician is not till next Wednesday. I don\u00b4t think he\u00b4ll give me a deep explanation of the reasons behind the discrepancy between the results of the first Coombs test and the second one conducted in a different laboratory. And I\u00b4m sure he\u00b4ll automatically think that the second result (i.e., the absence of antibodies) is the right one, maybe without indicating a third test to find out which of the previous two ones is the true one.  My question is: How do false positives work in Coombs tests? Why something as concrete and specific as what it says in the first test's results (\"MILD AGGLUTINATION IS PRESENT BUT ONLY IN THE UNDILUTED SAMPLE\") would be false (as my obstetrician immediately assumed) and a negative result would be true one?  In my opinion (but of course, I\u00b4m not a doctor), the negative result obtained in the second test is more suspicious than the positive result obtained in the first test, for the simple reason that what is there, is there, but what is not there may show later, or maybe is hidden or has been missed by the lab technician... I don\u00b4t know. Doesn\u00b4t it work like home pregnancy tests? When  they're positive, there\u00b4s no mistake and you\u00b4re pregnant, but when they\u00b4re negative, the result is not certain, and you may be pregnant or you may be not.  Thanks in advance. Best regards,  M.M. Buenos Aires, Argentina\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Coombs Test False Positive (?)",
    "content": "Hello M.M.,  Lab tests can be tricky to interpret.  Believe it or not, even a positive pregnancy test can be a false positive.  Regarding your first coombs test, mild agglutination only in the first tube means there is minimal positivity.  The way the test works is a technician runs the sample to see if any agglutination occurs (this is basically sticking together of the red cells).  If it does they dilute the sample by 1/2 and run the test again.  This process is continued until agglutination is no longer seen.  The level at which the last agglutination is seen is referred to as the titer.  (For example, if 5 dilutions were done the concentration becomes 1:32 so the titer is 32.)  The agglutination reading is a bit subjective.  If only a small amount is seen this can occur for various reasons.  The Rh antigen is very antigenic, meaning it creates a vigorous response so a very low level is suspicious for not being correct.    Similarly, though, a test can also be false negative.  Determining which was correct can be tricky.  Your doctor likely considered multiple factors in making this decision.  As an aside, for an Rh negative woman, giving RhoGam (the \"Rh vaccine\") is generally done regardless of the coombs results.  This is because the goal is to prevent the development of Rh antibodies.  Giving RhoGam once someone is Rh positive is ineffective.  The danger is that we won't know if the baby is Rh + until after birth, at which point it is likely too late for the RhoGam to be effective.  Giving RhoGam during the pregnancy is harmless to the baby, even if the baby is Rh negative because the concentration is not very high (high enough to be effective but not harm baby).    I would recommend you discuss this with your obstetrician as you may actually be a candidate to receive RhoGam.  If your husband is Rh positive and you have a child that is Rh negative, the chances of future babies being Rh positive is 50% each.  The danger is not for these babies but for future Rh negative babies if you develop Rh antibodies (that can develop from you being exposed to Rh + baby's blood, often during delivery).  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My spleen was removed due to trauma in 1949, when I was 11 years old.  After recovery, no problems. (But I did develop an appetite for the first time in my life!) In 1980, I had a huge hemorrhagic adrenal cyst removed. The surgeon told me that my spleen had grown back because I was a kid.  He said that my entire left side was full of spleen and there was spleen tissue scattered all around my abdomen.  I know the spleen has a large part in the immune system and in filtering the blood.  Could all of this extra spleen tissue  be responsible for auto-immune problems?  In the past 10 yrs or so I have developed psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis and PMR as well as osteo-arthritis.  I have also been borderline anemic for at least the past 50 years.  Most other labs normal, except for sed rates which run 40 to 60 mm/hr All of the anti-inflamatory meds they have me on (MTX, Remicade, cortisone etc.) do not seem to have weakened my immune system.  (I've had 1 cold in the past 8 years.)  Just curious, I don't reall want to have anothe splenectomy! Thanks, Dalgam\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have not provided a full set of laboratory values which are highly important in deciphering them. For example, you have left out the mean corpuscular volume (MCV).  Lymphocytosis is a fairly common occurrence and is seen at some point of time in most people's lives, usually in association with viral infections. Lymphocytosis is commonly short lived, and extensive investigations of such cases is not usually needed.  There are many other uncommon causes of absolute Lymphocytosis which include, - viral infections (infectious mononucleosis, cytomegalovirus infections, hepatitis) etc, - protozoal infections(toxaplasmosis,trypanasomiasis), - acute bacterial infections(pertussis), - chronic intracellular bacterial infections(brucellosis, tuberculosis), - acute lymphoblastic leukemia, and - chronic lymphocytic leukemia.  Your ESR is elevated, the absolute lymphocyte count is just above normal and your description raises a suspicion of enlarged lymph nodes in your neck. This picture raises suspicion of this being due to infectious mononucleosis. If an individual with this kind of a picture happens to be residing in a tuberculosis prevalent area, tuberculosis also needs to be considered in the differential diagnosis. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As you have not mentioned about your HIV serostatus, I assume that you are immunocompetent. Also you have not mentioned about the platelet count.  Several mechanisms have been proposed on the effect of Cytomegalovirus (CMV) on hematopoiesis in immunocompetent hosts. One postulated mechanism is a  direct effect of CMV on bone marrow cells leading to cellular injury and pancytopenia. Several in vitro studies have shown the ability of certain strains of CMV to infect hematopoietic progenitor cells and subsequently inhibit hemopoiesis. In addition, it has been suggested that CMV infection results in downregulation of granulocyte-colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) and hematopoietic suppression. CMV antigen may be detected in the bone marrow. Reticulocyte count in peripheral blood, an indirect marker of bone marrow erythroid cell line function, may show a marked decrease.   There is yet another mechanism for the pancytopenia observed in CMV and Epstein-Barr (EBV) virus infections  is known as  Hemophagocytosis [Hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (HLH)]. Triggered by these viruses,  HLH could result in proliferation of mature histiocytes that destroy hematopoietic cells. Hyperproduction of cytokines, including interferon-g and tumor necrosis factor-a, by EBV-infected T lymphocytes may play a role in the pathogenesis of HLH.  One interesting and important observation has been that some cases of HLH are known to be precipitated by infections due to non-viral pathogens. This is important clinically because, treatment of the underlying infection often results in improvement of the HLH.    Although hemophagocytic syndrome typically occurs in patients with malignant diseases, acquired immunodeficiency syndrome, bone marrow or solid organ transplantation and in those with autoimmune diseases receiving immunomodulating therapies, very few cases have been reported in immunocompetent patients. A familial form of the disease (familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis) has also been identified.  In aplastic anemias, a mild macrocytosis is frequently observed.    In HIV infections, there are several causes for pancytopenia which I will not be discussing here. Hemophagocytosis is a strong contender to be considered in your case. Best wishes!\n\n",

However, there are some studies that have have observed that hemochromatosis in fact, may have a protective effect against a tubercular infection.  Access to iron (Fe) is important for growth and replication of human pathogens that multiply mainly in iron-rich macrophages, including Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb). In addition to decreased access to Fe, M.tb residing within macrophages fromindividuals with hemochromatosis exhibited a 50% decrease in the rate of growth relative to that seen in macrophages from healthy controls.  Thus, increased Fe in the macrophages offers a possible protection against many virulent species of bacteria that multiply mainly in macrophages, such as Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Yersinia pestis.

    "title": "Methemaglobinemia and Dental Work?",
    "content": "Back in 2004 I went into the ER for severe abdominal pain and ended up having to undergo emergency surgery. My appendix and left ovary and filopean tube were removed (the latter due to a cyst that turned into a benign tumor). Because I had retrograde menestration, a tube was inserted down my nose into my abdominal cavity to try to siphon out the dried blood. This, unfortunately, made my throat very sore.  To treat the sore throat in the ER, I was given a product called Hurricane Spray. It was left at my bedside and I was instructed that I could use it whenever I felt that it was needed. After a period of a few hours, my fingernails and lips started turning blue and my oxygen stats started dropping. I ended up spending the night in the ICU where I was eventually diagnosed with Methemaglobinemia. The doctors in the ICU believed that I had an adverse reaction to the benzocaine found in the Hurricane Spray. We were provided with a list that had other medications/inhalents, ect. that could trigger this effect. I was advised to avoid anything found on the list. \"Caine\" medications was one of the items on the long list.   On the flip side of this coin, as a child I had used Children's Orajel (containing benzocaine) for when I was loosing my baby teeth, and as a two-year-old, I had to undergo dental surgery when I fell and split my lip and gums open. I was put under with laughing gas for this procedure, but would assume, since laughing gas is not a pain killer, I would also have to have had some sort of \"caine\" at that point. I never had a problem. I don't know if the Methemaglobinemia incident in the hospital was a case of overdose on the Hurricane Spray or if I've become super-sensitive to \"caines\" as I've aged. I've never seen any doctor for my Methehemaglobinemia issues.  My problem is now that I've finally decided I need to see a dentist for the first time in some 12 years or so. I'm suspect that I may have a few cavities (though they're not painful) and in the past, my dentist said that I had a narrow jaw and all my wisdom teeth would have to be extracted at some point. Obviously, dentists will use products such as benzocaine, prilocaine, lidocaine, ect. as a local anestetic for dental procedures. Having a history of an episode of Methemaglobinemia with benzocaine is there any local anestestic medication I can take that won't trigger this effect? Is there anything I can do?  With me also having high blood pressure and Mitral Valve Prolpase, I really don't want to have to go under general anestesia for something as simple as a tooth filling.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your description of the bone marrow picture lacks clarity and detail. Is it possible that you mean dysgranulopoiesis?  Dysgranulopoiesis is characterized  by abnormal nuclear configuration (hypo or  hypersegmented, or bizarrely segmented nuclei) and abnormal cytoplasmic granulation (hypogranularity or abnormal granules). Pseudo Pelger-H\u00fcet neutrophils are frequently seen. Dysgranulopoiesis may occur in a variety of myeloproliferative or myelodysplastic syndromes and in some cases of primary or secondary AML. Chromosome 17p deletion has been reported to be strongly associated with dysgranulopoiesis in MDS and AML. Dysgranulopoiesis has been noted to occur shortly before CML transformation.   The bone marrow picture that you describe, in some ways, suggests a myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) with erythroid hypoplasia with a suspicion of early CML transformation.It will be better if you could send a clear description of the bone marrow picture so that a meaningful interpretation becomes possible. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 16 y/o F with High RBC HGB HCT and low MCH MCHC MPV",
    "content": "Hi, Your laboratory test results do show a raised RBC count and the RBC indices indicate a hypochromic microcytic picture with a normal RDW.  Generally, a suspicion of Iron deficiency anemia (as it is the commonest) often begins with the finding of \u2018microcytosis\u2019(smaller than normal sized RBCs) and 'hypochromia\" (paler than normal RBCs) on a blood smear. In the not so distant past, microcytosis and anisocytosis were diagnosed based on stained peripheral blood smears. Nowadays, automated blood analysers provide parameters such as HgB, red cell indices, RDW as well as others.  Faced with a situation of microcytosis and hypochromia, often, the temptation to jump to a diagnosis of Iron deficiency. Thalassemia must always be excluded before a decision to prescribe iron is made.More so,in populations in which thalassemias are prevalent.   Differentiating iron deficiency anemia and thalassemias (with their very heterogeneous nature) can be challenging. Usually iron deficiency can be ruled out using free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), transferrin saturation or ferritin as a screening test. But diagnostic dilemmas do occur.  Efforts on to find ways of improving the sensitivity and specificity of tests to separate out iron deficiency from thalassemia traits. Various discrimination indices (such as Shine Lal index, Mentzer's index, England and Fraser idex and several others) have been used for this discrimination. Osmotic fragility test is one other test that may help in some cases.  All these still lack an ideal discrimination index. RDW is another index frequently available as part of the reports in the automated analysers.This index has further been refined as RDW- SD (stands for Standard Deviation) and RDW-CV (stands for Coefficient Variation).   thalassemia trait: In this situation, the affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia, reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The red blood cell count is usually increased to over 5.5 x 1012/L. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is usually increased. Alpha thalassemia is common throughout parts of the world where malaria is endemic and is common in people of Asian, African, and Mediterranean heritage.  Beta thalassemia trait: In this, the affected individuals have minimal clinical manifestations, usually manifested as a borderline anemia with disproportionate microcytosis and a reciprocally high RBC count. They also have a normal (12.7-16.3%) or near normal (up to 17%) red cell distribution width.  The distinguishing finding in beta thalassemia is a hemoglobin electrophoresis with the finding of elevated minor hemoglobins Hgb A2 and F. Both will be increased in beta thalassemia trait without iron deficiency, and will be normal or decreased in alpha thalassemia and isolated iron deficiency anemia. However, it is good to remember that rarely some individuals with beta-thalassemia also have normal levels of Hb A2 and Hb F and if both alpha and beta thalassemia coexist, the changes in Hgb A2 and F may not be apparent.  It has also been observed that a high erythrocyte count is a common feature of iron deficiency anemia in infants and young children, more so in those with mild anemia. It appears that high erythrocyte counts cannot be regarded as a reliable preliminary parameter in differentiating iron deficiency from thalassemias in infants and children aged up to 48 months.  In your case, the laboratory values provided suggest what could be a beta-thalassemia trait. Firstly, consult your doctor and discuss these test results.It may not be a bad idea to have these tests repeated and include a reticulocyte count. If you happen to be from a thalassemia prevalent area, a hemoglobin electrophoresis is all the more appropriate. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Painful Lump in Back of neck raised WBC for months went down",
    "content": "I am so hopefull that maybe someone can have some insight into medical problems I have been dealing with for 4 months. Initially I went to see my Primary care doctor for painful swelling and lump on the back of my neck by the base of my upper back because it had become so painful I couldnt stand it at work. He initially said he thought it was a ball of muscle spasm and prescribed Soma and methylpresnison 6 day pack. I went back to see him a few weeks later and swelling did not go down despite having been on the steroids but energy level was terrible prior and had somewhat improved ( I must note other symptoms I had were redness with non itchy spots and swelling on my arms and hands that also disappeared with the steroids but came back within days of completing the pack). He ordered bloodwork and another 6 day pack of methylprednisone and to go back a few weeks later. Once again redness and swelling of arms and hands went down but not back of neck which pain seemed to have worsened in that I was also getting pains in hands and what felt like rigidness that would cause me at times to drop things. My doctor therefore ordered a ct scan of my neck.....went back a few weeks later and was told swelling and glandular problem was seen of lymph node and  wbc from the bloodworks he had been performing were consistently high....ct scan suggested possible non hodgkins lymphoma and was referred to oncologist. A week later when I saw the oncologist all of sudden after several months of high wbc it went down to 9.9...he therefore told me it is most likely auto-immune and did tests for that having follow up a month later. When I returned wbc still was in normal range although mid was slightly elevated and he said all autoimmune tests came back normal that maybe I have firbromyalgia to see a rheumatologist. I went to a rheumatologist who currently has me on prednison 5mg 2x a day to control the rashes and swelling of arms and hands (neck is still painful and lump is still same)...he said he does not feel I have fibromyalgia but is not sure what is going on and wanted me to do another ct scan since once again lupus/ra came back negative. I am awaiting the new ct results and very frustrated as months have gone by .....is it possible that this is still lymphoma since no biopsy or testing was done other than bloodwork? The pain seems to have progressed over the last months and I am really worried so much time is going by with no diagnosis (note...symptoms have been so bad both rheumatologist and primary care have had me out on short term disability and have had many problems with everyday functions). Any suggestions or help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Mild thrombocytopenia is what you have and 150,000 to 450,000 is the range.This may not be of significance in your case.However a bleeding or clotting disorder may prompt for further testing and a bone-marrow.Enlargement of spleen again is a pointer for further investigations.Drugs taken also can lower the count.Auto immune disorders,bacterial infections,idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura are some of the conditions lowering the platelet count. Your doctor is right in his suggestion and get repeat test after sometime. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,A low ferritin represents lower iron body storage.The jump in iron levels might indicate improvement either due to therapy or better diet. Macrocytosis with out anemia can be physiological.This variation may also be seen in family members and thus may be considered as hereditary and would not need investigations in the absence of clinical features.To determine the cause of macrocytosis could be challenging if there is associated iron deficiency or a thallesemia trait.Hepatitis,liver disease,alcoholism, hypothyroidism could all present macrocytosis.Presumably alcohol has direct effect on red cell morphology.Increased reticulocyte count polychromasia,and nucleated RBC may suggest a bleed or hemolysis. If there are immature cells in the peripheral smears or cytopenias a bonemarrow is required. Do consult a hematologist.Best wishes.\n\n",

Next to the important question about your marriage.The condition you have inherited is autosomal recessive.That means that the children could inherit the disease only if the partner also carries the gene.This can happen more in close relation marriages.For example your mother and father have carried the genes with out disease.Now hypothetically,in 4 children,one child would normal,two would be carriers,one child carrying both abnormal genes, at risk of disease.The two otherwise normal would be carriers. In a nut shell two abnormal genes must be present to risk development of disease in an Autosomal recessive condition.You must get genetic counselling to make sure you have no problems.PCR Analysis is used to detect carriers and also in antenatal diagnosis.

When I was admitted, my CPK and ALT levels were perfectly fine, but after a couple days they both spiked.  The CPK went to 4000, and the ALT to 1600.  I was quite nauseous at the time, dizzy, and very weak.  It's now a week from being released and I feel perfectly fine, but I'm still not cleared to start playing soccer because the 9000 CPK.  I'm no longer nauseous, my appetite is back, I don't feel dizzy, my liver is back to normal, I'm drinking a ton of water...I have no clue what's wrong--and neither does my doctor.

Diagnosis is by testing for urinary 5-HIAA.Polycythemia can also lead to excessive sweating,itching,and giddiness associated with high Hb and high concentration of red blood cells.Average age of diagnosis is around 60 years for polycythemias.Itching after bath occurs as a specific feature in some patients with polycythemia vera. While I have narrated some clinical conditions relating to sweating in your case may be related to your hyperthyroid state.May be you may need to get another review of your thyroid status.Do consult your physician.

    "content": "Hi, Hi, From  a surgical perspective, i note that you have not mentioned the cause of hyperthyroidism in your case. Was it Graves' disease or a toxic adenoma or something else.The reason why it is important is that Graves' diseae, is usually associated with anemia, rather than erythrocytosis or polycythemia. Erythroid bone marrow hyperplasia is commonly seen and usually they develop features of an iron deficiency anemia as this condition often affects menstuating women.  One condition that can cause nocturnal sweating is hypoglycemia. This may be, - chronic idiopathic hypoglycemia, - hypoglycemia associated with insulin therapy in diabetics, or - caused by insulinomas.  Insulinomas may be - sporadic or - occur in association with multiple endocrine neoplasia (MEN 1).  Insulinomas generally need the presence of the 'Whipple triad' and laboratory evidence of hyperinsulinemic hypoglycemia for the diagnosis. But atypical cases do occur, and can be very difficult to diagnose.Sometimes, the hypoglycemia can be purely nocturnal and in such cases, the affected individuals may only recall sweating among the neuroglycopenic symptoms.  The components of MEN 1 syndrome are as follows,  - pitutary tumors,  - Hyperparathyroidism (the most common), - Pancreatic islet cell tumors(the second most common), - insulinomas (20-35% of functional pancreatic islet cell tumors), - gastrinomas, - glucagonomas,  - carcinoid tumors,and - Thyroid adenomas (5-30% of patients). As Dr.Jagesh has suggested, your thyroid function needs to be re-assessed first. If you are euthyroid, then other causes need to be excluded. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High RDW, High Basophils and Myelocytes found",
    "content": "Hi, Unfortunately, your post is devoid of any detail.  There is no information about the actual levels or percentages of the various tests and no details about hemoglobin level or the peripheral blood smear study as well. Therefore, i am left with no option other than to provide some general background information.  Whenever myelocytes are seen in a peripheral blood film, the important next step is to find out if they are - neutophil myelocytes - eosinophil myelocytes, or - basophil myelocytes.  Neutrophil and eosinophil myelocytes can occur both in reactive conditions and in certain leukemias. Basophil myelocytes essentially occur with leukemias.  An Schilling  count may be useful to determine if there is any 'shift to the left'.   The term left shift indicates that there are increased numbers of circulating immature neutrophils (band cells +/- metamyelocytes, myelocytes).   A regenerative left shift is characterized by band cells(immature neutrophils) with leukocytosis. However,the number of immature neutrophils does not exceed 10% of the neutrophils, and no young cells, such as metamyelocytes, are present.This is seen in acute infections(usually bacterial).  A degenerative left shift is characterized by circulating band cells >10%  in conjunction with absence of leukocytosis, with or without the presence of precursors (metamyelocytes or myelocytes) . A degenerative left shift is often an unfavorable prognostic sign.This may be seen in relation to overwhelming infections, myelodysplastic diseases or in leukemias.  Leukoerythroblastosis:  A condition wherein immature nucleated red cells in addition to left-shifted neutrophils and at times even neutrophil precursors (metamyelocytes, myelocytes, promyelocytes), are thrown into the blood by the bone marrow in response to certain insults.  If this is seen in a case with severe anemia (or thrombocytopenia), then it is likely to be a response by a overzealous bone marrow to iron deficiency anemia. On the other hand, if this response is seen with normal hemoglobin levels, then other causes such as a metastatic carcinoma (osseous), or a leukemia is often the cause.  The atypical lymphocytes are difficult to explain. There have been case reports of Myelodysplastic syndromes and Lymphoproliferative disorders occuring simulteneously. \"Concurrent Myelodysplasia and Lymphoproliferation: a Disorder of the True Pluripotential Stem Cell?\" (Q J Med 1985; 55: 199-211).  From the aforementioned facts, it is obvious that you need to get investigated further to elucidate the underlying cause. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated Absolute Lymphcyte Count",
    "content": "Hi LMASC, Thank you for that interesting observation. The laboratory reference ranges indicate the values most supposedly \"normal\" people in a given population will have.So,it is probable that some may have values slightly above or below a given range.    The laboratory reference ranges for 'normal' values vary between various laboratories.  To take the example of the absolute lymphocyte count, some examples of the normal rages(all values/mm3) quoted are such as, 1000-3000(mostly),1000-3500,1000-2900,900-2900,800-2600, 1000-3500 and so on. What finally matters is that the accepted definition of lymphocytosis which is when the count is >4,000/mm3.  It is defined that way perhaps because, most individuals with diseases causing significant lymphocytosis tend to have values >4,000/mm3.  Thus, to go by your laboratory's reference range, you do have a absolute count higher than upper limit of normal but, still if one adheres to the strict definition, you fall short.  Importantly, one should never treat laboratory values. The values should always be viewed in the context of the clinical picture. Best wishes!\n\n",

Just two last questions:  Is it possible for Sjogren's Syndrome to cause an elevated absolute lymphocyte count, an elevated relative lymphocyte count, or both?  Based on my labs and in the absence of any other symptoms, should I be concerned at all about Lymphoma or Leukemia?  My understanding is that Sjogren's does put me at increased risk for Lymphoma, but I am not sure if there is any increased risk for Leukemia?    I'm just not clear as to when elevated counts become 'concerning.'  I would assume that absolute lymph counts would be quite high where Leukemia is concerned, but perhaps you can verify that for me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi LMASC,  Relative lymphocytosis is fairly common in primary Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and is usually of no clinical significance. This picture is an apparent pnenomenon because many patients with this syndrome have mildly lower absolute neutrophil counts.  There have been isolated reports of  - patients with primary sj\u00f6gren's syndrome and T cell large granular lymphocyte (LGL) leukemia. - primary sj\u00f6gren's syndrome associated with other lymphoproliferative disorders that have chronic lymphocytic leukemia-like properties (CD5+ CD20+ cells), and - primary sj\u00f6gren's syndrome with B-cell lymphoma with circulating B-cell (usually CD20+ CD5-) monoclonal cells.  Sj\u00f6gren-like syndrome (SLS): SLS presents clinically with salivary gland enlargement, xerostomia and keratoconjunctivitis sicca.It is believed to be caused by an HIV-induced immune dysregulation.

    "content": "Hi, I have been seeing a hematologist since 2006.  I was diagnosed with Essential Thrombocytosis after having a platelet count of over a million.  I was placed on Hydroxyurea 500mg 1x a day.  I was only being seen once a year so, I requested a referral to another doc.  In the meantime, my regular physician did some fasting labs that showed my vitamin D levels were very low.  The labs also showed that I was very anemic. ( My hemaglobin was down to 6) and my platelet count was elevated as well.  He admitted me for a day to give me 2 units of blood and the next day I had an iron infusion.  He sent me home on prescription vitamin D.  I will soon see the new Hematologist but, I'm wondering if there is something that could be causing all of this?  Will I most likely keep the diagnosis of ETC? Is it normal to have a sudden onset of symptoms like this???  I'm just not getting very many answers and this all started when I was 25.  It was only 5 months after I gave birth to my 2nd child who is coincidentally disabled.  Anything would help.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Very low vitamin D levels, anemia and elevated platelets",
    "content": "Hi. It is understandable that you are concerned about the falling hemoglobin  % and a low vitamin D level.  Calcitriol (1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3) has shown potential in enhancing the antitumor activities of a variety of cytotoxic or differentiating agents (including hydroxyurea). It is possible that your low vitamin D3 level could have had a negative impact on the action of  hydroxyurea. You certainly need active correction of the deficiency.  Essential thrombocythemia is considered to be an indolent disorder and several studies show that usually there is no difference in survival, in comparison to healthy controls, during the first decade after the diagnosis. Life expectancy, however,may show worsening beginning in the early to middle second decade of the disease, with increased mortality related to thrombotic events or to delayed transformation into myelodysplasia, polycythemia vera, acute leukemia, or myelofibrosis.   Progression of essential thrombocythemia (ET) to myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) or acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a rare event in patients who have not received antineoplastic agents. However, this progression has been described in patients with ET treated with hydroxyurea. Therapy with alkylating agents has a leukemogenic risk (about 4.5% at 8 years).  Therapy-related refractory anemia following long-term treatment with hydroxyurea or other nonalkylating agents has been reported in patients receiving hydroxyurea treatment in association with the 17p- syndrome.  17p- syndrome is characterized by \"typical\" dysgranulopo\u00efesis, pseudo Pelger-H\u00fcet hypolobulation and small vacuoles in neutrophils, associate with 17p and p53 mutations.  About 50% of cases occur after prolonged use of alkylating agents and the other half occur after essential thrombocythemia and polycythemia vera treated by hydroxyurea or other nonalkylating agents.  Therefore, you must consult your doctor without delay and get investigated and have your low vitamin D status corrected. Best wishes!\n\n",

Hypersegmented neutrophils may be seen in the following conditions apart from vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiencies. - as a familial feature, - in chronic infections, - following cancer chemotherapy, - in renal failure,and - in some cases of iron deficiency anemia(mechanism unclear).  The importance of Hypersegmented neutrophils in iron deficiency is that in cases where there is a combined deficiency(dominant iron deficiency with early B12 and folic acid deficiency) and there are no macrocytes(masking effect due to iron deficiency), it may lead to a situation where the underlying vitamin B12 or folic acid deficiency may be missed.

    "content": "Hi, The normal reference range for an absolute monocyte count is 40 - 950/\u00b5L. A value >950/\u00b5L is called as Monocytosis.  Monocytosis is seen in some of the following disorders, - recovery phase of many acute infections, - rheumatic diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), - malignant processes (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), - chronic infectious disorders (tuberculosis), - chronic inflammatory bowel disease, - storage diseases (Niemann\u2013Pick disease,Gaucher's disease), - granulomatous diseases: sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X,syphilis, brucellosis, Crohn's disease etc) - Parasites (malaria),& - drugs (methsuximide, griseofulvin, and haloperidol).  There is a paucity on information on conditions where both the absolute neutrophil count and the absolute monocyte are consistently raised together.   A combination of raised monocyte and neutrophil counts were seen to be associated with cardiovascular disease in a relatively healthy elderly population. (Experimental Gerontology, Volume 39, Issue 4, April 2004, Pages 615-619).  Severe hyperlipidemia has been reported to affect the hemogram values(using automated analysers) as follows. - may raise the hemoglobin levels, - may falsely elevate leulocyte counts, - may falsely elevate monocyte counts and  - falsely lower the lymphocyte counts. These fallacies were recognized following manual differential counts. (Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine. Volume 46, Issue 7, Pages 1054\u20131055).  Both your total cholestrol and the LDL cholestrol are in the \"borderline high\" ranges (perhaps not high enough to affect the hemogram values).  Therefore, i would suggest that you should first get these tests repeated. If a similar pattern is seen yet again, one may need to look for separate causes for the leukocytosis and the raised monocyte counts. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Your son's blood parameters though they show some variations do not show any overt abnormality.An absolute neutrophil count when it goes below 1500 needs scrutiny and might get classified as mild neutropenia.Blacks have a lower ANC value.The presentation for neutropenia is presenting with infections.Chronic benign neutropenias familial and non familial are known.These are not problematic.Drugs can induce neutropenia.Immunologic neutropenias,congenital syndromes could also present this in part.Reduction in monocyte values again could lead to infection states. A repeat test may be done but in the absence of any clinical finding may not be of significance.However do consult your doctor who can give you a better correlation. Best wishes.\n\n",

None of the doctors that she has seen have been able to tell her whats causing the nerve damge. Her neuropathy appears to be getting worse as now its moving up her legs.  She had a blood clot in her spleen early in 2009. It was determined at that time that she has 2 copys of the C677T gene.

    "content": "Hi, The methylentetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene has been found to affect oxidative stress status in human body. The gene codes for an enzyme that plays a central role in the folate metabolism.   Nucleotide transition (C to T) at nucleotide 677 of MTHFR causes alanine to valine substitution in the N-terminal catalytic domain, leading to 30% and 65% reduction in activity for heterozygotes and homozygotes of the variant allele, respectively. Reduced activity of MTHFR leads to high blood levels of homocysteine, which gets rapidly auto-oxidized, leading to the production of cytotoxic reactive oxygen species and results in endothelial damage.  There is evidence that (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism is involved in the pathogenesis of glaucomatous optic neuropathy.The two common types of glaucoma include primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and primary closed angle glaucoma (PCAG).The type of glaucoma that may occur seems to be related to ethnicity.    (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphisms may influence hematological and neurological dysfunction in cobalamin-deficient patients.  It Is suspected to cause accelerated atherosclerosis in type 2 diabetic patients.  To answer your specific question, as yet, there is insufficient evidence to conclude that (MTHFR) C677T gene polymorphism causes peripheral neuropathy, macro or microangiopathy. Best wishes!\n\n",

I scored moderate short-term memory loss on a quiz.I get frequent tachycardia, my resting heart rate can be 115 bpm sometimes.I feel very tired. I have had different blood tests to see what the problem is, including b12 and folate. My b12 was 306 pg/ml ( normal range 179-1132). My folate was 5.3 ng/ml ( normal range 3-19). The lab just said that's ok. I have read on the internet though on many sites, that the levels i have of both b12 and folate can still cause lots of problems, that you can still have a deficiency and nerve and psychological problems. The sites advise to check homocysteine levels, and mma. Thing is, i feel embarrassed to go back again to have more tests, i'm living in greece, and they even thought checking b12 and folate was strange because my cbc was normal. I have quite high hb, the lab doesn't differentiate with males and females on the range, mine was 15.7 gr/dl..my mcv is 93.5.I am female. Don't really know what to do at this point. regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: b12 and folate levels",
    "content": "Hi,  Vitamin B12 (Cobalamin) is a collective term for four of the chemical forms of vitamin B-12, - cyanocobalamin (most common form in food supplements, perhaps the weakest form), - methylcobalamin (most potent, neuroprotective function),  - hydroxycobalamin, a precursor to methylcobalamin and adenosylcobalamin. Found in animal protein but not in vegetables. Most stable form(helps in detoxification- esp; cyanide), and  - adenosylcobalamin (synthesis of nucleoproteins,and myelin in nerves).   Optimal serum levels of cobalamin are essential to complete the following three enzymatic reactions.  - Methylcobalamin acts as a cofactor in the conversion of homocysteine (Hcy) to methionine.  - The adenosylcobalamin is required for the conversion of methylmalonyl coenzyme A to succinyl coenzyme A.   - Methylcobalamin is necessary for the conversion of  5-methyltetrahydrofolate to tetrahydrofolate and is essential for DNA synthesis and red blood cell synthesis.  Deficiencies of cobalamin and folic acid result in elevations of Hcy and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels.Studies have shown that this elevation occurs much before the fall in serum levels of vitamin B12 and folic acid.   Clinical cobalamin deficiency: manifests with hematologic or neurologic signs and symptoms, cobalamin levels <200 picograms per milliliter (pg/mL), and elevated  Hcy and methylmalonic acid (MMA) levels.   Subclinical cobalamin deficiency: no obvious clinical signs or symptoms (although some individuals might have subtle neurologic signs), cobalamin levels of 200\u2013350 pg/mL and at least one metabolic abnormality (mildly elevated methylmalonic acid or homocysteine).  Low status of vitamin B12 and folate and increased plasma Hcy have been found in studies conducted on patients with depression. An association between depression and low levels of the two vitamins is found in some studies in the general population. Low plasma or serum folate has also been identified in patients with recurrent mood disorders treated by lithium. A link between depression and low folate has similalrly been found in patients with alcoholism. Low folate levels are furthermore linked to a poor response to antidepressants, and treatment with folic acid is shown to improve response to antidepressants.   In a large population study from Norway, vitamin B12 and folic acid deficiency was associated with increased risk of depression but not anxiety.  The authors conclude thus; \u201cThere is now substantial evidence of a common decrease in serum/red blood cell folate, serum vitamin B12 and an increase in plasma homocysteine in depression. Furthermore, the On the basis of current data, we suggest that oral doses of both folic acid (800 \u00b5g daily) and vitamin B12 (1 mg daily) should be tried to improve treatment outcome in depression\u201d. (J Psychopharmacol  January 2005   vol. 19  no. 1  59-65)  In another study, 3,884 elderly people were screened for depressive symptoms. Folate, vitamin B(12), and homocysteine blood levels were compared in 278 persons who were diagnosed with depressive symptoms. Concluding remarks of the authors is as follows. \u201cThe association of vitamin B(12) and folate with depressive disorders may have different underlying mechanisms. Vitamin B(12) may be causally related to depression, whereas the relation with folate is due to physical comorbidity\u201d. (\u201cVitamin B12, folate, and homocysteine in depression\u201d: the Rotterdam Study. Am J Psychiatry. 2002 Dec;159(12):2099-101)  People with Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism exhibit impaired homocysteine metabolism(elevated levels of homocystine). This polymorphism is more frequently seen in depressive patients in the general population. This gives credence to the association between vitamin B12 deficiency and depression.  (MTHFR) C677T polymorphism also has been seen to increase the overall risk of schizophrenia and severity of negative symptoms.  In the light of these and several other studies, it is quite understandable that your apprehensions are well founded.You can discuss with your psychiatrist about having your RBC folate, Hcy and MMA levels checked, just to be sure. RBC folate levels are more accurate than serum folate levels.  Best wishes!\n\n",

He had been very tired, run down, always w/ dark circles, could be very irritable but also 13... also underweight, 62\" & 84lbs. He has always been skinny though. Anyway, we were going to repeat labs in 3 mo. We were back at dr's for my daughters annual visit, and she also was amazed at the remarkable improvement in his appearance, ordered more labs, this time to r/o celiacs and check for specific levels of iron & b-12.

    "title": "Re: 13yo low WBC & neutrophils, high RDW & monocytes",
    "content": "Hi, The high RDW helps in determining if there is only a B12 and/or folic acid deficiency (with normal RDW showing the red cells are mostly the same size) or with concomitant iron deficiency (a high RDW due to small and large red blood cells).  The normal reference range for an absolute monocyte count is 40 - 950/\u00b5L. A value >950/\u00b5L is called as Monocytosis.  Monocytosis is seen in some of the following disorders, - recovery phase of many acute infections, - chronic infectious disorders (tuberculosis), - chronic inflammatory bowel disease, - rheumatic diseases (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis), - malignant processes (Hodgkin's and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), - granulomatous diseases: sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X,syphilis, brucellosis, Crohn's disease etc) - storage diseases (Niemann\u2013Pick disease,Gaucher's disease), - Parasites (malaria),& - drugs (methsuximide, griseofulvin, and haloperidol).  The slightly increased monocyes in a differential count in the case of your son, indicate need for an absolute monocyte count. As your doctor suspects, Crohn's disease can be one of the possibilities.   Many children with myelodysplasia syndrome(MDS), may exhibit monocytosis. Most of these cases will also have blasts(>5%), without an excess of blasts in the bone marrow.The presence of blasts in the blood may lead to this condition being labeled as juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia(JMML).  Your son has indeed responded to vitamin B12 and folic acid. However, other tests to assess the iron status such as transferrin saturation may be needed as the ferritin value, although seemingly within range(closer to the lower limit of normal), may still be associated with depleted iron stores.  You next step, at least as far as this forum is concerned, should be to provide us all the test results of your son (the complete blood count, reticulocyte count, absolute monocye count, ESR, peripheral smear examination etc), so that it may be possible to narrow down the differential diagnoses.

The surgeon said she is doing great, everything went perfectly.  2 days later she became very nauseated they emptied her stomach, then took her for a C.A.T scan, on the way she went white and limp.  They treated her for low electrolytes, and had to do a blood transfusion.  They gave her 8 pints of blood in a 24 hour time frame because her hemoglobin levels were not stable.  After her 8th pint of blood her hemoglobin got up to 11.  The next morning it dropped to 7.7 then back up to 9.5 by 11am.  The doctors have run multiple tests, but nothing is showing up.  Her white blood count is normal, she has no evident bleed outs, her spleen is slightly swollen, and lab results show no sign of red blood cells attaching themselves.  She is doing great other than blood pressure and hemoglobin levels not staying consistent.  My question is; where is the blood going?  Why can we not keep her hemoglobin levels consistent?  How much longer can we give her infusions before it becomes unsafe?  Thank you for any advice/answers, Very Worried\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Transfusion of 8 pints, where is the blood going?",
    "content": "Hi, There seems to be general consensus that Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) is an efficacious and cost-effective means of alleviating pain and restoring function in individuals with end-stage arthritis of the knee. Published studies in the literature have consistently lent support to validate this view. But, there is a lot of ongoing debate about the benefits and potential risks of  simultaneous bilateral TKA procedures.  The surgical options available for these patients include  - a staged (\u201cstaggered\u201d) procedure, with a certain time interval between 2 procedures,  and - Simultaneous knee arthroplasty (one-stage bilateral knee replacement).  The simultaneous arthroplasty procedures may be, - conducted by a single team of surgeons, one side followed by another, or -  two separate teams, one for knee, operating simultaneously.  Quoted advantages of simultaneous bilateral TKA include, - only one exposure to the anesthetic, - limiting a major surgical procedure to a single event and  - feasibility of symmetrical rehabilitation of both knees, thus shorter rehabilitation and early recovery, and  - reduction in the length of the hospital stay and thereby the ultimate costs.  Quoted disadvantages include, - prolonged sugery and  exposure to the anesthetic, - comparatively more intra-operative bleeding and transfusion needs.  These overall risks appear to be higher in patients >80 years of age as they frequently have more co-morbidities.  Several factors are being investigated as potential contributing factors for the excessive bleeding that may occur during or following simultaneous bilateral TKA procedures.   - technique(cemented vs uncemented), - age (young vs older), - co-morbidities, - pre-operative hemoglobin levels(lower the level- as in rheumatoid arthritis, increases risk), - overall tourniquet time (higher the time, risk seems to increase), - continuous vs intermittent release of tourniquet during the procedure, - release of tourniquet before vs after skin closure, - suction drain vs no-drain (some studies have noted a considerable increase in blood loss by suction drainage in the patients who had an uncemented prosthesis), - hypotensive anesthesia vs normotensive anesthesia (hypotensive anesthesia   has been shown to reduce blood loss by about 43% in major joint replacement surgeries) and - hypothermia (higher risk in prolonged procedures and in the elderly individuals)  Often, the patients final hemoglobin depends upon, - the pre-operative hemoglobin, - the amount of blood transfused and - the amount of crystalloids infused (dilutional effect).  In the case of your grandmother, it is not possible to say with conviction what caused the low hemoglobins despite transfusions, but it is more likely to be multi-factorial. Hypothermia needs to be ruled out, corrected if present and prevented. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 yr old female, professional marathon runner.  I just had a routine blood test and noticed my FERRITIN level is high at 391 ng/ml (over double the reference range).  My iron is normal at 84 ug/dL.  My hemoglobin and hematocrit levels are fine at 14.1 and 41.0 respectively.  The only other level that was high was the GGT at 79 IU/L.  That seems almost double what it should be.    I am concerned about the elevated ferritin and GGT levels.  From my own research on the web it seems that a high GGT level can be from alchohol abuse (among other things) but I don't drink.  I am very healthy in my lifestyle.    Are the GGT level and ferritin levels related?    I train VERY hard, twice a day, and this can be very taxing on my liver.  Could this be the cause of high ferritin and GGT?  My racing season has been just so-so this year and I think it is because of this problem.  Maybe I have Sideroblastic Anemia?   Any thoughts????  Thank you in advance!      Oh, and I was tested for hemochromatosis twice and it was negative.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: very localized pain along vein in leg, moving up into thigh",
    "content": "Hi,  Such a pain along the one of the major superficial veins of the lower limb may occur with \"superficial thrombophlebitis\".  This usually presents as a sterile inflammation of a small segment of a superficial vein associated with an underlying thrombus.  Thrombophlebitis may be, - primary (idiopathic) or - secondary to other causes(intravenous devices, intravenous infusions, intravenous drug adminstration, varicose veins, Buerger's disease etc).  Clinically, it manifests as a tender, cord-like thickening of a superficial vein with or without associated redness and peripheral edema.   One special variety is known as \"migratory\" thrombophlebitis (Superficial migratory thrombophlebitis, Thrombophlebitis migrans,Trousseau's syndrome).  In this condition, different veins or different areas of a vein are involved at intervals.   Trousseau in 1861 described this sign in relation to internal malignancies and came to be known as 'Trousseau's syndrome'. About 50% are associated with internal malignancies.Common cancers which are associated are, pancreatic(esp;body and tail) and lung cancers. It has also been been described with thromboangitis obliterans(Buerger's disease). Heparin therapy is usually required in these cases as warfarin resistance is common.  Your description does not entirely fit the diagnosis of a thrombophlebitis. You must consult your regular doctor who will be able to examine you and come to a definitive diagnosis. Good luck!\n\n",

Stress would not cause pain and knots in her groin area, and that development needs to be evaluated right away.  If your doctor is not an internist, or specialist in internal medicine, or if he or she does not consider the knots to be significant, request an immediate referral or make an appointment with an internist as soon as you can.  The internist can refer you to any other specialists indicated by the results of the examination, if needed.  Knots or lumps often turn out to be benign, but that needs to be determined.    Please let me know if you need further information.  Good luck to you and to your daughter.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: treatment of fulmenent autoimmune hemolytic anemia",
    "content": "Hi, I empathize with you and fully understand your genuine concerns. An understanding of the autoimmune hemolytic anemias may help you in comprehending the situation better.  Autoimmune hemolytic anemia(AIHA) may be classified as,   - Warm antibody hemolytic anemia: is the most common form of AIHA. Autoantibodies in in this condition generally react at temperatures  37\u00b0C. Most of the autoantibodies are of the  IgG class. This condition may be idiopathic, present in association with certain other diseases such as lymphoma,Systemic lupus erythematosus,or chronic lymphocytic leukemia) or in some cases are drug induced.  - cold antibody disease: is caused by autoantibodies that react at temperatures < 37\u00b0C. Autoantibodies are usually IgM. Infections tend to cause acute hemolytic disease.  Paroxysmal cold hemoglobinuria (PCA): is a subtype of cold agglutinin disease which is rare. Hemolysis results from exposure to cold (generalized or localized). Activities such as drinking cold liquids, washing hands in cold water may precipitate acute hemolysis. An IgG autohemolysin is involved in the pathogenesis. This binds to RBCs at low temperatures and causes intravascular hemolysis upon re-warming(as the body temperature reverts to normal). It occurs most often following a nonspecific viral illness.  Most patients who have AIHA have mild anemia of limited duration and, therefore, do not need therapy. Because most of the chronic cases are mild, minimal or no intervention is necessary.   Following are the management modalities that may be needed (singly or in combination).  Blood transfusion: Blood transfusion is needed only in life-threatening situations or as a interim measure while waiting for other tratment modalities to take effect.  Steroids: About 80% of patients who have idiopathic warm antibody hemolytic anemia, respond to steroids (1 to 2 mg/kg per day).  Intravenous Immune Globulin (IVIG): IVIG is effective in doses of 1 to 2 g/kg administered over 1 to 2 days.May be useful in the management of drug induced warm antibody hemolytic anemia after withdrawal of the offending drug.   Splenectomy: Splenectomy is effective in cases of AIHA in which most of the hemolysis is in the spleen, such as IgG-induced AIHA. It is not as effective in IgM-induced disease because most of the hemolysis in this condition occurs intravascularly. In PCA splenectomy has no role.  Coomb's test only diagnoses the cause of hemolysis as AIHA.  There are 2 types of Coombs Reagents available. - Polyspecific reagent: Containing both anti IgG and antiC3, - monospecific reagent: Either containing anti IgG or anti C3. Thus it is possible to identify the presence of complement 3 (C3) separately from IgG.  With these results in hand, one may be able to diagnose the subtypes as follows: - positive with anti-IgG and negative with anti-C3: probably, idiopathic warm antibody AIHA or the drug-associated AIHA. - positive with anti-IgG and anti-C3: SLE associated case, idiopathic warm antibody AIHA, or rarely drug-associated AIHA.  I sincerely hope your mother is better by now. Hope this information is useful in some way. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: lymph nodes in neck with history of dvt and cin1",
    "content": "Hi, It is indeed unfortunate for you to develop a DVT such a young age. Did the doctors find any underlying predisposing factors-congenital thrombophilias, for example?  You indicate that you have cervical intraepithelial neoplasia type 1 (CIN 1) and few palpable cervical and pelvic lymph nodes. You have not mentioned which group of lymph nodes in your neck are enlarged.That might have helped.   DVT, CIN-1 and enlarged cervical and pelvic lymph nodes could well be completely unrelated, isolated entities or could have a common background.  CIN-1 is a low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion and not a \"cancer\" as such. Neither the pelvic lymph nodes nor the cervical lymph nodes are likely to be directly caused by the CIN 1. CIN 1 has been shown to have a high rate of spontaneous regression within 1 year. For cervical lymphadenopathy, the list of causative factors is exhaustive.    Some risk factors have been identified and found to be important in developing CIN. Two significant ones among them are, - Women who are immunodeficient and - infection caused by the higher risk serotypes of HPV, such as 16, 18, 31 or 45.  Women with HIV are 10 times more likely to develop CIN. Risk of CIN is increased in HIV positive women by - decreased CD4 cells and  - associated Human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. (HIV infection is thought to activate the HPV and cause cellular abnormalities).The CIN tends to progress more rapidly and is also resistant to conventional treatment.  Toxaplasmosis is a well known cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. Immunocompromised individuals are at a higher risk. Most acute Toxoplasma infections are relatively asymptomatic. Lymphomas have been reported with toxaplama infections.  The reported incidence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with HIV infection has ranged from 0.25 to 0.96% in clinical studies, but up to 17% in autopsies.The overall risk of DVTDVT in HIV/AIDS appears to be approximately 2-10 times greater than in the general population.The underlying mechanisms behind this hypercoagulable state are being investigated extensively.   As i pointed out earlier,all of your symptoms and signs (DVT, CIN-1 and enlarged cervical and pelvic lymph nodes) can very well be completely unconnected and in that case, cause for each must be sought independently. However, it is safer to have your HIV serostatus confirmed. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I m 26 year old, Male, with no apparent illness, prior surgery, or history of medical problems in the family. I have enlarged spleen assessed using Ultrasound with volume of 368 ml, with largest dimension size at 12.6 cm. Here is my blood results:  RBC: 577 ( normal range: 415 - 580 )  HGB: 160 ( normal range: 135 - 175 ) Platelets: 341 ( normal range: 150 - 350) WBC: 7600 ( normal range: 4,000 - 11,000) LYMPH#: 2730 ( normal range: 1030 - 3200) NEUT#: 4320 ( normal range: 1870 - 7000) MCV: 80 (normal range: 79 - 100) MCH: 28 (normal range: 27 - 32) MCHC: 348 (normal range: 320 - 360)  RDW: 11.4 (normal range: 11.5 - 14.0)   My doctor doesn't think anything is wrong. But I am still very worried and think it could be a disease process. I don't have any other symptoms other than mild pain in the spleen that comes and go. I actually went for a complete work up because a week prior to going to the doctor I had 2 days of fever, and pain in my spleen. The fever had by the time I got an appointment resolved itself.  For a 26 year old do the above parameters look good to you, and also my triglyceride were kind of high, and my ferratin levels were at 226 (within the normal range). All other tests including urine, liver function, chemistry, and chest x-tray were completely unremarkable.   Could it be possible that there is improper assessment of my spleen's size?\n\n",

    "content": "I would tend to agree with your doctor.  Your lab tests are all reassuring that there is nothing major going on.  Your symptoms suggest that you had a recent viral infection.  The spleen measurements that you give can be interpreted as mildly to borderline moderately enlarged.  This can be do to several reasons.  Most commonly, the spleen enlarges as it serves its normal role in helping \"filter\" the blood of antibodies, etc. that are helping fight off infection.  Given your recent cold symptoms, it is likely that you are experiencing a physiologic increase in your spleen size to help it perform its function better.  In this case, the spleen will slowly return to normal size, though this may take  a few weeks.  Splenic pain can occur with stretching of the capsule (the surrounding \"shell\" of the spleen) when it enlarges from any cause, including normal enlargement.  If you continue to have ongoing symptoms I recommend that you follow up with your doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

My husband was diagnosed to have a slightly enlarged spleen few years ago, about 3 years ago, if my memory serves me right. We didn't do anything about it until this week because it's giving him pain on his lower left rib. Our doctor took blood and urine test, results were fine but we still have to wait for the Hepatitis test result. The doctor reckons it was just some skin deep problem which is causing the pain.  Please help me understand what could be the possible cause of the pain. What additional test do we need to do? What about the Lymph Nodes, Bone Marrow tests or anything like that?  Thank you, Diane\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Enlarged Spleen",
    "content": "Hi bossdiane and Zeeshmanq, Thought i will let you have some interesting information that i happened to come across. The various possibilities have already been well explained by Dr.Chan Lowe.  Assessment of splenic size becomes necessary in many clinical situations(in adults as well as in children). With the advent of the modern imaging techniques, it has become possible to obtain far more accurate estimates of splenic dimensions. Ultrasonography and CT are the most commonly used imaging techniques. Ultrasonography has the advantage of not involving ionizing radiation.  \"Normal\" splenic size: In paediatric and adolescent age groups, there are indications of a significant correlation been observed splenic size and height, weight, and body surface area.   Radiological texts differ in defining the upper limits of normal for the longitudinal diameter(length) of the spleen, with values ranging from 12 to 14 cm in adults. Normal splenic size has been found to vary significantly depending on age and sex. Overall average for splenic length of 10.65 cm on imaging has been observed in several reports for the general adult population.  Historically, assessment of splenomegaly has been based on spleen length, as the measurement of splenic width is more difficult and less reliable(more prone to intra-and inter- observer variations in ultrasonography). Defining splenomegaly on the basis of calculated splenic volume may be more uncertain.  There is marked variation in the ultrasound techniques (patient position, position of the probe etc) used in evaluating the spleen. These contribute to the observed variations in splenic length during assessment.  One study in particular, has come up with the following observations.  - more than 7% of athletes were observed to have a spleen length of >13 cm, - a value that has been traditionally used as a loose cut off point to define splenomegaly. - As a group, African Americans in that study population had smaller spleens despite being taller and heavier than the white athletes. - only a moderate correlation was observed between splenic size and anthropometric measurements in the adults studied. Br J Sports Med 2006;40:251\u2013254. doi: 10.1136/bjsm.2005.022376  Your splenic size has to be interpreted with caution in the light of the available scientific evidence. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: undiagnosable low hemoglobin+low haematocrit",
    "content": "Hi, A majority of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) are anemic. In most cases, this anemia is normocytic and normochromic and hypoproliferative in nature, with a low reticulocyte count. The main defect responsible for this anemia of CRF is absolute or relative erythropoietin deficiency. Other factors also play a part in the development of anemia such as, malnutrition, acute and chronic blood loss, iron deficiency, hemolysis, acute and chronic inflammatory conditions, severe hyperparathyroidism, folate and vitamin B12 deficiency, aluminum toxicity,  inadequate hemodialysis, shortened erythrocyte life span, underlying hemoglobinopathies, hypothyroidism, and multiple myeloma.  The management of this renal anemia consists of effective dialysis, correction of deficiencies (especially iron), and control of renal osteodystrophy, as well as the optimal dosage and duration of treatment with EPO.   Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) and its analogues have provided enormous benefit in the prevention and treatment of anaemia in chronic kidney disease (CKD). Unfortunately, in some patients, EPO resistance develops. If anemia is not responding, despite appropriate dosage and duration of therapy, then the reasons for this should be sought.  EPO resistance can be due a variety of causes such as, malnutrition, chronic blood loss, iron deficiency, infections, primary hematological diseases, osteitis fibrosa, aluminum toxicity,  folic acid or vitamin B12 deficiency, or multiple myeloma. Angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors have been suspected of causing EPO resistance. There have been some isolated reports of bone marrow amyloidosis causing EPO resistance.   Your fathers's lab results (you have omitted the reference ranges) show RBC indices presumably within normal limits, the platelet count is normal and of course a normocytic normochromic anemia.   The folic acid level is difficult to interpret as you have not mentioned whether the values are in ng/ml or nmol/L. The normal range is >3.1\u201312.4 ng/ml(7\u201328.1 nmol/L). If it is in ng/ml, then it is HIGH and if it is in nmol/L, it is NORMAL. This why lab results should be correctly mentioned(including the lab reference ranges). Red blood cell folate levels are said to be more reliable than serum folic acid levels(which are commonly performed).The vitamin B12 value is above normal range.  Right shift of the neutrophils can occur in  vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, liver disease, chronic uremia etc.  There are a few other relevant findings in the peripheral smear (occasional schistocytes, microspherocytes, and macrocytes).  Schistocytes, microspherocytes and macrocytes are found in certain conditions which include. - heriditary spherocytosis,   - Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA).  Microspherocytes (hyperchromic and significantly smaller sized RBCs) may be present in  - patients with a spherocytic hemolytic anemia, - burns and  - microangiopathic hemolytic anemia.   Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia may indicate underlying  disseminated malignany, chronic disseminated intravascular coagulation(DIC), thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura or the hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome(Thrombotic microangiopathy).  Your father's platelet count is normal. Patients with DIC or hemolytic\u2013uremic syndrome typically have severe thrombocytopenia,they are less likely. If DIC is the cause of thrombocytopenia, one must exclude an underlying infection or a malignancy.   That leaves us with Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia (AIHA).  Coombs-negative AIHAs have been reported.  Thus, one likely possibility in your father's case is Autoimmune Haemolytic Anaemia. Drug-induced AIHA also needs to be considered.It is also advisable to check his RBC folate levels. Your father's doctors in all probability, have considered these in the differential diagnosis and there must be a valid reason why infection is being considered. Without actually examining a patient, one can at best, only speculate. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Blood Cells Under a Microscope",
    "content": "Hi holas22, It is not possible to even contemplate answering about a parameter(PCO2), that is largely dependent on the vitality of the red Blood Cells (RBCs), as many vital details are lacking in your question, such as, - the RBCs are from which \"coelomate animal\" ? [animals that have a body cavity - includes mammals and non-mammals. Coelomate animals have blood], - in what kind of a solution are they  stored, - at what temperature they are stored, - in what type of container they are stored(glass/plastic - gases may diffuse through. More so, for plastic), - are they exposed to the atmospheric air or kept in a hermetically sealed container, - are they from an arterial, venous or capillary blood sample, - was the subject suffering from respiratory illness, at the time of sample collection, - was the subject's acid-base balance normal or otherwise?, - are there Leukocytes along with them?, - and so on....  From the moment blood exits the circulation(from being in vivo to in vitro), it starts to undergo many changes. The \"sum of all bad things\" that that happen to RBCs from this point onwards, is called as the \"RBC storage lesion\". This lesion comprises of all the changes brought upon in the course of blood storage, which limit the  survival of the RBCs, when they are returned to the circulation once again.  The RBC storage lesion includes:  - reduction in deformability of the RBCs associated with loss of membrane constituents and haemoglobin, - depletion of red cell ATP and 2,3-DPG (causing left shift of O2 dissociation curve)  and  - accumulation of bioreactive substances primarily released from white blood cells and consumption of oxygen (in non-leucocyte-reduced blood).  CO2 is generated during aerobic metabolism, while lactic acid is produced all through aerobic activity in blood in vitro. The availability of O2 is altered depending on number of  leukocytes. Moreover, glycolysis is a predominant way of ATp generation in the mature erythrocytes. The temperature is shown to be key-factor in the regulation of these metabolic changes in blood.  Blood gas analysis should be performed preferably, immediately after collection of an arterial blood sample. However, in practice, small delays do occur due to several factors.Some studies have tried to address the effects of such delays.Effects on the samples by delays of 15 minutes upto 3 hours have been studied. Majority of them seem to indicate that determination of blood gases should be done within in 15-30 min at the room temperature or within 2-3 h if stored at 4\u00b0C after withdrawing. Glass containers or syringes are said to be preferable over plastic (newer low diffusibility plastic syringes have become available).Changes in blood gas levels did continue to worsen with time but, the changes between 1and 3 hours was not thought to be significant enough to affect clinical decisions.  In many countries, in blood component preparation, upon donation, the temperature of whole blood units is brought down to room temperature rapidly using special plates and are kept overnight at room temperature (20 \u00b1 2 \u00b0C) and further processing done following morning.  With the availability and use of modern anticoagulant/preservative solutions, it is possible to bank whole blood for a period of up to 42 days. Frozen-stored red blood cells (FS-RBC) are usually preserved upto 3 years and sometimes longer.Cryopreservatives are used to prevent ice formation within the cells.Liquid nitrogen(at -196\u00b0C) is used for cooling.  At 1 atmosphere presssure(mean sea level pressure), the CO2 gas turns solid at temperatures below 78 \u00b0C (108.4 \u00b0F). There is paucity of information as to the fate of CO2 'gas' under these conditions.  You have to only surmise from the foregoing account what the fate of those RBCs is most likely to be. Thank you for this very interesting question. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: How long can you safely take LMWH?",
    "content": "Hi, Before i try to address the question as to  \u201cwhat determines the length of safe treatment with LMWH ?, i would prefer to answer the question \u201cwho determines the length of safe treatment with LMWH\u201d.  For the first time, the FDA approved a new indication for FRAGMIN(R) (dalteparin sodium injection), for the extended treatment of symptomatic venous thromboembolism (VTE) [proximal deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and/or pulmonary embolism (PE)] to reduce the recurrence of VTE in patients with cancer.  FDA approval was based on data from the landmark CLOT study (N Engl J Med 2003; 349:146-153July 10, 2003), which evaluated the safety and efficacy of FRAGMIN in reducing the recurrence of DVT/PE in patients with cancer, compared to an oral anticoagulant (warfarin). The study period lasted 6 months.  Although four different types of brand name LMWH products had been already approved by the (US) FDA, no generic versions of these drugs had been approved in the United States till July 23, 2010, at which time, the  FDA approved the first generic LMWH \u201cLovenox\u201d (enoxaparin sodium injection) for use as an anticoagulant therapy.   (Although long-term warfarin therapy had so far been the mainstay of treatment for cancer patients with VTE, there are many practical problems with its use in this group. In particular, achieving therapeutic drug levels is a challenge in cancer patients due to the increased risk of malnutrition, vomiting, drug interactionsand liver dysfunction in these patients. Moreover, these patients are at an increased risk of adverse effects of warfarin therapy. In contrast, LMWHs are associated with a lower risk of adverse events compared with warfarin in these patients. These agents also possess  practical advantages compared with warfarin, including more predictable anticoagulant activity and ease of administration).   LMWH is administered once or twice daily, both during the high-risk period when prophylaxis for DVT is recommended and also while waiting for oral anticoagulation to take effect in the treatment of DVT. The activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) does not need to be monitored, and the dosage does not need to be adjusted. LMWH is already approved for use in outpatient settings(including management at home) for these short term indications.  Now let me try to answer the question \u201cwhat determines the length of safe treatment with LMWH ?   The possible determinants are, - results from long term, well designed randomized trials indicating efficacy and safety, and of course, - final approval from agencies such as the (US) FDA as well as others, and - long term post marketing surveillance.  I hope this information is helpful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Based on your description alone, the first condition to be excluded is a mucocele.  The main cause of mucocele formation involves mucus extravasation from accessory salivary glands and is generally though of as being of traumatic origin, particularly related to lip biting. Following the trauma and extravasation of the saliva, an inflammatory reaction ensues and reactive granulation tissue is formed. This granulation tissue is responsible for the encapsulation of saliva and mucin from the ruptured ducts. It is not a true cyst (best classified as a pseudocyst), as it lacks an epithelial lining.  Mucocele appears as an asymptomatic nodule with a pink or bluish color. The nodule often evident within a few days following minor trauma. Once produced, it may remain unchanged for months unless it is treated. If the content of the cyst is drained, it usually consists of thick, mucinous material. Some lesions change in size from time to time and may disappear after traumatic injury (commonly, accidental biting), which results in drainage and may even disappear or re-fill.  Ideal treatment involves removal af the lesion and the removal of the salivary gland connected with it. Lesser procedures such as marsupialization also may be done but, recurrence rates may be higher. There have been some reports of successful  use of intralesional steroids.  The other lesions one needs to consider in the differential diagnosis are, - hemangioma, - nodular basal cell carcinoma, - malignant melamoma, - squamous cell carcinoma and  - minor salivary gland tumors. You must show it to your doctor(sooner, the better), who will be able to come to a more accurate diagnosis after assessing the morphology of the lesion. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Factor V Leiden (FVL)is an inherited autosomal dominant trait. However, in some cases, factor V Leiden may be inherited as an autosomal recessive trait. This is associated with a greater risk of venous thrombosis.  Each FVL gene is present in pairs, since one is inherited from the mother, and one  from the father. Depending on the inheritance of the mutated gene, FVL thrombophilia runs in families in a more severe or a less severe form.  The less severe (but more common) form of autosomal dominant FVL thrombophilia is called \"heterozygous\" and occurs when an individual inherits only one copy of the altered or mutated gene. If a parent has an autosomal dominant condition, there is a 50% chance for each child to have the same or similar condition.The more severe form of  is called \"homozygous\" and is caused by the inheritance of two mutated copies of the gene.  Autosomal recessive Homozygous FVL thrombophilia is caused by the inheritance of two changed or mutated copies of a gene.This occurs when two people who are heterozygous  have children together.Then,there is a 25% chance, with each pregnancy.  Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common, very heterogenous disease with variable expressivity as well as genetic and environmental interactions. Heterozygosity for this mutation occurs in at least 3% of unselected, healthy women. FVL is present in heterozygous form in approximately 12\u201320% of venous thromboembolism (VTE) patients. Its severity and age of onset may vary. Not all mutation carriers develop VTE. The exposure of mutation carriers to other clinical risk factors multiplies the potential risk of VTE.  The lifetime probability of developing thrombosis is considerably less in heterozygotes with the factor V Leiden mutation than in patients with the other less common inherited thrombophilias. Some reports indicate the lifetime probabilities of developing thrombosis are as shown below:  protein S deficiency > antithrombin deficiency > protein C deficiency > factor V Leiden, when compared to controls.  'Combined' thrombophilias [with an additional thrombopilic mutation, for example, activated protein C (APC) resistance] will render an individual more susceptible to thromboembolic events.  Independent risk factors for VTE include older age, confinement to a hospital, recent surgery that required anesthesia, trauma sufficient to necessitate hospitalization,malignant neoplasm (with or without chemotherapy), neurological disease along with chronic extremity paresis, superficial vein thrombosis, and prior central venous catheter or transvenous pacemaker insertion. Additional VTE risk factors for women include the use of oral contraceptives, hormone replacement therapy, and selective estrogen receptor modulators.  Oral contraceptives are contraindicated in women who are  homozygotes for factor V Leiden mutation or for women who have previously had thrombosis. However, the majority of carriers are heterozygotes and remain asymptomatic, despite their exposure to transient risk factors for thrombosis. In general, asymptomatic heterozygous carriers of factor V Leiden should be given information on the relative and absolute increased risk of thrombosis, without discouraging the use of second-generation oral contraceptives.  A policy of screening all women before prescription of oral contraceptives, might deny effective contraception to a substantial number of women while preventing only a small number of deaths due to pulmonary emboli. It might be more, practical however, to consider the personal and family history of deep vein thrombosis while deciding to prescribe oral contraceptives. Thus, testing for factor v leiden mutation is indicated in asymptomatic adult family members of probands with a known factor V Leiden mutation, especially those with a strong family history of VTE at a young age.  You have indicated(in your profile) that your mother underwent a hysterectomy for endometrial hyperplasia (but you have not mentioned the cause for the hyperplasia). This information is important to identify any additional risk for VTE. For example, one of the causes of endometrial hyperplasia is selective estrogen receptor antagonistic therapy(eg; tamoxifen) in breast cancers. Malignancies tend to increase VTE risk.  Whether your mother's VTE episode was primarily due to FVL is hard to say. Were there any other risk factors? Lupus antocoagulant was perhaps positive?- if so, adds to her risk.   Your ( and your sister's) risk of having the FVL mutation is 50% as your mother is heterzygous.Neither you nor your sister presumably had any DVT in the past. At present you do not have any independent risk factors for VTE as well. Also, there is no family history of occurrence of VTE at a young age.It is also good to see that you are well informed about the risk.Therefore, there appears to be no urgency in getting tested for FVL or continuing the oral contraceptives. However, it is better to consult your regular doctor and get tested at the earliest convenience for the inherited thrombophilias.  This will ensure that in future, should an unforeseen event/illness suddenly increases the overall risk, adequate VTE prophylaxis may be instituted without delay.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Perscription drugs and affects on BAC levels.",
    "content": "Hi,  A large number of medications have the potential to interact with alcohol. Those interactions can alter the metabolism or activity of the medication and/or alcohol metabolism, resulting in potentially serious medical consequences.  When alcohol is ingested, a little of it is immediately metabolized in the stomach. The rest (major portion) is absorbed via the portal venous system primarily from the stomach and the upper small intestine. Alcohol absorption from the stomach is slow but rapid from the upper small intestine. The absorbed alcohol is then transported to the live. A part of the ingested alcohol gets metabolized during its initial passage through the liver- the  \u201cfirst-pass metabolism\u201d. Only about 10% of the ingested alcohol undergoes the first pass metabolism. The remainder of alcohol leaves the liver intact and enters the systemic circulation and is distributed throughout widely to the tissues. If any \u201cfirst pass metabolism\u201d occurs in the gastric mucosa is controversial. Gastric alcohol dehydrogenase enzyme (ADH) has been demonstrated in the gastric mucosa. Some believe that this gastric first pass metabolism occurs significantly at low levels of alcohol consumption.  In the liver, alcohol is metabolized by several enzymes, the most important of which are ADH and cytochrome P450. The activities of these enzymes are highly variable, accounting for the observed variations in alcohol elimination rates among individuals. Cytochrome P450 actually consists of two enzymes,  - cytochrome P450 reductase and - CYP2E1. CYP2E1 plays a part in the metabolism of many drugs and therefore involved in many alcohol-medication interactions.  There are two types of alcohol-medication interactions:  -  pharmacokinetic interactions, in which alcohol interferes with the metabolism of the medication, and  -  pharmacodynamic interactions, in which alcohol enhances the effects of certain medications, particularly in the central nervous system(such as, sedation).  Pharmacokinetic interactions generally occur in the liver, where both alcohol and many medications are metabolized, frequently by the same enzymes.  Histamine H2 receptor antagonists such as Nizatidine, Cimetidine, and Ranitidine inhibit ADH in the stomach, thereby reducing alcohol first-pass metabolism. They also increase gastric emptying, thereby allowing alcohol to enter the upper small intestine where, the absorption is very rapid. As a result, blood alcohol levels (BALs) are often higher than expected for a given alcohol dose. This effect tends to increase over time.   The following study was a double blind, placebo-controlled study involving nineteen healthy male subjects. This study evaluated the effects of escitalopram, given alone and when co-administered with alcohol, on cognitive and psychomotor function in those healthy subjects.  \"Effects of Escitalopram Administered Alone and with Alcohol on Cognition and Psychomotor Performance\" Candace Jeavons Wilkinson, PhD et al, Southern California Research Institute, Los Angeles, CA;  UCLA Mood Disorders Research Program Presented at the 43rd Annual New Clinical Drug Evaluation Unit MeetingBoca Raton, Florida | May 27-30, 2003  This study concludes thus, \u201cAn acute dose of escitalopram, compared to placebo, does not appear to cause any significant impairment for a wide variety of cognitive and psychomotor skills in healthy male subjects. Co-administration of escitalopram with alcohol does not appear to potentiate alcohol-induced impairment of cognitive and psychomotor function\u201d.  Benzodiazepines such as alprozolam which also act as gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonists, are known to cause blackouts as a result of high dose use. Isolated published reports involving small numbers of patients suggest that individuals who have borderline personality disorders, a prior history of violent or aggressive behavior, or alcohol or substance abuse may be at risk for such events. What might seem like one drink may be equivalent to a couple more when under the influence of a benzodiazepine drug.  Changes in pharmcodynamics and pharmacokinrtics of benzodiazepines have been reported in a variety of disease states including alcoholism, impaired hepatic function and impaired renal function.  Alprazolam concentrations may be reduced by up to 50% in smokers compared to non-smokers. Maximal concentrations and half-life of alprazolam has been seen to be approximately 15% and 25% higher in Asians in comparison to Caucasians.  There is as yet no convincing evidence to implicate Escitalopram or alprazolam in causing high BACs. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated WBC Elevated RBC Past Thymus Tumor",
    "content": "Hi, Thank you for this very interesting and thought-provoking post.  The fact that you had a thymolipoma in the past, and that you are concerned that all your symptoms and signs may be due to one single diagnosis, prompts one to consider a possible \u201csyndromic\u201d diagnosis which of course, features thymolipoma.   Thymolipomas are rare, benign tumors of the anterior mediastinum accounting for up to 9% of all thymic tumors. They are rarer than the non-thymic lipomas of the mediastinum In the majority of cases, the tumors are incidental discoveries on routine chest X-rays.   Approximately 10% of them are associated with paraneoplastic syndromes.. Thymolipomas are associated with autoimmune diseases in up to 50% of the patients, which include,  - myasthenia gravis,  - hypogammaglobulinemia, - aplastic anemia, - hodgkin lymphoma, - lichen planus, - erythroblastopenia,  - Graves\u2019 disease, and  - chromic lymphocytic leukaemia.   Thymolipomas show an excellent outcome following surgical excision. Patients with symptoms of underlying autoimmune disease occasionally show an improvement of the symptoms after a resection of the tumors.  As you have not provided the laboratory reference ranges, it is not possible to interpret them meaningfully.  One of the paraneoplastic syndromes reported wit thymolipomas and thymomas is Hypogammaglobulinemia. Ig deficiency with thymoma (Good syndrome) affects adults aged 40-70 years   I will discuss it briefly the entity of hypogammaglobulinemia.  Hypogammaglobulinemia comprises of a set of disorders showing deficiencies of humoral immunity.  \u2018IgA deficiency\u2019 is the most common antibody deficiency syndrome, followed by the \u2018Common variable immunodeficiency\u2019 (CVID). All types are characterized by recurrent infections.  The incidence of autoimmune and collagen vascular diseases is increased, especially in IgA deficiency. IgA deficiency may remain asymptomatic in childhood, and manifest usually during early adulthood.  Systemic lupus erythematosus without renal disease, neutropenia, rheumatoid arthritis, autoimmune hepatitis, hemolytic anemia, and endocrinopathies have been described, especially in CVID. Neutopenia is frequently seen. Many of the CVID has a variable age of onset, usually occurring around the third decade of life. However, many of the other types of hypogammaglobulinemias (including the hereditary ones) present at birth, infancy or early childhood.   In your case, I am not certain if all your symptoms, past history and laboratory results can be packaged into one single \u201csyndromic\u201d diagnosis, but it may be worth excluding hypogammaglobulinemia (especially considering your persistently high total white cell counts indicating some underlying infection or recurrent infections). - either a paraneoplastic syndrome (akin to the Good syndrome), perhaps persisting after thymectomy, or  - a completely unrelated isolated hypogammaglobulinemia.

    "title": "Re: Thalassemia Minor Patient?",
    "content": "Hi, In individuals with Thalassemia minor, \u201cnon-transfusional iron overload\u201d is very unusual unless, they happen to have an associated mutation (in homozygous or heterozygous form) of Hereditary Hemochromatosis. One other factor which affects dietary management is iron deficiency, which may be rarely co-existing.  Therefore, patients with isolated thalassemia minor have no particular need to follow any dietary modification or need any specific nutritional supplements.   A balanced diet rich in high quality protein, adequate energy, B-complex vitamins (in particular, vitamin B12) and folic acid is recommended.  Multivitamin and mineral supplements containing large amounts of iron and vitamin C are best avoided.  Having a basic knowledge about composition of common food stuffs and especially with relevance to the contents of iron, zinc, magnesium is a bonus and helps to avoid pitfalls - more so in the case of vegetarians.   For example, a vegetarian diet often contains less zinc than a meat based diet and so it is important for vegetarians to eat plenty of foods known to be rich in this vital mineral. Vegetarians may need as much as 50% more of the RDA for zinc in their diets than non-vegetarians because of the lower absorption of zinc from plant foods (excessive phytates, which prevents absorption of zinc). One should also remember that excess fiber in the diet can decrease zinc absorption.  Good sources of zinc for vegetarians include lentils and beans, seeds, nuts, wholegrain cereals, yeast and dairy products. Pumpkin seeds are one of the most concentrated sources of zinc. Armed with this sort knowledge, one can with success, avoid consuming supplements which can have potential adverse effects.   While deficiency of zinc compromises the immune system,  zinc toxicity can occur in acute or chronic forms. Intakes of 150-450 mg of zinc/day or intakes of more than 3 months duration have been associated with reduced levels of high-density lipoproteins, low copper status, altered iron function and reduced immune function. Copper helps in erythropoiesis along with iron.   Lastly, there is one other factor which is best avoided, and that is - alcohol.  30% to 50% of alcoholics may be zinc deficient. Alcohol consumption decreases intestinal absorption of zinc and increases its urinary excretion.  I hope this information is helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Compound Hetereozygote Hemochromatosis - Conflicting Results",
    "content": "Hi, You indicate that you are a compound heterozygote for hemochromatosis.   Compound heterozygote: The presence of two different mutant alleles (that can cause genetic disease in a heterozygous state) at a particular gene locus, one on each chromosome of a pair.   Compound heterozygotes can be divided into two groups:  - subjects with iron overload (with elevated ferritin levels) or  - those without (with normal ferritin concentrations).  More than 80% genetic hemochromatosis patients are homozygous for this mutation (mutation C282Y). The heterozygous state for this mutation is highly prevalent in the general population   Compound heterozygotes for the C282Y and the H63D mutations may have a comparatively higher risk of iron overload or genetic hemochromatosis than single heterozygotes of the C282Y mutation. Liver biopsy and hepatic iron evaluation are also recommended in compound heterozygotes (C282Y/H63D) and  C282Y heterozygotes, who have indirect markers of iron overload, particularly if they also have abnormal liver enzymes or clinical evidence of liver disease. These individuals account for a small proportion of phenotypic hemochromatosis and they have a relatively low likelihood of significant iron overload. Elevated values of iron tests in them are often due to other causes of liver disease including alcoholic liver disease.  Indirect markers of iron stores such as serum iron or ferritin lack specificity when used alone.  Transferrin Saturation  (TS):  Safe range -  12-44%. Any values above this range must be considered diagnostic for hemochromatosis.   Any values far below this range may be a sign of  chronic infection, bleeding ulcers, or cancer.    The amount of storage iron - Serum Ferritin (SF): Safe range -  5-150 \u00b5g/L. A hemochromatosis patient needs to be at the lowest end of this range. A value of <10. needs to be the treatment goal.  Interpretation of these results at times may not be as straightforward as they appear.   African Americans in the U.S have a 20% carrier rate. This population has one special problem, and that is in that the main screening lab value - transferrin saturation (TS), sometimes seems normal. In this one group, one may need to depend on family history, symptoms or elevated serum ferritin as a diagnostic parameters to determine hemochromatosis.  Some studies indicate that the mean transferrin saturations within the middle and upper sub-populations for African American men and women were from 8% to 16 lower, whereas mean serum ferritin concentrations were substantially higher than those for Caucasians of the same gender.  Since serum iron can be elevated by eating and can fluctuate during the day, serum iron measurements should be done fasting, usually in the morning before breakfast. Measurement of transferrin saturation is ideally performed after an overnight fast. Overnight fasting avoids postprandial or circadian variations and eliminates nearly 80% of false-positive TS results. Simultaneous serum ferritin determination increases the predictive accuracy for diagnosis of iron overload.  As you can well appreciate, the values that you have provided must be interpreted in the context of - the normal fluctuations of serum iron, - overnight fasting prior to testing(yes/no) ,  - influence of ethnicity on some of the values, and - presence or absence of associated liver disease/alcoholism.

    "title": "Re: High lymphocyte count low MPV",
    "content": "Hi, As not a great deal of details have been provided in your post, I will confine myself to providing you some information on the various differential diagnoses that may need to be considered in such a case scenario.  The normal mean platelet volume (MPV) ranges between 7.5-11.5 fl.  Whenever the MPV is decreased, it means the platelets are smaller than normal. They are known as microthrombocytes.   Microthrombocytosis  may indicate the following disorders: - Aplastic Anemia : A rare acquired disorder in which the bone marrow stops producing new blood cells. - Wiskott-Aldrich Syndrome: An inherited immune deficiency disease, one of whose main symptom is a tendency to bleed due to a low platelet count. - Thrombocytopenia-absent radii (TAR Syndrome:) A rare disorder in which there are low platelets and absence of the radius bones in the arms. - Storage Pool Disease:  one of the several types of storage pool disorders , when involving plateles, results in a mild bleeding disorder that causes bruising.  One may suspect the type of bleeding disorder based on the age of onset. At birth: maternal idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, maternal systemic lupus erythematosus, intrauterine infections, maternal medications, TAR syndrome, and congenital amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia. 2 to 4 years:  Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). 4 to 7 years: Henoch-Sch\u00f6nlein purpura.  Platelet storage pool disorders: can be congenital or acquired and result from a deficiency of granules (alpha or dense granules, or both) or a defective release of granules at platelet activation..Acquired platelet storage pool disorders may be associated with underlying myeloproliferative disorders, disseminated intravascular coagulation, and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura/hemolytic uremic syndrome.  TAR syndrome (amegakaryocytic thrombocytopenia syndrome): An association of phocomelia with thrombocytopenia and a decrease in the number of megakaryocytes on the myelogram was described, the TAR syndrome(thrombocytopenia with absent radii- but thumbs and digits are almost always present), a rare congenital disorder that differs from the myelodysplastic syndrome in that no changes occur in granulocytic and erythroid series. They frequently are associated with relative hypogammaglobulinemia,  Acute immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP): in most cases, particularly in children, is mild and self-limited and may not come to medical attention. In children, immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) is more common among boys compared with girls. The prevalence peaks between 1-6 years of age. In children, most cases are acute, frequently manifesting a few weeks after a viral illness. Immune mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is a common manifestation of autoimmune disease in children. Although patients often present with petechiae, bruises, and some mucosal bleeding, the incidence of life-threatening hemorrhage is rare (0.2\u20130.9%) but can be fatal if bleeding occurs in vital organs.  Neonates may also have a form of immune thrombocytopenia with extensive bruising and thrombocytopenia called neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenic purpura (NATP). The platelet destruction here is secondary to transplacental maternal IgG alloantibodies, rather than autoantibodies. Platelets are large sized (giant or \"dust-like\").Thus MPV will be often raised.  Onyalai:  is a rather mysterious disease, is a special type of aquired immune thrombocytopenia in Africa (in some parts of countries in central southern Africa such as, southern Angola and northern Namibia). Cause is unknown although, plant toxins have been implicated in the etiology. Clinical presentation apart form bleeding in the skin and mucus membranes, is associated with typical hemorrhagic bullae in the oral mucosa.Can present at any age (including infancy). The platelets in this disease are morphologically normal.   Most patients recover and the platelet counts return to normal slowly. However, it may frequently relapse or may become chronic. Infants of mothers with onyalai, unlike infants of mothers with idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, do not appear to be at risk of thrombocytopenia and haemorrhage.  Drug-induced thrombocytopenia: several drugs(including analgesics) can produce thrombocytopenia as an advese drug reaction.  One must remember that the lymphocyte counts in the new borns and infants are normally higher than in adults. At age 1, Mean absolute lumphocyte count is about 7.0/\u00b5L(range 4-10.5).  So your child\u2019s absolute lymphocyte count is within normal limits. The cause of the bleeding and raised MPV will need to be investigated comprehensively, sooner rather than later. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated RBC related to Thalassemia trait?",
    "content": ". Hi, Iron deficiency is the most common acquired cause of anemia and Thalassemia is perhaps the most frequent gene mutation in human beings.  A suspicion of Iron deficiency anemia (as it is the commonest) often begins with the finding of \u2018microcytosis\u2019(smaller than normal sized RBCs) and 'hypochromia\" (paler than normal RBCs) on a blood smear. In the not so distant past, microcytosis and anisocytosis were diagnosed based on stained peripheral blood smears. In recent times, automated blood analysers are becoming increasingly available widely available thus provide parameters such as HgB, red cell indices, RDW as well as others.  Faced with a situation of microcytosis and hypochromia, one must not succumb to the temptation to jump to a diagnosis of Iron deficiency. Thalassemia must always be excluded before a decision to prescribe iron is made.  Differentiating iron deficiency anemia and thalassemias (with their very heterogeneous nature) has remained challenging. Usually iron deficiency can be ruled out using free erythrocyte protoporphyrin (FEP), transferrin saturation or ferritin as a screening test. But diagnostic dilemmas are not unusual.  Efforts on to find ways of improving the sensitivity and specificity of tests to separate out iron deficiency from thalassemia traits. Various discrimination indices (such as Mentzer's index, Shine Lal index, England and Fraser idex and several others) have been used for this discrimination. Osmotic fragility test is one other test that may help in some cases.  All these still lack an ideal discrimination index. RDW is another index frequently available as part of the reports in the automated analysers.This index has further been refined as RDW- SD (stands for Standard Deviation) and RDW-CV (stands for Coefficient Variation).   thalassemia trait: Here, the affected individuals are clinically normal but frequently have minimal anemia, reduced mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH). The red blood cell count is usually increased to over 5.5 x 1012/L. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is usually increased.  Alpha thalassemia is common throughout parts of the world where malaria is endemic and is common in people of Asian, African, and Mediterranean heritage.  Beta thalassemia trait: In this, the affected individuals have minimal clinical effects, usually manifested as a borderline anemia with disproportionate microcytosis and a reciprocally high RBC count. They also have a normal (12.7-16.3%) or near normal (up to 17%) red cell distribution width.    The distinguishing finding in beta thalassemia is a hemoglobin electrophoresis with the finding of elevated minor hemoglobins Hgb A2 and F. Both will be increased in beta thalassemia trait without iron deficiency, and will be normal or decreased in alpha thalassemia and isolated iron deficiency anemia. However, one must remember that rarely some individuals with beta-thalassemia also have normal levels of Hb A2 and Hb F and if both alpha and beta thalassemia coexist, the changes in Hgb A2 and F may not be apparent.  Thus, in your case, the laboratory values provided suggest what could be either  an  thalassemia trait or a beta-thalassemia trait. Distinction between these may need further tests such as measurement of the minor hemoglobins  Hgb A2 & Hgb F, modified hemoglobin H inclusion staining, and RDW-SD (seen to be consistently low in heterozygous alpha-1 thalassemia but not in heterozygous alpha-2 thalassemia).  You perhaps need the guidance from your regular doctor as well as a hematologist    Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: C-reactive protein and Factor V Leiden",
    "content": "Hi, A fair amount of clinical/research work on C-reactive protein (CRP)levels, other acute phase reactants and their relevance as a risk factors for myocardial infarctions, metabolic syndrome, diabetes, atherosclerosis, arterial thrombosis, hypertension etc,  gets reported from the city of Leiden in the Netherlands (where incidentally, Factor V Leiden was first identified in a family).  The elevated CRP levels have been shown(in some of these studies) to increase the risk of myocardial infarctions(coronary thrombosis) but, not  the risk of venous thrombosis. Is it possible that you are mistakenly referring what you came across in relation to protein C?   Apart from this there is just one other connection that i can think of- All clotting factors (including factor V)  are synthesized in the liver except for Von willebrand factor (vWF) \u2013 which is synthesized by the endothelial cells of blood vessels as well as by the platelets.The acute phase proteins (including C-reactive protein) are also synthesized by the liver. In conditions causing acute stress, the liver starts to manufacture acute phase proteins at the expense of the clotting factors, thus resulting in a bleeding diathesis.Thus, there is this known 'inverse' relationship between  C-reactive protein and factor V.  A highly sensitive C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) assay is now available.This is very useful in assessing the cardiovascular risk.  CRP is a non-specific marker of inflammation. As a prognostic indicator,it lacks specificity. Apart from acute and chronic inflammations, infections, and autoimmune diaorders, levels may be increased in certain malignancies as well (ex; colon cancer). Persistent, marked and unexplained elevations hs-CRP (greater than 10.0 mg/L), should lead to tests to exclude non-cardiovascular causes.  Your C-reactive protein levels are indeed very high(normal levels upto 4.9mg/L). Women taking HRT will have higher levels of CRP. You will need to be fully investigated to exclude non-cardiovascular causes among others.Your doctor will be the one best placed to guide you through this.  I hope this information is helpful. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Symptoms of anemia but CBC is normal?",
    "content": "Hi, Iron deficiency often develops very insidiously. Stored iron in the bone marrow is the first to become depleted. Serum ferritin levels start to decrease following this, while the Hct, Hgb and MCV remain normal. A drop in the iron ferritin level occurs before any depletion in serum iron (as seen in iron-deficient anemia) and may decrease significantly without any obvious symptoms whatsoever.   At least some of the reasons for the difficulties in the interpretation of serum ferritin levels are due to a number of laboratory-related factors such as, - the presently available ferritin immunoassay kits, which lack accuracy and reproducibility especially in the lower end of the reference range of 20-150 ug/L. The lower edge is rather too close to \u20180\u2019.  - the problems faced by the laboratories in establishing genuine reference ranges in the face of sub-clinical iron deficiency in the apparently \u2018normal\u2019 general population without evidence from bone marrow aspiration. - setting a \u201ccut off\u201d point for diagnosing iron deficiency due to many invalidated reference ranges in common use (many use a cutoff level of 12ug/L, while the literature frequently quotes a figure of 10-20ug/L).  Ferritin concentration indicates how much iron is stored in the body. As ferritin is one of the \u201cacute-phase proteins\u201d, measured levels may be normal or elevated in infective, inflammatory (especially rheumatoid arthritis), chronic granulomatous diseases or malignant disease in the setting of iron deficiency. Serum ferritin level is also increased by excessive alcohol intake. In the absence of one of these conditions, if ferritin is low, one may attribute the low serum ferritin levels to iron deficiency and begin treatment. A careful clinical history, ESR and serum C-reactive protein level can be of help to identify such conditions. However, It is also extremely rare for ferritin levels to be to be falsely low.  One study compared serum ferritin concentrations with iron stores in the bone marrow for unexplained fatigue in non-anaemic women and found that  - some women with very low iron stores in the marrow still have ferritins between 16 -20 ug/L and - that a serum ferritin concentration of 50 \u00b5g/l was associated with a 50% chance of iron deficiency occurring in the bone marrow. Significant response to oral iron supplements was observed only in the patients with a baseline serum ferritin concentration  <50 \u00b5g/l. (Verdon F, Burnand B and Stubi CL et al. Iron supplementation for unexplained fatigue in non-anemic women: double blind randomized placebo controlled trial. BMJ. 2003 May 24;326(7399):1124). (http://www.hubmed.org/display.cgi?uids=12763985).  Iron-thyroid connection: insufficient iron levels theoretically can affect the first two of three steps of thyroid hormone synthesis in the thyroid gland by reducing the activity of the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, which is iron dependent. Conversely, iron deficiency may also affect metabolism by reducing the conversion of the \u2018inactive\u2019 T4 to the \u2018active\u2019 T3 form in the tissues. Low iron levels also are believed to increase the levels of Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH). Some studies have raised doubts about this connection. One such study concludes thus, \u201cThere was no association between thyroid function and serum ferritin levels. We conclude that serum ferritin levels do not account for the relation between subclinical hyperthyroidism and vascular mortality\u201d. http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16889492  In your case (as i already mentioned), it is extremely rare for ferritin levels to be to be falsely low. Therefore, it is likely that the iron therapy was just not optimal to correct the deficit in your bone marrow. Also, in resistant cases, any associated underlying disorder (mentioned earlier) that may be contributing to the iron deficiency should be sought. Any ongoing blood loss also has to be looked for. Some of these disorders impair erythropoiesis by decreasing both erythropoietin (EPO) production and marrow responsiveness to EPO. A bone marrow examination will help to confirm the diagnosis.

    "content": "Hi, Unfortunately you have not indicated the laboratory reference ranges for any of the values provided. Interpretation of these values without reference ranges is not advisable, as these ranges vary between laboratories. Also what is not clear is, whether these represent values on a single occasion or a sample of the pattern seen during the past 5-6 months.  As your main concern seems to be about leukemia, i will let you have some information about neutrophils and their relevance in this context.  Normally, not all the neutrophils in the blood 'circulate'. Some remain attached to the vessel walls(marginal pool). In some situations these 'marginated' neutrophils get released from their attachments and begin to circulate when dire need arises(acute stress,severe exercise,adminstration of epinephrine etc). This condition is known as Pseudoneutrophilia.   Segmented neutrophils (segs) are the mature neutrophils that have matured enough at release from the bone marrow and are functionally (phagocytosis) mature. Segmented neutrophils comprise 40-75 % of the peripheral leukocytes.They normally have 2 to 5 nuclear lobes.Normally, majority of the neutrophils circulating in the bloodstream are \"segs\".  The nucleus of less mature neutrophils on the other hand, is not segmented, but has a band or rod-like shape. Less mature neutrophils - ones that have recently been released 'in a hurry' from the bone marrow into the bloodstream - are known as \"bands\"(or stabs).Band cells are normally <10% of the total leukocyte count(mostly 3-5%). An increase in leukocytes (primarily neutrophils) used to be identified by a \"left shift\" in the ratio of immature to mature neutrophils in the \"Arneth count\" which is not in routinely performed these days.  Confusion arises at times due to the ways a differential count (\"diff\") is reported.Some laboratories report the band forms separately and others don't.  A leukocyte count above 25 to 30 x 109/L is termed a leukemoid reaction, which is the reaction of a healthy bone marrow to extreme stress, trauma, or infection.  Although the white blood cell count (WBCc) is typically thought of as being greatly increased in leukemia, the WBCc is in reality highly variable, and may range from severe leukopenia to extreme leukocytosis.The platelet counts are generally decreased in acute leukemias, but may be normal in chronic leukemias.The hematocrit and hemoglobin usually reveal a normocytic/normochromic picture.

    "title": "Re: Abnormal Clotting Unknown Disorder",
    "content": "Hi, I certainly share your concern for Ms.Norma.I will try to provide you a bit of background information which may be of some help to you.  Pulmonary embolism is generally classified into 3 major clinical types. - massive, - submassive and - minor.  Thrombophilia(an incresed tendency of blood to clot) is usually categorized into two types, - acquired and  - inherited.   In acquired thrombophilia the abnormal clotting is usually related to a specific cause, such as prolonged periods of bed rest after surgery, trauma to the leg, or a malignancy.  In inherited thrombophilias, there is a  tendency to form clots due to a genetic predisposition (inherited).   The inherited causes are AT-III deficiency, protein C and protein S deficiencies, dysfibrinogenemia, and activated protein C (APC ) resistance. Most individuals with APC resistance have a mutant factor V molecule (factor V Leiden) -  named after a city called Leiden in the Netherlands where it was first identified in a family. Another mutation, the Prothrombin G20210A mutation is also frequently co-inherited in Factor V Leiden carriers. This is in fact the second most common genetic defect for inherited thrombosis, with Factor V Leiden being the most common.  About 5% of Caucasians have factor V Leiden, and it is more common in individuals of European ancestry. In the US, approximately 1-2% of African Americans, Hispanic Americans and Native Americans also have the mutation. Factor V Leiden is rarely found in Asians.  Any person who is homozygous (that is, he or she inherits a mutation in both copies of their gene, one from each parent) they are at a greater risk to develop a blood clot than an individual who is heterozygous for the mutant gene.  The risk also multiplies if they have both factor V Leiden and prothrombin G20210A.  The clinical course of most patients with pulmonary embolism is one of gradual resolution with re-establishment of flow in the pulmonary arteries.  A small group of patients, experience recurrent showers of emboli which may ultimately occlude a large part of the pulmonary small vessel bed with development of chronic \u201cvascular\u201d type of pulmonary hypertension, which may even be fatal. Whether anticoagulation is effective in the treatment of recurrent thromboemboli is undetermined.  Recurring embolic episodes  while on anticoagulation is an indication for inferior venacaval filters. Ms Norma, as you have indicated, has had a pneumonectomy(indication?). As she has only one functioning lung presently, it is unaffordable to lose any of her remaining lung reserve. Thus, there seems to be an absolutely strong indication for placement of an inferior venacaval filter.  As she is presently admitted to a hospital, I am certain, the treating doctors will consider all options. Good luck!\n\n",

I have a history of oncology visits 2 years ago. I had high hematocrit, hemoglobin and RBC. I believe my EPO was low at that time. I had a bone marrow aspiration/biopsy and it came back normal. I then lost my insurance. I have had no care for 2.5 years but am finally insured again. My first CBC came back  Hemoglobin 16.7 Hematocrit  47.7 RBC 5.5 WBC 9.0  I went to the lab today and had blood drawn for a JAK 2 mutation test. I am not able to see the oncologist for 3 weeks. I am feeling very anxious about it all.  I would really appreciate any input. Thank you so much for this service!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Philadelphia chromosome is a choromosomal abnormality seen in 95% of cases of chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). It is a reciprocal translocation (swap of chromosomal material) between chromosomes 9 and 22. Thus, Philadelphia chromosome is a BCR-ABL fusion gene.    BCR stands for \"breakpoint cluster region\" gene from chromosome 22. ABL stands for \u2018Abelson murine leukemia viral oncogene homolog\u2019 from chromosome 9.   There are 4 myeloproliferative disorders. These may be classified into two major groups. - BCR-ABL  mutation positive: Chronic myelogenous leukemia and - BCR-ABL  mutation negative: Essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia (the \"classic\" BCR-ABL -negative myeloproliferative disorders). (BCR-ABL  mutation positive cases of Essential thrombocythemia have been repoted fairly recently).       Each of these MPDs is believed to represent a stem cell-derived clonal myeloproliferation with the  features of thrombocytosis, erythrocytosis, and bone marrow fibrosis respectively.  Unlike with cases of chronic myeloid leukemia, in which the bcr/abl mutation is invariably detectable, current diagnosis of essential thrombocythemia, polycythemia vera, and myelofibrosis with myeloid metaplasia is based on a set of clinical and laboratory criteria that have undergone substantial modification in recent times.   A unique \u201cgain-of-function\u201d mutation, Janus tyrosine kinase (JAK2), was first reported in 2005 in PV. Since then it has been identified in all 3 classic MPDs.   Polycythemia Vera (PV): in PV, a reported increase in hematocrit (Hct) value may or may not represent a true increase in erythrocyte production. Apparent polycythemia: results from either an acute plasma contraction  (relative polycythemia) or confusion regarding the upper limit of normal laboratory values for Hct. Although acute plasma contraction is a well accepted entity, the existence of chronic plasma contraction, [Gaisb\u00f6ck syndrome (relative polycythemia with nephropathy & hypertension) as well as  \u201cstress polycythemia\u201d (relative polycythemia occurring with emotional stress)] is still debated.  Traditionally, PV has been diagnosed based on the criteria from the \u2018Polycythemia Vera Study Group\u2019, which requires an elevated red blood cell mass.   Some clinicians currently recommend that one should depend primarily on the clinical presentation, serum erythropoietin (sEPO) level, and bone marrow histology in diagnosing PV.  Initial work-up: includes determination of the sEPO level and further investigations are based on this value.  In PV, the sEPO level is usually low but can be normal; It is extremely unlikely to be elevated. Therefore, further work-up is recommended only if the sEPO level is low or normal.  A low sEPO level mandates a BM biopsy to look for morphologic evidence of PV as well as to test for JAK2 mutation.   Decisions to perform BM biopsy and JAK2 mutation screening, in cases with normal sEPO levels, should be based on the presence or absence of a compelling clinical picture (pruritus, erythromelalgia, splenomegaly, arterial or venous thrombosis) or laboratory (thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, increased leukocyte alkaline phosphatase score, well documented increase in Hct level from an individual\u2019s baseline value).If these features are lacking, then, one should consider close follow up with periodic monitoring of Hct and sEPO levels.Abdominal ultrasonography to exclude  splenomegaly may be useful.  As you may well appreciate, in your case, one may not diagnose PV based on the elevated Hct alone, but the sEPO level will perhaps determine the further workup needed. So, you need to be patient till then. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "21year old female, unexplainable bruises, pictures included.",
    "content": "I wrote this for future visits to other doctors so I don't have to repeat myself, but I decided to try a forum. No doctor could figure out what;s wrong with me, I went 6 times to the ER, called many doctors, saw specialists. I'm not sure in what category put it given it's a medical mystery up to now.   I'm a 21 year old Female.   First off, thank you for whomever reading this, I more than appreciate it.  For two weeks I had splitting headaches coming from the back unto the temples. I felt pressure through the day, and a few times (maybe 10 to 15 times) a day I felt like someone was literally crushing my skull.   The headaches stopped and one day I woke up with general weakness through my limbs. Any small effort made my muscles feel very tired. Like going up a few stairs my legs were tired as if I ran a marathon but my breathing and heart rate was fine. My arms were also very weak. I felt tired and generally very lethargic. Mentally and physically. I slept maybe a good 15 to 20 hours a day. I thought it was a cold at first.  Two days after the onset of the body weakness, my left forearm was the weakest of my limbs with a very noticeable deterioration compared to two days ago. I had weird spams and a burning sensation in my hand and some upper arm numbness at times. General confusion, time disorientation and dizziness. There was a \u201cbump\u201d on the middle-right side of my inner left arm. I had a bit of confusion and focus problems and a lower back ache which descended into my legs, mostly my right thigh with a  shooting pain coming from the sciatica nerve. A day or two later, my neighbor (which is also one of my best friends) convinced me to call info-health (811) and I did so. The nurse asked me about my temperature which was normal, my heart rate was a bit higher than normal (about 120 a minute), I told her about my weakness, my left arm, and my confusion and she urged me to go to the ER and made me promise that as soon as I hang up I either go to the ER with someone or she calls an ambulance. I actually waited for my mother to come back from work, which took about 3 hours, meanwhile my neighbor was with me.   When my mother came back from work, she took me to Saint-Mary's ER, I was quickly seen and admitted and put in the \u201ccommon\u201d room (where people spend the night). My mother left because she was working in the morning and a good friend of mine came and took over looking after me, it was about 1am when he came over. I was seen by Dr. (Intern I think) Marie-Luce Chen, she gave me a neurological exam (test my strength, make me walk on tiptoes or heels) my left arm was much weaker and much less endurance. I had difficulty walking on my heels. I never tried when I was \u201chealthy\u201d so I'm not sure if I generally can do it but I couldn't at all. I could not stay on my feet with my eyes closed and arms in front of me either. They took my blood and a urine test (both came back normal). Around 3am-4am Dr. R. Drummond saw me also re-did the neurology exam. Same thing happened than the first time. They were trying to put me on pain killers for my back, they gave me two (I think the same thing as Triatect-30 but a different name) twice, both times it did nothing. At home I also tried Aleve and my neighbor gave me Tramacet which didn't work either. At the end they gave me two Dilaudid which worked almost immediately. And he booked me for a CT head scan. I left to go for a cigarette and call my mother, at the exit I was stopped by a lady who put me on a wheelchair and took me to the CT scanning room. I removed all my piercings except my implants. The CT showed nothing abnormal and I was discharged. Dr. Chen apologized they didn't find anything and I was sent home with a Dilaudid prescription. Dr. Chen was very nice and had a great sense of humor and very professional. My friend was a the \u201cdesignated\u201d driver and we got home, went to bed at a bit passed 5am and woke up the next morning around 12.   My friend, when he left, I asked my neighbor to pick up my prescription, she was going to wall-mart. During that time my left arms swelling previously mentioned started to get bigger and a blue-ish color. From there the veins broke (I felt a \u201ccrunch\u201d) and blood spilled underneath my skin. The bruise was the length of my forearm. All this happened within 2 hours. I took a glass to give soda for my neighbor and my hand let go on the glass. I became increasingly dizzy.  My neighbor was very concerned and stayed with me until my mother got home and she took me back to Saint-Mary's ER. At this point I was scared myself. I saw another Doctor I think his name was Dr. Reid. He didn't say much and took my blood for a test I stayed there an hour an half. Usually Saint-Mary's ER moves quickly so it takes maximum 30 minutes from entering to being seen from a Doctor. He took a blood test and it took 30 minutes before the results came back, they were normal and I was discharged.   Leaving the hospital, I was with my mother, our tire had a flat. While waiting for CAA we decided to go to Davis Mortimer Jewish Hospital because she was concerned and so was I. I mean, it was a huge bruise and it was scary, and my vascular system started to be very painful and my veins were getting stiff.  *On a side note, my left forearm was never used for blood samples, there was no physical (nor emotional or stress) trauma that could cause this.  At the Jewish Hospital I waited 3-4 hours in the waiting room before being admitted, the bruise grew and one started to appear underneath my left breast on the far left side and started extending towards the middle (but never attaining it).   I was taken to the \u201ccommon\u201d room to be assessed by a Doctor, I was seen by Dr. Segal. He quickly examined me and took more blood samples and gave me two urine tests. They moved me to a room, my mother had to leave home and I was left alone. After an hour of being a lone I was wheeled out into the end of a very cold hallway. At this point I was pretty ticked off, in pain, afraid, alone and cold. Without anyone giving me even a bit of consideration. My mother came back, I was ready to get dressed and leave right then and there until a Dr. told me to stay put because the dermatologist he called was coming from home. It was around 7 am, I was tired, in pain and scared.  The dermatologist came rather quickly (within 30 minutes) he name is Dr. Genvi\u00e8ve Fortier-Riberdy. She works at the Jewish, CHUM and Saint-Luc's hospital. She saw me and diagnosed me telling me she was 99% sure it's Zona and gave me a prescription (for very expensive pills might I add). Gave me a follow-up reference for two days later at the CHUM. She discharged me with more Hydromorphone.   *Another side note, Zona is asymmetric (indeed my bruises were all on the left side) but they are NOT a rash, at all, they are very obviously bruises, she completely miss diagnosed me, made me take antibiotics which made me weaker and my stomach upset and cost over 100$. I mean it's not a dermatology issue, even I know that, and it does not even look one bit like Zona. This made me extremely upset including how the hospital treated me.  The next day I spent at home relaxing, the bruising got worst, started on my right side also (excludes Zona, which I already checked what it looks like, but I still kept taking the antibiotics thinking a Doctor knows best). On my face, right forearm and knee/thigh. While I was getting worse, the pain also worsened a lot so I upped my dose myself from 1 pill every 4 hours to one pills every 2 hours and half or 3 hours.    On the Tuesday of my appointment I presented myself at the CHUM, she saw me and discarded her Zona diagnosis and decided on a biopsy. Taking a 4 samples with a 4gauge dermal punch, using only one punch to do all four. She took a sample on top of my left hand, one the first bruise on my inner left forearm, and two under my right breast on the older bruise and a new forming one. Her and her Intern (I think) stitched me up and gave me a last extensive blood test and sent me on my way.   I will receive my result within a week and half, but she will not be there until the 23rd. Currently we're the 14th of June when I'm writing this and it's been a week since the biopsy. Two of the stitching placements have been more than irritated. I regularly change the bandage and keep it clean with a Sea Salt solution and wear loose clothes and keep the area covered by the bandages at all times. I have 4 cats so I make sure nothing irritates them. I let them air out for an hour or two a day in a clean room where the cats are not aloud in. One of the stitches had too much pressure and ripped, which is relatively minor. One of them though skin grew over the stitch itself covering it completely included some other of the stitches which are also \u201cingrown\u201d.   From then to yesterday I was relaxing, taking it easy, not doing much effort and only going out in the backyard to get some air. The bruising disappeared from my face and I had a lot more appearing on my left arm and some but not much on my right arm. I had a pretty big bump and my mother convinced me to go back to Saint-Mary's ER yesterday. I went, it was Dr. Drummond again, he's a great doctor and remembered me. He's very thorough and has great bedside manners and a great sense of humor. He reassured my mother saying he doubted that I would loose my arm or have a permanent \u201cdeformity\u201d and he did not think that I would die but would not elaborate on his theories until I got the results of my biopsies. Gave me more Dilaudid and sent me on my way home.   We stopped at an all night pharmacy and got the prescription. I must say that I've doubled my dose because one pill (1mg) barely takes the edge off the pain. So I take two every 3 hours. It doesn't get me \u201chigh\u201d just very relaxed, I'm coherent (I'm currently on it while I wrote this). I stay up about 18 hours straight so that's about 6 a day. And I sleep for about 9 to 10 hours. But because I don't do much I don't get tired as quickly even being very lethargic.   I'm extremely dehydrated since a week or so, I need to drink a lot, almost excessively but my salivary glands are not working properly and my throat is dry. I feel like I don't urinate enough for what I drink, but my urine is clear and no pain during urinating.  Bowel movement is so-so but I think not eating and taking Dilaudid is causing the constipation. Because otherwise when I'm healthy it's regular.   The left arm is brutal. The veins stiffen and go to the surface, you can see them clearly underneath the skin, the skin becomes \u201cbumped\u201d and then the veins bursts and you can see the blood spilling underneath the skin, it usually takes 1 hour and half from noticing the bump to the blood spilling. The pain appears when the bump because relatively big and presses on nerves, causing my left hand and arm to be very weak. The constant pain compares to having fire injected intravenously and it's a constant, painful and agonizing burning sensation through every capillary, veins and artery through my upper body. Merging that with the back pain, I must say it's awful and I don't know what I would of done without the Dilaudid. I cannot even properly describe the pain. I have never felt anything like this in my life.  Since two days I have a full body itch, no bumps, no burns nor discoloration or any skin botches or anything different. Just an itch through my whole body (arms, legs, back, face, head feet, butt but no in my groin region). No fleas, or anything \u201cmini insects\u201d that are noticeable or anything, just an itch.  It's not easy bruising, as in I don't bruise easily there's absolutely no trauma at all.   Also when I sleep since I'd say since 4 days, I get extremely hot (but no fever) when I'm in bed, I sweat, a lot, and feel very hot. (But my temperature is normal, this is sort of weird). And only in bed.  These are the symptoms which I had/have, those with a star are gone; -Headache.* -Confusion. -Body Weakness. -Back pain. -General \u201cvascular\u201d pain. -Slurred speech. Not often. -Horrible focus. It has gotten a bit better. -Muffled hearing. As if I would hold my hands to my ears, I hear well but slightly muffled                                  and not like under water but really as if my hands would be covering my ears. -Horrible itching all over my body. Just started today (14th of June) -Extreme dehydration. I drink ALL the time, I get tons of Powerade and Gatorade, it helps the   most.  -Dizziness. I thought it was because I barely eat, but I forced myself to eat something and got some sugar in my system and I'm still dizzy to it's a symptom. -Complete lack of appetite. -Eye focus is off. This also got a bit better. -Facial and foot swelling.* It got much better, my face still is a bit swollen but my feet are alright.  -Paleness. I'm extremely pale on the face, I look pretty dead actually, I have very dark black circles beneath my eyes and my lips are either really pale or darkened in an unnatural color (blue-ish/black). It's more than just unusual or die to allergies. -Mouth burning. Each time I eat or something, my mouth is on fire, like a burning sensation, not like I would drink something hot, but just like I was gargle acid.  General Health Info About me;  Medications I've taken in the last 6 months; -Hypnogen (Zolpidem); In Europe for the time I was there to help me sleep. 10Mg once before bed for a month.  -Gravol; Helps me sleep sometimes. (Two tablet maybe twice a month if I feel I won't be able to fall asleep.) -Gabapentin; Prescribed by my family Doctor to help me sleep (which was useless and never re-filled). -Tramacet; 4 pills of 350mg for my current pack pain (not at the same time). Did not work. -Tylenol extra fort (extra strenght); I had a really stiff neck 2 months ago for 2-3 days. -Aleve; A few times for the headaches first mentioned and for the current pack pain (before the Dilaudid or Hydromorphone).  -Pro Valacyclovir; For my very misdiagnosed Zona by Dr. Genvi\u00e8ve Fortier-Riberdy. Out of 42 I took 14.   I take showers which are a few degrees lower (not cold, but a tiny bit cooler than usual) so my blood circulation gets a bit slower (because of the hemorrhaging) to help with the bleeding, sleep with the AC on a few degrees higher also (not freezing, just 2 degrees higher than comfortable temperature) because cool and sleeping helps slow the circulation and the bruising is better the next morning.   I've been very careful with what I eat, any changes in my environment, stress or mental or physical trauma that may have caused this, and there's nothing. I did not have a fever at all, during no point of this it exceeded 37.5. My breathing is fine and my heart rate is still a bit elevated. I think my pressure might be a bit down but nothing too noticeable.   My blood and urine results where 100% normal and I had also blood tests done about 2 months ago by my family doctor which were also normal. My first urine test was a bit \u201cdirty\u201d (transparent and regular color though and the rest was fine).   In my opinion (not a medical professional); I doubt the biopsy will show up with anything, I think my problem is either immune or hematological, if something a vein biopsy would have been appropriate, I think my problem isn't in my tissues nor in my blood (full blood test panel). The problem is not the bruises themselves but an underlying unknown problem.  I drink Apple Cider (not the alcohol one) to help cleanse my Liver to keep them up and healthy. And Cranberry juice for my Kidney's. And pro-biotic capsules (which are the only ones that passed medical tests; Bio-K Plus, CL1285md) because I don't eat much and want to keep my intestinal functions, well, functioning. I barely eat, I do not feel hungry at all. I do my best to force myself to eat, an least soup. But I drink a lot.  My mother tried to help with my sciatic pain, she's an exceptional massage therapist and she finished medical school in Europe (but that's about 30 years ago and never really practiced). She did help me a bit but my nerve is very irritated and inflamed, so she can't do much about it.   No alcohol beverages either during this time at all.   I was in Europe for a month last October to November (5th of October 2009 to the 6th of November 2009).   I gave myself a seasonal flu shot in Europe last November (the 3rd of November 2009 to be exact). There, you can get a prescription for a flu shot syringe (already ready, if the doctor doesn't have any in his office) you can either get the shot when you get it at the pharmacy or take it home on special \u201cdemand\u201d. I was leaving the 5th of November and didn't want to wake up super early so I gave myself the shot at home. (Did it properly, intramuscular in my deltoid muscle).  I don't do well on hormones (like birth control pills). It gives me evil mood swings.  Definitely not pregnant.   I'm not around any chemicals (except hair color) and I did some paint stripping about a month and half ago but the paint stripper was the less toxic one available and well ventilated.   I'm not super active, I rather study but I'm not a couch potato.  Animals I'm in contact with on a daily basis; Huge fish tank I have since 3 years, Lizard I had since 4 years and 4 cats I have since an least 1 year, although I'm allergic I deal with it fairly well and it doesn't bother me and they're house cats that never go out.    I had 4 surgical procedures done; at 2 months old my skull \u201csutures\u201d fused together too quickly, second was when I was 13 I had a cyst on my right wrist, when I was 18 I got a clitoral hood bisection, I performed a Lingual Frenectomy on myself, also when I was 18 I got a copper IUD installed.   No allergy to any medications.   I don't do any drugs, not even marijuana occasionally, I drink socially which is once or twice a month, a bit more during warm weather and I smoke half a pack of cigarettes a day more or less. I have not had a piercing in over a year and no new tattoos in over 2 years.   Gave blood almost exactly a two years ago at a blood drive in Verdun. (Only gave blood once).  No chronic problems except a lot sleeping problems like; dream paralysis, or exploding head (Like loud sounds out of nowhere), or I wake up after a nightmare and still see a bit of what I was dreaming about (wake up from a nightmare with bees in it I'll wake up in a panic and see some bees for 2-3 seconds), insomnia (unable to fall asleep for hours) or over sleeping (sleep 12-15 hours and wake up, then go back to bed after 5 or 6 hours because I'll get super tired, restless legs and arms). So this took a toll on me and I was prescribed Gabapentin, which is a very mild muscle relaxant and an anti-convulsion medication which did nothing for my sleeping or anything else for that matter. I quit taking it after completing a full course and never got a refill.   When I was younger I had chronic back pains but nothing like I currently have. Allergies that were misdiagnosed time over time for the flu by my family Doctor. (Dr. Sayegh Jones working at the CLSC of Verdun/Cote Saint-Paul). I had some \u201csocial\u201d issues, social phobias, more precisely of schools and institution buildings, which I got over.   I was afraid doctors would think I'm crazy or something going to the ER 6 times in a week getting 3 hard medication prescriptions. Usually I'm the first one to send someone to the doctor or recommend going to the hospital. Last time I was in the ER it was almost two years ago, in October of a very advanced Strep throat infection, loosing my eyesight and hearing on the right side and my glands extremely swollen in my neck. The hospital was the last resort. That was 2 years ago.   I'm also afraid that the doctors might think I'm a junkie looking for Morphine or drugs, but to be honest, if I would want to get high/stoned whatever you call it I would get a joint or something but I'm not even remotely interested in drugs. Honestly I was afraid the Dilaudid would make me less coherent and mentally present, and obviously I can do my pure physics so it doesn't affect my mental ability HAH!   I'm almost desperate, the pain is awful and I don't want to spend too long on those pills. And not even for me, but my mother is extremely concerned and I don't want her to worry and spend sleepless nights.

    "content": "Hello, After going through your post in detail, i would like to give suggest from a dermatological perspective. Your condition resembles a rare disorder by name Autoerythrocyte Sensitization (Gardner-Diamond Syndrome). The main clinical feature is the appearence of repeated crops of large painful ecchymoses. Usually this bruise is preceeded by a burning sensation and a feeling of a lump at the affected site. The area gradually becomes red and within an hour bruises appear which are tender and painful for many days, lasting for a week or longer. They are more common on the extremities. The pathology of this condition is poorly understood. It has been hypothetised that one becomes sensitive to ones own red blood cells. This can be demonstrated by injecting the patients own blood by intra cutaneous injection which leads to bruise formation.  The association of high incidents of emotional disturbance have been recorded in these patients and this psycological component has made some researchers to suggest the term Psychogenic Purpura. Examination of blood is normal and treatment is unsatisfactory. However, recently, Plasmaphresis has given good results in a few. Do keep us informed about your biopsy results too.  Best Wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for the detailed post. In my reply, I will not (for ethical reasons) be referring by name, to neither the institutions/hospitals you had attended, nor the doctors who attended on you.  The first thing that struck me as surprising is the fact that you had performed a Lingual frenectomy on yourself at an early age. Pain thresholds do change with times. I hope the clitoral hood bisection that you underwent was carried out by medical personnel.  There is only one condition that perhaps comes just close enough to resemble some of the symptomatology described. This condition  is known as  \u201cAutoerythrocyte sensitization\u201d (Gardner-Diamond syndrome).  Autoerythrocyte sensitization is typically encountered in white women who are emotionally  stressed or who have known psychologic illnesses.  Pathogenesis: as yet not fully elucidated. Escape of RBCs into the tissues is involved in the pathogenesis of the lesion.    Symptomatology: Trauma induced or spontaneous, painful ecchymosis  occur. Sometimes. bruising may occur at sites distant from the site of trauma. Coagulation parameters are typically within normal range. case history included repeated visits to various physicians at different centers and an extensive investigative profile.  Diagnosis: Is by autoerythrocyte sensitization test. In this test, 0.1 milliliters of autologous RBCs or erythrocytic stroma is injected intradermally at one site (and a separate control injection without RBCs) at another site. Both injections are preferably given at sites difficult for the patient to reach(to reduce the possibility of self-induced excoriations). If pain, swelling, and induration at the site of RBC injection appear(and not at the control site)  24 to 48 h after injection, then the test is considered positive.  One very detailed study published in 1967 observed  \u201ca predominance of hysterical and masochistic character traits as well as a propensity to express psychological problems in physical form both through conversion mechanisms and psychophysiological responses\u201d. The authors suggest that this is an organic disease, that is closely related to severe emotional disturbances and that hypnotic suggestion can apparently influence lesion production. http://www.psychosomaticmedicine.org/cg ... /5/491.pdf  The main treatment for this condition is psychiatric intervention and therapy.  As far as your symptoms are concerned, the description \u201cFrom there the veins broke (I felt a \u201ccrunch\u201d) and blood spilled underneath my skin\u201d, has not been reported in this condition(to the best of my knowledge).So, your condition does seem unique. Therefore, it will be best to wait for the skin biopsy results to arrive and then your doctor will undoubtedly guide you concerning further management. I hope this information is useful. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Arsene,  It can be very difficult to have documented physical symptoms and hear that the cause may be related to psychological factors.  Having the diagnosis of autoerythrocyte sensitization, if that is the diagnostic conclusion, does not mean that the person is mentally ill.  It is a rare somatoform disorder in which the medical symptoms are very real.  It is a diagnosis of exclusion, meaning that when every other possibility has been ruled out, autoerythrocyte sensitization (Gardner-Diamond Syndrome) must be considered.  Conditions that are ruled out include autoimmune disease, purpura conditions and amyloidosis, among others.  These conditions would be revealed by blood work and skin biopsies in addition to careful examination and evaluation, such as you describe.  Since they have not been identified through the tests that you have undergone, psychosocial stressors must be considered.  There may be no overt psychological symptoms, and the person may consider their stressors usual and manageable, while the stressors are in fact placing major stress on the body.  Case histories are not plentiful since the condition is rare, but through exclusion, psychosocial stressors are clearly indicated.  There is likely to be resistance to the idea of having a \"psychiatric\" diagnosis, but one must remember that it is really a medical condition caused by psychosocial stress instead of by bacteria or a virus.  There may be a genetic influence.  Others have been resistant to the concept of psychological treatment being part of the treatment directed at a medical condition.    In your situation, consider your description: you have a history of social phobias, you are a student (which is stress-inducing in itself), you have had painful and unexplained physical symptoms, you have had worry and fears regarding what was happening to you, the waiting for long periods during acute symptoms, having a flat tire on the way to seek further evaluation, unrelenting pain, extensive sleep problems which may include sleep terrors (an anxiety syndrome), the insult of being left alone and cold in a hallway and the diagnosis of Zona, and have undergone extensive and repeated tests.  Yet you appear to minimize your own stress and instead focus on reducing your mother's worry.  It is notable that you were relaxing and taking it easy and the facial bruising began to resolve.  A psychological evaluation of your stress level likely would find significant stressors prior to the development of your symptoms, as well as those since you have sought treatment.  The earlier psychological treatment is received, the better the outcome with this condition.  And I will emphasize again that psychological treatment in this situation is part of the treatment for a medical condition.  I hope you are able to accept all avenues of treatment to help resolve your distressing condition.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! I had knee sugery done last week to fix a torn miniscus. About 4 days ago, I developed severe pain in the calf of my left leg, where my surgery was done. I thought it might be muscle related,so I asked my fiance to rub it. He said he could feel a lump deep inside in the spot he was rubbing and that's the area that's very painful. This morning as I was putting lotion on my legs, the apinful area felt warmer than the rest of my leg, only it seemed to cool down with rest and gets warm when I'm upwalking around. Could this be a blood clot? Do they do that-get warm with walking and cool down with rest? I'm worried, as my mom was hospitalized in May of this year for blood clots on the lungs. She has had problems off and on with blood clots since she was in her 20's, but was never put on blood thinners until her incident in May. Could this also be something hereditary? Thank you for your time!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: deep vein thrombosis",
    "content": "Hi, Your concern about DVT is well founded. A past history of varicose veins, a family history of pulmonary embolism, either proven or suspected, and the history of recent lower extremity surgery, certainly would be reasons enough to cast aspersions.  Of course a DVT needs to be excluded soon as well as, congenital thromophilias.  However, there are other conditions that also may cause a similar clinical picture such as, - Cellulitis, - Baker's cyst,  - Torn gastrocnemius muscle, - intramuscular haematomas etc.  Clinical diagnosis alone of venous thromboembolism is often inaccurate, and most patients with suspected venous thromboembolism do not have the disease.  As you had recently undergone a knee arthroscopy, one other condition (although appears very unlikely in your case) at the least, merits discussion and that is, extravasation of irrigation fluid.   Extravasation of irrigation fluid is the unintended migration of irrigation fluid used as part of a surgical procedure or certain other procedures in clinical practice.This may be realized during a procedure or in the post operative period.It can result in a compartment syndrome. There have been case reports of delayed presentations(up to a week following discharge from hospital).  In the context of knee arthroscopy (and other arthroscopic procedures), this may occur into the calf muscles,thigh muscles or other neighboring muscles.  Hypotheses: Capsular defects may aggravate risk. In individuals with intact knee joint capsules, fluid may dissect around the semimembranosus bursa or beneath the tendons of the sartorius, gracilis, and semitendinosus muscles and thus find entry into the calf muscles.    The use of pressurized pulsatile irrigation systems, automated arthroscopy pumps for the infusion of fluids into the joint during an arthroscopic procedures,and the use of pressurized intravenous infusion of parenteral fluids have contribute to genesis of this complication.The use of a pneumatic tourniquets adds to the risk.   You must consult your orthopedic surgeon immediately and get assessed.Generally, investigations such as compression ultrasonography and color fow duplex imaging are often the preferred initial investigations.  In the event DVT is ruled out in your case following these and other tests, a hematoma within the calf muscles seems most likely (perhaps causing local inflammation or in the process of getting infected). Good luck!\n\n",

The investigations would probably involve a bone marrow examination to rule out myelodysplasias and to confirm diagnosis.Folate levels and schilling test with radioactive cynacobalamin,and tests for iron levels are the other relevant investigations.

    "content": "Hi, Bone marrow involvement in alcohol misuse/abuse can happen in the following scenarios: - as \"bone marrow failure\" or - as \"intraosseous fat necrosis\" associated with alcoholic pancreatitis.    Cases of severe pancytopenia with bone marrow hypoplasia after consuming excessive amounts of alcohol for many years have been reported.Prompt hematologic remissions have also been noted in these individuals if they completely abstained from alcohol and consumed an adequate diet.  Bone marrow failure may manifest as failure of the marrow to produce 1, 2, or all 3 cell lines of the blood (Single cytopenias, bicytopenias, and Pancytopenias respectively).  Bone marrow failure occurs more commonly in countries in the East than in the West(as In Japan & the Far East -at least 3 times higher than in the United States or Europe).Mexico and Latin America also show a high prevalence.  Cases of \"intraosseous fat necrosis\" associated with severe alcoholic pancreatitis also have been reported.Skeletal involvement may occur as an isolated phenomenon or simultaneously with subcutaneous nodules and polyarthritis in these individuals.    Some necropsy studies indicate a relatively higher prevalence (approximately 10%) of intramedullary fat necrosis in patients who died of acute pancreatitis.  Thankfully you have suffered a milder form of what appears to be a pancytopenia with a relatively more prominent involvement of platelets. As i indicated earlier, studies show \"prompt\" recovery to near-normal levels of the blood elements provided..... - alcohol intake is completely stopped, - person consumes an adequate diet and  - no other contributing/aggravating factor exists. Hope you will recover soon, Good luck!\n\n",

I am a little concerned because this is jeopardizing my future as we started playing again. Do you have any suggestive blood tests or work ups?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   Most of your labs are either normal or very close, so probably don't reflect the cause of your complaint. However, the potassium (K) is on the low side, which could very well explain the leg weakness and trembling, while your other symptoms do sound suggestive of a sinus infection, which should have no relation to the low K, which is my primary concern. Where is it going? Do you manage to stay properly hydrated? Electrolyte imbalance is often the cause of generalized musclular weakness (and cramping).   Do you, by any chance, have a fondness for licorice? This is something which, as silly as it sounds, needs to be ruled out early on, as over-indulgence in licorice can  cause potassium loss with consequent muscle weakness or even flaccid paralysis in extreme cases.  Of course there are other causes of low K, not always obvious. Eliminating licorice is just to get the oddball  thing out of the way.  As for the EBV and not recalling having had mono, this is not at all unusual and the ups and downs of it are not usually a major problem, although of course there can be flareups  which include marked fatigue and lassitude. I don't think this is likely to be  a major problem, but it is something to keep in mind.   Again, I  think the single most remarkable finding (seemingly overlooked by your doctor) is the low K  level. It could reflect something as simple as a diet deficient in potassium, and of course it's not low enough to cause profound or life-threatening problems, but the fact it is not normal is odd and ought to be explored, especially since muscle strength and function depend so heavily upon it.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "You're welcome. Your blood pressure seems to be staying within reasonable bounds, if a tiny bit on the high side. The 24-hour urine test is somethng worth making the time for, since it can evaluate whether or not you suffer from an unusual sort of adrenal tumor called pheochromocytoma. These tumors can actually occur in other parts of the body than the adrenal glands themselves, and they secrete adrenaline of their own, which can not only account for blood pressure increases, but also nervousness and an increase in resting heart rate. This still wouldn't explain the dizziness, however, which may well be a separate issue and should be investigated on its own. Since your blood pressure never seems to be low, it's probably not faintness you're feeling, but vertigo, usually a product of an inner ear disturbance. This should be explored. The potassium supplement should help with the loss of that salt, which is important, but dizziness can be, as you've found, a very disruptive thing too, even when it's not dangerous. Checking for vertigo would be very important, or at least treating for it symptomatically with somethng like meclizine.  Best of luck to you. Keep in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Well, those test results are good news, but at some point we sometimes wish something would show up just so we could have something to hang the symptoms on. The sinus infection theory is still very viable, especially if it is a deep sinus or a walled-off infection. Antibiotics may well do the trick in that case, but sometimes need to be rotated, and yes, those infections, even with treatment, can be incredibly long-lasting, stubborn and recurrent. That may just be the culprit.   Thanks for following up, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  The BP elevation is just at the point where we like to follow it, with an eye toward treating medically if it continues to creep up consistently. The number you quote here is considered the upper end of \"normal\", and while it's not, in itself, any reason to stop working out, do be sure you keep your appointment, as your doctor will likely want to follow this and may even decide to begin treating it now, rather than waiting. It's not bad, it's just not quite where we like to see it. Currently the trend is toward wanting to see it no higher than 120/80, but there can be enough fluctuation during the course of a day, that your doctor may just want to keep an eye on this. Not yet a \"dangerous\" level. Maybe a treatable one.\n\n",

You may be given a 24 hour monitor to wear to see what sort of irregularity your heart is trying to pull. It's also the right time to make the transition from pediatrician to GP or internist. Since your BP is still fluctuating and is creeping up, it seems, I'd definitely say it's time for a cardiological consult. This may be a big help. I certainly hope so.

    "content": "Hi there and apologies for the delay in response, but was due to circumstances beyond my control. This latest finding is very interesting and, while not something one would think of right off or even halfway through, it could explain a lot. Your idea about the possibility of something like Cushing's being caused by heavy workouts is interesting and might bear further investigation, but there's no baseline support for such a theory at present. However, pheochromocytoma is not ruled out until the test has been done, and I'm not sure why your urologist is certain you don't have this, when there is clearly something going on. This should be ruled out as well as Cushing's or something similar. The elevated cortisol is being caused by something, and of course it could be related to an increase in serum adrenaline as well, all of which are suspects in your symptoms. I can well understand your frustration, but you may be close to a resolution now, and someone needs to order that 24-hour urine test. I'd push for that, ask him to just humor you, and if it's negative there's really nothing lost. The cortisol elevation also needs to be followed.   As I said, you may be getting close to a resolution. While there's not enough as yet to call this one thing or another, there are now some strong clues. Good luck to you and please follow up with us. I should be able to reply in a timely manner for the forseeable future. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "TTP",
    "content": "My husband got TTP July 30 2009. He was in the hospital for 2 weeks, 10 days having pericisis treatment (taking out his platlets and put in frozen new platlets) and in ICU for those 10 days, he also had severe pain and was put on pain medicine. Moved to regular room for a few more days. He was home for 2 days and started having confusion, weak, fever, pain and weakness. Took him to the ER and they admitted him back into the hospital for another week to observe him and treat for pain. After a week he was sent home again and has followed up several times with Hematologist. He has been fine since then. My husband also has Crohn's and now since he has had TTP Doctors are scared of helping him. They all think they are going to induce TTP again. So, they don't know what tom do now that my husband is full blown Crohn's flair up. They have been passing him from Doctor to Doctor. He seen a surgeon yesterday and said he could take out my husbands colon and rectum, but that is all he can do. Husband had a CT scan today. Doctor is suppose to call after he gets his hands on them. My husband was given a Remicade treatment 2 weeks ago and started flairing a few days after receiveing the treatment. He has gone down hill every since. He has lost 15lbs in 10 days, running a fever off and on and barely eating. I am having him drink Ensure to put on weight. He drinks4 a day with 350 calories in each can. He is on Predisone (10mg) a day. Before he has his colon and rectum removed we would really like to follow all medicine help first. Any ideas? I have been searching the internet for someone thats not scared to help him. Thank you for your help in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Severe Microcrytic Anemia with Normal Iron Levels",
    "content": "Hello -  I am a 42 yo woman and went into my doctor for a health screen for adoption. Evidently, the paperwork called for a CBC, first one I've ever gotten. The doctor called me in immediately to say everything was Normal, except I was severely anemic, so much so she said if it was any worse she'd have me get a blood transfusion.  My cells were microcrytic, so the doc ordered an iron level test and gave me an iron supplement to take. She called immediately the next day and said my iron levels came in  at 47, which she says is normal (normal being 30-170). So she is referring me to a hematologist.   Even thought I went in for just this routine health check - I now realize I had been having symptoms of anemia - which I had atrributed to my allergies and asthma (and just getting older). I have been having dizzy spells with exertion for the past few months, heavy breathing and heart pounding (all attributed to my asthma issues by me). I also have recently noticed the brittle, severly splitting nails (very much so in the last month but I attributed them to a very bad manicure), pica (I have always loved ice though, so didn't think much of it), and fatigue. I also noticed what I believe was restless leg syndrome last night (my back and legs trying to contract like I was shivvering from cold) and my husband says my gums and inner eyelids are pale.   Here are my questions:  1) Could this be beta-thelassemia minor? I am 42, wouldn't it have been diagnosed earlier? And even if it is possible, why the sudden anemia now, after all these years? My paternal gramma was anemic in  middle age, but she has passed on and no one seems to know the type or cause of her anemia. No one else on either side of the family has reported any anemia.  2)Could this be related to a thyroid problem? My sister had Graves disease about 20 years ago. She took the thyroid suppression drugs and it went into remission and has not come back. My dad also informed me he was hypothyroid for a period as a kid. Docs have checked my thyroid before and all has been normal.  3) Can severe allergies cause this at all? My already very serious allergies just worsen with age. I currently have some unexplained eczema on my thigh, which for me always means I have some new allergy (usually food or contact) I haven't figured out yet. In the past 2 years I have developed a severe gag reflex each morning to the post nasal drip as the overnight build up drains. I have always had a seriously strong gag reflex to smells etc, but this thing in the mornings is new and annoying as I sometimes even gag so hard I vomit a little.  Thanks for your help... all my other tests are normal, and we have no family medical history of anything notable other than what is listed above (and My dad also has Meniere's disease, Gilbert's syndrome and just recovered from prostate cancer afetr surgery).\n\n",

If you had a recent infection with a virus this may have cuased you to make more lymphocytes than usual.  I do notice that you have a slightly low MCV.  This sometimes goes along with iron deficiency (although you are not anemic).  You may want to take a multivitamin with iron (an over the counter one would be fine) to help prevent iron deficiency anemia from developing.    Overall, I think your lab results are not concerning.

My symptoms: reoccurring: ear infections, sinus infections, strep throat, oral ulcers, photosensitivity, upper abdominal pain, chest pain, light headedness/dizziness, headaches, joint tenderness, various muscle aches, and swollen lymph nodes.   Constant symptoms: malar rash, left shoulder pain, neck pain, right hip/lower back pain, and chronic fatigue.  I have had 2 bone marrow biopsies - 10/2008, 10/2009.  Both have come back fine.  I have had so many tests done - ANA, SS-A, SS-B, RA, Arthritis Panel, Vitamin deficiencies, Ig's, cholesterol, glucose, ANCA, anti-granulocyte antibodies - all have come back either negative or normal.  ANA, SSA, SSB - have all been tested on multiple occasions - always negative.  Sed rate is 42 (slightly high).  I have had an ultrasound of upper abdomin -all is normal, no splenomegaly.  I have tried steroids (prednisone) - bottoms out my neuts, but ups my WBC. I don't like G-CSF or GM-CSF due to the horrible reaction my body has to it - severe headache/migraine, severe bone pain, shaking, fever, cold sweats, nausea, vomiting, severe upper abdominal pain, severe chest pain (might be bone pain), and passing out.  My mother has SLE and Sjogren's Syndrome - my tests always come back negative for both.  Does anyone have any idea what is wrong with me? I recently moved and am trying to get in to see a new hematologist.   Thanks for any comments.\n\n",

I am a 37 year old male and had 2-3 ultrasounds of my liver in the past year or two suggesting just fatty infiltration of the liver.  I am also a type 2 diabetic, mildly high triglycerides and mildly high cholesterol and am on no meds for my diabetes.  I have been seeing a GI doctor for about 2 years now and he keeps telling me to lose weight and I have neglected to do so.  My ALT has been mildly elevated for the entire 2 years that I have seen him (between 65-95) but just recently I have had my LFT's checked quite often and the ALT was 119(dec 09) 153(Mar 10), 123(Apr 10), 108(Mid Apr 10), 119(Late Apr 10), 89(May 10) and then just recently 125(June 10).  All other numbers are within normal limits.  I was a pretty heavy drinker as a young man and as soon as I saw that my ALT went up to 153 I quit drinking IMMEDIATELY without any help just 6 weeks ago.  The numbers have been slowly lowering but my GI suggests a liver biopsy and I am completely against it.  What would you suggest that I do?  I have also lost about 15-20 lbs in the last 6 weeks due to not drinking and eating better along with added exercise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The problem with alcohol is that as we age our ability to handle alcohol by the liver becomes less.Consequently there is deposition of fat in the liver.This is known as steatosis and might be asymptomatic.Abstinence from alcohol for 2 to3 weeks is enough to clear the histologic picture. But then long term high consumption could lead to an hepatitis and cirrhosis known by name alcoholic liver disease.Generally 40 to 80gms of alcohol for 10 to 12 years is associated with higher risk.Women have a higher chance so does obesity,and improper diet in both. While liver function tests,ultrasound,triglyceride level do give some information the single test that is most sensitive in diagnosis would be liver biopsy. Also it helps to rule out other liver conditions like hemochromatosis which could be found in diabetes also. Also you would need to get your serum proteins and AG ratio since you seem to have lost weight in a short time which of course may be related to excercise,diet,and abstinence from alcohol. The foundation of treatment of alcoholic liver disease is abstinence. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Permanent Brusing After Trauma?",
    "content": "Dear Doctor(s): 20 yrs. ago I got hit with a racquetball to the thigh. What began as a red mark the size of the ball eventually became a blue/gray deep dermal discoloration & spread all the way down my thigh & over my knee & shin slowly, over the course of many months. The discoloration is sort of \"see thru\" and makes my skin look \"dirty\" from a distance. Up 'til about 6 months ago I never had any strange sensations in that area, but toward the beginning of this year my thigh started to feel warm on and off - like a heater is blowing directly on it. And I get little prinkly sensations and a TINY bit of numbness off and on. The discoloration is hideous to me & my self esteem has suffered over the years because of it (I've never worn shorts or a bathing suit). In much the same way, 5 yrs. ago I had to give myself small shots to the belly. Within a few days of each shot, a light blue/gray discoloration developed around each injection site and remained permanently. Lastly, I've had a blue/gray see-thru patch of skin on my abdomen since I was about 6 yrs. old. My parents don't know how or when it came about but they claim it was not present at birth. It seems SIMILAR, although not EXACTLY like the \"bruise\" on my thigh. I'm searching for a way to remove all 3 of these ares of discoloration and bring my skin back to it's natural color (I'd be willing to try lasers, topical creams, light therapy, etc.) but I'm getting conflicting \"diagnoses\" from doctors & no-one seems to know what caused the discolorations or what could remove someting so deep in the dermis. Everyone is perplexed! One of the hypotheses was that the Iron leaked out of my blood after the trauma and left behind a stain. I've heard yes, it can be removed, no it can't, try Vitamin K, try laser, try UV therapy, it's Scleroderma nothing can help, it's a vascular issue, it's a nerve issue, it's light refraction ... you name it. The dermatologist refers me to the hematologist who refers me to the neurologist who refers me to the rheumatologist who refers me to the cosmetic surgeon - and around and around we go. My question is 2-part: 1) Any idea what disease process this is and what caused it? and 2) What are my options concerning removal?  Yours very sincerely, Ann-Marie L. Cleveland, OH\n\n",

Platelet function is normal to supranormal with 30% showing antiplatelet antibodies.Autoimmune causes are postulated as a possible cause.

The commoner cause for neutrophilia is infection.But then your son has been investigated and except a CRP which can be considered as average value,and neurtrophilia he is otherwise normal. Neutrophils exist in circulating form CGP ie circulating granulocyte pool The other is known as marginal granulocytic pool ie MGP adding to TBGP ie total blood granulocytic pool. Those who do heavy workouts,sometimes there is a surge in the CGP due to influx from the MGP thus resulting in transient neutrophil increase.This is normal and physiological. Your son may need a repeat test to make sure. Best wishes.\n\n",

It hurts to sit and also grab things (like open a jar) because there is no cushioning.  Is it possible that this could be caused by low ferritin?  Also, am I considered anemic even though I fall with the normal range for Hemoglobin?  Maybe my normal is just higher?

I wanted to run this by you and see what you think....at the time of hospitilization, different tests were done to check for any underlying bacterial infections (she never did have a fever) and all came back normal. She does suffer from severe allergies so that would probably explain the dark circles under her eyes. She wasnt on any type of steroid therapy during the hospital stay, although her asthma doctor did prescribe her predisnone after we came home. She does suffer from severe nose bleeds, mostly in the middle of the night, to where I have to get up and change the bed. I don't know if this will give you any further insight as to what may be going on with her, but I just wanted to know if there is anything I may need to discuss with her pediatrician before going.

Would you consider my d-dimer level significantly high?  What things other than cancer or inflammation could cause this?  I have had no recent surgeries, however I am 4 months postpartum (natural birth).  The nurse had a hard time drawing my blood, she poked and prodded and it came out REALLY slow.  Could this cause it to be elevated?\n\n",

    "content": "D-dimers are break down products of blood clots.  In your case, they were likely using it as a screening test for pulmonary embolism.  Since the CT was negative, it is quite unlikely that this was the cause.  In the absence of other findings, an elevated D-Dimer to the extent that yours is elevated is extremely nonspecific and likely does not represent pathology.  If you were in the hospital we may want to check another one later to see if it had returned to normal.  If you were an outpatient I would probably not worry about it and would not order a repeat.  Your pain sounds more consistent with costochondritis or pleurisy than with heart or pulmonary embolism causes.    If you still have questions regarding your pain feel free to post some details and we'll see if we can help you.    Hope this helps.\n\n",

I suspect that your lab test does not represent anything abnormal, but is most likely simply a normal variation.

Previously, my labwork with regard to methotrexate has been normal. Could my abnormal labs be a result of the RA process, leftover methotrexate in my system, or something else? My symptoms are: joint pain and swelling, extreme fatigue, weight loss, hot flashes lasting hours - they occur even while at rest, but are more pronounced when cleaning the house and moving around, low-grade fever, loss of appetite. My recent labwork showed:  MCV 78.8 low (normal range is 81-99) MCH 24.8 low (normal range is 27.0 - 31.0) potassium 5.1 high (normal range is 3.5 - 5.0) I feel lousy all of the time. I am supposed to start remicade infusions next week for the RA, as the methotrexate makes me sick and wasn't very effective. Any idea what the labs mean? Any connection to the hot flashes? Previous labs showed my hormone levels were ok. The hot flashes are unbearable, as is the overall \"sick\" feeling. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Venessection for high ferritin and low haemoglobin?",
    "content": "I'm a 53 year old male diagnosed with beta thalasemia. About one and a half year ago I had my ferritin level checked for the first time and the result was 1012ug/lt. After that I had the ferritin level checked monthly and the value fluctuated around 850ug/lt up to 916ug/lt. During this period there was one time where the ferritin level reached up to 1200ug/lt. The last blood test I took (today) showed a value of 848ug/lt. So far I have tried to maintain my ferritin level and keep it low through diet for e.g. avoiding red meat, egg yolk, avoiding consumption of vitamin C after poultry/iron containing vegetable consumption, and avoiding supplements that contains iron and zinc.  Due to doctor's concerns that my high ferritin level might affect the other organs I have done ultrasound for liver and kidney and the results showed that they're in a good condition and are functioning normally.  I have visited several hematologists however they offered two different opinions to treat my condition.   1. If my ferritin level goes up to >1000ug/lt, I was to start the treatment by consuming eksjade. If after consuming the medicine and my ferritin level drops below 1000ug/lt I was to stop the treatment. The reason why the hematologist suggested this treatment was because my haemoglobin level was 130g/lt. Another reason considered by this hematologist of why venessection method would be risky was because of my thalasemia. It was also recommended that I should drink black tea after each meal to neutralise the iron in food consumed through urine.  2. The other haematologist considered my low haemoglobin level and thought that it's better to treat my condition with venessection method. The reason why this hematologist thought that this method is safer than consuming the drug was because the drug has a lot of side effects. This hematologist also thought that my haemoglobin level would not be a problem.  Right now I'm intending to start treating my condition and I have considered both methods of treatments. I'm considering to go ahead with option number 2 but I have a few questions in mind beforehand.  So the question here is, how much blood would be withdrawn for example, for a ferritin value of 1000ug/lt? or for e.g. if the ferritin value was 800ug/lt? would there be any difference?  Secondly, do you think there's a need for ferroscan? And what is the purpose of ferroscan?  Lastly, in your opinion, was my decision to do the venessection is the better way to treat my condition?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,You are partly right in saying that only males suffer from hemophilia.Woman is only a carrier.But you have bruises so did your mother had some related problem.Being a sex determined problem why should you have factor8 deficiency?That is probably the reason you have been reffered to hematology rather than a suspicion of malignancy.Women carry two x chromosomes which protect by producing adequate factor8 while the males have xy and have the disease carried in the single x.But rarely mutation could occur in one of the xx in a woman and a mild deficiency status could occur.Again an xy with a mutant gene in a manifesting female.Some times combined factor5 and8 with moderate factor8 deficiency may be mistaken as hemophilia.So do not worry about malignancy and get your self examined.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am 36 years old and pregnant with twins.  I am 33 weeks along.  I have a platelet count of 50 and my hemotologist has recommended prednisone, 100mg/day for the rest of my pregnancy.  I will be having a C-section on Dec.9, 2009.  I took my first dose today...  I am concerned about this medication vs my pregnancy.  Is this medication safe for my twins?  Would a platelet transfusion be safer for my babies?  I would love to have a second opinion.  Please help.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I had blood work done recently to determine whether or not I had a thyroid issue.  Everything came back normal except that I had a lower hemoglobin count.  I didn't get an exact number, the nurse said that it wasn't low, just low for me.  I had just finished a menstrual cycle at the time the blood was drawn.  It was rather heavy with a lot of clotting.  I was on a liquid iron supplement as a child and had to take an iron supplement during my pregnancy.  My sister is regularly anemic.  The nurse seems to think it could be a vitamin deficiency.  (My diet is seriously lacking in the iron department and I drink tea nonstop.)  I'm scared to death that it could be cancer, mainly because my dad has lung cancer and this is on my mind rather frequently.  Could my cycle have something to do with this lower count?  I truly appreciate your time.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Anaemia is mainly either due to nutritional factors or loss of blood like in excess menstrual flow,or bleeding from other sites like gastro intestinal tract.Debilitating diseaes,auto immune disorders,and parasitic infections are amongst other rarer causes.The commonest is nutritional and your diet is probably responsible for this.Iron deficiency,B12 deficiency cause these types and can be recognized by doing a CBC.Appropriate therapy instituted would increase your Hb levels.Proper foods recommended for each type can prevent development of anaemia.Do get your self examined and there is nothing to worry.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 42 years old, and healthy.  My serum ferritin is 12.  With my first baby 3 years ago, my crit dropped to 18 and hovered around 18 for about 6 months.  It staggered up to 32 with Chromagen, but the Ferritin stayed at 10.   Second pregnancy, the crit stayed around 32, but Ferritin stayed at 10.  Today, the crit moves between 30-38, and the ferritin is still 12.   My joints hurt; I am tired all the time; my heart rate by the end of the day goes from 60 bpm to about 90.  My nails have ridges in them.  When I sleep 10 hours and wake up, I feel like I have carbon monoxide...it's as if I've never slept.  If I get less than 10 hours of sleep, I can hardly function.  There's no depression or other etiology.  Here's the problem.  Three doctors have dismissed the serum ferritin and indicated that since the crit has risen, I don't need iron.  One physician indicated that low serum ferritin can cause other problems, even if the crit is holding.    Does anyone think the serum ferritin numbers are disturbing, and if so, will shots or IV iron improve matters?\n\n",

Do I need to be concerned? I know that I have a lot of symptoms of hemochromatosis-- to include hypothyroidism, gall bladder disease w/o family history, liver damage, etc.-- and am curious as to whether subclinical iron overload could be a factor.

Here's the problem; I recently got a job that involves a lot of standing (often for 4-5 hours at a time). I started experiencing sore feet and legs, and more worrying, occasional sharp pains behind my knees. Since I wanted to avoid DVTs and more spider veins (I already have  a few) I bought a pair of light compression stockings (8-15mmHg) and have been using them at work for two days now. Today when I removed them I noticed a pronounced bluish discoloration in the skin immediately above where the stockings stopped. It's persisted for a few hours, and the area is tender.

    "content": "Hi drocra, One of the problems associated with (esp. the above-knee compression) stockings is that they tend to 'roll' down at their upper edges and cause some constriction (sort of tourniquet effect).  Chance of this happening is more in individuals with thick thighs. Usually, this may cause minimal discomfort but nothing more serious. In your case it seems to have caused bruising, perhaps due to your Factor V Leiden heterozygosity.\n\n",

    "title": "Unexplained Vein Burst in Leg",
    "content": "I am a 29 yr old female.  Yesterday, a blood vessel in my right leg burst for no apparent reason.  It burst in two places.  The larger burst is on the outside of my leg a few inches below the knee, the smaller secondary burst is right at the bend of the knee but not behind the knee.  I am assuming that it is a vein b/c I have always had a visible, close-to-the-surface vein right in that area.  I have several visible veins, but they do not look like vericose veins (i.e. they are not bulging or painful).  The burst was preceded by a sharp, localized stinging sensation (I thought I was being bit by a mosquito).  The same thing happened about five years ago in the same place on my left leg.  That first one was worse - it left a larger pool of blood under my skin anyway - and it was preceded by an itching sensation.  It healed in about a week, and I didn't pay it much mind.  I thought it was a random, freak, one-time occurance.  But now that it's happened a second time...  I have no known history of blood clots.  In accord the rest of the women in my family, my bp is on the low side and I am almost always slightly anemic.  My father had a mild heart attack several years ago, but after losing some weight and bringing his cholesterol and stress levels down, he is now in peak health.  I am mostly vegetarian, but I do not know what my cholesterol level is.  I am a light smoker.  I used to be a heavy drinker and marijuana smoker, but I have been clean now for almost two years.  I am not on any medications, per se, but I do take a daily multi-vitamin and extra B vitamins (being a smoker).  I also take oregano oil, cloves, DHA (fish oil), and probiotics to control systemic candida overgrowth.  Other unexplained symptoms that may or may not be connected include mild peripheral neuropathy (tingling and numbness in my hands and/or feet that comes and goes, sometime lasting a few minutes, sometimes lasting for hours), swelling in my hands, feet, and ankles (esp in hot weather and if I've been walking or sitting for long stretches), itchy skin (esp my buttocks and the tops of my thighs), and migraine headaches accompanied by sudden drop in body temperature.  Could these things all be related?  Are the burst blood vessels really something I should worry about?  Thank you for your time and consideration.  I and my husband do not currently have health insurance, so I really need to know if this is something I can let slide or not before I shell out a bunch of money for office visits and tests.  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear xsgenefuzz, Everything you describe seems to be rooted in a fairly serious systemic problem that deals with both your arteries and your veins.  Your arteries are the vessels that carry blood away from the heart and feed life promoting nutrients and oxygen to the rest of the body: brains to toes! Veins are the vessels that carry blood from the outer-reaches of your \"planet\" back to the heart and lungs to be cleansed and re-energized.  There are two similar conditions that affect these vessels:  PVD and CVI.  PVD is peripheral vascular disease and refers to a problem with the arteries of the body, inhibiting their ability to carry blood effectively to its destinations.  CVI is Chronic venous insufficiency and similarly adversely affects the veins ability to carry blood back to the heart and lungs.  With arterial insufficiency you will get the tingling and paresthesias you describe. With venous insufficiency you get dependent swelling in you feet and legs.  Varicose veins are ones that happen to sit close to the surface - enough so that if the flow through the veins is compromised these vessels can swell enough that if fragile will burst - just as you describe.   I would heartily recommend that you seek health insurance and then through your assigned primary physician arrange the proper medical diagnostics and treatments to protect you from possible serious complications associated with PVD and CVI.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: prothrombin gene mutation",
    "content": "Hi, There is a paucity of studies in patients with prothrombine gene mutation regarding long-term anticoagulation.This is due to the relative rarity of this disorder. Factor V Leiden is the most common cause of inherited thrombophilias accounting for about 40 to 50 percent of cases.Studies done in patients with factor V Leiden have shown that the risk of bleeding from anticoagulation outweighed the potential benefits of anticoagulation. They recommend that only Patients that have had multiple thromboembolic episodes or are at high risk of further episodes (for example, multiple deficiencies) may be started on long-term anticoagulation.  Beginning long-term anticoagulation is influenced by the patient's overall risk of recurrent thrombosis balanced against the risks associated with long-term anticoagulation on an individual basis.  Since you have proven prothrombine gene mutation and have proven internal jugular thrombosis and segmental pulmonary emboli the risk is fairly high and so there is a chance that you may need long term anticoagulation (if your individual risk for recurrent thromboembolic disease is high).  I hope this helps you to understand this condition better.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old female, that has over the last two or three months noticed bruises, that are all painless all over my problem.  They all range in size, right now alone I have anywhere between 12 and 16 bruises, some on my elbows, arms, legs and hands.  I also have this spot on my ankle that is really dark brown and has increased in size in the past few months.  It was at first the size of a quarter, now it encompasses almost the whole left side of my left foot, all of my ankle and up to my pinky toe.  I would say that it is about 4 or 5 inches long and 3 inches wide.  I also have darkening and peeling on a spot on my wrist, that started a little over a year ago, and has progressively gotten bigger and darker.  I have another spot on my stomach, that is starting, it has a diameter of between two and three inches.  My toes are becoming discolored, especially my pinky toe on my right foot, it is turning black starting at my nailbed, and dramatically increasing in size as well.  I also have these small pinpoint red dots up and down my legs and arms, which under flourescent lighting is highly visible.  My nails and hair are brittle and easy to break off.  My body also has difficulty healing from any type of injury, leaving permanent scars, and taking sometimes months to heal from a simple cut or scratch.  What could be causing this problem?  Could it be a Hematologic Disorder, an Autoimmune Disease or Cancer?  What would be your best guess as to what it would be?  I am actually going to see my Rheumatologist in less than a month, and hope that will share some incite into these problems as well.  I have also noticed more and more moles, all are brown and range in size.  I actually have one that is the size of a penny, and you can actually wiggle it around, it is hideous.\n\n",

I have mild fatigue (could be weight related?), no fevers whatsoever, no pain (except in my torn meniscus), no obvious infections, no swelling or recent illnesses.

Again, everything normal range except: WBC 12,200 (neutrophils 77%, low lymphocytes - no absolute numbers run) CRP 25.5 1Hr Sedimentation Rate 37.5  Rheumatoid arthritis suggested (family history), but I can't get in to see a rheumatologist for blood tests like rheumatoid factor until mid-August (I'm outside the US currently & only specialists here can run those tests). What else could we check for in the meantime that would cause no symptoms and these blood results? I have no RA symptoms and I can't get my knee surgery until the problem is figured out..

    "content": "I am a 19 year old female, who in the past year (at college) was constantly sick, had strep, flu, multiple colds, and from late December to January experienced extreme fatigue, reduced appetite, and a sustained fever (relatively low 99.5-101 at the highest).  Doctor thought it was either mono or pneumonia, however mono tests came back negative, and chest x ray was relatively good.  I eventually got better but still got sick very frequently (at least 3 times a quarter).    Over the summer I went in for a physical and mentioned how for some time now (at least 5 months) I felt as if I was constantly sick after eating.  I had apparently lost 14lbs without trying since late December when I was in for what they thought might have been pneumonia.  The doctor noticed my spleen was significantly enlarged, (and painful when pressed) as were the lymph nodes in my armpits.  She explained that my problems eating were most likely caused by my spleen pressing on my stomach, not allowing me to eat as much as I normally would.  She ordered some blood tests: EBV, CBC, and one for Celiac disease (it was a long shot).  She had figured that I had gotten mono awhile back and had not noticed.  EBV and the Celiac tests came back negative and the CBC was normal.    I am a runner and in good health, and would like to know what might have caused the enlarged spleen.  I understand when the spleen is enlarged it has a higher chance of rupturing, furthermore I dislike constantly feeling sick after eating and as this has been going on for some time, I would love to hear if there might be some other underlying illness that might cause my symptoms to persist for such a long time, so that I might treat it and rid myself of the side effects.\n\n",

They said I had no fever but had a severe transfusion reaction.  I received Benadryl and Solu-Medrol and a bag of fluid after that.  They had stopped the blood when I came to and said my blood pressure had dropped to 70/40 and my pulse had dropped.  My family doctor was called and diagnosed it as a vasovagal reaction.  Can a severe blood transfusion reaction be called a vasovagal reaction?  They said there was no hemolyzation of the blood.  What exactly happened?  How often does this happen?  They gave me another unit with the premedication and filter, and it seemed to work okay that time.  What do I need to understand about what happened?\n\n",

While there, I had an initian blood draw which showed my Total Protein to be elevated (8.3 with an upper limit of 8.2). This was the only abnormal result on the blood test.  Albumin was reported as within range at 4.1, but globulin was not reported.  Can I assume that my globulin level was 4.2 and high also?  Are there other proteins other than albumin and globulin that are included in the total protein count?  The doctors in the ER did not mention anything about this abnormal level to me, I only found out after I asked for a printout of all my results which I read once I was at home.  I did have a second blood draw while I was there, not sure why.  Would they have told me if they were retesting my blood?  The guy that drew my blood kept the tourniquet (latex glove) wrapped around my arm for so long that it left it numb, could this have affected the total proteins?  Thanks for any help.

    "content": "Hi Mindy,  Your total protein level is actually still within the range of normal.  Labs have to set an upper range for their tests and a certain percentage of people will be outside these limits (usually about 5% since they often choose the 95% range for normals as their  upper and lower limits).  Things that cause an elevated total protein typically have much higher levels of total protein.  Speaking solely based off your lab value I would not be concerned about this level.  There are other proteins in the blood besides globulin and albumin that get measured so it is not necessarily accurate to subtract albumin from total protein to get globulin levels.    Your doctor will be able to review your entire case and give you more info.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "What are implications of Low Neutrophils /High IgM?",
    "content": "hi everyone: I have had some confusing lab results, and I'm hoping you can help me understand them. My doctor was checking to see if I had Anti Phospohlid Syndrome. I'm healthy, non-smoker, don't drink any alcohol, 18.6 BMI, very fit, 46 year old female. Only other DX of importance could be Long QT, but I don't know if that's relevant.   The result is listed first, with the lab reference range in parentheses.  Neutrophils (absolute count): 1.4 (2.1-6.5) Eosinophils 6 (0-4%) Lymphocytes 41 (13-46%) Monos 10 (4-12%) Neutrophils % 43 (41-81)  WBC (K/ul) 3.3 (3.5-12.5) Hematocrit, Hgb, MCV, Platelets, RDW, RBC all normal  Cardiolipin IgM >100 (1-9 Mpl)  (was 41 in 08; no gammopathy back then. I don't know about now yet) INR PT 11.2 (9.1-11.2 sec) Beta 2 Glycoprotein ser/plas U/ml IGA <10 IGG <20 IGM 14  CRP, homocysteine, and cardiolipin IGG all normal. Cryoglobulins negative Lupus Anticoagulant, ANA all negative (although I had an ANA of 1:640 speckled in 2004--negative since then).   a) Is there any relationship between the IgM and the low neutrophils?  b) My doctor wants to test again in 3 months. If you were my doctor, what would be the lab tests you would run at that time? Would you test for beta 2 microglobulins?  c) What are the implications of having high cardiolipins alone (that is, if the other tests listed above are essentially normal)?  d) If a doctor asks me if I have a clotting problem, and I've had no clinical signs of a clotting problem, based on the results listed above, do I say yes or no or kind of?   Thanks for your help.  AJ\n\n",

    "content": "OK, brief history...psoriatic arthritis for 22 yrs; Enbrel treatment for past 6 yrs.  PA \"in remission\", no active PA.  Legally rx'd opiate (Opana, Oxycontin) from 2004 until 1/2009, tapered off to judge extent of pain.  Went to new rheumatologist 2/09; I felt that previous MD wasn't doing as much for me as he could.  New MD ordered full battery of tests; normals/negatives were Lyme, Sed Rate, TSH, uric acid, urinalysis, beta-2glycoprotein I antibody igg, igm, iga, anticardiolip ab, iga/igg/igm, ANA, CCP igg antibodies, g-6-pd rbc, hepatitis, hla typing b27, lupus anticoagulant, RA factor, Sjogren's ab anti-ss-a/-ss-b.    CBC showed WBC count at 15.4, RDW at 14.8, neutro-segs of 78.1, and lymphocytes of 13.1.  TPMT (thiopurine) was 8.3 u/ml RBC.  All other categories WNL.  This test was performed on 2/26/09.  Next test on 5/8/09 (pre-op testing) showed WBC at 13.9, RBC low at 4.68, and RDW at 14.8.  All others WNL.  Finally, test on 5/26/09 had WBC at 12.8, RBC low at 4.45, hemoglobin at 13.1, and hematocrit at 40.1.  All others WNL.  I was scheduled for foot surgery on 5/28, but the surgeon has postponed this procedure due to the elevated WBC, as it's indicative of an infection.  Now, in my researching around, I have 3 factors that will likely increase WBC:  Smoking, allergies, and rheumatoid arthritis (inflammation).  I stopped my weekly Enbrel shot 3 weeks ago in preparation for this surgery, as Enbrel is an immuno-suppressive.  My concerns are many:  Shouldn't the rheumatologist, on my first follow-up in March, advised me of the high WBC?  The normal range listed is 3.2 to 9.6; I would think that something greater than 50% over normal would be cause for some concern!  As someone taking a TNF-A inhibitor, the FDA put out an alert on 9/4/08 regarding a higher risk of fungal infections (histoplasmosis, etc.) for patients taking TNF-A drugs.  However, I was never advised of this, and in reading about histoplasmosis, it's rather asymptomatic, yet readily treatable.  Shouldn't the high WBC, combined with this alert, raised some red flags?  Lastly, what exactly does the low thiopurine (TPMT) indicate?  Many thanks in advance!\n\n",

I had a CBC done in June of 2006 and my RBC, Hemoglobin, and Hematocrit were elevated (5.91, 17.90, and 52.80%, respectively).  My doctor had me come back in to re-test in April of 2007 and my levels had come down from the previous test but were still above the normal range for the lab my work was done at (5.76, 17.70, and 50.70%, respectively).  I got another test done in May of 2007 and my results had lowered into the normal range (RBC - 5.51, Hemoglobin - 16.80, Hematocrit - 48.50%).  I decided to get another CBC done in July 2008 just to see where things were at and the results were RBC - 5.61, Hemoglobin - 16.90, and Hematocrit - 51.00% (slightly above normal).    I have read on various websites that a normal hematocrit range for an adult male can range from 41-53%.  Would you consider my labs fairly normal or would you suggest getting further testing?  I am concerned I may be at risk of polycythemia vera.    Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

The fact that you've had swollen lymph nodes for over a year and the just slightly-off blood work could mean there is some obscure process going on that your doctor isn't able to identify and it is worrisome that the lymph nodes would remain swollen for this long, especially without any really major flags in the blood work. A hematologist is the most likely specialist to figure out what, if anything, is going on.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the past 12 months I have had numberous blood tests which my doctors have said are fine.  However, after this last test I asked for copy of the report and was annoyed to find that there were several abnormalities flagged on the test that he did not relay to me.  ANA was normal.  Though it has been positive in the past.  Low titire.  For 3 years I have suffered from various odd symptoms, chest discomfort, cough, phlegm, tight throat, tmj, breathlessness,  but am feeling much better now with almost no symptoms apart from what feels like a bladder irritation.   I have trace protien and blood in urine which comes and goes and which doctor is not concerned about.   My test results were:  WBC was low at 4.63 MCHC was low at 32.1 Lymphocytes were low at 1.08 Eosinophils were low at 0.6  Nothing too bad but just outside normal range.  However  My anion gap was very low at 5 Carbon Dioxide was very high at 31 Calcium was high at 10.4 Heamatocrit was high at 47 and Hb was relatively high at 15.1  In an effort to alkalize my body I have been living on a mainly fruit and veg diet and have been taking lots of supplements and Coral Calcium.  (which made me feel much better and which I have now cut back on due to high blood calcium) Do you think this could have had any effect on the blood test.  I am feeling well apart from this bladder irritation, I am not short of energy and sleep about 7 hours a night.  One of my sons has chronic granulomatous disorder, another is diabetic, and my mother had arthritis.  In mid life she also had many strange symptoms which she had numerous tests for and which apart from her arthritis and thyroid problems came back normal.  She lived to be 81.  I am 58.  Please help I am worried to death.  I have also just had a pap smear which was boarderline - Atypia, I have discomfort in loins especially when I need to urinate.  No actual pain.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Anion Gap Low, Calcium High, Crit high, WBC - confused",
    "content": "Hello, Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are:  White blood cells: 4,500-10,000 /mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   Although your lymphocyte count is relatively low, it is still within the normal range in relation to your total count. The most common cause of lymphopenia is recent infection like common cold. All types of infections can result in lymphopenia like bacterial and fungal infections.   You have mentioned that you been suffering from recurrent upper respiratory tract infection, it could be of viral infection which makes your results not alarming. As your doctor advised follow up test would be satisfactory.  As for the dysuria, it could be due to excess calcium salt excreted in urine especially if there is concentrated urine. More fluid intake would be helpful, otherwise urine analysis is essential.  Normal calcium values are in the range of 8.5-10.2 mg/dL, so you are in the high normal level.  The anion gap is calculated using this formula = ([Na+]+[K+] ) - ( [Cl-]+[HCO3-] )  The average anion gap for healthy adults using this formula is 8-12 mEq/L.  Modern analyzers use a new classification system in which a normal anion gap is between 3-11 mEq/L. Anion gap measurement is subjected to errors like improper processing of the blood sample (delay) may result in mild reduction in the anion gap.  One of the most common causes of a low anion gap is a low albumin level. Another cause is the presence of abnormal positively charged proteins that bind to cations in the blood, as in multiple myeloma.  Normal Pco2 is in the range of 35-45. Although your results show mild decrease in Pco2 level it can be seen in non pathological conditions like Hyperventilation  Hypoxia in high altitude Anxiety  You mentioned that your main complaints were chest and urinary troubles, so these blood results should be taken into consideration although the changes as you can see are mild.  For exclusion of serious causes like multiple myeloma, a 24 hours urine analysis would be a good initial test to confirm the presence of proteinuria, a liver function tests including serum albumin to exclude hypoalbuminia, as well as repetition of al the previous tests (CBC, KFT, Ca, Blood gases). Radiologic testing like CXR and abdominal US may be helpful to rule out chest infection and to check the kidneys  respectively. Further investigations would be requested based on the new results.   Regarding the Pap smear results, most physicians consider follow up testing and treatment of any underlying infection in women with mild cellular changes.  Only by complete history and physical examination a proper management can be done. So, I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns. Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks very much for your valued answer to my question.    The issue with increased urination now seems to have resolved itself and the bladder irritation has disappeared.  Also, a week ago I had a repeat pap test which was normal.  At that time my urine was tested and was free of either protien or blood.  (which was a great relief).   I am still suffering from the cough with phlegm and chest discomfort, but it comes and goes and seems worst when I am tired.   My life involves extensive travel (40 flights so far this year) and my symptoms are always worse after an international flight.  I have had these chest and tight throat symptoms for the past 4 year or so, surely if it was multiply myeloma I would have known well before now.   I also often feel strange pulses in places I have never felt them before, in my side, back and more recently my left  knee.   An EKG showed abnormal repolorisation, pulse 55 and low voltage but again the doctor didn't seem concerned.  My blood pressure is now fine 110/70 or so, but that too has over the past couple of years been as high as 160/100 - it's been normal for about 6 months.  Don't know what has been going on, or is going on but it's pretty confusing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, These results suggest a normal kidney and liver function tests. They also show an ESR level that does not indicate underlying inflammatory conditions.  These are not specific tests for myeloma, however, if your urinary problems and the urine proteins are no more present, urinary tract infection or stones are more likely to be the cause of the urinary symptoms rather than a myeloma.   In addition patients with multiple myeloma usually have some abnormalities in their blood tests (e.g. CBC, Ca, uric acid, B2M, total proteins and Albumin).  For these recurrent upper respiratory tract infections that seem to be of a mild form, it is possible that you are allergic and travelling many times a year with exposure to different allergens as well as the stress it carries may make you more susceptible.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor; he would repeat your blood and/or urine tests to make sure no persistent changes are there that mandate further investigations.

I exercise 4-5x p/week, slender body - 6'2\" tall, 182lbs.  Symptoms: For 2 years, I've developed severe acid reflex. So bad that it's damaging my esophagus. Last year, I had a polyp removed from my voice box due to the reflex. I sleep elevated & eat high akaline diet to prevent this but no luck.  Around the same time (2yrs ago), I developed red blotchy marks on both sides of my neck which derm's diagnosed as POIKILODERMA \"sun damage\". I don't believe this is sun damage as it happened suddenly & at the same time as my reflex. All articles on POIKILODERMA suggest mostly women get this in their 50's-60's.

I have Hashimoto's Thyroiditis and was diagnosed in February with Lupus. I am not sure that I agree with the Lupus dianosis right now. Other tests have not been done to rule out other issues that can be misdiagnosed as Lupus (I have been reading a lot on the subject). Could Lupus explain these blood results and are there other things that could cause these results? Thanks so much for your time!!!  Kary\n\n",

    "content": "I would like some advice on recent test results. I am having other medical issues, and I am wondering if I have some type of cancer that has not been caught yet. I just want to make sure to get the best advice I can get.  Medical Info is as follows: 05/14/09 12:48 CBCWBC: 5.3    Hemoglobin Blood: 11.4*    PCV BLOOD: 35*    PLATELET COUNT: 268    Red Blood Cells: 3.76*    MCV: 92    MCH: 30.3    Mean Corpuscle Hemoglobin Concentration: 33.0    Red Blood Cells Width Distribution: 13.6     05/14/09 12:48 RoutChemsIron Blood: 54    Total Iron Binding Capacity: 384    Percent Saturation: 14    Ferritin Blood: 5*     Here is the bloodwork on the Vitamin D: It was very low. 08/21/08 09:46 NutritionVITAMIN A (RETINOL): 0.76    RetPal: 0.00    VITAMIN B-12: 436    VITAMIN D 25-OH: 14*      Other health issues---Vitamin D deficient, Diagnosed with Excessive Daytime Sleepiness, Demylenation on Brain (Have been tested with spinal and Evoked Potentials but I can't get a definitive diagnosis of MS).  Lung nodule discovered in 06/2007. It was 4 mm in size. Recent scan 05/2009. It has increased to 8mm. Also, diagnosed in 2006 with a heart murmur (never diagnosed before). It showed Mitral Valve Prolapse  Symptoms includes---extreme fatigue, achy joints, skin lesion that will not heal on forhead, cognitive issues--fog in my head, memory, concentration, etc., depression  I am sending along the MRI and the Chest Scan in case you would want to see these as well. This started in 2007 and has progressed and gotten worse.  12/12/2008 - Brain Mri W/wo Contrast    Exam performed on 2008/12/12 16:04 (Report received on 2008/12/13 20:39)  MRI OF THE BRAIN WITH AND WITHOUT CONTRAST - 12/12/2008   INDICATION: Alteration of consciousness.   COMPARISON: CT head August 2008.   TECHNIQUE: Multiplanar multisequence MR imaging is performed from the skull base to vertex before and after IV administration of 10 mL of Magnevist.   FINDINGS: The ventricles and basilar cisterns are within normal limits. Diffusion-weighted imaging is negative. There are approximately five white matter T2 hyperintense foci, approximately three of which are periventricular. There is a thin T2 hyperintensity along the callosal septal margin. No other parenchymal abnormality is identified. There is no abnormal intracranial enhancement. There is a small pineal cyst. There is no evidence of intracranial hemorrhage.   IMPRESSION: Few nonspecific white matter T2 hyperintensities, as described above. Hyperintensity along the callosal septal margin is suggestive of demyelination, however, this does not meet imaging criteria for multiple sclerosis.   05/06/2009 - Ct Chest Without Contrast     Exam performed on 2009/05/06 16:52 (Report received on 2009/05/07 14:41)  CT CHEST, 05/06/09, 16:49  HISTORY:   Disease of the lung per code, in reviewing Star panel the patient has history of an outside study that showed a nodule and this is for followup. That study, though, is not available for comparison.\ufffd A chest x-ray from 02/04/09 is reviewed. The nodule is not visualized on that chest x-ray nor on the thoracic spine from 10/03/08.  TECHNIQUE:   Supine inspiration helical multidetector acquisition without intravenous contrast enhancement was obtained in full inspiration and reconstructed at 1.8 mm increments using 2 mm thick sections and standard algorithm.   FINDINGS:   There are postsurgical changes in the epigastrium consistent with a history of gastric bypass is noted.\ufffd There is a non-obstructing less than 4 mm calculus in the left kidney.\ufffd The upper abdomen otherwise appears unremarkable.\ufffd The pericardium and cardiac chambers appear normal on these noncontrast enhanced views.\ufffd No coronary calcification is seen. The main pulmonary artery segment and aorta are of normal caliber.\ufffd No pathologically enlarged mediastinal nodes are identified.  The parenchymal images show a nodule in the region of the junction of the anterior and lateral basilar segments of the left lower lobe seen best on image 67, series 2, measuring about 10.1 X 7.2 mm.\ufffd This does not definitely contain central calcification.\ufffd The lung parenchyma is otherwise unremarkable.  IMPRESSION:   1.\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd\ufffd Postoperative changes in the epigastrium.

    "title": "Re: High WBC +low BUN + hight ALT+high RDW +low MPV",
    "content": "Hello --  While  there are some levels that are just very slightly elevated, there's nothing here that would indicate anything of immediate concern. In fact, your BUN is at the bottom  end of the normal range (within normal limits -- WNL) and your ALT is perfectly normal. The two others which are high are just barely so. Your MPV is just below normal limits, but that is far preferable to high, so that's okay as well. Also, parts of what you've included is CBC results and part is metabolic panel results. Still, if these were the only ones found to be \"abnormal\" all looks pretty good. The only thing I would suggest is that this all be repeated just to see if the results are consistent or close enough to normal (as are these) to warrant no further study. While it's great to have absolutely WNL, usually being close and just outside is not remarkable. Your off ones are just barely off. This could be laboratory error. The fact that ALT is completely normal is puzzling, unless the lab that was used has a different standard, which is sometimes the case. However, that number is normal for most lab standards.  All in all an unremarkable finding with some slightly off numbers. Probably should be repeated for accuracy, but no cause for concern at the moment.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "polycythemia vera, spleen & side pain",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with Polycythemia Vera in 2004 after routine blood work revealed that all cell lines were elevated, after bone marrow biopsy, and EPO showed low result of 2.5.  I have also had JAK2 test, which came back negative, but my hem says that JAK2 is not always an indicator of polycythemia vera.  I have been taking Hydroxyurea for about 4.5 years.  My problem is not the polycythemia.  I am living with that.  My problem is that since 2004, and dx of hepatosplenomegaly, I have had excruciating left side pain.  All CT scans have come back negative for any clots or infarctions.  Since taking HU, my spleen & liver size has been reduced, but the pain continues.  I've had CT's, ultrasounds, etc, but all tests come back with no abnormal results.    My pain levels vary, in that I can go along for a couple of months with a side ache, and then all of a sudden, the pain changes, and becomes unbearable for a couple of weeks.  It never completely goes away.  I have blood work done every 3 months, sometimes more often if the pain is bad, but the results at this time are within normal ranges, thanks to the HU.    The pain is under my left rib cage, sometimes extends to midline in my abdomen, and also causes the 9th, 10th & 11th ribs on that side to hurt.    I also have osteoporosis (-3.3 at last dexa), and I am wondering if this may have some effect on my pain & what is happening with the side pain.  No one seems to have any answers.  On my last visit to the doctor a week ago, it was suggested that I have an exploratory procedure to actually take a look at what is happening in there since the pain I am experiencing is debilitating at times and effects my life in such a negative way.  I have a job that I sit all day at a computer for, and when I get home at night the pain is much worse after stretching out and I cannot lay on that side.  I would describe the pain as dull aching when it's at its 'best' and stabbing, pinching, burning at it's 'worst'.  Sometimes the pain area is the size of a football or bigger, radiating from the back side of my ribs to midline abdomin.    I've also had all my regular tests done, colonoscopy, yearly exams, etc.  All normal.  Is it possible for a spleen to 'go bad', and if it did, would it show up on any tests?   Any ideas that you might have on what could be causing this pain would be helpful, and I would present them to my physician (oncologist/hematologist).  I think the worst part of all this is having no answers.   At this time, both sides ache, but the left side is the worst.  Also, I was DX with polycythemia and had spleen/side pain prior to weight loss surgery, which was done mainly to help give my organs/spleen/liver more room within the abdomen.  For a while in the beginning, I did experience some relief, but it has not remained that way, and my weight has remained normal for the last 4 years.

    "content": "Just a follow up from my previous post.  Since that post, I have had a CT w/contrast, and MRI without, and both tests come out 'normal'.  I'm truly am about to go crazy with this pain problem.  The doctor prescribed Norco, Morphine & Valium for pain.  This morning I woke up with a fever of 103.1, and even after tylenol to reduce the fever, it was still 101.8, and my left side pain is about a 7.  Any ideas of how to proceed?  Any questions I should be asking?  Are there any tests left to do that could give us a clue?  I've been thinking about talking with the Dr about another bone marrow biopsy to see if things have changed in 5 years.    Thank you for your time. Gin\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Pharmacyboy, Shaking hands with someone carries a very small risk of transfer of infections such as the common cold and other generally minor illness-related viruses.  If you then put your hands in your mouth, it is possible you could catch that virus. This is not the way viruses such as AIDS and Hepatitis B or C are spread.  These are contracted through deep body fluid exchange such as blood to blood or through sexual interaction.  Leukemia is definitely not spread person to person at all.  If he were actually infected with a serious virus such as those and you had some kind of blood to blood transfer through shaking hands with this man as with a \"blood brother\" pact where blood crosses or you were in a health care setting and you were treating a seriously wounded hand but you were unprotected and had a small cut or open wound (a scab is not an open wound and mosquito bites are not a mode for entry), then there could be a small risk of infection.   Try not to worry about results of lab tests such as this, especially any that are near the reference range value.  These tests are tools to help the doctor determine the cause for illness and to alert him/her to some underlying problem but they are only part of the picture.  There are typically other symptoms to go along with the abnormal values that usually indicate disease.  If there was an alarming value your doctor would have discussed it with you.  They do not keep their patients in the dark about it.    If you find yourself obsessing about this, you could have another problem that might need attention.  There are disorders that cause you to obsess about things to the point that these obsessions interfere with your daily activities, keeping you away from normal situations and interactions.  I would discuss this concern with your doctor or mental health professional.  An evaluation could uncover a problem that could be treated quite easily thereby avoiding it becoming a bigger issue for you in the future.  I would recommend this type of psych evaluation.  If it is not a problem for you, great; but if it is, you could avoid much unnecessary concern.  We should be as concerned with mental health checkups as we are with physical exams.  Best wishes\n\n",

On the results it says that the platelet count is high at 443, the MPV is low at 6.3. the SEGS are low at 29.0, and the lymphocytes are high at 61.0. She complains of stomach pain daily, and random foot pain as well. Do you have any idea what this could be? Also she finished a round of amoxicillin about a week ago due to an upper respiratory infection. Also, the doctor said she is having more tests done to rule out things, but that she wasn't overly concerned.\n\n",

    "title": "Very low ferritin, failure to respond to supplements, B-12",
    "content": "Can you tell me which direction to go?  I have six daughters - the first four have had low ferritin, the first starting 8 years ago.  I have always been suspicion of malabsorpion, always looking for answers.  One daughter was as low as 16 ferritin.  They also have low Vit. D (20, 21, 23).  Finally I had my ferritin tested, and it was 6.  I developed terrible symptoms - fog, lack of concentration, memory problems, spinning room, my brain felt like it was starving - and the others such as incredible fatigue, always cold, peeling fingernails, lack of energy to do anything but the absolutely necessary.    After paying a fortune for an MRI, I found information on the web about B-12 and Pernicious Anemia.  My B-12 was in the 300's.  I asked the dr. for B-12 shots.  I was skeptical that I would feel a difference very soon.  I noticed small improvements in the first couple of days.  After two months on the shots, I can function again and even smile.  I don't feel perfect, but I'm much better.  I have also been taking iron - 65mg two or three times a day.  I finally got an appt. with a hematologist.  I was so disappointed.  She treated me like I was stupid.  She said my blood cells were shaped correctly, so I couldn't have PA.  She said low ferritin does not have symptoms, and that my B-12 wasn't low enough to cause me any troubles.  I am so frustrated!!  I have watched my girls for years suffer from symptoms with their low ferritin.  The symptoms improve when the ferritin goes up.  And, I KNOW I did not make up the symptoms I was having.  I could hardly function.  With the B-12 shots and iron supplements, my symptoms have gradually lessened over the past two months.    The doctors have told me I needed anxiety medication, or that it's my hormones.  This is crazy!  My big concern is to prevent my daughters from getting so terribly ill as I have been.  I was hoping someone would help me connect my condition with my girls'.  The adult doctors will not give advice on children, and the pediatrician is out of ideas.  I have spent so much money on dr. visits and tests.  Can you give me any help?  New note:  the hematologist' test results were that with 2-1/2 months of iron supplements (65mg/325 x 2-3's per day), my ferritin had dropped.  It went from 6 to 16, and then to 14.  I'm finally getting iron IV's for four weeks.  This is great, but it's only a bandaid.  I am also so terribly tired again.  Michelle Tew\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Michelle,  First, you need the assistance of a good hematologist. Second, you haven't seen one yet -- but you know that. It seems likely there is a familial anemia, very probably PA, and there is no definitive test for this, certainly not \"your red cells are correctly shaped\"! There is a lot of blood work that needs to be done, as well as the rule out of atrophic gastritis, which is commonly associated with PA. This  is discovered (or not) via gastroscopy.   Your symptoms are all consistent with some sort of anemia, and you responded to supplements, though not dramatically. If you are found to be positive for PA, your daughters will need to be evaluated (and perhaps should be anyway) and followed. If any of you have this problem it's likey the rest do as well. Treatment is highly individualized B-12 injection, IM, and each patient is different in his or her needs in this regard, but the thing can be managed with proper followup and supplements.  First find yourself a hematologist who is interested in solving your  problem. After that it should all start to get a lot better.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

MCH high at 34.2. Iron all normal at total 142, saturation at 46, binding at 308. However Ferritin is way up at 1690. I've read high Ferritin can kill off RBC's, which I'm thing is why that count is down. So my questions are, what does it mean to have a normal iron count but way high Ferritin and low RBC's? What can be done to raise RBC and lower Ferritin? I do consume alcohol and should also mention the reason for these tests were from a toxic reaction to medication prescribed in Mexico for food poisoning. I went into convulsions and had to be hospitalized overnight to flush out the medication. Could this also be a reaction from that experience?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While most of your blood work was close enough to be ok, the ferritin was high, but this was in the setting of recovery from a toxic response to medication for an illness, and since ferritin levels react wildly to systemic upsets and illness, this should be rechecked before any serious concerns become raised. It may have already corrected itself.   If, after rechecking, this is still way off, your alcohol intake needs to be looked at more closely, and beyond that certain disease processes would need to be ruled out, such as hemachromocytosis and thalassemia as well as certain types of anemia. However, with everything else pretty much in  line, I'd put my money on reaction to a transient illness. Follow up study is entirely appropriate.  Hope this helps. Follow up with us as needed, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I hope this is the correct forum for this.  In October 2007 I developed a DVT in my after I slightly bumped my leg on a chair.  There was some bruising but the impact wasn't that hard.  At that time, blood tests were done and they all came back negative.  I was treated with \"blood thinners\" for three months.  About a month ago, I went on a 5 hour plane trip and developed another DVT in the same calf.  I initially saw a physicians assistant who consulted a hemotologist.  This time, the plan was to do an ultrasound once a week instead of the Coumadin.  He also felt that further testing was unnecessary because there was a clear cause for the DVT.  After 4 ultrasounds (the last one 10 days ago), the clot seemed to be stable and resolving.  After the pain increased in the calf, I went back for an additonal ultrasound that found a clot in another vein.  I am now taking Lovenox and warfarin.  I am 44 years old and very athletic.  I am afraid I will have damage to my leg.  I spoke briefly with my PCP on the phone and she suggested I see vascular surgeon.  I don't understand why she would suggest this.  Wouldn't a hematologist be a better option?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recurring DVT Without Clear Cause",
    "content": "Hi Bernoulli, I can understand why your PCP feels there is a clear cause for this DVT. Prolonged sitting causes the blood to pool in the lower legs and leads to the subsequent development of a DVT. Lovenox and warfarin are used in conjuction but only until warfarin levels are therapeutic which are monitored by labwork. There are risk factors that predispose people to DVT's such as heart and vascular disorders, smoking, obesity, sitting for extended periods, injury, surgery, malignancy, etc. An evaluation by both a cardiovascular specialist and hematologist is recommended. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I noticed a lump in my throat about eight months ago.  In July 2008 I noticed it was getting larger so I went and had it checked out.  I had a scan done and the report came back that I have a 3.4cm x 2.2cm mass in the right lobe of the thyroid with a mild enhancement.  My dad and an aunt have had thyroid cancer.  My sister use to work for an oncology Doctor and said that sometimes your blood work can show signs you have cancer.  It is now 11/12/08 and I have swollen lymphnoids at each side of my neck (as if I had tonsilitis), swelling under my chin, and what feels like two more lumps on each side of my esophogus above the mass on my thyroid.  I feel like I have been choked my neck is really sore.  And my lymphnoids are even painful.  I had mono when I was 15 and my neck wasn't this sore and my lymphnoids weren't this swollen.  Back in July my blood work was:  WBC 3.4 (L) RBC 3.9 (L) MCH 34.9 (H) GLUCOSE 147 (H) Fasting CREATININE .6 (L) ALT/SGPT 78 (H) TSH .01 (L)  I don't have health insurance so I haven't been able to get any more tests done.  I am just worried due to my family history.  I have a hyperactive thyroid and I am really tired.  I don't ever have any energy.  Please help if you can.  Should I be concerned about cancer?  Do my blood levels say anything?  How would I get help without health insurance.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be very helpful if you inform us about the rest of your thyroid function tests. Thyroid-stimulating hormone TSH Normal range is 0.4\u20134.5mIU/L The TSH level is very low and your scan results are of hyperthyroidism. You mentioned that you have been told so, but I do not see any information about the treatment you have received to solve this problem and the results of your last thyroid function tests.  Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are: White blood cells: 4,500-10,000 /mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   Your total leukocyte count is low (leukopenia) but the differential count (neutrophils, lymphocytes, etc) is important to understand what might be a cause.  Although it is lower than normal, a single reading is not enough to suspect malignancy as many benign conditions like viral infections can cause low while cell count. So repeating the CBC is important.  More relative to you is the fact that mild leukopenia may occur in many patients with hyperthyroidism, as well as it is a known side effect of antithyroid medications.  Having lymph node enlargement following infection in the areas drained by this group of lymph nodes occurs to all of us. They usually remain palpable after recovery although decline in size. These nonspecific nodes are usually less than 1 cm, mobile and soft to firm.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper evaluation. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear all,  I am a 30 year old male and in November 2005 I was admitted to hospital as I had blurred vision, my pupils were irregular and I had a severe headache and was being sick.  After blood tests it was discovered that my haemoglobin was 19.2 and CT and MRI scans confirmed a venous sinus thrombosis.  The clot damaged one of my cranial nerves which has left me with peripheral double vision although this is not severe.  Over the past three years I have had numerous tests to try to uncover why my haemoglobin is raised, including:  - Red Cell Mass (My test showed I was 110% but I was told it had to be 125% to be classified as polycythaemia vera)  - Thrombophilia (all tests for clotting disorders were negative)  - Iron levels normal  - JAK2 mutation normal  - Oxygen binding afinity borderline  - Ultrasound normal  - Ocular myasthenia gravis test normal  I was initially on heparin in hospital, followed by warfarin for 9 months and I am now on Plavix (clopidogrel) daily.  I ensure that I am hydrated, have a relatively healthy diet, do not drink to excess and do not take drugs.  I am a smoker however I have reduced my smoking significantly and changes in my smoking habits have not impacted on my Hb over the last 3 years.  I see a haematologist every 6 months and my Hb has continued to be between 18 and 19.  My ongoing symptoms include daily headaches, general tiredness, dizziness and a feeling like I am moving or falling when I am standing still, blurred vision, intermittent low blood pressure which has caused fainting, itching after a hot bath, redness in the face which seems to be getting worse down the sides of my nose, general muscle pain (particularly in my neck, shoulders, jaw and legs), restless legs at night or when on a long plane journey.  I have also more recently started to get pain and a feeling of tightness when I get an erection.  My most recent blood tests also showed elevated white cells so I had a bone marrow test.  I saw my haematologist today who said that my bone marrow was 'overactive' but he still felt I did not have polycythaemia vera.  He is now seeing if phlebotomy will help and I am scheduled for this next week and in 3 weeks time, with a follow up haem appointment after this.  I'd be incredibly grateful to get any thoughts on the above as it is very frustrating (I think for my haematologist also) to continue to have tests that are not completely 'normal' but not be given a definitive diagnosis.  Obviously I am very pleased that I do not seem to have anything sinister at the moment but I am also aware that these things can progress and in the meantime my symtoms do cause problems in my daily life.  So any opinions or ideas for further tests/avenues I could discuss with my haematologist would be very much appreciated.  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While your hemoglobin was not quite up to the old \"gold standard\" for polycythemia vera, the diagnostic challenge for this disease is changing, and simple reliance on hemoglobin levels is no longer considered the definitive standard. The standard is still somewhat vague, but when hematological findings (such as your elevated hemoglobin) is correlated with a certain factor (JAK2V617F mutation), especially when characteristic symptoms are present (as with you) and everything else has been ruled out, then the diagnosis can be made with relative certainty. Since your doctor has decided to treat you based upon protocols for PV, one must assume, in the absence of the JAK2V617F mutation (for which you should be tested at once), we can reasonably assume you do have PV, which, if treated appropriately, is compatable with a normal life and lifespan.   I would bring  this to the attention of your doctors as soon as possible, in order to establish the diagnosis within reason, especially since the therapy is being instituted anyway. It would be good to be relatively certain (although I think we already are) that you do, in fact, have PV. A concrete diagnosis would be of great help in future.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr Kenyon,  Thanks very much for your reply, I really appreciate it.  I have been tested for the JAK2 mutation and my test results were normal so my haematologist is convinced that I do not have PV, which is obviously good news. What I'm not clear about though is whether you can have PV in the absence of a JAK2 mutation?  After venesection twice over a two week period, my symptoms did not improve and I felt quite washed out so he has stopped this as a course of treatment.  He feels that there are no other tests he can do so he has now discharged me back to my GP and I will no longer be seeing a haematologist.  My haematologist suggested that perhaps I am purely one of those people who have haemoglobin levels at the top of the range. Which I can accept, but it doesn't explain my continuing symptoms or the reason that I had a sudden venous sinus thrombosis in the first place.  Also, all my tests seems to have been borderline - like the red cell mass, oxygen binding affinity and the activity of my bone marrow.  Obviously now I'm not under a haematologist or having regular tests it makes me slightly anxious in case they have missed anything or any of my 'borderline' results progress.  My GP will now only be taking my bloods every 6 months.  I suppose all I can do really is monitor my symptoms and if I feel like anything is getting worse, try to get an appointment as soon as possible.  Thanks again for your advice!  I'm obviously just a medical mystery :0)  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "You can have PV without the JAK2 mutation being evident, so being followed every six months is probably the appropriate approach right now, barring any worsening or emergence of new symtpoms. If that should happen you definitely need to be re-evaluated. While you may be someone who just tends to have hemoglobin levels at the top of the normal range (and that's why there is a \"range\"), I feel there must be something causing the symptoms, and hopefully it will become more clear over time. Monitoring your symptoms  will be an important  part of the process.   You may be a medical mystery now,  but before long I feel certain the mystery will be solved.

    "content": "Hello --  While to my certain knowlege there is no cause-and-effect relationship between G6PD deficiency and various types of anemia, anemia can cause additional problems for people who have G6PD deficiency. While your hemoglobin is a little on the low side, and you do have a history of anemia (or so it seems), if you're having no symptoms due to the anemia (such as jaundice, fatigue, etc.), then doing whatever is required to treat the anemia should prevent complications due to the G6PD deficiency, which is extremely common.   I wish I could give you a better answer to this -- such as what the underlying cause of your anemia might be -- but there isn't sufficient information to hazard a guess on that, and so long as it doesn't provoke any sort of anemic crisis with symptoms as outlined above, then you're doing pretty well, really.  I hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

After being treated with antibiotics the feeling of unwellness went away for about 1 month then returned with a greater severity. In the past year I have had several infections to include a bad tooth abscess that I had for the past 8 years and 3 bloody sinus infections and gastritis that I get almost annually and none of thes infections were treated appropriately if at all. I have gained 10 pounds that I cannot get rid of reguardless of excersise and diet. Approximately 4-5 months ago, I was awakened out of my sleep feeling bad, weak and with pretty bad heart palpitations. After my ER visit I was told that I was in good health and nothing abnormal was to be reported. I was sent home just as sick as before my visit. I requested my tests to see what the report contained and found that my hematology test concluded: Neu% 36.7 out of 40.0-80.0 and Mono% 10.3 out of 2.0-10.0. I am floored that this was not looked into further and to this day am still suffering from the same symptoms and have had no luck in getting assistance or futher testing by any doctor other than 3 CBC and 1 thyroid test that came back normal.

    "title": "Re: High Monocytes and low Neutrophils",
    "content": "Hi there --  While there's little doubt something is wrong that would have to account for your lowered immunity and frequent illnesses, the bloodwork you had done was so close to the normal range that I'm really not surprised it wasn't followed up, even though in a private practice it probably would have been. Those numbers are right along the lower and upper ranges of normal, respectively, and  wouldn't likely account for your problems over the past year, so this is why you weren't worked up more thoroughly via the ER. Even if these findings were sent to your regular doctor, they would not, in themselves, have been likely to raise any red flags.  Further lab work is certainly in order, but of a more exotic nature. I think an ANA titer, complete metabolic panel (CMP), monospot and second CBC, at least, should be done, along with a very thorough history and physical (H&P). You may have something viral that's worked as a drag on your immune system while causing some symptoms of its own (Epstein-Barr virus/mono come to mind, along with a number of others). Hopefully you can persuade your GP to do this. If not,  then it's time for either a second opinion or a change of GP.   I hope this is helpful. While I don't think you have anything extremely serious to be concerned about, the chronic, seemingly random illnesses certainly have to have been exhausting emotionally as well as physically,  and I'm pretty sure there's a medical path toward managing this and correcting what's wrong , but it will require lab work and an interested physician. Often, unfortunately, with this sort of thing, one complaint arises at a time and seems inconsequential, so the  patient is just listed as \"sick\" and sent on her way. This is very unfortunate and I do hope you're  able to find someone willing to work with you on finding any underlying cause and setting up a plan of care so you can begin to feel like yourself again.  I hope this is at least helpful to you. Best of luck with this and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Elevated WBC and Platelet Counts",
    "content": "Hello --  Your doctor would be remiss to not explore possible causes of elevated WBC, and one reason is that it could indicate leukemia, but not necessarily. Sometimes thrombocytosis can co-exist with, or be combined with an overall  overproduction of blood cells, white ones included (myeloproliferative diseases). This family of diseases generally have a pretty good prognosis, with a few exeptions. In other words, it's not especially surprising or unusual to find elevated white counts with this sort of problem, and it doesn't necessarily mean there's anything serious going on.   Some additional blood tests may help clarify the issue. If not, sometimes a bone marrow biopsy is necessary to determine just what's happening. If there are not symptoms this probably won't be rushed, however.   I hope this helps answer your concerns.  I'm sure your hematologist will be following this appropriately, and you may  by now have had additonal tests done. Hopefully it's nothing remarkable, which is often the case.  Good luck to you.  Please update us if you learn anything new.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low Platelets - Bone Marrow Biopsy Test",
    "content": "Hello --  While there are no other really definitive tests that would tell more than a bone marrow biopsy, which is the logical next testing step for your aunt's situation, but if she is symptom-free and doesn't want to go through what is sometimes a painful and invasive test, then it's a matter of weighing risks and choosing quality of life against bothersome tests and possibly therapy that could wind up making her feel worse, at least in the short term. If  she's feeling well otherwise, she may have a blood or marrow disorder that could potentially shorten her life, but she may enjoy her life more, so long as she remains without symptoms. The only problem with that approach  is that if there is disease (which seems likely), then it will just progress. It's a difficult choice, especially in her age group, but it is her choice.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

The hematologist ran tests and found that certain values were above the normal range, but he was not concerned there was a real problem. He suggests having our family doctor run the tests again in a year to monitor things.   These are the results flagged as above or below normal ranges.

    "content": "Hello --  Your son's blood work as reported here seems essentially fine. Some of the values are actually within normal limits (WNL) while others would be normal for a full-grown man, and if your son is growing (which he undoubtedly is) then this could account for any slight upward skewing. The values are close enough to any lab standard to barely raise an eyebrow, although now that they've been tagged as not-quite-right they should be followed up for consistency's sake and to establish a \"normal\" baseline for your son. However, I don't feel these findings constitute any clear and present concern, so I hope this will help ease any concerns you may be harboring. Of course that's easier said than done when we're talking about one's own child, so the follow up is highly recommended. If things remain the same or are seen as totally WNL then I think you can completely relax about this. As it stands, I really don't see any cause for concern.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck  to you and to your son. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for the reply.  I have two sources of inflammation that I know about (but rest assured my doctors will be checking for others). One is the recently discovered \"mild\" hepatitis. The other is the dystonia in my neck and shoulders, which causes a lot of soreness and headaches and which I've had for 14 years. Could the latter really produce enough inflammation to elevate my ferritin? Even over time? If I understand you correctly, you're saying that the former is the more likely candidate anyway, right?   I've read about \"The Anemia Of Chronic Disease,\" which is caused by inflammation, but was under the impression that it usually features low TIBC rather than high or normal. Also, I thought that all forms of anemia involved abnormal hemoglobin (where mine is normal). Did you have in mind a disorder other than AoCD or am I just misunderstanding the criteria?   Does the elevated TIBC/low saturation suggest that some parts of my body are not getting enough iron? If the ferritin returns to normal, would you expect the saturation to go up and the TIBC to come down?   (I hope that's not too many questions. And please don't hesitate to tell me I'm wrong about something; that's what I'm here for. Thanks again for the help.)  -Clay\n\n",

    "title": "Slowly Rising RDW and LDH",
    "content": "Hello.  Over the last 3 years, my blood work has slowly been changing.  Initially, in April of 2006 my RDW was 12.7, which is within normal range.  In July of 2007, my LDH was 190 and my RDW was 14.8 - slightly elevated.  My iron in July of 2007 was 131, normal.  In December of 2007, my RDW went to 15.1 and my B12 was 250.  I was told to take B-12 supplements.   Finally in July of 2008, my LDH was 251 - very high above normal, my iron was 32 way below normal and my RDW was 15.6 even more elevated.  My hemoglobin, hematocrit, MCV, MCH, MCHC and platelets are all okay on all.  My MPV was 10.2 in July of 2008 --- right at the cut off for high.  I have had increasingly heavy menstrual cycles and need to have surgery because of the bleeding.  I feel like this is probably the cause of the iron issue, but what about the RDW and LDH?  Doesn't this signify something wrong with my blood or blood production?  I've read a little on the net, but I'm not sure what exactly it means.  Could you guide me in a direction I should go to have this checked?  Let me know what your take on the readings are, please.  I would very much appreciate it.  I feel fatigued every day and have lots of joint pain, thinning skin, hair falls out some, and tachycardia issues for over 9 years.  My TSH has slowly went down from .85 in 4/06 to now .60 in 7/08.  Not sure what's going on.   Thank you for your help!  Chris\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Slowly Rising RDW and LDH",
    "content": "Hi Chris --  The progressive increase in RDW and LDH are suggestive of some sort of organic anemia, most likely hemolytic anemia, which has several forms and a lot of possible underlying causes. While the RDW and LDH could indicate this or something similar, the findings also could be due to the heavy menstrual periods -- or vice versa.   The drop-off in TSH also suggests you may have an autoimmune disease which could be causing both the lowered TSH and some autoimmune cause for the anemia and even the abnormal menstruation.   You may need to have a consult with a rheumatologist and/or endocrinologist to sort this out, but this is typical of autoimmune problems (if that is the case). They can be infuriatingly difficult to diagnose and pin down to a specific area of concern, often moving from one to another system or involving one then more.   I wish I could give you a more concrete answer, but there's more detective work to be done by your doctor (or doctors). At this point it seems fairly certain you at least have some form of anemia, even if it is \"only\" due to heavy periods. The rest, however, still needs to be clarified, diagnosed and managed.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Aarzu --  While three of your parameters were very slightly above normal, this doesn't necessarily mean anything. First, it's so close to right it's splitting hairs (and of course we have to draw the line somewhere). This  should, of course, be repeated in perhaps a month,  but if it's no different or if it's back  to within normal limits (WNL) then it truly was nothing. If any of these were to rise significantly then it would warrant further study. As of now, though, there's really nothing to be concerned about, and just have the test repeated in about a month to compare. Chances are it will still be either normal or so close to it as to be meaningless.  Hope this is helpful. Best off luck to you.\n\n",

I suffer from aches and pains all over and cannot brush my hair without my arm getting weaker and weaker. I have got more and more short of breath over time and inhalers make not much difference to this. I have or had every symptoms of hypothyroidism left even though on treatment so I started myself on Armour thyroid which improves things quite a bit, however I still had problems raising the Armour to a decent dose to eliminate my symptoms. A saliva test confirmed me as low cortisol and I now take hydrocortisone every day too. My breathing is slightly better the more hydrocortisone I take, and the aches and pains and flulike feelings are a lot better. However I am far from well.  I have a GP who is running on a low budget and tests and time with him are very small so I have never really been effectively investigated.  I went to see him last week and told him I had now developed vitiligo and showed it to him, he confirmed I had, he also was unaware of my autoimmune state with the thyroid even though it was tested 18 months ago and came back positive. He ran these tests below, the results I find worrying and don't know what to ask of him from now on as he doesn't seem to know where to look for my underlying condition. My high WBC cound has been getting higher over 4 years and each time they say I must be fighting a cold or something, but this cannot be so for all that time. Each time I have it taken there is no sign of a virus. I expect high CRP with hypothyroidism but not all the other things which are high alongside it which makes it more worrying. Do I need iron pills? How are the MCV and RBC relevent? Do the test mean I have low blood volume and all the pains and shortness of breath are associated with the plasma viscosity? What about  the creatinine which has been high on tests for a long time?  It seems the doctor just says everything is ok and every time I have a test something else turns up as my health gets worse and nobody seems to have a clue as to where to look or what to do? Could you please explain what my tests indicate and help me find some kind of questions to ask the docotor? I thank you in advance and here are my test results....

    "content": "Hi Whitters -  I didn't have too much trouble finding your post. The problem will be sorting out the results here and correlating them with your symptoms. I definitely believe the slightly elevated red and white count correlates with the slightly high plasma viscosity, and overall probably would correspond with volume depletion due to mild dehydration. Why that would be is difficult to say. Perhaps you simply don't take in sufficient fluids?  As for the symptoms, these do match up well with low cortisol levels, but you need to have a stimulation (\"stim\") test to come up with a true and workable level in order to know if there  is a problem  and what it might be and how to treat it. Both the increased (but unregulated) thyroxin and hydrocortisone self-treatment are suggestive, at least, that there's something there that needs a closer look.   If there is any way you can either get more service from your doctor or find one who is willing to do more thorough investigation, it would be a huge help. I think you've got enough insight into the problems to recognize the connections between these issues, but you'll need far more precise test results and dosing in order to get this all in order.  The increased CRP is probably indicative of a low level of systemic inflammation which may be reasonable for someone with autoimmune problems. It probably correlates well with Hashimoto's and perhaps some other inflammatory problems.   While  I think you're probably on the right track here, and while the symptoms are no doubt unacceptable, at least you're working toward something of a resolution.  Unfortunately you require expert and thorough medical help to get this  all diagnosed and managed properly. You've done about as much as anyone can without a more thorough medical partner. Your blood work is  generally fine, but the parts you cite do suggest the things you've already mentioned, and your self-medication, while not something we'd normally encourage, do seem to bear out, at least on the face of it, your suspicions. Now you need to have this confirmed properly and treated precisely.   I would also look at the possibility of something causing mild to moderate dehydration, as that is the likely cause of the plasma viscosity and relative (though minor) \"off\" readings on RBCs, WBCs, etc. The CRP can probably be  brought down some by anti-inflammatory medication, but I wouldn't try and make that a do-it-yourself project, as it is potentially risky to go that route. Hopefully you can either get more out of your doctor or find another doctor who is willing to do more of what's needed.   I certainly hope this is hellpful to you. Best of luck and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John  Thankyou so much, you have no idea how much I appreciate your help. I think you are absolutely right about the need for a doctor who is more hands on and not just sitting back while I try my hardest to get well without hardly any input or help from him. I am between a rock and a hard place as I cannot travel far, live in a very small town in Northern England with just one Drs practice (quite a few Drs in it) in the whole town. I worry if I upset this Dr the others will wash their hands of me. I will try moving to another Dr in the practice to see if that helps at all though. I think he thinks I am just a hypochondriac you know...wibble lol. He said I needed to see a private Dr for some reason, if a private Dr could help, why can he not?  The dehydration, I have no idea how that could be, I drink lots of fluids throughout the day but on some of the thyroid forums like TPA-UK and STTM  yahoo  groups the other suffers seem to associate hypothyroidism with dehydration and also CFS of course is closely associated with low blood volume too. I see a connection with the CFS and the endocrine system more than is publicised I think. I shall conciously try and drink water throughout the day in an organised way to make sure I am getting the fluids for sure. My urine is very concentrated this week for some reason too and I don't think I have an infection, so that would suggest what you say also with regard to the dehydration is correct too.   Lots of the symptoms went when I started Armour, more went when I started HC. but I am left chiefly with cramps in ribs around back and under breast, with weak muscles and inability to support my upper body for long enough to walk around a while. Hypermobile joints. The most troublesome symptoms is puffing and panting shortness of breath on even the slightest exertion even with clear chest and open airways, wierd.  The only thing I am doing in connection with inflammation is taking Serrapeptase as it is prescribed in Europe for this purpose but is not a pharmaceutical which of course I wouldn't try to put into my treatment for fear of interractions. Any more strong drugs would possibly kill me off. I am wondering if any of the ones I am on from the Drs are causing any problems like the Seroxat(Paxil), Diazepam, Olmasarten.  Anyway I hope if you are anyone else has any more thoughts or help you will post again.  Lovely to meet you here John Good health to you. God bless Whittersx\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome, and lovely meeting you here as well. I only wish I were able to offer you something more substantial by way of direction. What you've come up with makes sense as far as it goes. The comment by your doctor that a private doctor might be better suited is certainly strange. It may well be another doctor in the local practice might be a better \"fit\" for you. It's  probably worth a trial at least.  The concentrated urine certainly does argue in favor of dehydration. The reason isn't clear, but your plan to purposefully take in more fluids should at least help with this.   The muscle cramping and weakness suggest a neuromuscular problem, whether secondary to one of the other disorders which may be present or in some primary form. Again, it's difficult to tell from this distance. Hopefully a different doctor may see something the current one hasn't.   Please stay in  touch with us here and keep us updated. Good luck and  good health  to you.\n\n",

    "content": "HIya Just to let you know, my doctor rang in response to my call and he loves the results of my blood tests. He thinks the HPV is going to together with the CRP inflammation and the RBC are higher because I smoke. I mentioned my urine and he is going to do a urine test. Ah well, at least it is slight investigation. I am sure that I need deeper investigations though as you said John. He never mentioned investigating causes of dehydration as he doesn't think that is the cause. I had to laugh at the wonder in his voice that my Armour  Thyroid was actually doing the job lol. Bless. He told me to come off the  HC or I would get horrible things like osteoporosis. He said my cortisol was within range when tested, however I pointed out it was 'lower end' of normal at bloods, bottomed out in my saliva tests and that I was resting my adrenals and didn't intend to be on the stuff forever. He didn't suggest any further testing for the adrenals due to the low normal blood test I had last year.  I think I shall definately have to change docs. You could shuffle in dripping pus and if your blood tests were even slightly near normal the doc would say you are ok. Symptoms don't seem to make a difference nowadays.  God bless Dawnx\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be more helpful if you can provide us more information about the complete blood picture results, reticlucytic count, iron, folic acid, VitB12, TIBC (if nay was done) and the results of the investigations done to find out the cause of this anaemia.  The best way to treat conditions like yours is treating the cause rather than the symptoms. So, if the cause is the hematuria then I would like to know what kind of treatment you have received for this condition and whether your doctor have suggested other treatment lines or he is suspecting other causes and is investigating them  Regarding the poor tolerability you have shown to iron intake whether oral or IV, unfortunately this is not uncommon problem. Your doctor is in position to better evaluate the reactions and the side effect from each route and chose the best for you. For example, nondextran irons given IV have reduced risk for anaphylaxis so he can think of it of was not used or reconsider the oral route. In all cases your doctor will reevaluate the whole situation and consider the more convenient therapy for your specific condition.  So, I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I usually go to sleep between 10:30-12:00, depending on how my day went and whether or night my anxiety is low enough. As my panic rises, I get very little sleep at night.

I know that have ovarian cysts on both ovaries that have been there for years, new uterine fibroids, lipase elevation that questions a problem with my pancreas, and HPV with cervical displasia that has not been tested in a while and could possibly be cancerous. I don't think it's cancerous, but we'll see.   After that I will be going to see a new hematologist to find out which level of VW I have and what treatments it will require.   Although I'm not happy to find out that I have this disease, I am very happy to have been diagnosed with the autoimmune disease that has plagued me my whole life. After 100's of doctor appts, tests, scans, pokes, and prods since I was appx 6 years old, this is such a huge milestone!  Happy New Year!  ~Joy\n\n",

    "title": "Von Willebrand's Disease - Possible Platelet Dysfunction?",
    "content": "Hi.  I am a 39 year old female and I have a history of hemorrhaging.  I have hemorrhaged 3 times in the last 8 years.  Once was after a DNC (miscarriage), once was during a C-Section and the last time the bleeding started a few hours after a minor fatty deposit was removed from my back (I narrowly avoided a blood transfusion during the last two episodes).  My primary doctor referred me to a hematologist who informed me that my Von Willebrand Factor was low (53% and 54% respectively) though the Factor VIII Activity and vWF Activity were normal.  I was informed that I had a mild, acquired Von Willebrand factor deficiency and was given a prescription for a nasal spray in case I ever had another problem (apparently the tests showed that this is not a genetic form of Von Willebrands).   However, during the first set of labs, it also came back that my Collagen/ADP was high (H110) and my Collagen Epinephrine was also high (H165), possibly indicating a platelet dysfunction.  My hematologist asked me to refrain from taking any Advil or antihistamines for the next week and then reran the tests.  The Collagen Epinephrine went down 9 points to 156.  However, since this was within the normal range (82-159), the lab did not rerun the collagen ADP.  I was informed that everything was normal and that I don't have a platelet dysfunction.  My concern is that the Collagen Epinephrine is still at the very high end of normal and that I might have a platelet dysfunction that could be aggravating the Von Willebrands disease.  If this is the case, I am worried that the prescription I was given might not be sufficient to prevent another episode of hemorrhaging.  The last episode of bleeding was very scary (for myself and, I also believe, for the surgeon) and I'm finding it hard to believe that this is a \"mild\" case of Von Willebrands disease.  I'm wondering if I should consider getting a second opinion from another hematologist.  Any advice that could be given would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Thanks for the really well-researched and complete post. You're obviously conversant in the area of platelet dysfunction and I think you're right to want a more complete study done, for the reasons you've outlined here. It  seems the diagnsis was based on something less than complete evidence, and while  the chances are good this is an acquired problem, \"a good chance\" isn't good enough; not for you, clearly, and not for a conscientious clinician. It certainly doesn't satisfy me or I'd tell you so.   I would definitely seek a second opinion on this one. While the first doctor may well wind up being correct, there's not enough  evidence to support that based on the evidence alone. When a problem is potentially serious there's no room for guesswork. I would by all means  seek a consult.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck  to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 32 weeks pregnant and was diagnosed with ME a few months ago. The inflammatory blood tests (CRP?PV?ESR) taken then were elevated but I was advised that this could be down to the pregnancy.  Now I've had a recent blood test taken by my midwife that my doctor has not yet seen. The results are slightly abnormal & I am not sure whether to be concerned.  Firstly it seems to show that I am borderline anaemic with HB at 11.5g/dL. Rbc, Hct, MCV, MCH all within range but MCHC slightly under range at 31.2 g/dL.  It also shows an elevated WBC at 11.95 10*9/L. Lymp, Mono, Eosi, Baso all within range but Neut slightly over range at 8.83 10*9/L  I have been suffering extreme fatigue and vertigo/balance issues for a while and even before my pregnancy but blood results have always been within the ranges. Although I did have one result with low TSH but normal free T4 it corrected itself by the next test results.  I have not been taking any medications.  Any abnormal results seem to be put down to my being pregnant and I am sure that is the case but I don't think I'll be able to really relax until this baby is born so that any tests can't be skewed by it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Anemia is very common in pregnancy as you make 1/3 more blood when pregnant and this blood is a little lacking in hemoglobin.  This could account for your symptoms and it would be a good idea for your to take a supplement on your doctor's advice.  Thyroid hormones also fluctuate in a person's lifetime and you might be having some symptoms relating to this as well.    Vertigo in pregnancy can be fairly common but you should talk to your doctor about it anyway.  Try not to worry too much about labs. Fluctuation in small degrees is common and if you had regular blood testing even when not pregnant you would note such as well.  Sometimes labs can alarm people unnecessarily because we erroneously think they should be constant.  If there are concerns for your pregnancy, your doctor would explain these.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 38 year old male with a high ferratin and high hemoglobin count. I get regular phlebotomies at least once a month and been undergoing this treatment for about a year now.  I was first diagnosed with high blood pressure and then under a long process to track down the reason for this It was determined I had Hemochromatosis heterozygous. I went under a pretty aggressive phlebotomy process to get my ferratin level below 50.  I recently moved to a new state and started to see a new hematologist. This hematologist determined I had a high hemoglobin count and that I may not have had Hemochromatosis but instead Polycythemia.  I have had several blood tests, colonoscopy, ultra sounds on my liver and kidneys, eye exams, and echocardiogram. I am scheduled for a sleep study to determine if this is a respiratory problem. All the tests results have come back normal thus far. I have been told I have Polycythemia Secondary, but no diagnosis as to what is causing it.  Is it possible I was originally diagnosed correctly with Hemochromatosis and this deasease can be causing an increase in Red Blood Cells as well? Should I request to see a new hematologist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  I've done some research based on your post, and have been able to find only conflicting information, but most of it has argued against a connection between Polycythemia and HH. There is at least one case on record that I was able to find, so it's clearly not impossible, but apparently this is extremely unusual. On the other extreme there are several studies which flatly state there is \"no connection\" between the two conditions. Based on my admittedly limited understanding of hemotology, it seems not unreasonable that polycythemia could occur secondary to HH, but apparently it doesn't happen very often.   Since this is well outside the scope of my training and knowlege,  I will refer this to our site's hematology team in hopes someone can come up with a  better answer for you. Meanwhile, good luck to you with this, and please follow up as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "You're welcome.   While I'm unaware (and I've been looking through the literature) of any aspect of HH that would cause any significant increase in red cell production, I've found one case of a young man who actually has both conditions simultaneously and, according to his doctors, utterly independent of one another. While this is apparently extremely rare, it's the only thing that comes to mind, assuming the red cell increase is significant and consistent. The by far greatest balance of studies all argue there is no \"secondary\" develpment of polycythemia via HH because there is no connection between the two. At least that's what's believed today. Then again, your current hematologist seems to believe it's possible, and he has to have based that notion (absent an actual diagnosis) on something he believes to be sound.   It is certainly conceivable that a mild increase in red cells, transiently, could be caused by something incidental and not pathogenic. If the count is markedly raised, however, over a period of time, something else must be going on.  I guess we'll see in time. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed last November with a severe B12 deficiency.  I have been on B12 shots ever since.  I feel \"much\" better as opposed to the years leading up to my diagnosis.  I was so sick every day that I literally thought I was dying.  I had major digestive problems, heart palpitations, difficulty breathing at times, heart burn, nausea, severe headaches, ringing in the ears, hair loss, leg pains, joint pains, beginnings of vision troubles, lethargy, severe anxiety and mood swings, twitches, seizures where I'd smell things that weren't there and unable to focus on my surroundings for minutes on end, sleepiness during the day, overactive bladder and nocturia, bleeding gums, loss of appetite and the list goes on.  I finally switched doctors and got some answers.  My question now is.. \"Why am I deficient?\"  My doctor says it's way too \"complicated\" to answer that, but I don't believe him.  I want to see a haematologish, is the correct specialist to request and do I have that right to do so?  I think I may be anemic or have pernicious anaemia.  Although a great majority of my symptoms have subsided I still have some that remain.  I know that because my B12 deficiency went a long time without being diagnosed that some symptoms may be irreversible, but does that also go for bleeding gums?  My dentist has ruled out any problems with my teeth and gums.  It is something else that is going on.  They bleed way too easily.  I also still have tingling in my feet and hands at times.  One times a few years ago after being given yet another blood test, I was called back to the doctors immediately because either my red or white blood cells were very low or high, I can't remember.  But after another blood test, they dismissed the first results.  I think it was a sign of something, but they never followed up on it.  Does anyone have any insight on anything I've listed?  Any information or thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am glad that you feel better. Your doctor is right in that there are many factors that can contribute to B12 deficiency. The absorption of B12 is amongst the most complex in comparison to other vitamins. It involves the secretion of a molecule called intrinsic factor which then combines with B12 ingested in the diet, it then travels to the terminal ileum where the combination is absorbed. Any excess is stored in the liver.   Any problem in any of the above processes could lead to B12 deficiency. One test used to distinguish the cause is called Schilling's test and is a complicated test that involves ingestion of a radioactive form of B12 and then measurement of B12 levels in urine before and after intrinsic factor.  The thing is while mild forms of B12 deficiency can be troublesome they are easily treated and rarely if at all leave permanent disabilities.   Subacute combined degeneration is the a neurological syndrome associated with severe long term B12 deficiency and involves degeneration in the central as well as the peripheral nerves. This a severe syndrome that can be associated with severe manifestations such as muscle paralysis.  Why do you feel you have anemia? If your blood tests are normal then you don't have anemia. Anemia is a lab diagnosis based on your hemoglobin level and your hematocrit level.  As long as you continue to improve then you shouldn't be worried. If you stop improving or something new arises you should contact your doctor. Of course feel free to consult a hematologist although your doctor may not feel there is a need for a referral if all your tests are normal.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was warned that there is a risk of complications if I get pregnant again and am trying to figure out exactly what those risks are to me and the baby before I schedule a tubal ligation. My first pregnancy was totally normal. (My husband and I are o+ blood types) My second pregnancy showed an -e antibody. Regular blood work was done and the numbers never rose above 1:1. My sons biliruben levels jumped very fast after he was born and he was under bili-lights for five days. I was told the antibody issue becomes a larger problem with each pregnancy and there is a good chance I may have a miscarriage if pregnant. If I did make it to 9 months, there may be more severe complications with the baby. He suggested we not have any more children. This is fine, but I am a person who needs more details before making my decision. I do not need anything sugar coated but want to educate myself as much as possible. What is the worst case scenario? My OB suggested I see a perinatologist, but the nearest one is over 3 hours away. Thank you for your time, lovedRN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are: 4,500-10,000 white blood cells/mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60% Lymphocytes: 20% to 40% Monocytes: 2% to 8% Eosinophils: 1% to 4% Basophils: 0.5% to 1% Band: 0% to 3%  Elevated Total leukocytic count can occur in different condition like infections (bacterial, viral or fungal), systemic disease (e.g.inflamtory bowel diseases and vasculitis), physical stress, cancer especially hematologic malignancies.  Specific increase in one blood element is more indicative of certain medical conditions, e.g neutrophilia (like in your case) in most infections and tissue damage like inflammatory and metabolic diseases. Smoking is well documented to increase the white cell count especially neutrophils.  Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000. An elevated ESR, LDH or CRP would be helpful and would make inflammatory changes more likely although not conclusive.  Transient elevation of the white blood cells is not warning but should be properly approached. Serial CBC follow up is essential. On the other hand, persistent elevation in the white blood cell count should be investigated properly to exclude both chronic systemic inflammatory conditions and malignancy.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This may be also be a cause of your CBC results. One of the causes of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto's Thryoiditis, it is an autoimmune condition that results in inflammatory changes in the thyroid. This end results in hypothyroidism after initial elevation of the level of thyroid hormones. The normal level of adult FT4 is in the range of 0.8-1.5 ng/dl.  If you develop a chronic thyroiditis state there might be also an increase in the white blood count since they are the cells that defend our bodies against any inflammation or infection or any foreign body.  Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) antibody is used to detect antibodies against the thyroid gland in Hashimoto's Thryoiditis. Most people with chronic thyroiditis (70%-90%) are positive for TPOAB test.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to recheck your thyroid function tests. Your doctor may consider an endocrinologist consultation if the thyroid function tests are not in the normal range.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: prothromben gene mutation?",
    "content": "Hello, The prothrombin gene mutation is a genetically acquired trait. It is relatively uncommon condition that is more common in the Caucasian population.   It can be seen in about 2% of the general population, 6% in patients with history of DVT and 18% in patients with positive family history. The gene is located in one of our chromosomes which is chromosome number 11   Simply, chromosomes carry two gene copies for each specific protein that has specific function in our body. When this gene has an error in one or the two copies, it codes for an abnormal protein with abnormal function ( may be as lost, increased or new function).  The coagulation factor prothrombin (factor II) converts into thrombin, a key enzyme in the coagulation process and haemostasis.  When its gene is mutated, an increased prothrombin levels would result and a higher risk of venous thrombosis would occur. This would put you at an increased risk for devolving DVT (mild) and at a greater risk if other factors are there.  If DVT occurs anticoagulation therapy is given and evaluation of the risk of recurrence would make the physician decides the benefit from chronic anticoagulation (long-term anticoagulation). At this time, there are no data supporting the long term use of anticoagulants in patients with the prothrombin gene mutation. But these patients are always kept under strict precautions to avoid DVT when they at risk like going for surgical operations or being bed ridden for a time.  Whether you will transfer this to your child or not, the answer is yes, there is a possibility. But since it it is usually a heterozygous type mutation which means one copy of the gene is normal and the other is mutated, the possibility is about 50%. So if your child will inherit the normal copy, there will be no problem at all and vise versa. This is also based on assuming that his father has normal gene copies. This can be confirmed by geneting testing.  Hope you find this useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Having a history of DVT is a risk factor for another DVT. Feeling lump and pain at the same arm where DVT was diagnosed makes exclusion of another DVT is essential.  It could be also a fibrosis in the vein after thrombosis has occurred.  Direct clinical examination is essential and Doppler US may be needed to confirm the diagnosis.  Having said this, it is also important to identify the underlying cause (exact defect) that makes you at high risk for DVT especially that you have also a positive family history. This may change your physician approach in the management.  I would advise you to follow up with your Doctor soon and to discuss with him all your concerns. Please keep us updated.

    "title": "Re: Raised WCC and lymphocytosis",
    "content": "Hello,  The clinical picture you described would make me think of an allergic condition or hypersensitivity as a poosible cause. A wide variety of allergens can cause increase in the number of lymphocytes as well as the appearance of skin rash or follicles. These include medications, exposure to certain organisms, dust etc. The mechanism underlying asthma itself involves lymphocytes and monocytes and their presence at a high level. Your history and your family history of asthma are supportive for this possibility.   The medications your on right now have been reported to cause skin rash, dermatitis, and urticaria although less common and mostly occur early in the course of therap.  So, you may be allergic to different types of allergens and not completely controlled with these medications, that may explain the blood results in a way.  Absolute lymphocytosis is defined by an absolute lymphocyte number is greater than 4000/mcl.   Common causes of lymphocytosis include viral (e.g. influenza) and bacterial infections.  That is why your doctor wanted to exclude viral causes by the tests he recommended since it is a common cause for lymphocytosis.  How about your blood level of CRP, ESR, LDH? It would be helpful if you can inform us about them.  However, serious causes like chronic lymphocytic leukemia should be excluded especially in very high lymphocytic counts (less likely as your blood smear was not suggestive). Blood smear (blood film seen under microscope) is very helpful in the diagnosis. If leukemia is suspected bone marrow examination should be done.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by thorough history and physical examination the proper diagnosis can be reached. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Vaccination against pneumococcal organisms and H influenzae type b are essential in postsplenectomy patients.  A conjugated-C meningococcus & Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccinations is given for those who did not receive this vaccine earlier.  The Pneumococcal vaccine is repeated every six years, while each year (winter) influenza vaccine is given.   Splenectomy results in marked improvement in symptoms of patients with spherocytosis and is curative in most of the cases. However, in the uncommon autonomic recessive variant of HS mild form of haemolysis may occur that results in mild elevation in billirubin.   Post cholecystectomy complications and exclusion of bile duct obstruction should be done to exclude obstructive jaundice. US of the abdomen may be an initial helpful test.  Your observation that increase in the yellowish coloration of the sclera occurs after constipation needs to be confirmed by lab tests and it could be just a coincidence.  You may notice increase in the bilirubin level by deepening of the yellowish discoloration, the presence of dark urine or changes in the colour of the stool based on the type of jaundice.  It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the exact bilirubin level in the last tests and its two main forms (direct, indirect). CBC and blood smear would be of help to exclude haemolysis. Yellowish discoloration of skin and sclera usually occurs when bilirubin is 2 or more. Liver enzymes and hepatitis markers may be needed.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concerns. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My doctor has been working with me for a year now to figure out what my stomach problem is. Still I keep getting a diagnosis as unknown cause of abdominal pain. My gall bladder was removed a year ago because they found a small stone and assumed this was the cause of my pain. When this failed to solve the problem I had an upper GI which showed a hiatus hernia. When the pain still persisted I went for a lower GI and this showed that I was completely healthy. Still unknown cause of abdominal pain. Initially, 5 weeks before this pain I woke up to an extremely painful swollen lymph node under my left arm. I had a mammogram and ultrasound performed to see if it was breast cancer. They did not see breast cancer only a small cyst in that left breast, and unknown reason for lymph node swelling. It eventually went down, but my health started to decline.  Symptom list and Blood results as follows:  Upper right abdominal pain, worse with movement, sitting, walking Heart Palpatations most recently ( especially when trying to sleep) Leg cramps Abdominal smasms Fatigue Weakness Occasional Nausea Shortness of breath Chest pain for days at a time No Fever No diarhea Occasional constipation  Blood work was all in normal ranges except for these three:  Alt is 4L normal range is 7-35 U/L WBC is 11.3  normal range is 3.4-10.6 K/mcL Lymphocyte is 4.6 normal is 1.0-3.7 K/mcL  I have been diagnosed with IBS, but I don't fit. The pain is not relieved by BM, and I don't have diarhea at all. I don't know if this matters but they also found a nodule on my thyroid and a cyste on the left kidney. Also Lymphocytes have shown elevated in previous blood work over the last year. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Absolute lymphocytosis is defined by an absolute lymphocyte number greater than 4000/mcl. Causes include inflammatory conditions (like chronic gastritis) and infections (like viral and bacterial infections).  Your absolute neutrophil count is mildly elevated, in this case exclusion of viral and bacterial infections should be done based on thorough clinical history and clinical examination.  An underlying inflammatory condition may be the reason. Gastritis and esiophagitis are known sequels for hiatus hernia and can give symptoms similar to yours as well as lymphocytosis (especially if associated Helicobacter pylori HP gastritis is present). The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux). Acid reflux causes severe pain and discomfort in the upper abdomen. You may also feel like throat or tightness in the throat, dry cough, maldigestion, palpitation and chest pain.   Other causes to be excluded are conditions known as postcholecystectomy syndrome (PCS) in which patients with symptoms after cholecystectomy similar to cholecystitis or gall bladder disease.   Causes include:  -Residual or reformed gallbladder  -Sphincter of Oddi (a bile duct sphincter at the dudenum) abnormalities. - Second possibility is duodenogastric reflux, is a cholecystectomy sequel due to functional bowel disorders. ERCP is the test of choice.  If all causes are excluded then IBS is to be considered.  So proper evaluation of the degree and the severity of the Hiatus hernia as well as all other possibilities like HP gastritis are mandatory.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor; he is in better position to determine what the most likely cause is. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your response, it is appreciated. I had a test done for the H-pylori, it is negative. I stopped taking the nexium I was on because I realized that I had been taking it for only a couple of months before all of this abdominal pain. I went to my doctors office to verify when I started taking the nexium and it was July 25th, 2007. I remembered that initially when I would take it, within 15 minutes my stomach would have spasms and an increase in heartburn. That settled down some after a couple of weeks. The next thing that happened to me was a left underarm lymph node swelled really big and painfullly. I went to the doctor, was still feeling quite well. There was no known cause except that my lymphocytes and wbc was elevated even then. This was Aug. 26th, 2007. I then became extremely tired, thought I had mono. Was tested and negative again. Finally lymph node started to get smaller and I started to feel better, that took about 5 weeks. Now we are almost into october. I had about two weeks until the final thing that led to the excruciating abdominal pain. And like I said here I am still today. I have been off of the nexium for 6 days now and I am really sore in the area's where the pain was so severe, and there are still small spasms but they are not severely painful. I am hoping I was having an allergic reaction and that it is as simple as that. I will have to continue to wait and see. My question is this, can an allergic reaction cause my body to react as it has with the elevation of wbc and lymphocytes. Does this make sense to you? I don't know too much about how allergies can affect the body. I do have seasonal and food allergies as well. Thank you again for your much appreciated response. If the nexium being eliminated does not see me into health again, I will ask for further testing from the GI doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lymphocytosis- low neutrophils - enlarged lymph nodes",
    "content": "Hello, If you have a normal white blood count but low neutrophil, the increased percentage of lymphocytes is not considered true elevation and is named relative lymphocytosis. This is true as long as the absolute lymphocyte number is not greater than 4000/mcl.  So, your absolute lymphocyte count is considered truly high since it exceeded 4000/mcl . Your absolute neutrophil count is within the normal range although the percentage is less than normal. Neutropenia is defined by an absolute neurophilic count less than 1500 cells/mm3.           So, your main problem is absolute lymphocytosis with a total while blood cells count in the high normal.  Common causes of lymphocytosis include viral (e.g. influenza) and bacterial infections. That is why your doctor wanted to exclude viral causes by the tests he recommended since it is a common cause for lymphocytosis. Your CRP is also suggestive of inflammatory condition but this is not specific and is not that high to allow any conclusion. If you have suffered from any recent illness like sore throat, sinusitis, dental or oral infection or inflammation this could be the cause of these results.  In addition enlarged nodes are commonly seen in this part of the body due to inflammations and infections in the oral cavity and nasopharynx. After recovery from infections they regress in size but remain palpable. They are non specific if small <1cm, mobile, soft to firm and are not increasing in size or number.   However, serious causes like chronic lymphocytic leukemia should be excluded especially in very high lymphocytic counts. Blood smear (blood film seen under microspcope) is very helpful in the diagnosis. If leukemia is suspected bone marrow examination should be done.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Only by thorough history and physical examination the proper diagnosis can be reached. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are: White blood cells: 4,500-10,000 /mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   An absolute neutrophil count ANC is a real number of neutrophil count in relation to the total white blood cells (WBCs). The normal range for the ANC is 1.5 to 8.0 (1,500 to 8,000/mm3). Lymphocyte Count (Absolute) range is 1000 - 3500/mm3. An ALC over 4,000 indicates lymphocytosis.  So, your blood count results are not considered alarming or at least at abnormal levels that are indicative of a serious illness, however, exclusion of all serious causes is essential . Some viral infections and allergic conditions may result in clinical picture similar to yours.   Other tests known to be elevated in tissue damage and inflammatory conditions are ESR, LDH  and CRP. Ferritin is also considered an acute-phase reactant that is elevated in the course of a disease usually together with other acute phase reactions (elevated C-reactive protein and ESR).   Normal level of iron is in the range of 60-170 mcg/dl.  Although the level of iron in your blood is mildly elevated, it is not alarming especially if all other parameters are within normal and you are on iron supplements.   Iron is stored in the form of ferritin. Levels of ferritin can be high in cases of: increased iron absorption (genetic disorders), following excess iron intake or blood transfusion, blood hemolysis or damage in certain organs.   Liver, spleen and the bone marrow are the main sites to store ferritin. Thus liver diseases, band lood diseases including leukemia although seems unlikely in your case.  Infections and inflammatory conditions like autoimmune conditions, arthritis, myoskeletal problems or infections are associated also with high ferritin level mostly with normal level of iron.  Hypothyrodism (most likely to be the cause) results also in abnormal blood counts especially if the underlying cause is of inflammatory nature or autoimmune disorders like Hashimoto's thyroiditis. Patient with thyroid hypofunction may complain of fatigue, muscle and joint pain. Arthritis is commonly seen also in patients with autoimmune thyroiditis.  Since your results are not conclusive of any specific illness, serial follow up of your blood count together with a thorough history and clinical examination may be more helpful in determining the possible causes and the needed investigations.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concerns. He might recommend thyroid function tests, liver function tests, to repeat CBC,CRP, ESR after aperiod of time.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Are you saying your blood was listed as A+ or the baby's blood was A+?  This would make a difference.  But, if you were mistyped, the encouraging thing is that if you ever received a blood transfusion there would be extra cautions and testing done (type and crossmatch) to be sure you are safe.  I don't know the reason for the error if it was your blood recorded and not that of your baby here.    Are you certain that you are O+ or was that the erroneous typing?  It would be good to follow up and check your records.  If and when you needed a transfusion in the future, be sure to ask them (or have your next of kin) what type blood they are bringing in to you.   Of course this would only be helpful if you are absolutely certain of your type and the accuracy of that screening.    If you donate blood, you would receive a card indicating your blood type.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low blood levels of vitamin D",
    "content": "Hello,  Precipitation of calcium in the kidney and the formation of renal stones that subsequently cause renal damage is a known complication from excess calcium intake.  The kidney excretes the waste products from our bodies and dissolves them in water. So, the key point is to maintain an adequate amount of water in the urine to avoid crystallizations and stone formation. The most common stones formed in the kidney are calcium oxalates.  In a study of thousands of women on calcium supplements, investigators found that a high intake of dietary calcium reduces the risk of kidney stones but supplemental calcium increases the risk unless it is taken with meals, particularly oxalate containing meals.  When calcium is taken with food, some of it will bind to oxalate in the intestine inhibit its absorption, so less will reach the urine to form a stone. Plus if calcium is taken without food, more calcium absorption occurs and stone formation will be more likely.   Symptoms suggestive of concentrated urine and or high level of solutes in urine are frequency and irritation or pain while urinate (dysuria).  I advise you to follow up with your doctor; he might recommend urine analysis, blood tests for calcium and vitamin D levels. Accordingly, he will determine the proper amount and types of supplements you need.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although your blood count shows a high absolute neutrophil count and a relatively low lymphocytic count, it is still within the normal range. In addition, the count has been fluctuating within the normal range with no alarming symptoms or signs. All these factors are reassuring and as your physician advised to follow up with a CBC and a complete physical examination is an appropriate decision.  Causes of these changes in the blood count are many and include physical and mental stress (stress leukocytosis), infections (commonly viral), allergies, medications, etc.  Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are: White blood cells: 4,500-10,000 /mcl.

The glucose, at 105, is fine. I am troubled at the newly lowered glucose \"normal\" limits, which, if they get much lower, would have us all be hypoglycemic. The HDL is lower than desireable, but not out of normal range. (Desired is 40 to 50). Since your total cholesterol is so very low, and your LDL so low, you should be fine with the lower HDL, which is at least in balance with the total lipds.   Other than the rather low hematocrit I'd be very happy with the results. I hope your doctor is looking at possible causes for the anemia, and I can't help but wonder if this wasn't a typo or lab error, since it is out of line with the other parts of the CBC.   Hope this helps clarify things for you. Follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with John, your results are reassuring apart from the hematocrit percent which as he mentioned could be an error.   I would like also to add some information about anemia. The diagnosis of anemia is primarily made by the finding of low hemoglobin level (in grams per deciliter) and/or RBC number \u00d7 10[12] L. The hematocrit (in percent) is measured together with other parameters to classify types of anemia.   Of these parameters:  - The average blood cell volume (MCV) (82-98); values above and below this range indicate macrocytic and microcytic anemia, respectively.   - The reticulocyte count (N:40,000-100,000 /muL of blood) is very important to determine the need for bone marrow examination; normal or elevated reticulocytic counts indicate adequate bone marrow function and extrinsic cause for the anemia.   - The hematocrit is almost about three times the measured hemoglobin value. The microcytic hypochromic anemia is usually due to deficient hemoglobin synthesis in cases of iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease. While macrocytic anemia is commonly due to B12 and folic acid deficiency.  - A peripheral blood smear should be also examined.  Hope you find this information useful. I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

All types of infections can result in lymphopenia like bacterial and fungal infections. Your total leukocyte count although high is still in the normal range and this is also seen in cases of infections.  Other causes include, severe stress, connective tissue disorders and some medications are also known to cause lymphopenia like steroids.  The rest of the results you have provided seems to be within the normal range and to me are not indicative of any abnormal or serious condition.  You have mentioned that you did the test while suffering from viral infection which makes your results not alarming. As your doctor advised another follow up test after recovery without any need for further investigations is usually satisfactory.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.

    "title": "Re: Severe iron deficiency, lupus",
    "content": "Hello,  Your results are typical for iron deficiency anemia.  This is a condition caused mainly by chronic blood loss without adequate iron supplementation and treatment. These conditions include irregular menstrual bleeding, inadequate iron intake, bleeding from gastrointestinal due to ulcers, colon polyps, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.   You have been on steroid treatment (Medrol) which is known to cause gastritis and gastric ulcers that are known to result in chronic blood loss. In addition, hydroxychloroquine (Plaquenil) is a medication known to cause anemia. Patients with hypothyroidism are also known to have anemia.   So, although chronic blood loss seems to be the most likely cause for this anemia, other causes should also be considered.  Iron infusion is usually indicated in cases of severe anemia (usually Hb below 9gm, or based on symptoms and signs), inadequate absorption (malabsorption) or when a rapid elevation of serum iron and its stores ferritin is needed.  I would advise you to continue your iron supplements and to follow up with your doctor. He might also recommend checking your thyroid function tests and an occult blood in stool test.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This swelling is probably an enlarged Lymph node LN (probably a submandibular LN).  This group of lymph nodes drains the teeth, the gum and the lips.   If infection or inflammation occurs in the area drained by them, they grow in size and become painful. When infection or inflammation subsides they regress in size but never disappear.   So, these nodes remain palpable, painless, rubbery in consistency and usually less than 1 cm in diameter. They may be painful when you frequently press on them causing a sort of inflammation.   A thorough clinical examination and history taking are essential for evaluation and better characterization of this swelling. Since it has been of the same size for years, it is probably of a benign cause and your doctor may just keep it under observation with no further investigations.   However, nodes continue to grow as well as those appear in other parts of the body are of concern and should be properly investigated to exclude serious causes.  Please follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Ultrasound found enlarged liver/spleen 1 week later liver enzymes were back to normal and CAT scan showed liver within normal range, but spleen was 15cm with no mass. Did a CBC again, and blood was all within normal range. Now, 1 month later I had bloodwork done again, and CBC w/differential was normal and blood smear was normal as well.  SED Rate was normal Feel fine, and have had no fever; I have had 1 swollen node on the back of my head behind my ear for 6-7 months now, it is painless and about the size of a pea. I do not think it has grown at all in size. I also have had 2 nodes on each side of the back of my head that I can feel, but are about the size of a pea as well.  I am due to see a hematologist soon, but am wondering what you think is or is not wrong with me based on your past experiences. I am extremely worried, and do not know what to put into have a normal cbc and blood smear. Are these nodes anything to worry about? Thanks a lot, I really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Causes of elevated liver enzyme together with mild hepatosplenomegally are many. Of them recent infections, medications, alcohol, fatty liver, cancer (leukemia) etc. Benign (familial) causes are also known to give similar clinical picture.  It would be more helpful if you can provide us information about the exact level of your enzymes, any history of medications, recent alcohol intake, history of recent infections (fever), transfusions, surgery and any relative family history.   It sounds like a transient cause (like infection, medication, alcohol) is the reason of your conditions since enzymes went back to normal in a short time and the recent liver image excluded any liver abnormalities.  The normal adult spleen size although slightly varies from one person to another, by CT scan it measures approximately 12\u201315 cm in length, 4\u20138 cm in antero-posterior diameter and 3\u20134 cm in thickness.  CBC, LDH and ESR are usually requested while investigating for hepatosplenomegally. It is reassuring that your blood counts, ESR are normal and liver enzymes went back to normal levels in a short period. However, follow up with blood picture and a thorough clinical examination and imaging to exclude serious causes is essential.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him the results of your CT scan to exclude any abnormalities in the spleen.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A known complication from the Duodenal Switch (DS) surgery is malabsorption of certain essential elements like vitamins and minerals. Thus, supplements are commonly prescribed for individuals who underwent this surgery. Folic acid and iron are of these elements that are to be supplemneted after this operation.  Most of the iron in our body is stored in the form of ferritin, a protein bound iron. Since ferritin is in the inside of cells, its level in the blood is small. Ferritin level may be high or low in association with certain diseases.   Ferritin test is usually performed together with the level of iron and other blood elements to confirm the type of anemia when levels are low.   To the contrary, elevated blood levels are seen in cases of: increased iron absorption (genetic disorders), following excess blood transfusion, blood hemolysis or damage in certain organs. Liver diseases, blood diseases including leukemia, infections and inflammatory conditions like arthritis are associated also with high ferritin level mostly with normal level of iron.  Very high ferritin levels (greater than 1,000 ng/mL) signify an iron overload can be seen in conditions like excess iron absorption (congenital hemochromatosis), excess blood transfusions (acquired hemochromatosis), abnormal erythropoeisis (in bone marrow diseases like MDS) or following excess Iron infusion.   Too much iron deposition in body organs, like the liver, endocrine organs, pancreas or heart, may negatively affect their function. Thus it is important to monitor the level of ferritin and to avoid its overload in the body with prompt management.   Discontinuation of Iron infusion therapy and frequent monitoring of the ferritin level in the blood are essential steps to determine the need for further therapeutic intervention.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

High level of homocysteine is also seen in some hereditary disorders. High levels are known to be associated with coronary heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular disease.  The test is not a routine one and it is recommended mainly to young individuals who present with an early onset cardiac disease or abnormal blood clotting (venous thrombosis) especially those who have no other risks for such conditions.  I would strongly advise you to avoid taking any medication without direct medical consultation and physician prescription.

    "content": "Hello,  Alkaline phosphatase ALP is an enzyme mainly synthesized in the liver and bone and to a lesser extent in the intestines and kidneys. During pregnancy the placenta becomes another source for LAP.  Normal level in adults is in the range of  20 to 140 IU/L (international units per liter).  Very high levels of ALP are seen in heptobilliary disorders, like hepatitis, fatty liver, cirrhosis, gallstones,and cancer. Levels are aslo high in bone diseases and during the healing of a bone fracture.   Infections, certain types of anemia and endocrine problems may raise ALP level. Medications that have an effect on the liver may also cause elevation in ALP level like some antibiotics, oral antidiabetics, birth control pills, analgecis, and antidepressants.  Low levels are commonly seen in patients with chronic diseases that result in malnutrition and low protien levels. Low levels are also seen in individuals with high Vitamine D level or low Vitamine C level as well as hypomagnesemia.   It is important to refer your results to the normal range of the lab where the test was done.  A single abnormal test in otherwise normal clinical and laboratory findings, makes repeating the test reasonable.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to avoid any medications before doing the test.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your WBC is low, which indicates a mild leukopenia; normal monocytes are between 4 and 10 per cent of the WBC. Your results show a chronic leukopenia, which could indicate a chronic viral infection (less likely with the passage of time), connective tissue disease/autoimmune problems, diseases of the bone marrow, and use of certain medications. It is impossible to know, without knowing more of your history, which may be the case -- or if it may be some other thing entirely.   You should be followed by your internist or, if there is a diagnosis other than notation of the abnormal lab findings, appropriate treatment. If there were a definite diagnosis I have to assume you'd be under treatment for something now, so my best guess is your doctor is simply following this mild abnormality and hasn't been able to assign it a cause. So long as there are no associated symptoms the best strategy is to continue follow up.  I hope this is helpful. If there are any additonal facts you may have left out, please follow up with us here.

    "content": "I have a sister who has been sick for a while, gradually getting worse. Over the last year she has lost a TON of hair, she has joint pains, shortness of breath, and very tired.  She got blood work at her doctor's office and he said she was very anemic and that there were some abnormal cells and he wanted her to go to a hematologist. She did. They took more blood and did a test for lupus and RA and those 2 tests were essentially negative but she was even more anemic, so they wanted to do a bone marrow biopsy.  When they did the bone marrow, they did not get enough marrow to test but the bone biopsy showed caseating granulomas.  They just did another bone marrow aspiration yesterday to test that and they had a real hard time getting anything to aspirate.  They mentioned \"dust\" a few times.??  The pathologist said they got enough though for the doctor to make the diagnosis and that he was leaning towards 2 different things but could not say what. It will be another week before we hear anything from the doctor and I was wondering what these 2 things possibly could be or what it sounds like to you guys.  Thanks for any information.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Enlarged red cells, or macrocytosis, is not a disease nor disorder, but can be a sign of a number of relatively minor problems of which alcoholism is only one. It can also indicate a deficiency of vitamin B-12 or folate, liver disease, chemotherapy, or  even can be  a result of the bone marrow trying to compensate for anemia due to any cause including a one-time  blood loss.   Most of these problems would have showed up in a routine comprehensive metabolic panel blood test, which may well have been done at the same time as the CBC which showed up the large red cells. Again, macrocytosis is not a disease and is not problematic in itself.  Sludge in the gallbladder is another problem entirely,  and could possibly cause biliary colic (gallbladder \"attack\") but is usually left alone in the absense of any symptoms. It is made up mostly of cholesterol, and eventually forms gallstones, which may also cause gallbladder problems -- or not.  I hope this answers  your questions. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Slightly low values on CBC",
    "content": "Hello Melissa,  The anemia is very mild.  (A normal hemoglobin would be around 13-14 and your son's is 11.9).  The MCV is a little low.  This is common in iron deficiency (probably the most common cause of anemia).  Normally with iron deficiency the RDW is also elevated.  To complicate things further, following a severe or prolonged illness the bone marrow can be suppressed some causing an anemia (called anemia of chronic inflammation or chronic illness).  In your son's case, I suspect that the later may be a significant cause of the anemia; however, given the low MCV it is possible that he may also be slightly iron deficient.  If one wanted to prove this, specific iron studies could be done.  Alternatively, he could simply take a multivitamin with iron.  The issue of thalassemia can also cause a low MCV, although with thalassemia I would expect a low RDW and his is on the upper normal side.  So, to try to summarize all this, I would recommend simply rechecking this in 4-8 weeks to see if it has resolved.  This will allow time for the bone marrow to recover from the illness.  During this time it is also reasonable to have him take a multivitamin with iron to help build up his iron stores.   I suspect most of this is the illness.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HELP HIGH IRON SLIGHTLY HIGH LIVER COUNT",
    "content": "Hi -  The most likely thing the doctor wants a hematologist to rule out (or in) would be  iron overload (hemochromatosis), a condition where the patient has either ingested too much in the way of iron supplements or has a disorder which causes overly high levels of iron in the blood. This is actually a lot more of a problem then \"iron poor blood\" and can lead to liver and kidney damage and increase the risk of heart disease. If it's caused by the  taking of iron supplements it  is easy to correct (stop taking the supplements), but usually the underlying condition is  already there  in these cases.   If you are diagnosed with this problem you will likely have to have blood drawn on a regular  basis (like donating, except the blood can't be used to replace whole  blood because of the high iron  content). Once the levels are normalized, periodic phlebotomy (drawing of blood to keep down the excess iron and red cell levels) is usually necessary.    Hopefully this is  not the case, but if it is, at least you can know there is a treatment for the disorder, which otherwise could be very dangerous.  Hopefully this answers your question and equally hopefully everything turns out to be normal.\n\n",

Doctors know that lab \"normal\" ranges are all subject to interpretation, and there has to be a cutoff somewhere, but when the results are so extremely close to the normal range (and on either side, depending upon the result one  looks at), they really are, for all practical purposes, fine. Just as there are some WNL results that a doctor will not be satisfied with in certain clinical situations, most of the time everything being as close as yours are, and given the doctor's judgement that you are otherwise healthy (except, of course, for the tonsillitis), this actually does make sense.

So, could B12 deficiency be causing this? The sweats are extreme enough to make me feel really dehydrated pretty quickly and my clothes end up drenched. It's hard to get the sweating to stop once it starts. I usually just take a nap so that I will be asleep and will not notice how cold I am so that I will stop bundling up from the cold. When I wake up, the sweats will be somewhat better. I often have a low grade fever (between 100 and 101), but I don't think that I have any more or less of one than I usually do when the sweating starts. I also usually have a slightly elevated WBC (just barely out of normal range) and slightly above normal (just barely out of normal range) MHC and MCHC.\n\n",

After months of seeing the Hematologist his wbc went back to normal and the doc said that his glands seemed to be going down, which i never noticed that they did. It has been since Dec. that my son has seen that doc since he said it was no longer necessary to see him. I notced the other day that his gland under his chin on the right side of his neck is still huge , much bigger than the other one. its noticable to me when he looks up or turns his head.is that normal for the gland not to ever go back to a normal size? should i be worried? he hasnt been sick or anything since no other symptoms and it doesnt bother him but it worries me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  If your son was seen by a hematologist who found nothing underlying the high WBC and swollen glands, and your son has improved and not been sick since, all is probably well. A lymph gland can take a good long time to return to normal size and, sometimes, there is a permanent difference between one and the complimentary one. Still, it can't hurt to mention this to the doctor. It would seem a comprehensive workup was done and your son was followed and nothing ever showed up. For your own peace of mind, though, at least a call in to ask about the one still-enlarged gland might be helpful.  Hoping all is well. Please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 36-yr old male with general good health, but I'm really worried about my blood test results, specifically my lymphocytes. 15months ago, my CBC diff showed lymphocytes at 1750. 6months ago, they were at 1112. Yesterday they were at 853. In all of these tests, everything else has been normal. But I am extremely scared about this decreasing lymphocyte count. I've read in one place that <1500 is abnormal, and in another that <1000 is abnormal. However, the reference range listed for my lab is and has been 850-3900. So should I not worry about the <1500 or <1000 numbers I read elsewhere, and base my condition only on the lab's ref range? If so, and I am technically within normal range in this lab, how concerned should I be about the fact that the levels have been dropping over the last 15months, although always within normal?  I've been generally healthy over this time although I went through a few colds between yesterday's test and the one 6months ago...but as far as this recent test, I don't think I've been sick for a few weeks at least.  I currently take vytorin 10/20, fluoxetine 40, fish oil, and psyllium fiber daily.  Any advice would be much appreciated...my doctor doesn't seem concerned since I'm not out of the normal range, but I'm scared since I seem so low by most accounts and because it has been slowly dropping.  Thanks, Arnold\n\n",

    "content": "Hello arnold -  This normal range business can be a real bugbear for a lot of people, and since you've looked into it and know what some of the ranges are (your lab's normal range is the same as the one I'm familiar with and you're in there) you will  just want to follow this over a period of time, perhaps in six months, unless you should develop some new and untoward symptoms. While you have seen a consistent drop, and this is of interest to an inquiring mind, it really doesn't mean anything until you get outside normal limits, and most all of us do, in fact, swing wildly within normal limits (and sometimes just outside them, too). In short, I wouldn't worry, but since you've done some reading and the \"don't worry\" advice probably won't stick, I suggest following up as I said earlier, in a few months, to see where you are at that time. And in the meantime, again  as I've already said, barring any remarkable symptoms (you're allowed to catch cold), try to not worry about it.   I hope  this helps ease your mind somewhat. Good luck to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your lab results could mean something -- or nothing -- none of them were what's known as a \"critical result\" which would require immediate or even urgent attention.  Nothing is very far from normal, and,  in fact, almost all of them are just barely outside normal limits. This could, as I said earlier, mean something, although I feel it's a little bit odd that every component  is just a hair off. There is definitely nothing crucial going on, so please don't panic over this. It happens. Usually when it does the whole thing is repeated. If it still comes out the same, then some detective work would be in order, of a sort that's beyond the scope of this site. We can't diagnose from a distance, and  oftentimes can't even safely make a guess. What I can tell you is that everything looks OK enough that you can relax until the scheduled appointment. Sometimes its seems we're a lot better off not knowing about abnormalities that don't carry any specific significance to them. Try and be patient and not worry. There's a good chance nothing is wrong, and certainly nothing critical.  Good luck to you, and please follow up with us.\n\n",

(1+ means that it is a minimal amount)  In cases where it was indicative of something, most commonly this would be from iron deficiency.  If all the other levels were normal (including the HgB/HCT and RDW) it is probably unlikely to be anything significant and may even be simply a normal variation.  Unless there are other indications that something is going on, there is likely no reason to repeat this.  If there is concern, it can be repeated to see if anything has changed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Momoffive,  MPV on a CBC stands for mean platelet value, which is basically a measure of platelet size.  It varies depending on when the CBC is done because new platelets are larger and get smaller as they age.  If you had your CBC done shortly after your bone marrow released new platelets the MPV will be higher.    A value of 11.2 is not concerning in general.  Really, the only time this value is helpful for interpretation is when there is actually a problem with the platelets.  Then, it can be helpful to figure out what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Night sweats, insomnia, anxiousness, loss of appetite, after a few months other symptoms were added, some change in control of muscles, twitching, shaking hands, blood pressure spikes etc. etc.  He was given...blood pressure meds., antidepressants, sleep help.  He decided on his own to have his blood tested again to test for other things and his platelet count came back a 19.     Our doctor has now diagnosed a tick related disease called babesia even though the test for that came out negative.  After 24 days on an antibiotic he is feeling much better.  But he is still having some neurological tremors and is also still taking the antidepressents that I don't think he really needed to start with.  The question finally,  is the low platelet count enough to diagnos correctly?  Thank good ness he is feeling better.   Second question please, I was told as a young woman that I had something called a D U variant and possible coolies anemia.  I have had regular blood work done and nothing has ever been said to me since then.  Is this something that needs a special test?\n\n",

It is a little unusual for the tests to come back negative for babesiosis so I can't say for sure that this is or is not the cause of his illness.  The good thing is he's getting better.  Regarding your question about anemia, Cooley's anemia (Beta thalassemia major) is a very, very severe blood disease that can present with life threatening anemia.  It requires life long transfusions to sustain life.  Given that your blood tests have been normal I am assuming you have not been requiring transfusions and thus do not have Cooley's anemia.  There are many different types of hemoglobin variants, several of which are not clinically significant.  I am not familiar with the Du variant and was not able to find any significant information about it.  If there is a question (even if you are just curious) you can have a hemoglobin electrophoresis performed to determine if you have any hemoglobinopathies.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, the baby aspirin is typical in cases where there is increased risk of blood clot.  It seems like such a little thing and aspirin seems so basic, but really it is an amazing drug.  If you had a history of DVT or other clots already, perhaps they would feel more intervention might be indicated but under the circumstances, this is a good course of action and would likely not be any different if they did have more information about the specific possible variants that are possible with Factor V.    By the way, clotting factors are implicated in miscarriage in only rare cases.  Most miscarriages occur in perfectly healthy women with no risks at all - merely luck of the draw.  It is suspected that most are caused by embryos which are defective and cannot survive.  When you think about everything which must come together perfectly for pregnancy to occur, implantation and development to progress, it's a wonder it happens as easily and often as it does.    Good luck to you as this miracle of pregnancy progresses.\n\n",

It's not swollen, not discolored, and you can't feel any definite lumps, but it does hurt when you touch it.

If it is during a time when the pain is there, tensing my thigh seems to not help, but it does not hurt if I flex my foot. I am worried about a blood clot, and my grandfather died from pulmonary embolism.

    "content": "Hello Wtchmel,  Inflammatory markers like ESR and CRP are, as the name implies, markers of inflammation.  The problem lies in that they are very non-specific.  As such, they become elevated anytime there is inflammation in the body for any reason.  Most commonly this is due to an infection, including minor colds.  Inflammatory conditions  such as arthritis can also cause an increase.  If they continue to be elevated without returning to normal you may want to consider seeing a rheumatologist.  These are specialists in autoimmune disorders.  An elevated CRP and ESR in an of themselves do not indicate a rheumatological disease; however, of the vast array of specialists that are available, this probably is the best place to start.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This is the reason they offer beverages following donation and tell you to increase your fluid intake for the next 24 hours.  If you are giving frequently I would recommend allowing more time between donations.  I assume your hematocrit (iron) is OK or they would reject you for donation.    When you donate, eat and drink well the day of the donation and follow up as directed with extra fluids.  Avoid strenuous activities for several hours following to allow your body full recovery.  You need to let your body make more blood so give it a chance.    There is nothing in the process of procuring the blood that should cause these symptoms unless you are psychologically affected and this could happen.  Some people faint just thinking about donating.  Good luck  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kerrilynn01,  By far, the most common reason for this is continued viral infections.  Children this age average about 12 viral infections per year, almost all of them grouped in the winter.  Because of this, these children tend to go from one cold to the next.  There are other causes of this.  In particular, it is important to be sure that it is actually the lymphocytes that are high and not the neutrophils that are low.  The percentages given are percentages of the overall white blood cell count.  A drop in one cell line will result in an increase in the others.  If there is a thought that your son may still have a viral infection and there are no other concerning symptoms it may be worthwhile repeating the CBC in a few weeks.  If there is concern about something else that may be going on I would recommend your son be evaluated by a hematologist (a blood specialist).  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HELP - microcytosis, anisocytosis 9 month old",
    "content": "Hello Shannon,  There are a few things to cover here.  First, his initial WBC count is quite high; however, since it dropped back down on the next test, the initial elevated white count was likely due to something called a leukemoid reaction.  Basically this is where the body responds to an infection so dramatically that it increases the WBC count into the range commonly seen with leukemia (hence the name leukemoid).  This is NOT due to a cancer and is really a harmless thing.  Now, regarding the microcytosis and anisocytosis.  Microcytosis means small red blod cells.  This correlates with an MCV (mean cell value) of 69 (low).  Anisocytosis means the red blood cells are of varying sizes.  This corresponds to the RDW (red cell distribution width) that is elevated.  The most common cause of an elevated RDW and a low MCV is, by far, iron deficiency.  I would suggest you talk with your son's pediatrician about some iron supplementation to help rebuild his stores.  After 2-3 months of iron supplementation, I suspect the MCV will be normal and the RDW will have decreased back to normal as well.  There are a few other possible causes but iron deficiency is much, much more common so trying to correct this is the first step.  If there is doubt as to whether or not this is from iron, iron levels can be measured.  This is done by testing basically three things-iron level, ferritin level, and total iron binding capacity (or sometimes transferrin saturation instead of the TIBC).  Iron deficiency has low iron levels, generally low ferritin levels (although this can be affected by other things), and a high TIBC or low transferrin saturation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: diverticulitis and vitamin B12",
    "content": "I am adding your other post here since it is related and the forum rules prohibit opening a new thread for a continuing subject. what alimentary cause causes poor absorption of high potency oral B12 supplements, necessitating IM injections of B12?  I should say first that it has been shown that people can absorb B12 taken orally if it is given in huge doses to compensate for the poor absorption so in answer to your question of high potency oral vitamins, studies have shown that 1,000 to 2.000 mcg would be needed daily to get the amount needed (equivalent to 2 mcg by injection).  Keep in mind that absorption is variable with the individual which is why we have a broad range here.  The reason is related to intrinsic factors in the gut which are required for the absorption.  Pernicious anemia is one condition which causes B12 deficiency.  There are many other conditions including long-term use of some medications that can result in such deficiency as well.  Any process that interferes with gastric acid production can lead to this impairment.  The acidic environment of the stomach facilitates the breakdown of vitamin B12 that is bound to food.  The vitamin B12 \u00adintrinsic factor complex then aids in the absorption of vitamin B12 in the terminal ileum.  Dietary sources of vitamin B12 are primarily meats and dairy products so vegetarians and vegans can be especially prone to a lack of B12.  Alcoholics and the elderly are also at risk.  But, the body does hold in reserve vitamin B12 so one can go several years without showing any signs of disease due to a lack in the vitamin through normal food intake.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Moggie,  Looking at your results it appears that your hemoglobin is low and your RDW is elevated.  The low hemoglobin defines this as anemia.  Most commonly, anemia with an elevated RDW is due to iron deficiency.  This would be supported by your slightly low ferritin.    There is another lab value found in the complete blood count known as the MCV or mean cell volume.  If it is low this supports that the anemia is likely due to iron deficiency (although there are some more possible explanations iron deficiency is by far the most common).  If the MCV is high it leans towards a deficiency of ferritin or vitamin B12 (less common).  I would recommend that you follow up with your doctor about this.  If it is due to iron deficiency treatment often requires iron supplementation at levels above that found in a typical multivitamin and often requires a prescription.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: neutophils too large",
    "content": "Hello Mermaid_g-ma,  Chediak-Higashi syndrome (CHS) is a genetic condition that affects many cells of the body, including the white blood cells.  It is quite rare.  You are correct that the body is constantly making new WBC's; however, the problem is that the genetic make up of the cells that become new WBC's is abnormal.  As a result, all the new cells made are also abnormal.    Unfortunately, these children often will die early due to complications from infection or problems with the WBC's themselves.  Those that survive tend to develop neurological problems as they get older.  The treatment of choice is a bone marrow transplant.  The bone marrow holds the precursor cells that become WBC's.  A bone marrow transplant replaces the genetically abnormal bone marrow cells with new, normal marrow cells that then produce normal white blood cells.  Unfortunately, this fixes the immune problem but not the neurological problems, which often can continue to develop.  At this point there is not a great treatment for this part.    Your grandson needs to be under the care of a pediatric hematologist that can help be sure that he is getting the correct care for this disorder.  I would also suggest that your son and daughter-in-law consider talking with a geneticist about this condition.  It is an autosomal recessive disorder.  This means that there is a 25% chance of future children also having this disorder.  The geneticist can give them all the latest information and answer any questions about this that they may have.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Could that be why my percentage is high?  the absolute count and everythign is normal.

    "content": "Hi Hp1023,  Neutrophils are the type of white blood cells that fight off infection.  However, neutrophils are also basically the early type of cell produced so an infection from some viruses can cause an increase in neutrophils early on the infection as well.  In addition, stress can also do this.  Your percentage is high but not worrisome if your overall white blood cell count is normal.  If other symptoms develop this can be rechecked.  Otherwise I wouldn't worry about it too much.  Best wishes.\n\n",

At the end of treatment, a clot was discovered and determined to be a result of my portacath.  I stopped using birth control when I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's.  Now I would like to return to using birth control.  I understand that birth control increases blood clot risk - however since my clot was associated with the portacath, am I low risk?  I've asked this question of both my family doctor and my oncologist and they don't seem to think it's a concern.  It's a unique situation though and I'd like another opinion.    If I developed a clot once (regardless of cause), am I not automatically at higher risk for clotting?\n\n",

There is some reason you developed a clot when millions of others with the same situation do not.  You could be prone to developing them, then once you get a stimulus (the catheter, oral contraceptives, etc.) you may do it again.  I would stay away from this form of birth control.  Perhaps an IUD could be considered?  It is a decision to be made between you and your doctor but I would opt out.  Let me know if you have other questions but this is my opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mama CherylInjerry,  The 27 number is most likely the percentage of white blood cells that are neutrophils.  A normal percentage is closer to around 50-60% but 27% is not critically low, assuming that your total WBC count is not too low.  Very commonly, infections with a virus induce a shift and production of lymphocytes (another white blood cell type).  When the lymphocyte count goes up, by simple increase in the total number of WBC's, the percentage of neutrophils goes down.  If there are other concerning symptoms I would recommend you have this rechecked.  Otherwise, it is probably fine to simply have this rechecked the next time a reason arises.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lmfort,  I did some literature searches and didn't find an obvious connection between iron deficiency and hepatic cysts.  Iron deficiency either develops from not taking enough iron in or by loosing iron through bleeding.  So, the general work up is to look for losses through bleeding (in particular, by the GI tract that is tested for with a hemacult card that detects blood in the stool).  If no bleeding is found then the next step is to increase iron in the diet (generally by using an iron supplement).    Regarding the hepatic cyst, there are several possible causes.  I would suggest that you follow up with a GI specialist for this.  Your primary care doctor can do the work up for the iron deficiency or you can see a hematologist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Finger discoloration and Sever Fatigue.",
    "content": "The middle finger on my right hand has recently(Today) become discolored. It is a red color in splotches under the skin with a blueish tint at the knuckle. Also I was etremely fatigue the whole day to the point where I was slipping in and out of sleep most of the day. Also I have a burning sensation in my bicep and about a cm away from my elbow on the forearm side, and this is the left arm. Also My hands are twitching, which could be something I always had but just never took attention to, but I figure its worth mentioning anyways. I also have a slight fever of about 100 degrees. I did some research on google and found that hema-somthing might be causing the discoloration on my finger, so I figured this was the best place to post this. Any help is etremely appreciated.  Also on a side note, for some reason the last few month I have made a significant increase in typos and errors while trying to type/write words. I was just wondering if this is a serious symptoms or not.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kylethedarkn,  This is a bit unusual.  I'm not exactly certain what may be causing it.  The finger discoloration may be from some changes in the tone of the blood vessels causing more blood to pool in the finger.  I'm not sure how to tie all your symptoms together, unless this is actually the early warning signals of a brain issue such as a transient ischemic attack (sort of like chest pain for a heart attack, TIA's are warning signals for strokes).    I would recommend you see your doctor if these symptoms haven't gone away or if they come back.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My spleen was removed 21 years ago because I ruptured it in an auto accident.  Since then I have been basically healthy, except for occasional high WBCs.  In 2006 leukocytosis was added to my health record.  I am 50 years old.  Last summer I spilled concentrated bleach on my hands causing caustic burns and hypersensitivity to all chemicals such as alcohol, soap, cosmetics, etc.  In Nov I had a vitrectomy done.  My pre-op blood work concerned my primary care MD.  The following were in the high range: WBC  14.4 Platelet count 384 lymphocytes 6.48  monocytes  1.87  eosinophils  .86 In the Diff Cell comments section it said \"few reactive lymphocytes\" in the PLT comments \"few large platelets, few giant platelets\"  A month later I repeated the CBC & the out of normal range were: WBC 16.9 platelet count 474 neutrophils 9.06 lymphocytes 6.10 monocytes  1.35  the Diff Cell comments stated: \"Few reactive lymphocytes, occasional myelocytes seen on scan.\" The CBC comments, blood stated: \"Microfibrin present; Peripheral blood smear reviewed; automated differential verified\".  My MD has sent a sample of my blood to a lab in Canada for what she terms a \"special test\".    In the past I've had similar WBC counts.  Twice I've been referred by a previous primary care MD for an ultrasound of my non-existent spleen.  I told my present MD that since I'm a post-splenectomy patient I rarely pay any attention to my bloodwork because my WBC is always elevated.  She mentioned a bone marrow test and I realized she was taking this more seriously than I.    Should my WBC still be high 21 years after the splenectomy?  I have no symptoms of infection except a slight head cold and frequent night sweats that have been attributed to peri-menopause for the past two years.  I did a course of steroids for the caustic burns in September and was using eye drops containing prednisone after the vitrectomy which I was still applying twice a day in one eye when the second draw was done.  Could the abnormalities be related to the use of prednisone?    I am not diabetic, I haven't smoked in 19 years and the vitrectomy was a complete success with no complications.  Should I be concerned or could the high WBC & platelets be attributed to either the bleach exposure, the prednisone or a combination of the two?\n\n",

    "content": "Hey, I'm a 21 year old male. I had my gallbladder out when i was 12 (and woke up with an intense pain in chest/back that comes every 5 months) and been diagnosed with IBS. I've also been told i had the beginning of a duodenal ulcer, but it was never treated.. (went on pantoloc for a week and then i got sick from it; so we stopped; but that was all). More importantly, I've had insomnia (i wake up 3-6 times a night regularly for the last few years). Its been better and less frequent but still happens around 3 or 4 times a week because i've been waking up at the same time each day. I've had a sleep study but couldnt fall asleep so i have to go back for one. I also found out that my \"spleen is slightly bulky in apperance and measures up to 12.6cm. THis is the upper limits of normal to borderline enlarged\". I also had a tonsillectomy in july.  The reason im posting here is cuz of two recent blood tests and symtpoms im not sure what theyre from and it has gotten me worried.  Everything was normal except my RBC (6.28), Hematocrit (.51), MCH (26.8)  and i ate that morning if that makes any difference. My doctor didnt acknowledge this and said everyhting was fine but he gave me a copy of the records and i notcied this. I also had a blood test a few weeks before at a naturopath who told me my RBC was a little high but that was all she said.   Beginning of August, i started to get really itchy at nighttime, and then it dissipated and was replaced with boiling hot feelings in my face at random times and my ears get red. I was also getting sore feelings on the sides of my stomach not simultaneously (not sure if it was indigestion or not), I get faint when i stand up to fast from lying down to the point where i grab on teh wall (my b pressure is normal), and my right middle finger goes white /numb when its cold.   Could this all be stress from previous probllems and inadequate sleep? Please help. I'm going to try a new doctor as well.\n\n",

How can your HCT and RBC be high if your B12 is low?  If I am overproducing red blood cells already and received B12 injections, would that cause me to make even more red blood cells?  Is this some type of rare blood disorder/condition?  Help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Npilant,  I suspect that your B12 is not low enough to produce an anemia.  There is another red blood cell measurement that can indicate B12 deficiency as well.  If the MCV is elevated (usually defined as >100) it is more consistent with a B12 deficiency.  B12 deficiency can cause neurological symptoms, though I can't be sure that this is the cause of your symptoms.  Getting B12 replacement is unlikely to cause an increased production of red blood cells for you.  You may want to see a hematologist to further evaluate your red cells if there is concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for replying Dr. Lowe as any additional information would be helpful at this time.  I have a CT tomorrow to see if I have a hole in a middle ear or inner ear bone.  My ENT doc said it's rare but could explain my symptoms.  I looked up the condition (superior canal dehiscence), and it only seems to answer part of the problems that I am going through (Dizziness, headaches, balance problems.)    I have thought for some time and continue to believe that I have Lymes Disease.  This is do to the fact that when all the symptoms started, well maybe a month or so later when I noticed it, I had a weird pinkish tan, irregularly shaped oval mark on my back.  It was gone less than a month later.  It did not have a bullseye but I've heard that doesn't matter.  This was back in 2002, but I was never tested for Lymes disease until about two weeks ago.  I had a Lyme Titer done, which came back negative.  I do not know what type of Titer was done, if they did the old ELISA test or the ELISA6 test and I assume they did not do the western blot.  Additionally, I have heard that other tick borne illnesses can cause similar symptoms (babesiosis, erlichiosis).  I should add that I lived in Maryland until about a year ago and individuals I knew, specifically the neighbor across the street, had contracted Lymes Disease there.  I had heard that the IGeneX is the best lab to use to have your blood or other fluids tested.    Should I just cough up the money and have samples sent there to be tested or are all labs the same? Also, my neighbor across the street had a giant bullseye on her leg when she got Lymes Disease and she tested negative the first time as well.\n\n",

The treatment, hydration and possibly blood transfusion, will likely be of use in pneumonia as well-at least the hydration part.  Strep. pneumo is a known severe pathogen for sickle cell patients because the sickling causes destruction of the spleen that helps remove organisms such as strep. pneumo.    Aggressive antibiotics are required.  Supportive measures such as intubation and mechanical ventilation can be needed in severe pneumonias.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I don't think these results would be related to your injection. I am not sure but if by K-40 you mean Kenalog-40 (Triamcinolone acetonide), then this is a corticosteroid hormone (glucocorticoid). To start off with a local injection would have minimal systemic effects. Glucorticoids tend to cause lymphopenia as opposed to neutropenia. Some systemic steroids may even cause apparent neutrophilia (increase in neutrophil counts) due to something known as decreased neutrophil margination.  On the other hand it would not interfere with your DHEA-s result. DHEA-s is a steroid hormone that arises from the adrenal gland. Hence persistently elevated levels could point to an adrenal gland problem such as adrenal hyperplasia.  Please update this thread and let us know what your doctor thinks.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again,  As I am sure your doctor must have told you, the presence of factor V leiden causes a person to have a higher tendency to develop clots (hypercoagulability). This risk varies depending on whether you have one copy (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of gene mutated. Homozygous patients are very rare but have a much higher tendency to for clots.  The important thing here is to avoid any other risk factors for clots. This includes avoiding contraceptive pills with estrogen, avoid smoking. Conditions such as pregnancy and surgery may also increase the risk of clot formation and you would need to inform your doctor for him to keep a close eye on your coagulation profile and maybe even give you prophylaxis therapy.  While steroids in general can increase the risk of thrombosis, I wouldn't think that locally injected steroids would affect your condition. It also would not explain the other findings you mentioned.  Keep us updated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Fouad,  The blood test showed the heterozygous type.  My doctor hasn't told me much, I was reffered to a Hematologist and am now waiting for my appointment date to arrive.    I know that the possibilities are endless with what could be going on, but the two things that scare me the most are cancer and lupus, and those are two words that have been brought up.  Because I've had to be patient (which I am not very good at) to find out what all these results mean, I've been trying to gather as much information as possible so that I can ask the right questions and have a basic knowledge to understand the responses when I go to my upcoming appointments.  My recent (within the last five years) family medical history is interesting to say the least, and I am trying to ensure I am healthy and doing all I can to stay in shape and keep my body working properly.  Watching my sister never really recover from her strokes at such a young age, and waiting for my mom to come out of brain surgery opened my eyes to a very unhealthy lifestyle.  I had quit smoking years ago, but have changed many other factors since then.  I do not drink(never really did), I eat a healthy diet (I'm definitely within the height & weight standards), I exercise 6 days a week so I know I'm physically fit.     Again, I am just trying to make sure I have a basic knowledge so that I can understand the answers to my questions when I go into my appointments.  I will definitely post again and let you know what's going on.  Thanks so much for writing back about the Factor V Leiden.  Have a great day!\n\n",

I go back in three months for another look just to ensure the counts are still good.  The Dr. thinks that I probably had a viral infection that did not present with symptoms and it caused my counts to be low.  I was just happy to hear that the counts were normal.  I've learned quite a bit about the Factor V Leiden, no HRT for me when that change of life occurs, informing Doctors before any surgeries so that blood thinners can be prescribed if necessary.  I also learned that I've dodged quite a few bullets having two children and having the types of surgeries that I have had.  I'm lucky I have had no problems.    I felt very blessed walking out of the Doctors office after my appointment.  Thanks for answering my questions.  I appreciate your help and your wisdom.\n\n",

The doctors were not sure what was going on with my son.  They found out about two weeks later when they got the blood results back found out that he had a abnormal hemoglobin called Koln.  I haven't heard about this condition until they diagnosed my son.  He is now 15 months and just recently had a virus and we thought we might have to go through another blood tranfusion but his body was able to bounce back from the illness.  With this condition he has signs to watch for and I was able to get him to the doctor before he was to weak.  Question:  I would love to know if this abnormal hemoglobin is hereditary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shelbyn,  There is not a lot of information about the Hemoglobin Koln mutation.  I can't really give you any specifics about this mutation itself; however, in general, hemoglobin mutations are hereditary.    For many hemoglobinopathies it takes two copies of a gene mutation (though not necessarily the same mutation) to cause problems.  A few can cause problems with only one copy.  Almost certainly your son will be able to pass this gene on to his children.  His copy may have arisen from a spontaneous mutation but now that it is there it can be passed on.  The part I'm less familiar with is what this will actually mean for his children.  In many cases it doesn't cause problems because the other genes received from the other parent are normal.  Given the apparent rarity of this particular mutation it is unlikely he will meet someone with the same mutation.  A hematologist will probably be able to give you much better information that I am giving you.  It is very reasonable to set up an appointment with a pediatric hematologist to discuss this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

No noticeable spleen or lymph swelling.  Was admitted following an ER visit due to anemia-- hemoglobin just under 6. Received three units of blood. Discharge papers said \"Marked microcytic anemia with normal iron studies.\"  Despite the absence of iron deficiency, I was still prescribed 65mg of ferrous sulfate 3x a day.  I have been told throughout my life that I was \"a little\" anemic, but it was always presented as unimportant-- \"Just take a multi with a little iron in it. See you next year.\"  The original ER visit was due to a severe dizziness and unremitting nausea & vomiting. I was diagnosed with Meniere's 25 years ago.  I've been referred to a hematologist, but have to wait forever to see her. GP wants her to evaluate me for thalassemia. But Isn't that something they would have found lot sooner than middle age? And isn't it a super longshot that a person of Irish/Swedish/Welsh heritage would have this?  Could it really be thalassemia? What else could it be? Should I avoid exertion or exercise until I'm diagnosed? Am I a stroke/heart attack waiting to happen? (Not that I feel much like doing anything, and I have positional vertigo.)  Help!

In reviewing your results it appears that your MCV (red cell size measure) is low and your RDW (average of cell sizes) is high.  This is consistent with iron deficiency anemia, one of the most common causes of anemia.  Your anemia is not severe and likely you are not noticing any symptoms from this although it can cause some fatigue.  It is actually a good idea for you to see your doctor.  This way you can get a prescription for therapeutic iron replacement.  Over-the-counter vitamins often don't have enough iron in them to replace stores.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Evidentloss,  There are two different factors to consider.  First, the A, B, O or AB status of the baby.  Then the positive or negative status.    Each parent has two copies of the genes, with each passing one of their genes on to the baby.  Regarding the ABO part, A and B are both known as dominant blood types.  If a person has an A or a B gene that part will be in the blood type.  O is a recessive type.  For a person to be O there must be two O genes.  If a person is A and O the blood type is A, if it is B and O the blood type is B.  If a person is A and B the blood type is AB.  So, for the baby in question, with one parent A and the other O having an A baby we would deduce that the baby has received the A from one parent and the O from the other parent (the only option in this case since O parent must be O,O).  So, the baby will have the genes A and O making an A blood type.  Now the +,- part.  + is the dominant gene.  If it is present the baby will be blood type +.  So, is it possible for two + parents to have a negative baby?  There is one way.  Each parent must have one copy of the + gene and one copy of the negative gene (+,-) so that there is a possibility of the baby receiving the negative gene from both parents creating a negative blood type with two positive parents.  I hope this isn't too confusing.  To summarize, it is possible for an A+ and an O+ couple to have an A neg. baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mama Cherylnjerry,  There are a few reasons for low white blood cell counts.  Most commonly it is due to a viral infection.  I think this is likely unrelated to your UTI's or your genital warts.  Neither of these would be expected to be a cause of a low WBC count or be  caused by a low WBC count.    Having a low white blood cell count can predispose to some infections.  This depends more one the actual amounts of the subtypes of white blood cells present.  In particular if the neutrophils are low it can increase the risk of bacterial infections.  I would suggest you follow up with your doctor about this.  You will likely need to have your CBC repeated soon to see if your WBC count is improving.  Best wishes.\n\n",

From your description it sounds like your son is experiencing a very typical course for mono, which can continue to cause fatigue and symptoms for weeks.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  30 / F / 7 + dysplastic nevi biopsy results in the last four months/ Bunion, cyst, jaw surgeries / Strokes, Brain Anyurism / ADHD med.  I recently had blood drawn and the results came back with these abnormal results.  WBC - 2.5 Lymphs - 47 Nuetrophils (absolute) - 1.1  The doc wants me to wait a month and come back to re-draw.  Said if the results were similar she would recommend a bone marrow biopsy.  My question is why am I waiting a month to see if the results are the same to get a biopsy?  If cancer is a possibility, wouldn't waiting 30 days give it even more time to do damage?  I can't get answers from doc till the work week, and of course my brain is in overdrive trying to figure out what's going on.  Any advice, or comments would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Fairycakes,  The most likely reason for your low WBC count is a viral infection.  Viruses commonly cause some suppression of the bone marrow leading to the low WBC count.  This effect is temporary.  I would expect that in a month your WBC count will be normal again.  If there were other abnormalities on the CBC, such as anemia or low platelets, or if you have other symptoms of a cancer it would be more appropriate to be more aggressive in the work up.  If cancer is present with no other symptoms, a delay of 1 month at this point is unlikely to cause any problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I work out on average 17 + hours a week, only 2 - 3 of the hours are hard core workouts, the rest being yoga, pilates and walking.  Could irregular menstraul cycles be the culprit?  The reason I ask is because I haven't been sick, haven't had a fever, or anything else going on in the past few weeks.  I've been tired, but I contribute that to my workouts and being back into the elementary / middle school schedules.    I had my blood checked almost a year ago and the WBC was low 3.6, the Mono # & % were also low, but everything else was fine all within normal limits.  I donated to the Red Cross about 6 weeks ago, so I know that the communicable diseases are not the reasons for my counts.    If I read low again and I know it's not from a virus or one of the communicable diseases the red cross tests for what am I looking at?  Are there questions that I should be asking?  Are there things I could be changing here at home to help get better counts by the next test?  I'm scheduled to go to OB/GYN as well as to be tested for allergies to foods.  Do you have any other areas I should be exploring in the meantime to have more information by my next appointment w/ my GP?    Thanks so much again for your help and the time you are putting into answering all these questions on the boards.\n\n",

He did find that I had bronchiecstasis and put me on a antibiotic and prednisone for 28 days. The prednisone brought my eosinophil count down to 8%. He says he doesn't know what to do about me.

Commonly they are elevated with parasites, which it appears have been tested for.  They can also become elevated in severely allergic settings.    Given that the prednisone brought your eosinophils down I suspect that you do have a component of allergies.  This would also fit your repeated need for polypectomies and ethmoidectomies.  You may want to see an allergist about this to see if there is any other testing that can help figure this out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was told it was nothing.. A few years later with the same results - I was told to try iron therapy - we did this with no result.   She has just had her first adult physical in preparation for college - she was told to see her ob/gyn for heavy periods due to anemia (form letter) - I called to let the nurse/doctor know that she barely had periods and in fact we'd put her on the pill at age 14 to finally attempt to regulate what little she had.   We were referred to hematology and there we were told that she was a carrier of Thalassemia.  but then called and told to give her 325mg of iron 2x/day. no other information, followup etc.   Here results from hematology were:  hemoglobinopathy profile = hgb A increase  TIBC= increase (478) UIBC= increase (453) serum iron = decrease (25) iron saturation = decrease (5%) ferritin = decrease (5)  Her family history does include blood disorders polycythemia, polyschemia vera, diabetes, heart and vascular disease, hashimoto.   A followup was not recommended - a diagnosis not given.  Should I assume she is simply low on iron and have her take it as recommended (even though this same therapy did not work before)?  Should I have her revisit her Endocrinologist?  Is there anything else I should do or should I feel comfortable sending her away to college with only \"take iron\" as our instruction?   Is she still considered a carrier of Thalassemia and should we pursue anything there?   She was treated with chloramphenicol as a baby for pneumonia.  could this contribute?    After so many years of having blood results missed (ANA x 2 years) and even her fibroma was missed after years of reported pain - I am nervous at the lack of explanation here.    What would you do?    Thank you in advance for your consideration!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kconner,  It may be that your daughter has thalassemia and iron deficiency at the same time.  Her iron tests do indicate that her iron levels are low.  To formally diagnose thalassemia, hemoglobin electrophoresis is done.  I suspect this has been done since you state she has elevated HgG A.  There are two types of HgB A (A1 and A2).  If it is the A2 form that is elevated it would be consistent with thalassemia minor.  Beta thalassemia minor typically will produce increases of HgB A2 in the range of 4-5%.  It is typically asymptomatic and an incidental finding.  If the iron deficiency is not improved by taking iron supplements there may be a problem with iron absorption.  I would recommend her iron studies be repeated after 6 weeks of therapeutic iron dosing (not just taking a multivitamin with iron as this often does not have enough iron in it to correct deficiency).  If proper iron dosing does not correct the issue she should have an evaluation for absorption problems such as Crohn's disease or Celiac disease.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Also, there might be other siblings of her who are Thalassemia(Carrier).  For her to be a Thalassemia(Carrier), either of her biological parents would carry a Thal gene which was passed on to her. She should follow up with a Thalassemia specialist and should note that she needs to take care of herself(especially when she is pregnant as Thal might affect her pregnancy). If her partner is also a Thal(Carrier) and if she is confirmed a Thal(carrier), their chances of having a Thalassemia(Major) child is 25% and the child will not make his or her own blood. So, be aware of Thalassemia and try to find out her status before hand\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Missunique2u,   Thalassemia intermediate patients often can live a normal lifespan.  As the name implies it is intermediate between Beta thalassemia minor and Beta thalassemia major.  The typical treatment for thal. intermediate is to do occasional blood transfusions and  chelation of the excess iron to prevent iron toxicity.  Unlike thal. major which is transfusion dependent, thal. intermediate patients may not need as many transfusions.  Often they are done only when times of increased bone marrow stress occur, such as during an infection or when increased production is needed and it is important to have good oxygen delivery such as in pregnancy.  If you are developing end organ damage you may need to have more frequent blood transfusions.  I would advise you to see a hematologist to help manage your condition appropriately.  Best wishes.\n\n",

This morning I woke up and my left arm is now purple and blue and my right arm is purple and red.  Does anyone have any ideas that this could be?\n\n",

Your platelet count and clotting times should be checked to see if there is an abnormality.  Bruising to this extent without significant trauma can sometimes signal a deficiency in one of the clotting parts.  This can be triggered by many different things so an evaluation is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 15 years old, with general good health. She had her first period 3.5 years ago, and from the very beginning, I noticed that something was wrong: the amount of blood was enormous!! Until then, I didn't notice any abnormal bleeding. My husband and I have good health, without bleeding problems  Our family doctor run some tests and the only abnormal result was her bleeding time (12 minutes).  She was referred to a children hematology service. The hematoligist ran dozens of blood tests (Proteins, Von Wildebrand, factors, etc). All the results seem normal, however, her bleeding time remains between 10-12 minutes Since last year the amount of blood of her periods seems more \"controlled\", however, each injury bleeds a lot. But other than this, my daughter has a normal life. But suddenly, last year, even without injuries or excessive bleeding, she started to feel tired. Her ferritin level was checked annd was 35. She took an iron supplement, the ferritin went to 52. After 6 month she was told to stop with the supplement and now the ferritin level is again in 35  Therefore, we don't have a diagnostic or a solution. We were told that the tiredness may be or may be not related with the ferritin level. The only answer we have from the doctors is \"she has a medical condition and she should live with this\".  Are there other diagnostic resources? Can this problem be a consequence of other disorder (meaning liver, or kidneys or...) Should we look for more answers with other medical specialties?   Thank you in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Esullivan,  It sounds as if your daughter has seen a hematologist already.  Follow up with them is important.  The most common reason for a prolonged bleeding time is an improperly done test now that it is not commonly done anymore.  In the setting of a truly prolonged bleeding time, Von Willebrand's disease is the most common cause and often presents with prolonged or heavy menstrual bleeding in girls.  It is important to assess not only for proper Von Willebrand's factor levels but also for proper functioning.  Von Willebrand's type II is a qualitative function problem with the Von Willebrand's factor and the levels are normal but the protein doesn't work.  Assuming this has been tested for there are some other very rare coagulation disorders that are still being characterized.  These disorders can cause a prolonged bleeding time also.  One of these disorders I found while researching this is a condition where the platelet microvesicle generation is impaired.  I can't tell you much beyond this about this condition, though.  Regarding the iron, heavy menstrual bleeding is a very common cause of iron deficiency anemia.  Ferritin is an indirect marker of iron levels.  Given that she responded to the iron supplementation it is likely that this is the cause.  She should probably continue to take a good iron supplement to keep her levels up.  Best wishes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The report we received from the Hematology Clinic states that my daughter \"had and extensive work-up for a bleeding disorder which revealed all were within normal limits. Her INR, PTT, von Willebrand screening and platelet aggregation studies were all normal as were her platelet electron microscopy results. Rare fibrinolytic defects were also investigated which were within normal limits\"  They also stated \"We will therefore not need to see her again in clinic\"  Regarding the continued iron intake, they stated \"should not over-use iron as to avoid iron toxicity\"  The above reasons show why I am lost.  As I understand my daughter bleeds but has not a bleeding disorder? her ferritin is low but if she takes too much iron can be toxic?  Thank you again\n\n",

His CBC results were: CBC Test in May 2006 \t(Adam 3.5 yrs old) WBC (10^3/uL):\t8.7            Range (4.6-10.8) RBC (10^6/uL):\t5.06\tRange (4.7-10.8) HGB (gm/dL):\t9.7\tRange (14-18) HCT (%):\t\t29.5\tRange (42-52) MCV (fl):\t\t58.2\tRange (80-94) MCH (pg):\t\t19.1\tRange (27-31) MCHC (gm/dl):\t32.8\tRange (33-37) RDW (%):\t\t17.5\tRange (11.5-14.5) Platelets (10^3/uL):\t454\tRange (130-430) MPV(fl):\t\t7.3\tRange (7.4-10.4) Lymphocytes (%):\t43.2\tRange (20-51) Monocytes (%):\t6.9\tRange (1.7-9.3)  Up until May 2006 Adam was consuming daily intake around 6-7 milk bottles (300 ml ea.) from powdered iron fortified cow milk noting that he was finicky with regular/normal food (my wife doesn\u2019t eat red meat, however Adam\u2019s meat intake was from chicken & fish at least twice a week). Other than looking skinny and pale he is active and sharp/smart.  After the test results we limited Adam\u2019s milk intake (since June 2006) to only 1 cup in the morning and concentrated on daily multivitamins and iron supplements.  We also consulted immediately a Hematologist and done G6PD tests for the entire family and were all negative.  My wife and I also did a CBC test and both of our results came normal within range.  A far as we know there are no thalassemia cases in both of our families (nor immediate nor distant relatives).  The Hematologist diagnosed the matter as iron deficiency and advised to improve Adam\u2019s diet.  We resumed the iron supplements but red meat was not a weekly meal and Adam remained finicky about food. Adam\u2019s pediatrician alarmed us not to blindly administer iron supplements and to make a proper diagnosis for the case.  We stopped administering the iron supplement and about 2 months later we did another CBC test for Adam and results were very close (somehow) to the previous test .   CBC Test in May 2007 \t(Adam 4.5 yrs old) WBC (10^3/uL):\t7.9\t  (4.6-10.8) RBC (10^6/uL):\t4.75\t  (4.7-6.1) HGB (gm/dL):\t8.8\tL  (14-18) HCT (%):\t\t26.9\tL  (42-52) MCV (fl):\t\t56.7\tL  (80-94) MCH (pg):\t\t18.6\tL  (27-31) MCHC (gm/dl):\t32.8\tL  (33-37) RDW (%):\t\t16\tH  (11.5-14.5) Platelets (10^3/uL):\t389\t  (130-430)\t MPV(fl):\t\t8.3\t  (7.4-10.4)\t Lymphocytes (%):\t28.4\t  (20-51) Monocytes (%):\t8\t  (1.7-9.3) Iron (umol/L):\t5.09\tL  (7.1-28.3)  We again resumed the iron supplements in June 2007 and in August 2007 we consulted another pediatrician and conducted for Adam electroferrosis, CBC, retic, smear and ferritin tests shown below.   CBC Test in August 2007 \t(Adam 4.75 yrs old) WBC (10^3/uL):\t7.2\t (4.6-10.8) RBC (10^6/uL):\t5.18\t (4.7-6.1) HGB (gm/dL):\t9.5\tL  (14-18) HCT (%):\t\t30\tL  (42-52) MCV (fl):\t\t57\tL  (80-94) MCH (pg):\t\t18\tL  (27-31) MCHC (gm/dl):\t32\tL  (33-37) RDW (%):\t\t17\tH  (11.5-14.5) Platelets (10^3/uL):\t484\tH  (130-430)\t Polymorphonuclears:\t46\t  (40-65)\t Lymphocytes (%):\t44\tH  (25-40) Monocytes (%):\t6\t  (2-8) ABS Neutrophil Count\t3.3\t  (1.6-7.2) Eosinophils (%):\t4\t  (0-4) Reticulocytes Count \t0.8\t  (0.2-2.0)  The note on the test states:  RBCs: Slight anisopoikilocytosis and hypochromia marked microcytosis cigar-shaped tear-drop and few RBCs fragments seen.

The pediatrician suspects thalassemia while the new hematologist doesn\u2019t rule out iron deficiency .  Where do we go from here ? What additional tests are required to make an accurate diagnosis?  (Help).  !!!!!!  Adam is still pale, active, smart and fun.  He is now eating red meat at least 3 times a week on regular basis and being given iron supplements twice a day 2 hrs after food.  This began 4 weeks ago.   The only thing in Adam health history is that he had tested positive for E-coli when he was  6 months old and we have given him the required medicine.  The doctor alarmed to repeat the test after 3 months as it may return and indeed Adam tested (+) for E-coli 3 months later as was alarmed and we treated it again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ihallal,  Distinguishing iron deficiency from thalassemia can be difficult.  Your son's testing reveal a few things that make me think he more likely has iron deficiency.  First, his MCV (a marker of red blood cell size) is small.  This goes along with both iron deficiency and thalassemia.  However, this RDW is elevated.  This is a measure of the variety in red cell size.  With thalassemia all the red cells tend to be small, causing the RDW to be low.  With iron deficiency the bone marrow is trying to make new cells to replenish the supply.  These new cells are larger causing the RDW to elevate.  This would be supported by his essentially normal hemoglobin electrophoresis as well as his somewhat low iron level.    I would recommend he first have his iron deficiency completely corrected.  This can typically be done with a six week course of replacement dosing iron supplements (more iron than is in a multivitamin).  If his MCV remains low or his anemia does not correct from this I would recommend retesting his iron levels, and a test called the \"Total Iron Binding Capacity\" which will be high in iron deficiency because the lack of iron leaves a large capacity to bind more.  If his iron levels are normal I would suggest repeating the electrophoresis at that point.  It is possible to have both iron deficiency and thalassemia.  To make this diagnosis reliably the iron deficiency needs to be corrected first.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Layla,  Your WBC count may be slightly high.  This can happen for any number of reasons.  Most commonly it is because of a recent infection (like a cold virus).  The subtypes of white blood cells can be more helpful in determining why the WBC count is high.  Your hematocrit (HCT) may be very slightly low.  This can happen for several reasons also.  A recent viral infection can slow the bone marrow down a bit and cause the Hematocrit (an indirect measure of the number of red blood cells) to drop a bit.  Your hemoglobin (Hgt) is not low (by most physicians standards) so I suspect that if you were to recheck your CBC your hematocrit would now be normal.  Your sodium (Na), potassium (K), BUN, creatinine (Cr), and platelets are all normal.  Overall, I am not concerned at all about your labs.  I'm not really sure they give any help as to what is the cause of your symptoms.  Your symptoms may be due to a viral infection or possibly a fungal infection such as valley fever or histoplasmosis.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 15 months old, 3 months ago he had a Fever and I took him to the doctors. She noticed he had \"lots and lots\" of swollen glands and said it was just a virus and sent us home. He also had what she called a \"rash\" on his leg. We came back a month later and he still had had swollen glands and the\"rash\" which she took a closer look at and it was ringworm and is still currently being treated with cream. Anyway she once again told me that it was a virus and his glands would go back to normal. (He also got pink eye, that was gone before the first CBC was done but after the glands were swollen.)I came back a week later because his glands didn't go down at all and it had been 2 months. She did a CBC everything was normal except for his wbc which was 19, 000. She put him on augmentin and said it must be a bacterial infection. A week later we did an ultrasound on his glands which some were almost 2 cm, there are quite a few on both sides also did another CBC w/ diff this time. Once again everything but his WBC was normal it was 15, 000 (I don't know what white blood count was high). She sent us to children's hospital to see a hematologist 2 days later and they did another white blood count and a blood smear. His WBC was 16, 700 and the blood smear showed some type of virus. The hematologist didn't find any swelling of the belly and no swollen glands by the collar bone but he did find them under the armpit. It's almost been a month since the last appointment and 3 months since this all started and his glands are still swollen, they haven't found what virus it was. He was neg for Mono and CMV. This whole time my son hasn't acted like anything was wrong except when he was getting that Fever 3 months ago and another small Fever on and off 2 months ago each only last 2-3 days. He has no symptoms what so ever except for bags under his eyes he has no weight lose, he eats well, no night sweats or fevers. What else could it be? I'm soo afriad that it is cancer since it runs sooo strong in my family. My cousin died of cancer when he was 21, my sister had cervical cancer at 16 my uncle had a brain tumor and lots of aunts, uncles and 2nd and 3rd cousins also have some type of cancers. My doc. said she was worried because this high white blood cell that was high is the one that is usually high in cancer, my hematologist said it is also the one that is high in viral infections(once again I do not know what one it is) and he says there is no reason to suspect cancer yet... but what could be making his glands swollen and his wbc so high for this long??? A week before this all started he got his 12 months vaccinations (Hib), Hep B, measles mumps, and rubella, chicken pox and pneumoccal conjugate.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Smule1985,  I hope you are able to see this post.  There was a computer error while I was trying to remove the duplicate post from our system and it erased both your posts.  There are a few conditions that may be causing the persistent lymph nodes.  If a diagnosis is not able to be made it may be helpful to biopsy one of the nodes.  This will allow the pathologist to examine the tissue under the microscope and be sure there are no cancer cells (putting everyone's mind at ease), do some cultures for specific bacteria/viruses and look for any other clues.  An infection from a bug called bartonella (cat scratch disease) can cause persistent lymph node swelling (although it usually is not all over the body).  Also, when mono was tested for, if the \"monospot\" test was used this test is not reliable in a child your son's age. Instead EBV titers must be done.  Ebstein Barr Virus (the cause of mono) can cause these symptoms.   It may also be worth testing for infections such as coccidiomycosis (valley fever) or histoblastosis depending on where you live.  These are fungal infections that can cause persistent lymph node swelling.  If no cause can be found, seeing an infectious disease doctor and possibly an immunologist may be helpful in guiding further work up.  Best wishes.  Sorry again about the computer problem.\n\n",

He believes that the lymph nodes have gone down a little which i'm not so sure, they seem the same to me but im not a doctor! They don't want to do a biopsy on his lymph nodes, its to much for a little guy and he still thinks that it is just a virus since he is not acting sick. They did another CBC today and his wbc went down to 10,300 thank god! i am sooo relieved, he said that in the blood smear all the cells were normal and there were alot of active lymphocyte cells?? i think im not exactly sure but i think thats what he said, and i have no idea what that means. All the other tests were in the normal range also. They never did find out what virus it was and i believe they are not going to keep trying to test it. He told me he must have had a viral infection and now its gone and he is getting better. We still have to go back in a month and retest him.\n\n",

I am experiencing gynaecology problems at moment with constant bleeding past 2 months most of time slight but occasionally very heavy. Am undergong tests soon for this.  I had a full blood count and iron store test in case the bleeding was making me anaemic but was surprised to get a result  of hb level of 15.1 with 12-15 being normal plus slightly elevated red blood cell count only by 1.0.  My iron store was normal.  I asked for a blood clotting test and again slightly odd result but only slight. INR was 0.98 when normal is 1.0.-1.1 . My fibrothingy was elevated by 0.3 and the other test in the group sorry can't remember waht is was was again elevated by 0.2.  I had a ultrasound scan of spleen to check not enlarged and it was perfectly normal.  I am worried that I have a tendency to blood clotting with these results although have been told the results are so slightly abnormal to not be problem.  I also can't understand how I can bleed as I am and have such a high/good hb level????\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Countrygirl,  All your lab values are within the range of normal.  Even though they are technically outside the established \"normal\" ranges by the lab, they are all so close that just the amount of variation in the testing could cause these numbers.  I am not concerned at all by them.  Regarding your bleeding and your high-end normal hemoglobin this would indicate that your body is doing an excellent job compensating for the blood loss you are experiencing such that your body is replacing all the blood you are loosing without difficulty.  You are likely getting enough iron in your diet to compensate for the iron loss.  I would recommend you be tested for a bleeding disorder called Von Willebrand's disease.  This is the most common bleeding disorder that presents with mucosal bleeding.  It most commonly presents in women as heavy or prolonged menstrual bleeding.  It can be tested for by a simple blood test.  I do not believe you are at any increased risk of clotting based on these lab results.  Again, they are all essentially normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Gordon1x2,  The AST is an enzyme that is released when liver cells break down (as is ALT although ALT can come from other places as well).  When there is liver damage the AST and ALT will become elevated.  These tests are commonly called liver function tests although this name is a bit of a misnomer.  The AST and ALT do not really test function of the liver, rather they test destruction of cells.  An AST of 66 is really only very minimally elevated.  With a viral hepatitis, for example, the AST can climb into the thousands easily.  There are many possible causes of this elevation.  It may be that you had a slight cold or were a bit dehydrated causing some slightly increased turn over of your liver cells.  I would suggest it be rechecked in a few months to be sure it has improved.  Regarding your RBC's, HgB, and HCT while technically outside the normal levels it is likely that these are still normal levels for you.  They, too, are only minimally elevated.  Normal levels are determined based on a bell curve so some people will \"normally\" be outside this range.  I would not be concerned about your levels.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I had posted previously about a strange reaction I had to a supplemental product, but no one had any insight on that.  Since then & having another m/c, I insisted on coagulation tests.  My PT/INR was initially .89.  That was on 2 baby aspirin.  Then on 4 baby aspirin - 1.0.  Elevated fibrinogen, and elevated Protein S.  I know what Prot. S deficiency means.  But can't find anything on elevated.  Anyone know what all this means, and whether I need blood thinners?  Or is the range they quote only for those on anti-coagulation and do they go by prothrombin time for those not on it??  I'm still waiting to get in with a hematologist.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi WendyNY,  I'm sorry I didn't see your first posts.  When you posted the follow up it removed your original post from the unanswered list that I usually look at.  So, I'll try to address all your posts here.  First, your joint pain symptoms definitely fit a rheumatic disease.  Being HLA-B27 + makes this a bit more likely.  Unfortunately, these can be very difficult to diagnosis and it can take some time to finally figure them out.  If your joint pain all started after being infused with the Bovine serum you may certainly be experiencing a condition called serum sickness where antibodies to the foreign serum are made, bind the serum components and get deposited in the joints causing severe pain, among other symptoms.  It would seem a little unusual for this to continue to produce symptoms for an extended period of time; however, my knowledge of this syndrome is limited.  The CRP/ESR do not cause the blood to be more \"sticky\" than usual.  Having an elevated WBC/neutrophil count do tend to indicate stress or infection but they are not necessarily a marker for NK cell activity.  Some people argue the INR is not helpful for anything except monitoring warfarin medication dosing.  The INR is a ratio of the patients PT level to the Lab standardized PT so that it is consistent.  I am of the opinion that an elevated INR is another way of saying the PT is elevated so the INR can be helpful in detecting problems with difficulty clotting.  It may not necessarily be helpful for looking at hypercoagulable states (increased clotting).  Aspirin does not affect the INR.  Having so many miscarriages is definitely an indication to be evaluated for these hypercoagulation states.  These would include: Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin 20210, Lupus anticoagulant (which actually induces clotting in the body contrary to its name), and anti-phospholipid antibodies among others.  The hematologist will be able to help you determine which tests you need to have.  I hope this helps a little.  Please feel free to post follow ups.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks Dr. Lowe!  I guess because I posted a secondary question on the other thread, that's probably why it was taken off your list...  The bovine colostrum wasn't intravenous.  I took it orally.  High IGG colostrum (I cringe when I think about it).  The joint pain history is over 20 yrs.  Different locations at different times in my life.  Was tolerable till hormones from IVF.  Then it worsened.  But after the colostrum, it was night & day.  I had swelling in my fingers (not joints, but the tissue between joints).  I was thinking about some kind of reactive, infectious arthritis.  That something was hiding out, and the colostrum let the cat out of the bag, per se.    I had the whole thrombophlia panel done after that inital PT/INR.  My PT/INR's under all categories (Lupus anticoag. & anticardiolipin antibodies) were low too, don't know the significance in that except what you quoted.  Genetic testing was ok.  Protein S was elevated, as well as the neutrophils, wbc again.  They had gone back to normal along with my sed rate & crp when I had the first PT/INR tests.  So the inflammation markers are up & down.   After more reading today, I found out that according to a nurses forum, 1.0 INR is considered normal for the general population.  That maybe me feel a bit better until I read about fibrinogen.  My Fibrinogen is 488.  Range is 193-423.  I was also taking wobenzym when I found out about my PT/INR.  I've heard that breaks down fibrin/fibrinogen.  I didn't have a pleasant reaction to that (palpitations for 1 1/2 days).     My biggest worry is that I'm getting on a plane on Sept. 12th, and my appt. with hematologist is Sept. 11th.  Will I be ok without blood thinners??  They don't help fibrinogen anyway, do they?  I'm on metformin too, so I worry about lactic acidosis, and taking too much aspirin.  Thanks for all your help.  I use to be so healthy & use to be able to overcome whatever minor ailments I had naturally.  This is all too depressing sometimes. because it seems so unfixable & long term.    Wendy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  You are correct that an INR of 1.0 is considered the exact \"normal\" although a little fluctuation above or below this is normal.  Aspirin should not affect your prothrombin time (PT) at the doses you are taking.  If you are taking toxic levels of aspirin the PT may be altered some, in theory, but I am not positive this pans out in reality.  Unfortunately having an elevated protein S doesn't really counteract the tendency to clot if a hyperclotting condition is present.  Also, you mentioned that your inflammatory markers go up and down.  Fibrinogen is an acute phase reactant, meaning that inflammation will cause it to go up as well.  This may account for your elevated fibrinogen level.  Your level of elevation is not particularly concerning nor dangerous.  Your joint pain really sounds like it is a rheumatological condition.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your rheumatologist.  Unfortunately, these conditions can be extremely difficult to diagnose.  Persistance is key.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

I had two further blood test one for celiac disease and another I can't remember the name of I think it was to see if there were any bugs in my stomach?

    "content": "Hi Lady2917,  There are a few things to consider.  First, with severe reflux there can also be ulcers or gastritis which can cause some bleeding.  Bleeding leads to ongoing loss of iron as well as directly leading to low hemaglobin levels.  I would recommend that you have your stool tested for heme that would indicate bleeding into the GI tract somewhere.  If they have not been, I would also suggest that you have your iron levels tested to see if they are actually low.  It may be that your iron levels are fine but your red blood cells are being destroyed.  If they are low, you should also discuss with your doctor about the possibility of Crohn's disease (one of the inflammatory bowel disease).  With Crohn's disease the area of the intestine that absorbs iron can become inflamed blocking the iron absorption.    Having a peripheral blood smear is also helpful to look at the red cells under the microscope to see if there is any evidence of red cell destruction (such as may occur if there is an antibody attacking your red cells).  It can also reveal any red blood cell abnormalities such a spherocytosis.  These are less likely if your anemia is just now presenting.  These often present in childhood.  You may need to see a hematologist or GI specialist to help work this up.  On a slightly different note, a hemoglobin of 5 is quite low.  If you are experiencing any shortness of breath, rapid heart rates, or other ill feelings you should see your doctor to be evaluated.  If the red cells get too low, oxygen delivery is compromised.  Best wishes.  Keep us updated if you don't mind.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Squeaky,  RBC count, Hemoglobin (hgb) and hematocrit (hct) are all essentially measures of the same thing-the amount of red blood cells in the blood.  There are several reasons your numbers may be increased.  Polycythemia is one reason but cases of pathological polycythemia are rare.  Other possible causes would be being dehydrated, being at lower oxygen levels (such as at higher altitude), or having a lung problem where less oxygen is able to get into the blood stream.  I would recommend you have your level tested again in the next few weeks to see if they have returned to normal.  If you are having any lung problems I would suggest you discuss this with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The results came back with 1.8 total bilirubin, which she said was just above normal.  She attributed this to \"Gilbert's Syndrome.\"  The doctor said my CBC was completely normal, but when I inspected the results myself later, I noticed that my WBC count was at 4,100, when the norm is 4,500.  Should I be concerned about this?  The WBC differential showed all individual WBCs within normal ranges:  Neutrophil 65.6% Lymphocyte 24.8%  Is there any cause for concern here?  Is there a possible connection between Gilbert's Syndrome and low WBC?  Thank you very much for your advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ralphmcgee,  To my knowledge there is no connection between Gilbert's syndrome and the WBC count.  Gilbert's is a condition where the liver doesn't process bilirubin as fast as a \"normal\" liver.  It causes the bilirubin level to be increased slightly and is generally harmless and incidental.  Your WBC count is really very minimally below the \"normal\" level.  I suspect this is normal for you.  Normal values are based on a bell curve so there is a small number of people that will still be normal and be below this \"normal\" cutoff.  If you aren't having any symptoms concerning for a low WBC count I would not be worried about it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a full blood count done today because I have a gynaecology problem which has resulted in my having bleeding for 5 weeks varying from slight to heavy on average heavy every three days. I am 46 yrs old and see a gynaecologist in two weeks.  In the past I have always been told that I have very good full blood count results with my red count being between 14 and 15. I was told normal is between 12 and 16 ( UK).  As I had been bleeding for 5 weeks I was assuming I must be getting anaemic but have just had a message from my Dr's surgery to say that my result was very good at 15.3.  I don't understand how you can bleed for 25 days and not get anaemic.  My husband has suggested that I maybe am very very good at converting iron in food for my bodies use but could there be a sinister reason for my red blood count being very good at this time??  I have never had an abnormal full blood count.  I do tend to bleed alot after a blood test and have to press hard for at least 5 mins but my ESR was tests three weeks ago and was normal.  I am worried that I have an underlying blood disorder that is only been kept in check because I am female and bleeding????\n\n",

Considering we can donate blood every couple of months and safely give approximately 500 ml (1 pint) without consequence, it makes sense that it would take a prolonged bleeding to put you into any kind of risk.  Yes, you do continue to convert and make more iron for your blood. This is the reason we can regularly donate.    Be sure you do not get dehydrated because your body does need fluid to make blood.  And of course you want to continue to be evaluated if this continues.  It is not unusual in the perimenopausal period for periods to be irregular like this.\n\n",

I was given 500ml of Iron infusion weekly B12 shots and folic acid tabs for one month, then my counts were monitored. They came as below:  Date              HB ;  WBC  ; Platelets May 1stweek -  8.5  ;4.7  ; 34000 May 2nd week - 8.9  ;4.7   ;35000 May 3rd week -  8.9  ;4.7  ; 32000 May 4th week - 9.2  ;4.7   ;33000  June 1st week -  9.5  ;4.7  ; 32000 June 3rd week - 9.9 ; 4.7  ; 30000 Then on july 2nd they did my bone marrow as all the blood test they  sent  out came back negative. And my counts from july 2nd:  Date         HB  ; WBC  ; Platelets july 2nd -      9.9 ; 4.7   ;32000 july 9th -       8.9  ;4.7   ;28000 july 12th -     9.3  ;5.8   ;27000 july 16th -     9.3  ;4.7   ;30000 july 23rd -     9.4  ;5.8   ;30000 All my bone marrow tests including chromosome tests came back negative but with one finding that there are no megakaryocytes in my marrow. My  oncologist is unable to findout what is the reason behind that and he wants to refer me to jhon hopkins in Maryland US. But before doing that he wants me to wait for 3 more weeks, but am already feeling pains in my muscles in hands and legs and slowly am finding small red spots on my skin. Am worried what to do. Please explain me, what is happening with me and what should i do now!?   And I recently discovered my previous blood reports like on year 98 and 2005.

    "content": "Hi Sunspin,  Based on your previously higher platelet level you do not have congential absence of megakaryocytes (the cells that produce platelets).  There is a very rare entity known as aquired megakaryocyte aplasia.  I think this is less likely to be the case, though, because your red cells seem to be affected also.    There is another, also rare, condition known as Evan's syndrome where antibodies attack the red cells and the platelets.  I am not certain that the megakaryocytes are destroyed in this condition.  I do not believe that they are.  It appears that you had some response to the iron infusions so your low RBC's may, at least in part, be due to iron deficiency.  The red dots you are seeing are likely petechiae.  These represent small areas of bleeding in the capillaries that occurs when platelets are low.  In themselves they are harmless.  They generally are the tip off that the platelets are low.  I would agree that you should pursue further work up and being seen at John's Hopkins is a good choice.  If your hematologist feels you should wait 3 weeks I would recommend you do so.  If you are concerned you should talk with your hematologist.  You may be able to get some more information that will make you feel better, or you may both decide to refer you sooner.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Momtomonsters,  It may be that your daughter is having recurrent viral infections (that can cause fevers, joint pain and rashes).  This is very common for children and can cause a drop in the WBC count.  I am a little suspicious of one other thing.  Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (formerly called juvenile rheumatoid arthritis) can present with fevers, a rash and joint pain.  The ANA and rheumatoid factor are generally negative with this disease.  The fevers generally come in the afternoon and can make the child feel quite bad, then when the fever is gone the child is well appearing again.  To make a formal diagnosis, there needs to be at least six weeks of joint inflammation.  A newer lab study that seems to be helpful in diagnosing JIA is called anti-cyclic citrullinated peptide antibodies.  If her joint pain and fevers continue I would recommend she see a pediatric rheumatologist if possible.  (They are a little few in number so there may not be one around if you are in a smaller area.  In this case, there may be an adult rheumatologist that is familiar with pediatric rheumatology that can help.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mag75,  Your lymphocyte levels are low but not critically low.  Given that it has been going on for 5 years, I strongly doubt any cancer cause.  Cortisol does cause a shift in WBC's towards neutrophils and away from lymphocytes so if you were very nervous it is possible that this contributed some.  I suspect that your doctor is correct about you just having slightly lower lymphocytes than the general population.  If you are not developing recurrent severe viral infections or other infections I would say your immune system is working just like it should.  Recurrent or rare infections is generally the first sign of an immune problem.  It is probably still a good idea to have a CBC done periodically (say every 6 months or so) just to be sure nothing new is developing but I strongly doubt anything will.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Araya06,  I am suspecting that your ENT doctor wants to do surgery to remove the polyp.  Depending on the size of the polyp or the lingular tonsil these could give you a full sensation in the throat.  Your WBC count may or, more likely, may not be related to your throat issue.  Your WBC's are really only slightly low.  If this is the first time they were low I would recommend that you repeat the test in 3-4 weeks to see if they have resolved.  Even though they are techically outside the normal range, your neutrophils and lymphocytes really are still within the normal range.  The MCV must be in a different set of units than I am used to  since normal for me is usually 70-90.  I suspect that both the MCV and MCH are only slightly off as well.  I would recommend you have your thyroid levels tested if you have not had this done.  Hyperthyroidism can cause weight loss.  If you are having any GI type symptoms I would recommend you see a gastroenterologist for an evaluation given your weight loss.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  25 year old male / thalassemia minima & chronic fatigue syndrome due to prior EBV infection.  Originally went in to my PCP back in May for a routine checkup and they found a low platelet count from my CBC.  After a battery of tests, the hematologist diagnosed me with the thalassemia minima (rare considering I'm caucasian) and the CFS from the Epstein-Barr.  The routine follow-ups have shown that my platelets continue to drop, but not rapidly, yet all other counts are normal.  Initial count of 132, second count of 129 a month later, and most recently I'm at 126.    The hematologist suggested that I get a bone marrow examination (aspiration + biopsy) and an ultrasound of the abdomen to see if my spleen is enlarged.    What is bothering me is that before my last CBC I had been taking EES before & after a wisdom tooth extraction.  Would this contribute to a drop in platelets?  Also, since I've been diagnosed with CFS from the EBV, would that cause my platelets to flucuate?    I'm extremely nervous about the bone marrow examination and thinking that it may be a little premature, since all of my other counts are normal.  I can understand the ultrasound, because of the possibility of an elarged spleen (which is not palapable).    Can anyone offer any advice/suggestions?  Does this seem normal?  Should I get a 2nd opinion?  Thanks, M\n\n",

Really, there is no difference between 130, 129 and 126.  Given the small amount of lab I would interpret this as your platelet count being unchanged.  However, your counts really aren't normal.  I think a work up is appropriate.  The EES is generally not reported to cause low platelets.  You may want to first start with the ultrasound before the bone marrow biopsy.  If the ultrasound shows an enlarged spleen, the biopsy may not be necessary.  It is less likely but you may also want to be tested for auto-platelet antibodies (antibodies that attack the platelets).  Continued follow up with your hematologist is important.  If you have any other cell lines that are not normal (anemia or low white blood cells) I would most definitely recommend doing the bone marrow biopsy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am in the middle of my 5th miscarriage, and believe some of this may relate to my repeated m/c history.  I've already been to a rheum. & infect. disease spec. & have gotten nowhere:  20 year history of joint pain Knees & hip in 20s Hip in 30s, hands late 30s Now 41 - concentrated in hands/wrists Been through multiple IVF's 3rd IVF used steriods joint pain worsened but not every day After 4th IVF used a bovine colostrum supplement (immunoglobulins) Severe joint pain every day for the past year since Finger swelling (tissue between 2 joints) Fluish for 2 mos./couldn't get out of bed for 2 wks. Muscle aches Burning pain sometimes radiates up mid lower arms  Tested neg. over & over for RA.  Neg. ANA (repeated 3x)  Sed rate keeps going up, even when symptoms sometimes improve.  Now at 60 mm (range <26) - taken pre-pregnancy  CRP high (4x acceptable level) though went down a bit last test  WBC has been slightly elevated past month on 2 lab tests  Neutrophils elevated  Only other thing that came up is I am positive for HLA-B27  I've got myself convinced I had some kind of reaction to the colostrum that brought some kind of pathogen out of hiding that has been causing my arthritis symptoms all along.  Because after taking that things became amplified 10x.  Rheumatologist doesn't know what's wrong.  Thinks reaction to colostrum.  All supplements that are suppose to help with inflammation I now have some kind of reaction to & they make things worse (fish oil, flax, seeds, nuts, etc).  And even when I avoid, doesn't stop the joint pain.  Oddly, during my pregnancy, my joint pain went away.  Now that my hcg is relatively down, the joint pain has returned.  I'm at my wits end.  I tried to convince rheum. to give me antibiotics to see if that helps.  No one is on board, as I can see that most drs are reluctant to connect arthritis with bacteria.  I posted this under the hematologist board, hoping that I would find someone more open minded.  Any thoughts???    I don't know what speciality to go to anymore.   I've lived with the intermittent joint pain for 20 years without really looking into it because it seems to be a trend with the women in my family.  But now that it has worsened, I can't ignore it.  And can't help thinking it may be causing my m/c's.  I think I've done every test with the rheum. & she said she doesn't have a thing more she can test me for.  Thanks!\n\n",

On last check in April, my calcium was 9.8.  I have had every test under the sun.  Pulmonary function test, JAK 2 mutation test, renal ultrasound, SPEP, UPEP, 24 hr. urine calcium, PTH (for parathyroid function), chest x-ray, sleep study, and kidney function tests.  All of the tests are normal.   My PCP referred me to a hematologist, performed two phlebotomies and my hemoglobin is now 16.5 and my HCT is 50.9%.  I really have no symptoms, except for some on and off back pain.  I was concerned about bone pain and myeloma, but the SPEP and UPEP were normal and my PTH was normal as well.  Plus, myeloma presents with anemia.  The worrisome lab results are the fluctuating calcium, high HCT and at my last hematologist visit my albumin was elevated at 5.4.  I think my doctors are stumped.  I am thinking it is a parathyroid problem, even though my PTH was normal.  Do you have any ideas?  Thanks,   T\n\n",

If, by chance, you smoke or live at a high elevation you may have a higher hematocrit (HCT) as a compensation for decreased oxygen.  There are a few conditions known as polycythemias that can present with elevated HCT.  I am less familiar with them as they are fairly rare.  Your hematologist would be better able to advise you about these.  In regards to your calcium I think you may be chasing a \"false\" number.  Total blood calcium is very much related to protein levels.  If your albumin is elevated it will make your total blood calcium levels increase.  The actual number of interest with calcium is the ionized (or active) calcium.  Often, the total calcium will be low or high but the ionized calcium will be normal.  I would recommend you have your ionized calcium level checked if there is concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Both these genes are involved in the synthesis of methionine.  They affect an enzyme called methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR).  These variants have been implicated in an increased rate of spontaneous abortions and sometimes lead to an increase in homocysteine levels which can cause an increased risk of clotting.    The C677T mutation creates a thermolabile form of the enzyme MTHFR that has decreased activity for converting homocysteine to methionine.  The level of increased homocysteine with this mutation is variable and may or may not cause problems.  With both these mutations, having only a single gene with one normal copy generally only causes mild, if any problem.  When both genes are abnormal, the effects are more pronounced.  The exact significance in regards to increased risk I am not familiar with.  You may want to talk with a geneticist to discuss the implications of these findings.  I would also recommend that all of you have your homocysteine levels checked.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am trying to get an appointment with a Gene Dr and sit down with all three of our test and have him explain what that means to me.  From what I understand my sister is at a age where she will not be able to take hormones due to blood clotting issues and my daughter each time becomes pregnant and will have to take predisone to carry the baby to tearm.  She had tried invetro twice and both times she has lost the baby right away.  Your explaination helps me understand why now.  I am currently having blood vessel skin eurptions all over my body.  I am being tested for Lupus but the test  look negitive at this point.  It looks like someone has taken a fork and scraped me all over when this happens.  My skin whelps up and my blood pressure goes up.  I am waiting for a appt. with a IM but in the mean time maybe I should see a Dr that deals with Hemalology issues due to the fact of these mutated gens.  Thank you once more for you help.

    "content": "I need some help.  Back in August of 2005 I had an emergency appendectomy (the appendix did not rupture). On the day I was supposed to go home from the hospital I developed a fever and my WBC went back up, leading my Dr to think I developed what he called a  pocket infection . They started me on IV antibiotics and sent me home a few days later (I had to conitue the IV antibiotics at home for 1 week). After the IV's my WBC was still high so they had me continue on oral antibiotics and said that should clear it up. Now, almost 2 years later, I had bloodwork to check to see if i was anemic from heavy menstrual periods I was having. I am not anemic but the CBC showed a WBC of 14.3.  One week later the CBC was repeated and the WBC was 13.8.  I was referred to a hematologist who just ran bloodwork today (3 weeks after the last CBC was done) and my WBC is now 16.2.  I do not feel sick and do not have any pain.  The hematologist also told me that my neutrophils were high, it shows on the report as GRAN 10.3.  He said he believes it is because I smoke (about 1 pack a day) and dismissed it at that.  I asked about Leukemia and he said he did not see any leukemia cells on the smear. Do you think he is right? I know many other people that smoke and have had bloodwork, and they do not have a high WBC.  Can it be anything else?  This is driving me crazy!! I have another appointment with a different hematologist next week but I can't wait!  Thanks in advance for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Paradox, I am interested in knowing how long it was between the blood donations, and if you were still taking iron supplementation through your lifespan since the bout of anemia at age 7.  If you were donating say every other month for the three donations, and we know the average life span of a red blood cell is 4months (120 days), then your supply of RBCs may have been dwindling all along and you did not know.  Each unit of blood represents about 1 Gram/deciliter.  If your value dropped from 12.6 to 9.6 - that would be 3 units of blood - just about what I presume you donated.  Your body may have reached 12.6 over a long period of time, and donating may have depleted the stores faster than it could be replaced. You may wish to consider if staying on a regimen of iron supplements may be in your best interest.   A hematologist is a specialist in blood disorders. Such a clinician may be very helpful to you in determining if you have an iron deficiency anemia, or something else. It may be well worth your while to follow your doctor's recommendation to see a hematologist, That way you can be best prepared to protect yourself.\n\n",

Iron deficiency would be more likely to have a low MCV and a high RDW.  Before starting iron supplements I would recommend that you have your iron levels tested.  If you are repeatedly becoming iron deficient there may be an issue with your iron absorption or you simply are not taking enough iron in your diet to meet your needs.  Menstrual bleeding is usually a small amount of blood but can be a significant issue when iron levels are already borderline.   (Iron is largely lost through bleeding.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Petechiae are flat red spots due to ruptured small tiny blood vessels (capillaries). They are similar to rash and may be mistaken with them in some cases.   The condition is due to local or systemic causes. Systemic causes like low platelet count and blood diseases usually result in a generalized form of petechiae rather than localized lesions in certain parts of the body. Local causes include trauma.  Given the fact that you have these spots localized on the foot and following trauma (tight sandal) a local cause is more likely to be considered.   Aging is associated with weakness of the blood vessels and mild trauma can result in petechiae, ecchymosed or bruise (larger area of bleeding). This is more likely to be the cause of these petechiae and that is why your doctor was reassuring you.  Some individuals under certain medications that cause decrease in the platelet count or vasculities may be predisposed to petechiae following minor trauma. In rare cases lisinopril causes low platelet count.  In general a complete blood count and coagulation profile (coagulation time, PT&INR) are done for investigating the cause if needed.  I hope you find this answer useful. Please let me know if you have further questions.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am hoping a doctor specializing in Hemotology can offer some explanation for this.  Throughout my life my HCT/B-12 count has been very low and then its normal again.  When I was age 11 (I am now an age 57 female), my tonsilectomy was postponed because my HCT was very low in my pre-admission lab tests.  When I was 21, they wrote this off as Mono at my student health center at college (which everbody seemed to be diagnosed with in the 70s).  10 years ago, at age 47, my Gallbladdr surgery was postponed due again to low HCT showing in my pre-admission lab work-up.  Yet, on a re-test at my insistence a few days later, it was normal.  I have blood drawn a lot for glucose testing as i was diagnosed with Type II Diabetes 10 years ago and my husband has Hep C (we always use protection), so my blood is monitored a lot.  For awhile I took monthly B12 shots then stopped for a year or two due to no insurance.  Then, when I had my next few physicals, my HCT/B12 were normal.  Now they show low and I am on monthly B12 again.  Based largely on notjhing else to pin this on, my docs say it's Pernicious Anemia but that the schilling results are unreliable so they do not know fr sure.  My sister, who has MS, has also been diagnosed with pernicious anemia and takes B12 shots.  Same with my Mother before she died.    I remember my mother telling me before she died 25 years ago that she may have passed a heriditary \"something\" on to us that was found by a test where they froze her blood.  She had a lot of neurological and nerve difficulties by that point but was a very serious alcoholic.  Any theories?  Any tests I should have run?  Should I see a Hematologist?  Ever heard of HCT/B12 being low for periods then being normal foir long stretches (while B12 shots are not being taken).  Only persistent possible system:  I have battled fatigue since chioldhood, likely have Sleep Apnea and have always struggled waking up in a.m. as I never feel rested except ONCE in last 15 years, the day after I got a single heavy dose of B12.  I felt new!  If you think it PA, do you recommend a week of shots to build up the B12 then monthly shot?  I havbe only ever had the once a month shots.  Thanks for the help.  No one else seems to have an answer for this!\n\n",

B12 is usually stored up in the body in large supplies so it takes a chronic shortage in the diet to end up being low on B12.  One of the few ways to become low is to have pernicious anemia, were one cannot absorb B12 from the GI tract.  The hemoglobin can bounce around a little but if it is flucuating fast you may consider other types of anemia such as folate deficiency.  Folate deficiency produces an almost identical anemia and red cell types.  I would recommend you see a GI specialist.

DVT extended from left illiac vein.  No imaging done post discharge.  Recently went to A&E (ER) with severe left lower quadrant pain and initially diagnosed with a kidney stone.  Pain had been present for approx one week before I went to emergency admission, building gradually.  After having 3 CT scans, they diagnosed Retroperitoneal Fibrosis secondary to Left gonadal vein thrombosis, also noting that my IVC is blocked (longstanding) and I have extensive collateral veins as a result.  There is also significant calcification in both illiac veins.   3 CT scans were due to my \"internal anatomy being unrecognisable\" and they thought the first two scans had not worked properly.  Anyway, after a 3 day admission, was discharged from hospital without warfarin, but I did have 24hrs of heparin (and morphine) whilst an inpatient.  I am currently trying to follow up with a local haematologist, but am here to seek your opinion as a backup.  My questions are:  What would be your recommendation for further investigation? Im worried about further undiagnosed longstanding thrombosis, and would prefer some sort of venography to see what the actual extent is.  What are the long term risks of occluded IVC, and should I seek to have this remediated?   Would occluded IVC account for my general low exercise tolerance, and a burning in my chest on exercise particularly in cold weather?  I have been getting random dizziness (feels like floor is rising) and also mild/nigling chest discomfort.  Is this likely to be related, and should I be worried (i am) ?  Thank you in advance.  Sorry for the long post, but I really wanted to provide as much info as possible.  Thanks Mike\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike, Sounds like you absolutely need to have a good haematologist on your case.  You seem to have a long standing coagulopathy (blood clotting abnormalities), and I would be interested in the results of the coag studies that I am sure were performed first at the age of 18, and then again, I would presume on your last admission for a coag problem.  The fact that the IVC filter has occluded attests to the pervasive nature of the coagulopathic problem you are fighting. Are you polycythemic?  There are treatment modalities for that condition if it is so.  Do you have genetic anomalies?  I agree with your nearly unspoken concern about being possibly inadequately anti-coagulated, and agree that you need to have a specialist look into some form of anticoagulation.  If you have also experienced - or may be experiencing episodes of TIA (trans-ischemic attacks), it may be of value to consider asking your PMD about medications such as Aggrenox (persantine/aspirin) which has an excellent track record in preventing TIA's.  Other medications such as Plavix may also be worth consideration.  If you have insurance, please follow through as soon as possible to obtain a good haematologist. If you are currently between insurers I strongly recommend you research obtaining public assistance if possible and obtain the proper medical specialists to cover your current need.  It sounds from your post that you may have a long standing medical concern that might even make you eligible for disability. It certainly is worth looking into. Please keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mike, now I am confused. usually the term IVC is used interchangeably for IVC filter.  The IVC stands for Inferior Vena Cava, ( a major blood conduit in your body)  and quite frankly you would not be alive if your IVC was occluded. Other wise if your use of the acronym IVC refers to an Intra -Venous Catheter (a central line), and it is clooted off, then there is no reason for it to be there and it should be removed.  If the IVC stands for something else, please explain so I can best give my perspective.  In any event, it is usually not a good idea to \"clot-bust\" any lines that have been placed in the body due to the risk of causing a \"shower\" - a cascade of micro clots that can do tremendous damage to the body and wedge in toes, fingers, and the small calpillaries of every organ of the body.  Please address all these concerns to the haematologist you are planning to see this week.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Marceline  Yes, its the Inferior Vena Cava which is occluded, though I do not know which location.  To quote a abdominal CT report which I got from my family doctor:  \"Note is made of dilatation of both azygous and hemiazygous, and dilatation of the superficial veins within the left anterior wall.  These findings are all in keeping with a longstanding IVC occlusion and collateral vessels\"  During one of the (three!) CT scans I had, the tech came out and asked with a smile \"where is your IVC?\".  I was confused at first, and then asked if he meant Inferior Vena Cava to which he replied \"yes\".  They seemed quite interested in this, but nobody seemed overly concerned.   Apparently the IVC is being compensated by these collateral vessels.    Ever since my left leg DVT, there have been a large number of veins running up the front of my chest.  They run from my left groin, upto the left of my heart.  They are bigger lower down, appearing to taper off as they rise up my chest.    When I meet with the haematologist next week I am going to have a list of questions.  The fact that he did not request a follow up with me concerns my deeply (I had to chase him for a follow up exam via his secretary, but he did not request a follow up with me).  I really appreciate your input and feedback.  Thanks Mike\n\n",

If indeed your body has created strong collageral vessels, I would not suggest you consider recannulization of the native vessel.

    "content": "Dear Mike, Thanks for the continued feedback.  I am a strong beiiever in non-medicinal intervention - when possible. In your case I would like to put in a plea that you fervently consider Coumadin therapy. The risks of occlusion are very high in your case, and long term anticoagulation therapy seems definitely advisable.  Coumadin is not a very difficult drug to self manage - it requires that you understand the nature of the med, and the things that serve to augment the values as well as decrease the values. The lab test used to determine therapeutic levels for Coumadin is the PT (prothrombin time with INR - International Normalizing Ratio).  This requires a simple blood test that used to be done only in formal labs but are now frequently done in the doctor's office with a simple finger stick.  The general rule of thumb is that a dose of Coumadin taken today will be reflected in a lab value about 3 days from now. This means that your diet (which plays significantly into the leveling of your INR) has a 2 -3 day stabilization process.  Deep leafy greens and other foods contain Vitamin K (the antidote to Coumadin), but you do not need to eliminate them from your diet, you simply have to level the playing field -so to speak- so that you don't bounce your levels.  This means you cannot binge or totally eliminate the different foods from your menu planning.  You can, for instance have salad every day - if  you do so every day. Or every other day so long as your rolling intake remains fairly level. If you binge on salad one week, to the exclusion of other foods, your Coumadin level (INR) will drop and you will become vulnerable to clots.  If your diet changes because you are sick and tired of salads, and you eliminate them completely, you are at risk of your level rising to the point you could develop a bleed. So, keeping your intake somewhat steady over the weeks span, should allow you to live a normal life - food wise.   I would suggest that the pay off of having to be watchful of your intake is well worth the risk of throwing a clot to the brain and ending up with a stroke.  The manufacturer of Coumadin has free literature that may help you with your decision making. Please keep us posted.\n\n",

One would be obstruction of the outflow tract by stones as you have mentioned.  This would generally present with pain.  Given some evidence of mild anemia I would be a little suspicious that there is something breaking down your red cells some.  Hemoglobin is converted into bilirubin and increased release of hemoglobin causes increased production of bilirubin.    If the liver is having trouble processing the bilirubin it can go up as well.  Essentially all of these can be tested for with some simple blood tests.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor about this.  If the screening tests have already been done and nothing was concerning it is reasonable to just check it again in a few months.  If they haven't been done I would suggest they be done sooner rather than later to be sure nothing more serious is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But, he has had really really bad bloody noses for almost all his life. I'd say for at least 8-10 years. Im wondering what could be causeing it. Like what are the possible reasons for it. I have searched for answers but havent found any. It couldnt be any type of a tumor or cancer could it? Im just very worried. He also has thin blood. Sometimes he can fill 4 paper towels full of blodd just from one nose bleed. I really hope nothing is wrong but im really worried. It would help alot if someone has any idea of what it might be.

Using the nasal moisturizers generally will help this, but the trick is to use them enough.  Often using the gel forms seems to work a little better than the sprays.  If this is not the cause there are a few other possibilities that are a little more common than the true rarities that can cause nose bleeds.  First, the most common bleeding disorder is known as Von Willebrand's disease and commonly presents mostly with nosebleeds in men.  It still isn't very common but can be tested for by a simple blood test.  Also, nasal polyps can present with recurrent bleeding.  It seems less likely if the bleeding has been happening for 10 years.  A thorough physical exam by his doctor can help look for these.  If there is suspicion, a CT scan can be done.

    "content": "Most of these values are very minimally abnormal.  Your hemoglobin and ferritin levels are slightly low, probably indicating that you are a little iron deficient.  Taking a multivitamin with iron can help this.  The CRP is a measure of inflammation. Normal levels vary from lab to lab but most doctors consider levels <1 normal.  TTG stands for tissue transglutaminase and is a test that is used to help diagnose celiac disease.  Again, normal levels vary based on the lab but this level does not generally indicate a significant presence of this antibody.  If it is present it indicates an increased likelihood of celiac disease.  I am not familiar with the IAG test so I cannot comment about it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Current medications are Commit lozenges (4mg) as a smoking cessation aide.  I went in to my PCP for a routine checkup and the blood panel came back with low hemoglobin/low plateletes.  The Dr. stated that I was \"mildly anemic with low platelets\".  I work in a blood bank, and had someone look at my results and they noted that the Bilirubin count from my metabolic panel was unusually high, and that the tests indiciated that my RBCs are \"small\".    Other than that, nothing else was abnormal.  I would consider myself healthy - 6'0\" / 165lbs, low cholesterol/eat healthily.  The Dr. referred me to a Hematologist, and I go in on Monday next week.  I'm slightly concerned about the low platelets (132 on a beginning range of 140) and the anemia.  I can't remember the Bilirubin count, but it was at the max in the range (200 something).  Does anyone have any thoughts?  What can I expect at the Hematologist?    Thanks, M\n\n",

Regarding your anemia, your HCT (hematocrit) and HgB (hemoglobin) are really the best indicators of anemia.  Your hematocrit is borderline low.  I do not think there is anything serious going on.  I do notice, though, that your MCV (a measure of red cell size) is on the upper limits of normal.  Sometimes folic acid (or folate) deficiency can lead to an elevated MCV with anemia.  You may want to take a multivitamin with folate in it daily to be sure that this is not an issue.    I would recommend that you have your CBC repeated in 6 months or so just to check up on it.

This, in itself, does not mean that you are unresponsive to the tetanus shot.  To truly determine this, your antibody levels must be low then you should receive a booster dose of the tetanus vaccine.  2 weeks later, your antibody levels should be tested again.  The tetanus antibody levels normally fall in the body producing the need for boosters.  I'm not sure I would recommend that you not get anymore tetanus vaccines at this point.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He said everything else was came back normal.  I had a second blood test for ferritin, b12 and folic acid.  My doctor says everything came back normal except I am slightly high on total serum protein (8.3?).  (He says they like to see a 7.5).  According to my studies on the internet, both percentages fall within the normal perameters.  He also had me do a urine test (the one with checking under micoscope?).....it came back with no protein (completely clean is what I was told) in the urine. My question is he wants me to see a hematologist for the slightly low iron and the slightly elevated protein serum.  I am so scared, so much that I have been having trouble eating and sleeping since I found out that a hemotologist is a cancer specialist.  This has also triggered panic attacks.  I contacted my doctor, and he assures me I shouldn't worry about having any cancer, that he just refered me to the hematologist for the anemia.  He prescribed Xanax for the panic attacks.  I have no family history of any type of cancers, that I know of.   P.S.  I have been taking an 81 mg aspirin daily for heart attack/stroke prevention and I do not eat alot of foods that has iron  (I don't eat much of a breakfast or lunch but I do eat red meat for dinner).  I drink alot of milk, but I drink 2%, which has 0% iron.  Could this be a cause of my blood numbers?\n\n",

While you are correct that hematologists generally are oncologists (cancer specialists) as well, they do see people with blood disorders that do not have cancer.

I recently had some blood tests done. my doctor said something showed that i had a chronic infection or illness of some kind. everything else was normal but I still haven't gotten my results for my lupus tests. So what in my blood would show that? I haven't felt sick. I've just been in alot of pain and been very tired and restless. But all I would like to know is what in your blood shows a chronic infection?\n\n",

Determining whether this is due to infection or some other cause of inflammation (such as a rheumatoid process or other disease like inflammatory bowel disease).  A few of these markers are C-reactive protein (CRP), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), platelet count and ferritin.  All these can become elevated with chronic (or sometimes acute) inflammation.  Without seeing your labs I can't give you a more specific answer.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am 28 years old.  I started iron infusions and my hemoglobin was at a 4.5.  I received 13 (125 mg each infusion) total at that time and the highest my hemoglobin reached was 7.  My doctor told me at that time that it if it was truly an iron definiciency condition that many infusions should take care of the problem.  However after 2 weeks without any infusions I began to feel very fatigued again and had my hemoglobin checked at my family doctors office and it was 6.8 then four days later at my hematologist office it was 5.2.  He tested my urine for hemoglobin and iron due to the fact that I have been a distance \"runner\" for many years however all of those tests have come back negative.  He decided to have me take 10 more iron infusions.  I am wondering if there are other conditions that might be masked by iron deficiency or some other things that we should be considering.  My doctor seems to not know what to check for at this point?  Thank you for any help that you can offer to me.\n\n",

Do you have the rest of your CBC results (especially the MCV and RDW)?  This would help limit the possibilities.

One is that your bone marrow is working hard to replenish your RBC's and sending out young red blood cells that typically are bigger.  Another possibility is that you have two different sized RBC's due to a hemaglobinopathy trait or other red cell condition.  A peripheral smear and a reticulocyte count may also help.  Your MCV is a little low suggesting the possibility of an iron deficiency anemia but there are other things that can do this as well.  Your hematologist should be able to guide you to the next needed test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Elsa Lynn, Sometimes the concerns we have are seated in somewhat basic situations:  At 28 years of age, is is entirely possible that your mildly low Hgb may be due to heavy menses.   You did not mention if you happen to be having heavy periods.  It may be of value to check your Hgb just before your next period if this is so, and then check it after your cycle is finished.  This will let your physician know how much blood loss you are having.  Has your tested level ever been much higher than 11.2?   12.0 - 15.2 is a typical normal range for Hgb in females.\n\n",

It sounds as if the vein has become blocked off for some reason.  This may have initially been (or still is) a small clot in the vein or possibly a valve in the vein that has been damaged by some trauma causing it to be obstructive.  This would cause a back pressure on the vein and result in enlargement.  I would recommend that he be seen by his doctor.  There are often several treatments that can be tried.

I have also developed a sensitivity to alcohol, which causes flushing and discomfort at the base of my neck and sometimes in the groin.I am a 29 yo female.   CBC came back normal except MCH was high at 33pg and RBC was low-normal at 4.33. ANA is negative as is rheumatoid factor. Bleeding times were normal. The results of the other battery of tests are as follows (in mg/dL): Albumin 4299 Transferrin 233  Prealbumin 27  CRP <0.32 Orosomucoid 54 Alpha-1 antitrypsin 179 Haptoglobin 38 Complement C3 89 Complement C4 21 Alpha-2 macroglobulin 250 Immuno-G 250 Immuno-A 862 Immuno-M 106 ApolipoproteinB 69 ApolipoproteinA-I 194 Total Protein 6.8 g/dL Mole Fraction 903 Iron 105 ug/dL  % Transferrin Saturation 44%  Lab comments: \"lab evidence of slight non-complement dependent in vivo hemolysis as indicated by relatively low haptoglobin level. Modest polyclonal elevation of IgA suggests mucosal immune response.\" My doctor explained to me that the test results suggest that by RBCs are being destroyed prematurely, yet the other tests say I'm not anemic, so my body's keeping up.  The other strange thing is that my GP told me there was evidence of \"organic alcohol compounds\" in my blood. I don't seem to have the lab report that confirms this, so I don't know anything else about that except that my GP said that it might  suggest a liver problem processing alcohol.  She's referring me to a hematologist, but I honestly don't know what she suspects or even what questions to ask the hema. when I go. Can you perhaps give me a starting point re: possible diagnoses, questions to ask, etc.?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

If you have been taking a multivitiamin with iron it may be that you are not absorbing it well.    Before increasing your iron intake too much I would recommend you talk with your doctor aboutt having some tests done to directly measure your iron levels (iron level and total iron binding capacity).  There are a few other causes of a low MCV that will not be corrected by iron.  Your WBC count is normal.  The increased amounts of lymphocytes and monocytes likely indicates that you had recently been exposed to a virus and your body was fighting it off.  This is nothing to be concerned about as they are only slightly elevated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 34 year old female who has recently received a blood test back from my Dr. with a Ferritin level of 2 (normal for this lab 10-291) and Hemoglobin of 10.9 (11.5-15).  My Dr. is recommending a colonoscopy, because he is concerned that the low levels are due to bleeding.   Background: Have always had low iron, father has low iron, I am a fish-eating vegetarian w/in normal weight range who takes a mutli-vitamin everyday and exercises 4-5 times a week. I am not fatigued, as typical with low iron, but rather would be considered high energy.  Questions: 1) Is the colonoscopy really necessary? For reasons both financial and of time concerns, I would really rather avoid this test unless absolutely necessary. 2) Couldn't the low ferritin levels be due to something blocking absorption of the iron I get? I eat a very high-fiber diet, and am on Prilosec for GERD, both of which I have read can inhibit iron absorption.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several possible causes for your condition.  The low ferritin makes low iron very likely.  Low iron, in turn, leads to low hemoglobin.  It is possible that you are low on iron from chronic blood loss but there are other possible reasons as well.  You may simply not be getting enough iron through the GI tract.  Absorption of iron can be a little finicky.  Iron absorption can be increased by taking it with vitamin C or citric acid.  If there is concern about blood loss through the GI tract, a test for hemoglobin in the stool (called a hemacult test) can be done to detect blood in the stool.  Typically this is repeated on three separate stools to help increase sensitivity.  If it is positive I would definitely recommend a colonoscopy.  Often, the source of blood loss in women is the menstrual period.  Of note, there are other indicators of iron deficiency anemia such as a low MCV and an elevated RDW.  Other deficiencies, such as folate or vitamin B12 can cause low hemoglobin, but would typically cause a high MCV.  You may consider having a bit more work up before having the colonoscopy.  Keep in mind that my recommendations are solely based on what I have been told.   I do not have your full medical chart and have not examined you.  In general, I always defer to the recommendations of your regular doctor but you may be able to discuss some of these things to get more information.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am having a bit of trouble determining which of these labs are normal and which are not as I am not familiar with these units.  From what I can see, it appears that you grandmother's kidney function is slightly decreased.  (GFR stands for glomerular filtration rate which is essentially kidney function.  Normal is above 60 ml/minute/meter squared.)  I suspect her creatinine is slightly high base on her decreased GFR.  It also appears that she may be a little anemic (Hemoglobin of 9.5, normal would be around 12-14).  This may be due to blood loss, iron deficiency or other cause.  The platelet count is increased.  This is likely in response to inflammation as a result of the stroke.  During the acute illness, many factors, including platelets, will increase.  These are termed acute phase reactants.  Ferritin is one of these compounds as well.  Her WBC count (the cells that fight infection) is slightly elevated.  This is also likely due to stress as her differential appears to reflect a shift towards newer cells.  This may also be a sign of infection but if there are no other indicators of infection it is likely due to stress on the body.  I am unable to comment any further due to my limited knowledge of these units.  My apologies for this.  The most important thing for her right now is close follow up with her doctor to ensure that the healing process is continuing appropriately.  Best wishes.  I hope your grandmother has a speedy recovery.\n\n",

    "content": "At first glance I would agree that this appears to be iron deficiency.  Your hemoglobin/hematocrit are only slightly low.  Your low MCV and high RDW support iron deficiency.  However, if you have been on iron supplementation for some time this becomes less likely.  I would recommend you have iron studies performed.  These would be measuring serum iron, total iron binding capacity and ferritin.  These three markers can help with determining if iron is, in deed, low.  It is possible that even though you have been taking the iron you have not been absorbing it well (not that likely).  Thalassemia is on my list of possibilities as well.  You can have a hemoglobin electrophoresis performed to look for the many thalassemia possibilities that exist.  The same test screens for them all.  Also, you should take a multivitamin with plenty of folic acid and vitamin B12.  Deficiency of these vitamins would typically cause a high MCV but it is a good idea to take a multivitamin to be sure that this isn't adding to what ever is the primary cause.  Keep us updated.

    "content": "I was not able to find much about this either.  From what I was able to find, Hemoglobin Hasharon is a variant of hemoglobin that is less stable than its normal counterparts.  As such, those that are carriers of this hemoglobin typically will have a mild anemia as the red blood cells containing this hemoglobin are less stable than the other cells.  Patients with carrier status have one copy of the gene for Hemoglobin Hasharon and one normal copy.  In production, the normal hemoglobin production typically out does the abnormal hemoglobin so the anemia is mild.  I was unable find information on the homozygous state.  Many of these types of mutations are not good oxygen carriers so the paitents may be dependent on blood transfusions.  I was unable to confirm any of this information regarding Hemoglobin Hasharon.  Hope this helps a little.  I'll keep looking to see if I can find more.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I got strep throat all the time occasional pneumonia and skin rashes a lot. My total WBC at that time were between 4.5-5.1 with only the neutrophil count low. I went to a hematologist and had a bone marrow biopsy done. THe results of that say: peripheral smear :neutropenia bone marrow:hypocellular bone marrow with granulocytic hypoplasia and decreased megakaryocytes  I was put on GCSF shots and had some raise in my counts. Then in 2004 I became pregnant and went off the shots. During my pregnancy my blood counts stayed in normal rannge and doctors said I didnt need to go back on my shots. Now in the last year my physician has told me my white blood count is low even though my neutrophil count is still in normal range it has been around 3.0-3.5. About 2 months ago I went into my doctor and told her about this numbness, pain, and tingling, burning  I was having in my hands elbows knees and feet. She checked my counts and they were at 3.3. She did a blood test for RA and said it was negative and my glucose levels were normal. Despite this she said she felt like I needed to go to a Rheumatologist but my appt is 2 months away. I went in this week because I am still having these different sensations and I have been getting light headed,very tired, dizzy and just generally weak.  THey called and said that I had a critically low WBC and I needed to see a hematologist again but I have not been seen by a hematologist since 2004 so I don't currently have one and have to wait for refferals to go through ect before I can even attempt to get an appt. Should I have another bone marrow biopsy done? I am very concerned about the change because it is not just my neutrophils that are low this time. it is the total WBC and the lymphocytes as well.

He is 66 yo white male, no medical hx except L anterior thalamic cva in 10/03, atrail septal defect found on TEE, plicated w/ Amplatz Occluder, tx w/ Plavix x 6 months then easa 81mg daily.  Last Sunday he had a syncopal episode, hypotensive (60/36), no pulses in extremeties, no femoral pulses by doppler on arrival to ER, but was in NSR, HR 76, SAO2=92%RA & dropping.  CT showed blood in area of heart, initially thought to be dissecting aorta or tamponade.  Life Flighted to a \"heart hospital\", became nauseated, continued hypotension, syncope & purple from nipple line to jaw with increasing JVD.  Admitted to ICU on pressor.  Next AM, BP @ 105/60, transferred to step-down, 2 days after syncopal episode became dyspenic on 4l/nc, spiral CT showed PE in artery of LLL of lung.  PVL of LE & pelvis negative.  All hematology tests negative to date, some pending.  ALL MD's (about 20!) are shaking their heads, no know cause for initial event (hypotension, etc) and no known reason/cause for peri-cardial effusion, all believe UNRELATED.  Now are pointing finger to \"hyerpcoag.\" disorders....Currently on Lovenox 80 BID & Coumadin 5mg.  After initial Comadin dose, 1st INR was 4.8, repeat was 1.2.  This is exactly what occurred with Coumadin after CVA in 10/03...one day INR was 0.8, the next 5.2-bounced around like a yo-yo....I predicted irratic INR levels (again MD's thought I was crazy until they saw #)  So, the question becomes, where are clot's coming from & is hx of irratic INR indicative of a particular clotting problem.  He is looking at life long anti-coagulation.  Previous hx of Coumadin use required DAILY venipuncture.  Had Heme. workup in hospital & are awaiting appt with Heme as otpt.  Note:  Cardiac workup i.e. EKG (R &L), enzymes, cath, TEE, tilt table all negative, all vessels, both cardiac & peripheral were WIDE OPEN with no signs of residual clot & NO narrowing.

Also, if the effusion was large enough to compromise blood flow, it is possible that the blood could have slowed enough in the atria (the top chambers of the heart) to have formed some clots in this area that could then have embolised to the lungs.  It would seem that this would have happenned sooner once his blood pressure was stabilized.  2 days later seems late to blame this cause.

    "content": "I'm hoping for some advice on causes of the following for my daughter.  She had backpain, fever since Monday.  Fever and backpain have subsided, but had a rash on stomach/back yesterday, and little raised bumps have developed randomly on hand/arm. Had reg. labwork done per dr. on Tues. - came back with wbc=1.7, platette count 90K.  Had repeat test thur. with wbc 1.6, same platlette count.  And some other issue with nucleus (I didn't understand the explanation on this).  Saw a hemotologist yest. who said it could be many things and would continue testing until we got an answer.  We have to wait 2 weeks (agonizing) to get results from more bloodwork done today and spleen u/s scheduled next week.  He did say Leukemia was \"unlikely\".  I am optomistic also, but would like to know realisticly what could be causing these odd symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "The more severe end of the spectrum would be leukemia.  This should most definitely be explored because missing this would be bad.  Once leukemia has been ruled out, the most likely cause is a viral infection that is suppressing the bone marrow.  This is a very common cause of low WBC and platelet count.  Often, only one of the cell lines is affected, but all can be effected to some degree by a viral infection.  Autoimmune diseases can cause these types of issues also but again much more commonly only one cell is effected.  For this reason I think this is quite about less likely.  Your doctor may recommend a bone marrow biopsy if the diagnosis cannot be made by other tests.  This will let your hematologist look at the area making the cells to see directly what is going on.  The procedure is relatively simple.  Without being able to examine your daughter I can't get much more specific.  I suspect, in the end, the diagnosis will be a viral infection just based on statistical odds.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Could this be G6PD Deficiency?",
    "content": "26 year old female here, generally healthy, non-smoker, occasional drinker.  Not currently on any meds, no surgery relevant to this problem.  I'm athletic person who typically plays \"tough guy\" rather than admitting something is wrong, so the fact that I'm asking... please take me seriously.  I'm asking about this because of a combination of events, and because I stumbled on this when they began testing Soldiers for this in the Army.  I work in the Command Surgeon's office, and read the information pamphlet about G6PD deficiency, and was surprised at the description of the reaction affected individuals have to Sulfa antibiotics.  I was curious, looked it up online, and had to find answers.  Reaction to sulfa antibiotic as a teenager: Not too long after I took the first dose, I felt weak and light headed.  I intended to lie down until I felt better, but it just got worse. I wasn't in \"pain\", but everything ached all over in a strange way. My stomach felt funny, almost like I'd been kicked there a while before, so that I had the residual ache. My back hurt a bit, and I hadn't done anything to it. I felt winded, like I'd just been running.  This went on for a few hours before I could finally go to sleep. I felt marginally better the next day, but I didn't feel normal for a while.  Haven't taken sulfa antibiotics since, however, I've felt similar at other points in time, never quite as bad, but for no explicable reason.  For no apparent reason, I'd find myself weak, light-headed, pains through my abdomen and lower back, and generally exhausted without being specifically sleepy, and this would last up to a few weeks at a time.  I've been feeling like this the past several weeks, and while I'm feeling a bit better now, I'm concerned.  I've been diagnosed with anemia a couple of times, but couldn't afford medical care, so I just took OTC iron supplements as I could.  It didn't always help.  I had neonatal jaundice, and it's in my records that I required treatment with a bili light.  I've had people tell me on different occasions that my hands look unusually yellow.  I looked at the list of other drugs that G6PD deficient people shouldn't touch, and I've never taken any of those, nor have I ever eaten fava beans, so I don't know if I'd react to them.  My grandmother was allergic to sulfa antibiotics, but she's dead now, and I have no further information about the nature of her allergy.  My mother and sister are not allergic.  I don't know my father's medical history, but I know he's of Jewish descent.  I know this is an X-chromosome linked trait, and that heterozygous females don't usually exhibit symptoms, but genetically, I could be homozygous.  Basically, ignoring the odds, does this sound like it could be the case?  Or is this probably something else?  Advice?  Please?  And no, I don't have medical insurance, and I can't afford a battery of tests and referrals out-of-pocket.    Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms may or may not be related to G6PD deficiency.  As you state, it is a disease much more common in men; however, it can happen in women (especially in areas with a high frequency of disease in the population).  Also, heterozygotes (those with only one abnormal gene rather than two) can have hemolytic crises if triggered properly.  Other red cell disorders can account for your periodic jaundice/anemia as well.    It is worth having G6PD evaluated for as it would nicely explain many of your symptoms.  You need to not be anemic when tested because the most common form of G6PD is a disease of older red blood cells.  Anemia induces new RBC's to be made that are not effected until they age, so the disease may be masked.  A few screening blood tests can also look for other possible causes and check your bilirubin level.  A high unconjugated bilirubin level is consistent with increased red cell break down.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for the delay.  I suspect that your enlarged spleen may actually be a symptom of an underlying illness.  There are several causes of spleen enlargement (splenomegaly).  Most commonly, viral illnesses can cause the spleen to enlarge as it helps clear the infection and antibodies.  Splenomegaly can also produce pain due to stretching of the capsule encasing the spleen (sort of like the shell of an egg).    Overall your symptoms suggest an infection with a virus such as Ebstein Barr virus or Cytomegalovirus.  EBV infection is more commonly known as mononucleosis.  These can be tested for with blood tests to help give an idea of whether or not they are at fault.  Poor circulation may or may not be associated with this.  Be sure to stay well hydrated to help circulation.    Mitral valve prolapse is extremely common in women and generally not symptomatic.  This is likely an incidental finding.  Some of the viruses that can cause these types of symptoms can continue for several weeks (particularly EBV).  If you are not overall improving I recommend that you follow up with your doctor.  You may also need some follow up blood work if you aren't getting any better, such as a repeat CBC, ESR or CRP (markers of inflammation), and possibly some rheumatic type labs (ANA for example).  Keep in mind the kidney stones as well.  They can certainly cause lots of pain (although less likely to cause your other symptoms).  Urinary tract infection with resulting kidney infection can also cause some of your symptoms.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "While EBV is most notorious for causing an enlarged spleen there are many other causes.  CMV is a member of the same family and can cause mono-like symptoms.  In most mono-like illnesses where EBV is not responsible, CMV is.  Many other viruses can cause a mildly enlarged spleen.  Really, any condition that is causing a proliferation of white blood cells can cause the spleen to expand.  EBV and CMV are probably the most notable viruses I can think of.  One note about a monospot test.  For most people it is pretty good but does have a few false negative results.  If there is significant concern, actual EBV antibody titers can be drawn which are much more sensitive and specific than the monospot test.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Platelet counts tend to go up with inflammatory states, such as infections.  This may also explain the low lympocyte count.

It is possible that your lymphocytes simply haven't had enough time to repopulate yet.  Overall, I would not be too concerned about your lab results.

There are several causes of a falling hemoglobin levels:  -Iron deficiency leading to difficulty making new red blood cells.    -Ongoing bleeding can also cause this.  If bleeding is faster than production, the hemoglobin level drops.  I would be a little concerned about this in your case.  -Aditionally, chronic illness can lead to decreased production of red blood cells.  A few tests can be helpful to sort this out.  First, I would suggest looking for any sources of bleeding, such as blood in the stool via a guaiac test.  Also, blood in the urine can be unseen but tested for with a urinalysis.  A reticulocyte count can help to determine if the bone marrow is producing new blood cells or not.  This will help narrow the causes.  Also, looking at various red cell indicators such as mean corpustular volume (MCV) can help.  If iron deficiency is possible, iron studies can be done to measure iron stores.  I would most definitely recommend that this be followed and evaluated.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  You really should ask the doctor who ordered the blood test, as the significance of such a test is always taken in relation to your clinical condition.  Depending on the context it may be a reaction to an infection or a side effect of a medicine you are taking.  An elevated white blood cell count typically reflects the normal response of bone marrow to an infectious or inflammatory process (tissue necrosis, infarction, burns, arthritis).   An increase in neutrophils is the most common cause of an elevated white blood cell count as in your case. But other subpopulations of cells (eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) can also give rise to increased leukocyte numbers.  Stress such as overexertion, seizures, anxiety, anesthesia can also lead to leukocytosis.  Drugs that cause leukocytosis include (corticosteroids, lithium, beta agonists).  Trauma such as splenectomy; hemolytic anemia; leukemoid malignancy can all lead to elevated leukocytic counts.   Occasionally, leukocytosis is the sign of a primary bone marrow abnormality in white blood cell production, maturation or death related to a leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder (acute leukemias, chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders).   The peripheral smear should always be inspected to detect blast cells (leukemia), band forms and toxic granulation.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Multiple enlarged lymph nodes in groin",
    "content": "Hello  I am a 22 y.o female who around six months ago noticed two enlarged lymph nodes in my groin on right hand side.  After numerous and numerous tests I underwent blood tests, X-Rays, Urine tests etc and all shown up as normal.  I show no other symptoms, but when I had un ultrasound done of the lymph nodes, the results found that i had actually more than the two I originally found. There is about four on my left hand side in my groin, but not as enlarged as the two on the right.   I underwent a lymph node biopsy with a fine needle three days ago. The surgeon told me that the results came out  \"unclear\" and that they arent sure if they should take one out and test for cancer or leave it a few months.  My problem is that I have had these lumps for months now and no one is giving me an answer. Does this seem like something to worry about? and should i maybe get a second opinion, I just want to put my mind at rest.  Also the lymph nodes have gotten harder over the last month - the surgeon described them as \"more prominent\" im not sure what that means? Can someone help me??\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally).  They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer.  Common causes of enlarged inguinal nodes include infections of the leg or foot, and STDs.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1  cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that inguinal  nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal If it is painful or tender this indicate infection or inflammation.   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations.  Routine blood tests include CBC, ESR, LDH, LFT they are helpful in the diagnosis. Abdomino-pelvic US is recommended. Lymph node biopsy is preferable to FNAC.  Direct clinical examination is essential.   Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

My parents were concerned about the possiblity of anemia, since I matched some of the symptoms (constant fatigue, rapid heartbeat, breathlessness, pale complexion).  When I got the results today, however, I found out that my neutrophils and lymphocytes were abnormal. My neutrophil count is at 32.8% (low, according to the results), and my lymphocytes are at 56.6%. The rest of the report read:  WBC 5.9 th/uL RBC 4.84 mil/uL Neutrophils 32.8% (LOW) Lymphocytes 56.6% (HIGH)  The only other thing that came out \"abnormal\" was my phosphorus level.  Phosphorus 5.0 mg/dL (HIGH)  Quite frankly, I don't know what to make of these results. Does this mean anything? And what could be the cause of it...?  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Your WBC count of 5.9 is considered normal.  The neutrophil percentage of 32.8 is only very mildly low.  Your lymphocyte percentage is actually normal for your age.    Lymphocytes are a type of WBC that help fight off infections such as viruses.  Neutrophils tend to help more with bacterial infections.  It is quite possible that you recently were fighting off a virus (even if you didn't actually get sick-in which case your immune system did its job well).    Your phosphorus level is also only mildly high and is not alarming.   All in all, I would say that you can rest easy about your labs.  Nothing strikes me as concerning.  Also, it is possible that your fatigue, breathlessness, etc. may be realted to a viral infection that was causing the shift in your WBC types more towards lymphocytes.  Anemia is a good thought also.  I am presuming, though, that your hemoglobin levels were normal.  Anemia is quite common in young girls.  I generally recommend that all girls who have started their menses take a multivitamin with iron supplement to ensure that there is enough iron for the body to make new red blood cells to replace the ones being lost monthly.  Hope this helps.  Let us know if you have any other questions.\n\n",

I had a leukapheresis done last August and my WBC was 3.95 THOU/uL, Lymphocytes 1.38 THOU/uL  (I was donating WBCs).  I was scheduled for another leukapheresis donation today and I had an even lower WBC of 3.67, and my Lymphocytes were 0.88 THOU/uL.  Everything else was within normal range both times.  Is this a trend I should be worried about and have checked out?  I have had an on and off persistent cough, but have not been significantly sick at all.  How can I increase my WBC count, as I have read that a low count can increase my chance for infections.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Low iron, enlarged Lymph nodes",
    "content": "Hello. I am a 21 year old female with 2 children ( 4 and 17 months) .  i was diagnosed with low iron about 4 months ago.. my levels we 3.2.  My heamaglobin was 114 (i think).  I did not respond to iron tablets and have now started on a course of weekly ferrum injections over a month. I have also had enlarged lymph nodes in my neck and now they are also under my arm and in my groin.   My Dr has told me to wait until my last iron injection which is about a weekaway and then he would retest my iron levels sometime after that. I am just panicking now becuase i don't feel any better. I am still excessivley tired and feel weak. And i don't like having to wait so long to know what is worng but my dr said not to see him until the course of irons shots.   i have also noticed that i am bruising quite easily and the bruises are taking a long time to go away.  What i am wondering is if i should seek more medical adviice sooner or if i am just over reacting and worrying about nothing? Does this sound like something concerning or is it fairly normal?  My past surgeies include 2 D&Cs and I had my right ovary removed 2 years ago due to a cyst and ovarian torsion.  There is a history of some cancer in my family. My aunt had breast cancer, my mothers dad had non hodgkins lymphoma and also later in life bowel cancer, and two of my aunts died of brain tumours.  I am currently taking Zoloft for anxiety/deression and occasionaly taking temazepam for sleeping.   Any advice would be greatly appreicated. Thankyou  Robyn\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you can provide us more details about the results of the blood tests requested by your doctor.  If you have not performed  tests for bleeding tendency then you better do them. These  include: - CBC (platelets) surely it is done before. -PT, PC -Clotting time and bleeding time. This is to see if you have really a bleeding tendency (which may explain why you bruise easily).  Regarding being tired exhausted, of course anemia will cause that, but if I understand well you have a 4 month child and may be lactating. This is alone can causes symptoms similar to your yours and having anemia will aggravate your condition.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 43 y/o female with a previous history of thyroid cancer (1995 and \"all clear\" now).  I don't smoke or drink.  I have GERD and have been taking Prilosec since 1998.  I am 5'7\" and 145 lbs.  Last year, while visiting a dermatologist for a rash, I was tested for Lupus (negative).  Incidentally, it was found that I had some form of anemia as my Hb, Hct, and RBCs were just below the normal ranges.  Two months later, I followed up with my endocrinologist and it was discovered that I still had mild anemia but it was stable.  I then took everything to my PCP (and started iron supplementation).  After 6 weeks of iron supplementation, the anemia resoloved itself; however my ferritin level is at 5.  I also had a fecal occult stool test that was negative; however, I am following up with my GI specialist to rule out colon issues.  Celiact tests were negative.  This brings me to my last round of tests.  My doctor did not even mention to me and I did not discover it until I picked up the lab reports to take to my GI doctor.  My WBC was slightly elevated at 11.0 (range is 4.0-10.5)  My neutrophils were at 84 (normal is 40-74) Absolute neutrophils were 9.3 (normal is 1.8-7.8) Lymphs were low at 11 (normal 14-46).  At the time of the test, I did not have any infection that I am aware of that would elevate my WBC.  My concern is my neutrophils--they have been consistently elevated for almost two years.  As for the lymphs -- this is the first time I've ever gotten a low reading.    I am starting to become more concerned by this and am wondering what it could indicate.  My \"internet\" research suggests there might be some imflammatory process going on (such as lupus) however I am supposedly negative for that.  Can you tell me what high neutrophils/low lymphs might represent?   Thank you.\n\n",

A test on urine to determine sodium level is another diagnostic that can be done. I would very strongly advise against you continuing this type of practice during a panic attack. Overconsumption of water which washes out sodium (a critical electrolyte in the body) can not only cause essentially a short circuit in the brain resulting in seizures, confusion/psychosis, and DEATH. I would also encourage you to seek professional care for ways in dealing with your panic attacks that doesn't cause yourself harm. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Typically the machine that runs the test on the blood is able to separate the serum and measure the sodium level from this.  Serum essentially refers to the blood minus the cells.  If the machines are set up to give a sodium level, it is the serum sodium level they are reporting.    The time frame you report is adequate to ensure that there are no problems with your sodium.  However, as Theresa pointed out, drinking large amounts of water can be dangerous if done rapidly.  Regarding your Chiari malformation, many people have Chiari malformations and don't know it.  It tends to be assymptomatic, with the exception of some having headaches.  Occasionally there can be more significant symptoms.  Chiari malformation would not affect water crossing into the brain and would not have an effect on producing water intoxication.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

So, if my levels were still normal yesterday at 6 then there should be no problem, right? Or should I still be worried? It's been 48 hours now since the incident.    Was the first blood draw (3 hours after) enough to determine if there were any problems or was I right to have it drawn again yesterday afternoon? My husband felt this was excessive and unnecessary.    Exactly how fluid is too much and in what amount of time? I drank a very very large amount and in under an hour not to mention everything else I had that day.  Ths is the first time I've ever responded to thirst/stress with drinking so much though and don't plan to do so again. If I had known about the dangers, I obviously would not have done. Also, didn't realize how much I had drank until it was over.\n\n",

    "content": "At 48 hours out, you are very unlikely to have any problems.  By this point, you will have excreted the excess water and your body will have adapted appropriately.  There is no need to do further lab testing now-presuming that there are no more excess water intake episodes.  Regarding the need to retest earlier, 3 hours is probably enough time to begin to see effects but if there is concern, a repeat level 6-8 hours later is very reasonable.  In regards to how much is too much, each person has a different level.  For some, drinking a half gallon at once can be devastating, others may need closer to a gallon.  Unfortunately, one cannot be sure until you've reached your level.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The diagnosis of anemia is primarily made by the finding of low the hemoglobin level (in grams per deciliter), RBC number, and the hematocrit (in percent).  Normal Hb level in women:12\u201316 g/dL or 7.4\u20139.9 mmol/L. Thus by definition you are not anemic.  Ferritin is iron binding protein and represents iron stored in the body Ferritin is found in the liver,  spleen, skeletal muscles, bone marrow and at low level in the blood.   Normal ferittin level in Female: 12-150 ng/ml Low ferritin level are commonly seen in:  Condition of chronic blood loss such as: Irregular menstrual bleeding. Inadequate iron intake. GI bleeding from ulcers, colon polyps, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.   In  non anemic iron deficiency state (similar to yours), impaired exercise performance is reported by many, while tissue oxygenation and cardiac performance were not affected. This may explain why  you have symptoms similar to that of anemia.  Although guidelines for the treatment of iron deficiency is based on the associated anemia rather than the absolute iron depletion.    Many studies have been done to examine the effect of iron depletion on physical performance and whether iron supplementation will improve the situation or not.  Indeed numerous trials concluded that iron supplementation in such cases offers better performance in individuals with iron deficiency.  This should be considered under the observation of a  hematologist to avoid any undesired complication.  Hope this information is  useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 31 year old male w/  absolutely no past health problems whatsoever. I have never smoked, drank alcohol, or done drugs. Recently, i saw my general physician, complaining of blood in my urine, frequent headaches, lack of energy, and relatively rapid weight loss (25 pounds in 4 months--w/o exercizing at all). She gave me Ciprofloxacin for the bloody urine, which cleared it up in about 7 days. She took several blood tests and results recently came back. She told me that i definitely have anemia, BUT THAT MY FERRITIN LEVEL WAS HIGH WHILE MY HEMOGLOBIN LEVEL WAS LOW. This seems like a contradiction to me, considering the little internet research i have done thus far. Do i have hemochromatosis? Please help. Awaiting someone's reply. -Jeremy C.\n\n",

My doctor ran bloodwork and the following came back:  RBC 5.35 (normal 3.80-4.80) Hemoglobin 152 (normal 120-150) Hematocrit .52 (not sure what normal range is) Neutrophils 1.9 (normal 2.0-7.0) Everything else was within normal range.  This has happened in the past where my RBC, Hemoglobin and Hematocrit were elevated and my neutrophils were low (as low as 1.2 at one point) but my RBC have never been this high.  They seem to cycle together.  Then they return to a more normal level though my red cell counts are always right at the very top of normal and my neutrophil counts are at the very bottom of normal.  Is a cycling of these counts normal?  Are the RBC significantly elevated that I should be concerned about them?  Could my blood levels be causing the fatigue?  Thanks for any help you can offer.

    "content": "Hi,  I'm a 28yr old fairly healthy woman.  No children, don't excersize, but not overweight, 5'9, 137lbs.  No known diseases or conditions that would cause them.  They are always on my legs or thighs, most recently the ones that really have me worried are on both of my legs right around the calf area, actually moreso on the sides of both calves so the bruises face each other.  It seems weird that I would have identical bruising on both legs in the same spots.  I'm admittedly a bit of a hypochondriac, not to mention I just lost a very dear friend to AIDS, and I know that bruising is a symptom of AIDS, but I don't want to work my self up unneccesarily.  I tried to locate pics online of what AIDS caused bruising/splotches look like to compare, but couldn't find any.  I was never intimate with my friend who passed from AIDS or anything, but seeing him deterioate up close has really gotten me paranoid.  I also took the rapid HIV test, which tests for the antibodies in your saliva, about two months ago and it was negative, so why do I keep getting these bruises on my legs?  My grandmother suffered from diabetes and high blood pressure, she had to take insulin shots, and she passed at 57.  Also, I have been wearing high heels since I was a teen ager, not sure if maybe I've put too much strain on my legs.  I used to smoke cigg's, but quit a few years ago, not taking any birth control, but I do take a daily multi vitamin.  I know that it's not from bumping into anything, because it would be kind of hard to bump the inside of the calf on both legs. I was recently taking amoxicillin for a UTI.  That's about all the pertinent info I can think of, any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

I was on birth control pills (Yasmin) for two years but had to stop because of the surgery. I am now ready to go back on birth control but since after the splenectomy my platelet count is a little higher than normal (493.000) and it has been stable for the  whole month. I understand that combined birth control pills have a risk of producing clots and plus my elevated platelet count I'm scared of taking the pill. My doctor said that since the platelet count is not that far from normal, I might be able to take my regular BC pill and at the same time taking a child's aspirin every other day just to reduce the risk of clots and for my tranquility. However, my doctor is not a hematologist and I'm not sure if this will work. If this doesn't work then is there a certain pill brand that I can take that won't put me on risk for blood clots? I know I'm not the only female in the world without a spleen that needs birth control ;o) !!! ( I wouldn't like to have to use barrier methods if possible) Thanks!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lymphocytes are small, mononuclear cells that migrate to areas of inflammation in both early and late stages of the process. They play an important role in immunologic reactions.  Normal lymphocyte count is in the rage between 16-45% of white blood cells (WBCs).   Increased lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) in adults is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count greater than 4,000/mm3.   The reactive, or secondary, lymphocytoses are conditions that involve absolute increases in lymphocytes caused by physiologic or pathophysiologic responses to infection (especially viral), inflammation, stress and in those who are long-term cigarette smokers.  The fact that you had Flu recently and Bells palsy make the increase of lymphocytes  number very likely to happen as a reactive process to infection. In addition, it is not so high to be alarming.   I advise you to follow up with your Doctor and to repeat you CBC after you recover from all these medical problems.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Should I see a hematologist about my anemia?",
    "content": "I am a 69-yr old male in generally excellent health. In Aug'06 during a routine blood test I was diagnosed as having a mild case of iron deficiency anemia (IDA).  My hemoglobin level was 12.0 g/dL, and I was told that anything below 13.0 g/dL classified me as having IDA.  My other blood test results (with units omitted) were:  ferritin (6); iron (17); TIBC (405.6); transferrin (290); WBC (7.0); RBC (4.78); HCT (36.8); MCV (76.9); MCH (25.2); MCHC (32.7); RDW (18.3); PLT (234); MPV (7.9).  I have had no symptoms of IDA.  I do not take any medications, vitamin supplements, aspirin, or NSAIDs.  There is no family history of IDA, and I have had only minor surgeries (bunionectomy and arthroscopic surgery of one knee).  When I was diagnosed with IDA, my primary physician said that blood loss in the GI tract was the first thing that needed to be ruled out.  Since then I have had the following tests which have so far not indicated any blood loss:  fecal occult blood test; colonoscopy; upper endoscopy; CT scan of the abdomen; and capsule endoscopy.  The gastroenterologist now recommends an enteroscopy to examine and take a biopsy of an isolated area in the upper third of the small bowel which revealed some mild irritation and loss of villi.  My questions: 1.  If after all these GI tests are completed, no blood loss has been discovered, what other tests can help determine the cause of the IDA?  2.  My treatment thus far has been strictly by the gastroenterologist.  Should I see a hematologist for another opinion?  Thanks in advance for your assistance.  rer1001.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with Dr. Safaa's comprehensive response to your previous post. I understand your reasons for concern.  I am not a gastroenterologist so we will have to wait and see your gastroenterologists decide concerning the jujenal lesion. If according to their assessment it looks significant then it should be biopsied. That it is the cause of your IDA is possible even though this is not supported by your occult blood in stools test (which was negative).  Your gastroenterologists want to be absolutely sure you don't have don't have any nasty (such as a tumor) that's causing your IDA, given your age.  Once that is ruled out, other more benign causes of IDA can be safely be explored. At this stage it would be a good idea to check with a hematologist. Other causes include malabsorption of iron and decreased intake.  Sometimes all that is needed is iron supplements to correct the condition. However, you are right not to take them now so they do not interfere with your investigations.  All the best and do keep us updated!\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has recently been diagnosed with MS but the more I research and what I know of the history of her symptoms I believe it to be vitamin B12 deficiency (not yet Pernicious Anemia, I hope). We are going to our PMD to discuss it and hopefully have a Schillings test done.  Now my question is can a B12 deficiency cause sarcoidosis or more specifically Uvitis (which she suffers from now) and Endometriosis (which has been treated several year ago with no reoccurrence yet). This would help us in solving the mystery of her ongoing health issues. I have read that sarcoidosis can affect the liver and the liver holds B12 in reserve. She has had no skin or lung afflictions as far as I can remember that sarcoidosis causes. I\u2019m not pushing toward sarcoidosis as much as I believe it to be a B12 deficiency. Any insight would be helpful.\n\n",

The most commonly affected organs are: -Lung: causing cough, pain and shortness of breath -Skin  in the form of Nodules and rash - Eye  affects vision and cause redness and lacrimal gland disorders.  -Liver :hepatomegally and elevated liver enzymes  Nodules formed by the disease can be seen on chest X-ray, CT studies etc. Biopsy from lesions is needed for definitive diagnosis, in addition to a blood test named angiotensin-converting enzyme.    Pernicious anemia is caused by a lack of intrinsic factor that is secreted from the stomach and needed to absorb vitamin B-12 from the gastrointestinal tract. Gastric diseases are the main causes of vitamin B-12 .  It is trues that neurological effects of vitamin B-12 deficiency may be seen before anemia is diagnosed. Investigations needed include: -serum vitamin B-12 level  -Schilling test  -measurement of serum holotranscobalamin II   I could not get the information well is she diagnosed with sarcoidosis? I do not understand why you relate sarcoidosis with  Vit B12 deficiency that would in turn be the cause of her symptoms.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "The tests were done as a result of elevated LFT during normal blood work.  When the results were received, the GP referred me to a hematologist and Gastrologist to understand why my ferritin reading is so high.  As for my symptoms, I am not sure if I have any.  I am tired most of the time but thought that was normal.  There is no family history that is relative or at least that is what the hematologist said.  Much of what you have provided in your post I have learned from other postings and internet websites.  What I have yet to find anywhere is that is ok for me to have these results and it just the way that I am.  If I could find some exception documentation, I would leave this alone.  I have had exercise induce asthma all of my life.  I do not take anything for it and never have.  I was an athlete that completed at a very high level and never had any problems with the asthma.  Today, I only have problems on the back side of colds and sinus infections that settle in the chest.  It takes me a little longer to get over it than most people.  I do not consume alcohol with any regularity.  The last time I had a drink was five months ago.  I have gone to business events were I may several drinks.  I am sure if I have some form of arthritis.  I am not a spring chicken anymore.  I broke several bones and had two knee surgeries over the course of time.  I have rotator cuff issues in one shoulder that has not been repaired.  That only bothers me from time to time when I sleep.  Do I need to let this go and not put anymore thought into this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am not a pediatrician however, I can tell you that platelets respond like an acute-phase reactant to tissue injury and many acute infections.   Hence, thrombocytosis can result from acute infections; inflammatory/immune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis); mechanical causes/trauma (burns, postsplenectomy); metabolic/toxic causes (exercise, cirrhosis, iron deficiency).  On the other hand, it can also be caused by neoplastic and myeloproliferative diseases (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelocytic leukemia) or vascular hemorrhage.   Eosinophilia may be primary or secondary to an underlying disorder. Allergic or atopic diseases are the most common causes, with respiratory and skin diseases most prominent. Eosinophilic drug reactions which are usually asymptomatic, may be associated with interstitial nephritis, serum sickness, cholestatic jaundice, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunoblastic lymphadenopathy.  Almost any parasitic infection can elicit eosinophilia, but not protozoa and noninvasive metazoa.  Nonparasitic infections also may be accompanied by eosinophilia. Hodgkin's disease may cause marked eosinophilia, whereas non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia are less often accompanied by eosinophilia. Ovarian cancer is the leading solid tumor associated with eosinophilia. Connective tissue disorders with increased circulating immune complexes and vasculitis are often associated with eosinophilia.  Your doctor is correct to wait and observe your child's blood count. If any other abnormality should arise or he should complain of any new symptoms you should report to his doctor as soon as possible.  Otherwise, the investigations done for these disorders is often invasive and traumatic to the child (such as a bone marrow biopsy) and should be reserved for those that are at high risk of disease.

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 44 y/o female with unremarkable PMH.  My bloodpressure runs 90/40's, my cholesterol is always unusually low (ldl 40's, triglycerides 30's and total 90-115) My mother has ideopathic neuropathy, psoriasis, arthrits and osteoporosis and my father has htn.   The past 1-2 years I've had continuous tinnitus, most of the time I feel like I have slight motion sickness, burning skin sensation on my upper arms and jaw, and I've had 2 episodes of vertigo.  No hearing loss.  My MRI of spine and brain are normal, thyroid panel, cbc, bmp, serum immunoglobin electrophoresis, lyme panel , esr, ana and markers for celiac disease have all been normal.  My b12 was 311.  I take multivitamins and eat a lot of foods with b12.  Could this low normal level be causing my symptoms?  Many years ago I had an episode of abdominal pain and elevated ldh and slightly enlarged liver which resolved after 6 months and they felt maybe it was viral.  thanks for any information you can give me.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been diagnosed with macrocytosis and have seen a hematologist who talked to me about myelodysplasia. I told her that 25 years ago I was told my bloodwork showed Pelger Huet Anomaly (PHA). My sister was tested and she had it too. She and I grew up \"over the store\", my father had a Texaco station. The underground gas tanks had vent pipes which were a few yards from our bedroom window. My question is, could benzene exposure have made my blood work look like I had PHA? My hematologist seemed relieved when I told her about the PHA, she explained the myelodysplasia was congenital (I was born with it) so benign. Because of my memory impairment, I forgot to tell her about the Texaco station. She didn't want to do any bone marrow testing and said she wouldn't until my hemaglobin is below 115. She told me to come back in 6 months. When I got home I remembered all the stuff I should have told her, like how I'm always exhausted, my sister went to bed at 8:00 p.m. for most of her adult life, she was always so tired. She died of breast cancer 2 years ago. Can you have PHA and it's not benign? I'm 55 but have felt like I'm 85 for a very long time. I am the sickest person I have ever known who's still alive.

    "content": "Dear slate,   Pelger-Huet anomaly (PHA) is a dominantly inherited benign defect of neutophil terminal differentiation.  Characteristic blood findings include: Bilobed shaped neutophil nuclei A reduced number of nuclear segments Coarse chromatin of the nuclei of neutrophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes.   Distinguishing this autosomal dominant disorder from acquired or pseudo-PHA is very important and affects the prognosis of the disease.  In the hereditary form of PHA, positive family history is helpful in making the diagnosis more likely. In addition, no other cell line involvement should be found in this form of PHA.   Exposure to Benzene for a duration ranged from 3 months to 17 years has been found to result in the development of the acquired pseudo-Pelger Huet anomaly in 0.5%.   In contrast, if anemia or thrombocytopenia is detected the diagnosis of Pseudo-PHA is to be considered which may preced the clinical onset of myelodysplastic disorders and other malignant hematological conditions.In such cases, a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy would be necessary.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with her this information and further approaches to each the correct diagnosis.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Truffles,  The diagnosis of SLE is based on both characteristic clinical features and autoantibodies. Criteria for diagnosis that a disease is SLE is based on the combination of different clinical feature with laboratory investigations. A combination of 4 or more of 11 criteria, will document the disease.  Clinically the disease affects many systems in the body like: Musculoskeleta (arthritis),Cutaneous (dermatitis), Renal (nephritis), Pulmonary (pleuritis), Vascular occlusions, etc  Worth noting that other disease criteria tends to be evident with time.   Antinuclear antibodies (ANA) are positive in >95% of patients during the disease activity. It is important to repeat the test as repeated negative tests makes the diagnosis of SLE unlikely.  In the presence of SLE corresponding clinical features, high antibodies to double-stranded DNA and antibodies to the Sm antigen support the diagnosis of SLE being more specific to this disease.   To the contrary, the presence of multiple auto antibodies without clinical symptoms do not confirm the diagnosis of SLE although  these individuals are at increased risk.   SLE patients have fertility problems and high probability of fetal loss. In such patients, with prior fetal losses, treatment with heparin is recommended to achieve live births.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor and to discuss with him the above information. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear allycat,  I can not suggest a certain diagnosis for your medical problems, however I would recommend you to go for the bone marrow biopsy as your doctor advised.  Persistent changes and the presence of abnormal cells despite adequate therapy are indicative of bone marrow biopsy. In such cases bone marrow analysis is a mandatory test to reach the diagnosis.   The reticulocyte count (N:40,000-100,000 /muL of blood) is very important to determine the need for bone marrow examination; normal or elevated reticulocytic counts indicate adequate Bone marrow function and extrinsic cause for the anemia. Persistent low level despite of adequate regular treatment is another indication for bone marrow biopsy.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear KIJONAMA,  The serum ferritin test is ordered to see how much iron your body has stored for future use. Reduced serum ferritin concentration is the most useful test for diagnosis of iron deficiency. As the body iron stores decrease so does the serum ferritin. A serum ferritin concentration below 12 ug/L is virtually diagnostic of absent iron stores.  Your RDW (Red cell distribution width) is elevated. The RDW is an index of the variation in cell volume within the red cell population. Red cell populations with higher than normal RDW are termed heterogenous; those with normal RDW are homogeneous. Increased numbers of reticulocytes will cause an increased RDW. In some instances, the RDW is the first test result to increase with changes in red cell population sizes. For example, in early iron deficiency, there are only low numbers of microcytic red blood cells.   Regarding the decrease WBCs: first it doesnt seem persistent; second you need to describe in more detail the differential counts and the morphology. There are many causes of leukopenia which include side effects from medication, bone marrow diseases.  Consult a hematologist as you may need to perform a panel of other tests which may show where the abnormality is.  Best regards,\n\n",

I am going through some trust issues due to mental stress.

I love my mother very much so please do not think I am bashing her.  I am now concerned since I know that I wasn\u2019t looking (due to stress) to see what the nurse was doing.  I now have a few concerning questions.  If I was stuck with an infected needle.  How would I know?  Would the infection or disease show up in the blood test? Would I need to take another blood test to see or would it show up in this one?  Would the needle mark on my skin show signs?    Hopefully I will get the results by the end of the week.  Thank you.

On my last blood test, the results showed that I have very high cholesterol (in the 220 range). My doctor was really confused and wants to take a re-test soon. Lately, I've been searching online and I discovered that   \"everyone needs at least eight hours of sleep per night. Fatigue can increase the adrenalin levels in your body, which causes cholesterol to become elevated. If you're not getting enough restful sleep, you may be increasing your cholesterol level. \"   During the last couple years of high school, I averaged only about 4 hours of sleep per night on weekdays. And even now, I find myself getting only 4-7 hrs per night. I'm pretty convinced that this is where my problem lies.   Would anyone please be kind enough to share with me your thoughts on this. I plan to be very strict with my sleep, but I am still very concerned about my current health condition. If i start getting 8 hours every night, how long til my cholesterol lowers? Will i ever get to a normal level again? Exactly how serious do I need to be about this?  I am really anxious to read some discussion about this.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kirti2005,  Different types food or beverages cause transient increase in the triglyceride levels, so fasting for at least 12 hours is essential before the blood sample is taken to measure the lipid profile. The Low density lipoproteins (LDL bad cholesterol.)  and the High-density lipoproteins (HDL good cholesterol) should be measured too.   Causes related to unhealthy life style are the primary source of high cholesterol level in young age as well as in adults. Being overweight, consuming a diet high in saturated fats (animal and dairy products) and cholesterol and trans-fatty acids (commercial food products), sedentary life, and consuming a moderate to excessive amount of alcohol are all risk factors to high.  A blood cholesterol of 220 in a healthy young person with no risk factors for coronary disease does not warrant treatment. Changes in the life style and healthy nutrition are very important to maintain the cholesterol level in the normal healthy range.   When lipid levels in the blood are very high, special blood tests are performed to identify the specific underlying disorder like liver, thyroid problems and Diabetes.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

There are many causes and manifestations of erythema including photosensitivity, erythema multiforme or erythema nodosum. It is very difficult however, to be sure of the diagnosis and to tell what was the cause. In addition I think you do not remember well the name of this disease as to my knowledge I do not know a viral induced fever with this name.  If we assume that these lesions were erythema due to viral infections, then I hope you find this information useful.  Although in half of all cases of erythema multiforme or erythema nodosum, the underlying cause my not be identified, viral infection has a causal role in many of them. In Erythema multiforme: Infections like primarily herpes simplex virus (HSV) and certain types of pneumonia caused by mycoplasma; influenza A and Epstein\u2013Barr virus are associated with erythematous lesion.  Clinically: fever, itching of skin proceed lesions that are typically surrounded by concentric rings of normal and red skin and distributed on different parts of the body.  Erythema nodosum may be caused by viral infection of the HSV. Clinically in addition to the generalized flu like symptoms there are red, hard, painful lesions that turn into to yellow and brown while they fade out.  Best regards,\n\n",

I would like to know if you have any symptoms suggestive of any form of infection like, sore throat, urinary tract infection, skin infectious, gastroenteritis etc.  MICARDIS HCT (telmisartan/hydrochlorothiazide) is a drug used in the treatment of hypertension.

    "content": "Dear wendy logan.  Type 1, (juvenile diabetes or insulin-dependent diabetes), is a disorder in which little or no insulin is secreted in the body most commonly due to defect in the body's immune system. The immune system attacks and destroys the cells that produce insulin in the pancreas (Beta cells).When the beta cells are destroyed, no more insulin can be produced, resulting in high level of blood sugar that can negatively affect the other body organs. Genetic factors are believed to play a role in the development of Type 1 diabetes.  The pancreas, is located high in the retroperitoneum (protected), thus being injured in common injuries like car accident is unusual, although it may happen. In such cases splenic or hepatic injuries co- exists.   The diagnosis of small pancreatic injuries is difficult and can be misdiagnosed. Chronic Pancreatitis (inflammation) , is to be considered in cases with history of traumatic injury to the pancreas. Chronic pancreatiis is one of the conditions that results in type 1 Diabetes. Pancreatic pain (severe agonizing epigastric pain which may radiate to the back accompanied by nausea and vomiting) accompanied by steatorrhoea and loss of weight.  Diagnosis of Chronic Pancreatitis includes:  Pancreas function tests including serum amylase Ultrasounds  Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)  CAT scans   For more information about chronic pancreatitis you can visit our website at: http://www.doctorslounge.com/gastroente ... atitis.htm  For traumatic injury of the pancreas to cause Type 1 diabetes, it should be a severe injury that can not be misdiagnosed clinically and should be associated with other symptoms and signs. However, we can never say never.  Keep on follow up with your doctor, and inform him with any new symptoms. You can discuss with him the above information and the possible investigations to be done for proper management.  Best regards,\n\n",

Not sure if it could have been always like that or not. He sent me for an ultrasound last night. It came back normal. She had a hard time imaging my veins though. How accurate is this test? Should I have a repeat study and if so, how soon? The d-dimer was also normal. Could it be in my pelvic veins? My leg hurts a lot especially in the calf but also in the though and even my hip a litlte. When I am just sitting here it even feels like something is pulling in my calf and it feels tingling.   What should I do? Chalk it up to some unknown injury or go back in for more tests???\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tifa,  Symptoms of DVT include painful limb swelling and discoloration in the affected limb.  Signs of DVT include Homans sign (pain on passive dorsiflexion of the foot), unilateral edema, and tenderness. It is important to know that these symptoms and signs can exist in other medical conditions like skeletal problems and cellulitis .  Diagnosis is done using different imaging techniques and blood tests. An Ultrasound (US), Duplex Doppler compression are the commonlyscan of the legs is the standard imaging technique requested in such Case, as it is highly accurate, non-invasive.However,it is less accurate in detecting DVT in the pelvis or the small vessels of the calf, in obese people or if there is marked edema.  \"D-dimer\" is the blood test, used to detect recent clotting. A positive test can be seen in many conditions including DVT and pregnancy. On the other hand, a negative one, makes the diagnosis of DVT very unlikely.  Combination of these measures is usually requested and very effective in the diagnosis of DVT.  With these highly effective measures, the diagnosis of DVT is sometimes very difficult and more complicated techniques is required.  A venogram or phlebogram, in which dye is injected into a vein in the foot and an x-ray is taken. It is the most effective technique in the Diagnosis of DVT.   In addition to ultrasound, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and CAT scanning are used to detect a DVT including pelvic DVT.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him the above information. Keep us updated.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "My dermatologist recently ran some bloodwork on me to determine if a I may have lupus.  Everything came back \"good\" according to my doctor.  I asked for a copy of my results and the only thing \"off\" was:  RBC x 10^6 = 3.99   (range 4.20-5.40) Hematocrit = 34.2    (range 37.0 - 47.0)  The doctor never mentioned these to me and told me they were fine.  In all the years I've had CBC's done, my red blood cells have never been a problem.  In the absence of any other abnormal red blood cell counts (hemoglobin was in the normal range), does this indicate anything or could it be just one of those things that \"just happens?\"  Not sure what to do about it, if anything.  Also, over the past year, I have had 4 CBCs done and on each one of them, my neutrophils have been very slightly elevated,although my complete blood counts are always in the normal range.  Three doctors don't have a problem with this.  Thank you, Christine\n\n",

I had the standard CBC performed and had the following results: Neutrophils = 32 Lymphocytes = 54 Absolute neutophils = 1.2  I was told that these were strange results and i should be retested which i was.  I was told by phone that my new absolute netrophils was 1.0.  My doctor wants to wait 1 month, retest, and if it is \"abnormal \" then send me to a hematologist.  Additionally, I have a Trace amt of blood in urine seen in urinalysis.  The only other symptoms I informed the doctor about are: lower back ache, frequent exhaustion, bleeding gums(not normal for me) and very frequent canker sores in my mouth over the past year.  Normally I get them about 1-2 times per year.   Does this sound like normal protocol or should I be concerned?  Any opinion will be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

According to my past bloodwork done over the past few years, it looks like my White Blood count dropped signifigantly in 2003 and has persisted until now.

I guess my questions are, 1) is this something to be concerned with? 2) Do I need to seek a second opinion? 3) Am I overreacting? 4)  Could stress cause this \"dip\"? Is it possible to have such a long period of low readings and then bounce back to normal and everything is fine?  I would really appreciate a reply post so I can \"put my concerns to bed\" for now.  Sometimes, reading all of these posts can be overwhelming.  Thank you, Stumpednsj\n\n",

I went to another Hematologist for a second opinion who thought it would be wise to have a bone marrow biopsy done.  He was able to determine that I have autoimmune neutropenia at this point and, while I do not \"qualify\" for a diagnosis of T-Cell Large Lymphocytic Leukemia due to my level of neutropenia, I do have all the pieces in place for it.  It was the genetic testing and flow cytometry tests which determined this.  My igG result came back high at 1770 mg/dl.  Also the T-Cell clonality test came back positive.  The final report read as follows: \"Moderate Lymphocytosis\" \"Modest increase in CD3+/CD8+/CD57+ Large Granular Lymphocytes, T-Cell\" \"Lambda predominant Plasma Cells\" \"No monoclonal B-Cell population\"  I have tested negative for RA but my grandmother had it.

Does this sound familiar to anyone?  there is not a lot of info out there on this type of condition and how it may or may not progress.  -StumpedNSJ\n\n",

    "content": "Dear stumpedNSJ,  There are four lymphoproliferative disorders affecting Large granular lymphocytes (LGLs):  reactive/transient LGL expansion,  chronic LGL lymphocytosis,  indolent LGL leukemia, and  aggressive LGL leukemia.   Criteria for diagnosis of LGL leukemia: Abnormal monoclonal proliferation of CD8+ T cells in patients with cytopenia.  The classic immunophenotype of the malignant T cell in LGL leukemia is CD3+CD4\u2013CD8+CD16+CD27\u2013 CD45R0\u2013CD57+CD94+.   Atypical lymphocytosis occurs cases of viral infections e.g. In Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection; the atypical lymphocytes are not CD57+.  A common association between LGL leukemia and other systemic diseases like: Autoimmune diseases, Hematologic disorders, Other malignancies.  LGL leukemia is an indolent chronic disorder.  Spontaneous remissions have been reported in some studies.  Recurrent neutropenia and infections are the main concern in treatment of this disease.  I hope you find this information helpful.

    "content": "Recently I had my blood drawn and for the first tiem ever in my life, upon initial penetration I felt a huge electrical spike feelign surge down the same arm, down my hand and to my fingertips. The pinkie and ring finger were slightyl less affected, it was the middle, index and thumb.   It felt quit ejangle for a time although I had no loss of sensation. Unfortunately, after 4 days or so anytime I extend the same arm as if compressing the area at the elbow joint, I get the majority of the same incredibly uncomfortable feeling.  The woman who drew the blood did immediately within justt 3-4 seconds withdraw the syringe, and she said she had never hit a nerve before, but that is what it was she said.  At rest I just feel a little bit of electrical jangle....but any movement....  How long does it typcially take for such symptoms to go away, and is there any treatment protocol other then letting the body do its thing? The feeling is really uncomfortable and prevents me from using my arm and hand the way it is supposed to.  Again, no numbness though in the extremity.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear DaveB,  Poikilocytosis indicates a defect in the maturation of red cell precursors in the bone marrow or hemolysis and fragmentation of the circulating red cells. Anemia due to myelofibrosis, a red cell maturation defect are diagnosed with bone marrow studies using bone marrow aspirate or biopsy.   Changes in the myeloid versus erythroid lineage (M/E) ratio together with the reticulocytic count can differentiate patients with a hypoproliferative anemia from those of hemolytic anemia.   For example, patients with reticulocyte index <2 and M/E ratio of 2 or 3:1 indicate hypoproliferative condition of the bone marrow. While in patients with hemolytic disease, the retucloctic index is >3  and M/E ratio of at least 1:1.   Another useful test is to stain the marrow smear or biopsy to check for iron stores or iron in developing red cells. Sideroblasts are the iron container in developing erythroblasts.   I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to continue your investigation. Keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

Hypercalcemia is defined as an abnormal elevation in serum ionized calcium concentration (free unbound calcium).  The most common causes of hypercalcemia are primary hyperparathyroidism and malignancy due to bone resorption. Reduced renal calcium excretion is another cause of hypercalcemia in cases like renal impairment, volume depletion, and thiazide diuretics.  My concern also is the back pain and the abdominal pain you  have mentioned, however it would have been helpful if you could give more details for the character of that pain. I hope you have been investigated for renal stones (e.g. using abdominal Ultrasound) and it was excluded to be the cause of that pain  I advise you to keep on follow up with your doctor and to monitor your blood calcium level at regular basis.

    "content": "Dear rybakgirl,  A hashimoto's, or goitrous thyroiditis is an autoimmune hypothyroidism due to antibodies that bind to the thyroid stimulating hormone TSH receptor. The result of this binding is increased size of the thyroid gland without functional activation or synthesis of the thyroid hormone.    Hashimoto's thyroiditis may be diagnosed only during investigations for asymptomatic enlarged thyroid gland rather than for presenting symptoms of hypothyroidism. As an autoimmune disease, a hashimoto's hypothyroidism may be associated with other autoimmune diseases like pernicious anemia due to antibodies against the gastric mucosa causing its atrophy. Decreased iron and folic acid absorption are also common in cases of hypothyroidism probably due to associated mucosal damage of the GI tract.  I advise you to keep on follow up with your doctor for further investigations of the underlying cause. Identification of the underlying cause is critical for the proper management.

These numbers seem marginal to me, but the doctor was going to keep me in the hospital any extra day amd was considering a blood transfusion. The number that is totally out of whack was % iron saturation, which doc said normal is between 25-50.  mine was at 4%  Is there something that can cause all the other numbers to be basically borderline, where this number is so off? i have been tired lately, and pale, cold, occasional dizziness, etc, but do not have a history of anemia.  I had contributed feeling sluggish to changing my work schedule to third shift and the accompanying sleep deprivation that has come with that, as I am up with my children during the daytime on the days my dh has to work.  My periods are regular (every 28 days),  not very heavy compared to the days before I had children, and last an avg of 4-5 days.

    "content": "Dear herege,  The diagnosis of anemia is primarily made by the finding of low the hemoglobin level,  RBC number, and the hematocrit.  However, for the identification of the cause, many other parameters should be investigated.  The average volume (MCV) of the red blood cells is used to classify types of anemia and is the first step by which the causes of anemia are approached. The normal MCV is in the range of (82-98) fl; values above and below this range indicate macrocytic and microcytic anemia, respectively.   The reticulocyte count (N:40,000-100,000 /muL of blood) is very important to determine the need for bone marrow examination; normal or elevated reticulocytic counts indicate adequate Bone marrow function and extrinsic cause for the anemia.   The hematocrit is almost about three times the measured hemoglobin value.  The microcytic anemia are usually due to deficient hemoglobin synthesis in cases of iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease.  In iron deficiency anemia which represents the most common form of anemia, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; in addition to examination of the peripheral blood smear should be measured.  Low serum iron or iron saturation are commonly seen in: Inadequate iron intake. Condition of chronic blood loss such as: GI bleeding from ulcers, colon polyps, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.    I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to complete your workup to find out the underlying cause.

    "content": "Dear Deb59,  Lupus anticoagulants (LA) are a heterogeneous group of antibodies that result in different clinical and laboratory effects.  Many Lupus anticoagulant LA are discovered accidentally such as when a prolonged activated partial thromboplastin tim (APTT) is found during a pre-operative evaluation.    The exact etiology of LA is unclear. These antibodies are commonly found in asymptomatic elderly individuals.  Among patients with autoimmune disorders, those with SLE have the highest incidence (20-45%).  Patients with HIV infection also have a high incidence of LA at some time in their course.  A number of drugs are known to induce LA.  The majority of patients with drug-induced LA however, have no systemic autoimmune disease or any other underlying disorder and have no clinical manifestations.   Although only a minority of patients with LA present with recurrent episodes of thrombosis, LA are one of the most common acquired predisposing causes of thrombosis.  The typical screening test is a prolongation of the standard APTT that fails to correct when the patient's plasma is mixed with normal plasma.  This suggests an inhibitor since normal plasma usually corrects any factor deficiency.  LA may influence the recommendation for the duration or intensity of anticoagulant therapy in patients with thrombotic events. When LA are found incidentally in asymptomatic patients, no therapy may be necessary.  In patients with drug-induced LA, discontinuing the agent will usually cause any abnormal clotting tests to revert to normal in 2-3 weeks.    When thrombotic patients who need anticoagulation with heparin have long APTT's due to a lupus anticoagulant, monitoring the heparin can be accomplished by using the anti-factor Xa activity assay, which is usually used for the monitoring of low molecular weight heparin.  Although the PT is less affected by LA than the APTT, the chromogenic factor X assay may be used to determine the accuracy of the INR in patients with LA.  I hope you find you this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear rfied112,  The iron supplement may combine with levothyroxine in the stomach and affect the absorption of the drug.  As a result the usual dose of levothyroxine becomes less effective in correcting hypothyroidism.  It is recommended to take the dose of levothyroxine enough time before the iron supplements.  While taking the two drugs, it is advisable to check for the thyroid function on a regular basis.   Although the interaction between these two drugs is not common and is usually moderate in severity, any symptoms suggestive of thyroid hypo-function or any abnormal signs should be considered seriously and consultation of the physician is mandatory.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear aitzi,  MDSs is more commonly seen in men above 65years old. Various cytopenias, including anemia, may persist for months to years before the diagnosis is settled.  Dyspoiesis in normocellular or hypercellular bone marrow is the main feature of this disease and include:  Dyserythropoiesis: ineffective erythropoiesis results in anemia and reticulocytopenia; anisocytosis and poikilocytosis Dysgranulocytopoiesis: Neutropenia; decreased or abnormal neutrophils. Dysmegakaryocytopoiesis Thrombocytopenia; large platelets with abnormal contents.  Management of MDSs  is usually conservative till leukemic transformation. Supportive care includes packed red blood cell transfusion, platelet transfusion, treatment of infection etc.  Androgens, pyridoxine, folate, and danazol High doses of erythropoietin (5000 to 10,000 U/day) is helpful in 10% to 20% of patients. Other  growth factors   Cytotoxic agents like Low dose cytosar therapy or topotecan showed activity in the treatment of this disease.  Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) should be considered in patients younger than 45 years of age who have an HLA-compatible sibling.   New drugs like Vidaza have shown to be effective in decreasing the transfusion needs and providing better quality of life, however no long term control of the disease could be demonstrated till now.

    "content": "Dear purple,  Cold agglutinins (capable of agglutinating RBCs) are immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibodies in the majority of cases, (less common [IgA] or [IgG]). These antibodies can result in RBC agglutination and destruction in the reticuloendothelial system (hemolytic anemia). Slowing of blood flow into the peripheral vessels results in  a Raynaud like syndrome (acrocyanosis). Hemagglutination occurs mainly at 4\u00b0C and not at 37\u00b0C, hence the name cold agglutinins.   On exposure to cold, painful fingers and toes with purplish discoloration of the peripheral parts of the body including ears, nose, forehead and digits take place. Classic chronic CAD is idiopathic, of unknown cause and symptoms occur on cold exposure with diverse degrees of severity.  Lymphoproliferative (includingB cell lymphomas), myeloma and autoimmune diseases may be associated with the production of IgM cold agglutinin.  Many blood tests are done to diagnose cold aggluitinination of RBCs. Specific tests include, the Direct Comb's test (DAT, direct antiglobulin test)   \u2022 In general treatment of the idiopathic form of the disease is conservative with protection from cold exposure, correction of any other aggrevating facors like anemia. The disease is of benign course showing periods of spontaneous exacerbation's and remissions.  Steroids are not very effective and may mask the diagnosis of an associated lymphoproliferative. Prednisone appears to be effective in cases with low cold agglutinin titer, and high thermal amplitude. Plasma pharesis is considered by some doctors in severe cases when other measures fail to induce remission of the symptoms but causes temporary relief. \u2022  Chemotherapy is generally avoided in the treatment of idiopathic Cold agglutination disease CAD. Benefits versus the long term effects of these agents should be considered while describing any of the chemotherapeutic agents. Chlorambucil has been used successfully in CAD. \u2022  Patients with lymphomas and cold agglutinins are known to have a more chronic course. In such cases treatment of the underlying lymphoma with Cyclophosphamide, vincristine  and fludarabine were all successful. In patients who fails on these different chemotheraputic regimens, rituxan has been effective in treating symptoms due to the  cold agglutinins and refractory autoimmune hemolytic anemia.   I hope you find this infromation useful. Best regards,\n\n",

I was told I had a hernia but no bleeding was found from the colitis. I still have a low blood count and was told I might need to take iron shots.

    "content": "Dear Tiger,  The diagnosis of anemia is primarily made by the finding of low the hemoglobin level, RBC number , and the hematocrit.  However, for the identification of the cause, many other parameters should be investigated.  The average volume (MCV) of the red blood cells is used to classify types of anemia. The normal MCV is in the range of (82-98) fl; values above and below this range indicate macrocytic and microcytic anemia, respectively.   The reticulocyte count  is very important to determine the need for bone marrow examination; normal or elevated reticulocytic counts indicate adequate Bone marrow function and extrinsic cause for the anemia.   The hematocrit is almost about three times the measured hemoglobin value.  Macrocytic anemia are commonly due to B12 and folic acid deficiency. While causes of normocytic anemia include: hemolytic anemia of various causes; aplastic anemia.  The microcytic anemia are usually due to deficient hemoglobin synthesis in cases of iron deficiency anemia and the anemia of chronic disease.  In iron deficiency anemia which represents the most common  form of anemia, serum iron, iron-binding capacity, and ferritin; in addition to examination of the peripheral blood smear should be measured.  In patients with ulcerative colitis, anemia is usually due to iron deficiency anemia as a result of blood loss. Blood loss can be microscopic and detected only by microscopic examination of the stools.   Another possibility is the anemia of chronic inflammatory disease, in which there is a failure of iron incorporation in the developing erythrocytes.   Rarely in patients with ulcerative colitis, there is an associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia. The condition is confirmed by blood tests to detect increased amounts of antibodies (direct and indirect Coombs test).  Low ferritin level are commonly seen in: Condition of chronic blood loss such as: Inadequate iron intake. GI bleeding from ulcers, colon polyps, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.   IV (intravenous) infusion of supplemental iron is indicated when:  Oral intake is not convenient. Higher doses of iron are needed in cases of severe anemia. Inadequate absorption like in malabsorption Rapid elevation of iron level is mandatory.  So, I hope you can inform us about the detailed results of your blood tests including the blood smear and the results of any other investigations that have been done recently.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear River, Dear River,  Warfarin is the oral anticoagulant commonly used by many doctors in the treatment of DVT and other thrombotic conditions. The needed dose is determined by achieving a certain international normalized ratio (INR) range (usually 2.0-3.0) . While the dose of heparin is determined by achieving at least twice normal level of activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT).  In individuals, who have prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) (increased bleeding tendency) that is not caused by heparin or oral anticoagulants; Tissue thromboplastin inhibition (TTI) screening test is used to check for circulating anticoagulants like Lupus like Inhibitors, and Heparin inhibitors. LA may influence the recommendation for the duration or intensity of anticoagulant therapy in patients with thrombotic events.  However, I should emphasize that this test is not valid if there is heparin or oral anticoagulant intake and other tests and approaches should be done to confirm the presence of these circulating antibodies.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Keep us updated and best regards,\n\n",

I am a 34 year old male, healthy, active, and a muscular 240 pounds.  I have no underlying medical conditions that I or my Physicians are aware of.  I have NKDA.  Within 2 days I developed a UEDVT in both brachial veins and the vein they attach to (I can't remember its name) in my right arm.  I have a small amount of swelling in the inside portion of the right bicep and some redness from under my arm in the armpit to mid forearm.  I had the UEDVT confirmed via ultrasound.  It appears that the clot(s) extend from in the armpit to just below my elbow.  My arm is not grossly swollen and has good PMS.  I have been put on 120mg Lovenox and 2.5mg Coumadin as my treatment and nothing more.  I had the formation of a clot in my lower left calf following left knee surgery 7 years ago and received no anti-coagulant therapy then with complete resolution and no known problems associated with my previous clot.  From everything I have read I may have some protein deficiencies and possibly other problems to look into in the future.  But my immediate concern is the treatment of my UEDVT.  I have read about long term Post-Thrombi-Syndrome and its potential debilitating effects.  I have also read about possible incomplete clot removal from just LMWH and Coumadin therapy and potential to have a PE later in life.  I am a Fire Fighter who leads and active professional and personnel life.  How concerned should I be about the potential debilitating effects of these complications?  Should I insist on a more aggressive treatment with Thrombolitics via catheter injection directly to the clot(s) followed by LMWH?  Currently my medical treatment is being monitored by my Orthopedic Surgeon and have not seen a blood clotting specialist.  What type of Physician/Specialist should I see regarding treatment of my UEDVT?  I want the best treatment and best outcome, and am worried about dying on my family from a PE or other related clot problem now and in the future, please help. Thank you, Jason T\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LFD0884,  Idiopathic UEDVT is diagnosed by exclusion when none of the  risk factors for UEDVT is present. Only 20% of cases can be of Idiopathic cause.  Secondary UEDVT occurs due to two types of  risk factors: Exogenous risk factors like: central venous lines,  cancers,  history of similar attack due to leg deep venous thrombosis,  oral contraceptives, and  severe trauma is the major factor in the development of UEDVT.  Occult malignancy in particular lung cancer and lymphomas is sometimes discovered during the follow-up in 24% of patients.  Studies reported a contributing role for blood clotting factors like antithrombin III, protein C and protein S defects, factor V Leiden and G20210A prothrombin mutation etc. So it is wise to search for coagulation abnormalities in patients with Idiopathic UEDVT.  Treatment is basically with Therapeutic dose of unfractionated or low-molecular-weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulation for at least 3 months.  I hope these informations are helpful, I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to consult a vascular surgeon for proper medical care.  Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "I`m 50 yr old female. Caught mononeucelosis 3 yrs ago and havent been the same since. My Hb at the time was down to 6.6, I had jaundice and felt very poorly. I was found to be deficient in B12 and folic acid.Took iron for 6 months and it seemed as if all was going ok. Had regular check ups and 3months ago my blood started dropping again down to 8.9 with accompaning jaundice, although liver function tests are ok.  They think I have an immune hemolytic aneamia, but this is proving difficult to confirm.I have an enlarged spleen  but they don't want to remove it yet and although I had a bone marrow biopsy done 3yrs ago they want to do another and a CAT scan too. Any thoughts on the matter would be gratefully received. I am desperate for an answer  after so long. Is there anything that I can do to correct the enlarged spleen, is it ok to drink alcohol? Many thanks in anticipation,\n\n",

Autoimmune hemolytic anemia occurs in many conditions that include:  o        infections, such as hepatitis, cytomegalovirus (CMV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), typhoid fever, E. coli (escherichia coli), or streptococcus  o        medications, such as penicillin, antimalaria medications, sulfa medications, or acetaminophen  o     leukemia or lymphoma  o     autoimmune disorders, such as systemic lupus erythematous (SLE, or lupus), rheumatoid arthritis, Wiskott-Aldrich syndrome, or ulcerative colitis  o    various tumors  In suche cases Autoimmune hemolytic anemia is named secondary immune hemolytic anemia.   When the cause is not recognized, it is named idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia.  Symptoms of hemolytic anemia include: Fatigue   Pale skin   Shortness of breath  Rapid heart rate  Enlarged spleen And in severe cases juandice and dark urine.  Lab results such cases include: Positive direct Coombs' test or indirect Coombs' test  Elevated bilirubin levels  Elevated LDH  Low serum haptoglobin  Hemoglobin in the urine  Elevated absolute reticulocyte count  Low red  blood cell count    Steroids - Prednisone is usual upfront treatment. splenectomy is considered in steroid nonresponding cases.  While, Immunosuppressive therapy is given if there is no response to prednisone and splenectomy.  I hope these informations are helpful.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear betm,  Ferritin is iron binding protein and represents iron stored in the body Ferritin is found in the liver,  spleen, skeletal muscles, bone marrow and at low level in the blood.   A ferritin blood test is requested to investigate certain conditions like: The  cause of anemia.   Diagnose hemochromatosis .  Check for the efficacy of iron therapy  Low ferritin level are commonly seen in: Condition of chronic blood loss such as: Irregular menstrual bleeding. Inadequate iron intake. GI bleeding from ulcers, colon polyps, colon cancer, hemorrhoids, etc.   IV (intravenous) infusion of supplemental iron is indicated in severe cases of anemia when: - Oral intake is not convenient. -Higher doses of iron are needed in cases of severe anemia. - Inadequate absorption like in malabsorption - Rapid elevation of iron level is mandatory.  There are different types of IV iron preparations including iron dextran, sodium ferric gluconate, and iron sucrose.   Doses are given at low rate, e.g.the total dose of iron dextran in normal saline over eight hours.   Test doses of undiluted iron dextran is usually done to avoid for anaphylactic reactions although side effects, which are usually mild and reported in less than 25% of patients.  Sensitive patients can also receive intravenous iron infusion using prophylactic antihistamines, corticosteroids, and histamine2 blockers.   Rapid symptomatic improvement is usually expected in the majority of cases. The risk of iron overload and the potential increased risk of infection are considerable.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor, discuss with him the indication for parentral iron ifnusion in your condition and updated him with any symptom.

I wanted to know if anyone else has been diagnosed with this and what treatment they decided on.  I go to the doctor on Nov 8 to decide treatment.

    "content": "Dear robby,  Hereditary spherocytosis (HS) is a familial hemolytic disorder.  The clinical picture may  range from asymptomatic cases to severe hemolytic anemia.   The characteristic morphology of RBCs in HS is the microspherocytic form, this is due to loss of the cell membrane  integrity resulting in increased osmotic fragility.  The defect in the  blood cell membrane is due to genetic abnormality that lead to abnormal membrane protein structure.  Splenomegally and splenic sequestration of RBCs result in destruction of these abnormal RBCs and hemolytic anemia. Thus,  Splenectomy is curative for most of cases.  Maternal and fetal complications during pregnancy are not frequent.  Women with spherocytosis who are welling to get pregnant should be on follow up with their hematologist during their pregnancy period. They also should inform their obstetrician about their condition and to follow up regularly with US. Fetal skeletal abnormalities are not frequent.  I hope these informations are helpful.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 36 year old female who has had muscle and joint aches and pains since my teens (though mostly at a tolerable level). These pains have increased notably since the birth of my second child 18 months ago. My GP recently did a battery of tests to see what was going on. Thankfully my RA was negative but my haemoglobin was on the high side at 15.6 (up from 13  just 9 months ago) and my transferrin saturation was 47%. I didn't take in what the ferritin level was but I think it too was at the high end of normal. My GP was a bit concerned as he thought these levels were high for a female my age. The decision was to re-check in 3 months time and if the figures are climbing to refer me for further investigation.  My father has suffered from very similar aches and pains for years and was diagnosed with fibromyalgia 6 years ago. I found out yesterday he was never tested for HH. He goes next week to be tested.  MY GP seemed to be inclined towards a diagnosis of HH for me. My questions are.... how high do the levels have to be before treatment begins? My pain is increasing and I am exhausted lately.... how much worse does it have to get before phlebotomy starts (that's presuming correct diagnosis of HH).   As an aside, I rarely eat red meat and I would have thought that my diet was actually lacking on the iron front.  Thanks   P\n\n",

However I wouldn't have thought that would have led to high iron levels given that I don't eat much red week.. maybe once a fortnight I'll have a lasagne or something.  The plot has since thickened in that my father has had a letter from his GP stating that his gene test is negative and ferritin is normal. I presume that means he isn't even a carrier which means I can't have HH.  unless I have some \"wild gene type \" HH I probably don't have HH at all. So why the 47% Transferrin saturation and HB 15.6? Can this happen just as a \"blip\"? Can that level combined with my joint pains indicate anything else... could the TS levels be caused by whatever is causing the joint pain?  MY Rheumatoid factor, ESR, CRP, LFTS and TFT were all normal (and immuno- somethingorother).   I have searched the internet for clues and I'm finding no other likely cause. I am a  bit overweight (about 20lbs)... could fatty liver be a possibility? I rarely drink alcohol though I did  drink socially (and frequently) in my younger days... hardly at all over the past 8 years. IF it was fatty liver wouldn't the LFTs have been abnormal.

    "content": "I'm a 36 year old woman of normal weight, physically active.  My ferritin and red blood cell test have been on the very edge of the low range for several years, despite the iron pills my doctor put me on, which I have been taking for three years now.   My doc is satisfied with the ferritin levels always being not-quite low. I am wondering if it's ok that this has not improved with the iron and  hoping that fixing this will fix my problems of being cold constantly.    Test values:  Ferritin:  15 Hemoglobin:  12.1 RDW: 14.4 MCV: 81 MCH: 26.2 MCHC: 32.4  TSH: 0.3  All other CBC test values are in the middle of the normal range.    I am significantly colder than other women of similar body type - which for a whitewater kayaker is a dangerous problem.   My monthy flow is light or average.  Comparing pictures of me from 6 years ago, I am also sginificantly paler than then (I am a pale caucasian anyway) and too often am dead tired.  I'd like to get back to being able to donate blood as well.   I also take thyroid hormone (total thyroidectomy 10 yeaars ago), birth control pills, a prenatal multivitamin, and calcium (calcium taken separate from the iron for better absorption).  diagnosed with endometriosis 6 years ago, which the BCP keep under control.  No other meds or health problems.   Please let me know what to think - where is all that iron going if not into my blood?  Can I stop taking the iron if it's not helping?  Is it ok to live with iron levels on the edge of low?  Will getting pregnant make this worse?   Thanks so much for your answer -   -Lea\n\n",

I have a great endocrinologist; he and I are both happy with my  TSH level (0.3), so I only see him once every few years, though my TSH is tested annually.  My otherwise wonderful family doctor (RN, actually) feels there is no iron issue since the levels have stayed just barely inside the bottom edge of the \"normal\" range, so she has not investigated an etiology.   Is she right?   After three years on iron I'm worried about why my ferritin and red blood cell lab results all always point toward almost- iron-deficiency.     So should I stop taking the iron, or ask my doc for some tests (which ones?), or something else?     Thanks -  -Lea\n\n",

    "content": "Hello JFK,  Plasma cells are terminally differentiated, fully mature B lymphocytes. Because plasma cells secrete immunoglobulin, clonal proliferations of plasma cells usually result in the excessive production of a single immunoglobulin type or often only a single light or heavy chain. Immunoglobulins (Ig) are made up of 2 components: light chains and heavy chains and further classified by the type of light (kappa or lambda) or heavy (alpha [IgA], gamma [IgG], mu [IgM], delta [IgD], and epsilon [IgE]) chains.   These monoclonal paraproteins are detectable by serum electrophoresis or immunofixation as single sharp bands or peaks standing out from the background of reactive immunoglobulins.  Clonal plasma cell proliferations form a clinical spectrum encompassing indolent and aggressive forms of disease. These include multiple myeloma, macroglobulinemia, malignant lymphoma, amyloidosis, monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS).  Another important criterion for MGUS is stability of the monoclonal protein over time. Nonetheless, during long-term follow-up, an associated malignant process develops in about 30% of MGUS patients. Since none of the features defining MGUS is uniformly helpful in predicting the risk for malignant disease, patients should be followed up on a regular basis indefinitely.  Please note that you did not specify which type of monoclonal protein you are being monitored for. Hence, I am unable to provide you with more specific information.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi nelly145, Although D-Dimers are frequently used to assist (along with other diagnostics, ie, vq scan, CT Scan, ultrasound etc.) in identification of DVT's, Pulmonary Embolism etc. Alone this test is essentially nonspecific and may become elevated for numerous reasons aside from blood clots. For example, other conditions in which elevations may occur are due to fever, infection, recent trauma or surgical procedures in the previous three months, malignancy, etc. A D-Dimer is essentially a product of clotting so in answer to your question, \"So you could have a normal d-dimer but still have a dvt that is older. Is this true, or will the d-dimer be elevated no matter how old the clot is\"? It is highly unlikely that this result would be normal if a clot was present. In my opinion, it would be much more likely to show an elevation in this case or in any of the above examples previously mentioned. Identification of a DVT would not be based soley on an elevation or lack of for that matter of a D-Dimer test but would be included along with other diagnostics, symptoms, etc., and a diagnosis would be based on the picture as a whole. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "My name is Jackie and I am 36 years of age.    First lets say I have been pretty fatigued for a few months.  I have been seeing an acupuncturists due to a car accident I had a year ago.  He was also an MD in china (internal medicine) for 10 years.    About 5 weeks ago, he felt my nodes in my neck and collar bone area and they were enlarged and easy to touch (more prominent on left).  He asked me if I was sick or anything and I said no but I had been fatigued.  He did not want to alarm me but just to keep an eye on it.  I went back to my primary for a follow up blood test I took on 1-12-06 due to the fatigue.  Apparently it showed anemia with hemoglobin at 11.3 and hematocrit at 33.1    At the appt, the pcp doc told me it could be a virus that is new in my system and I just have not shown signs yet. She gave me a 10 day prescription of amoxicillin to rule out infection. 875 mg twice a day X 10 days.  She also told me to get a multi with 100% iron which I did.  I was to come back in 4 weeks after I stopped the antibiotics, re-check nodes and  take a new blood test. I guess they have to give time for the lymph nodes time to go down. If the lymh nodes are still swollen - we will have to do a biopsy. If blood is stll low then it may mean other things.  Well just a week later went back to my acupuncturist and he  noticed a pretty big lump under my left arm that was shaped like an egg and was 2 inches long and 1 inch wide. It is bigger now and this appeared day 7 of antibiotics which should not have happened if it were just a cold or virus.  Lymphnodes were still swollen and a few were fixed.  My husband and I went in with no appt.  She felt  the mass there under my arm (axillary lymph node) and it is cause for concern and further testing.  She also felt around and my neck & collar bone area lymphnodes which were still swollen. Mainly on the left .  I was also still very fatigued even after taking more iron, b-12 and vitamin c.  She wrote me an order to get a double mammogram and a double ultrasound and they both came back fine except showing swollen lymphnodes.     The mammogram stated mutliple bilateral lyphnodes more prominent in left than right.   The ultrasound stated - At least 4 and probably 5 lymphnodes seen in the left axillary area.  They are hypoechoic but with hyperechoic centers and some of these are notched.  Lymph nodes are present.  All these reange in size from 5mm to 2.2 cm.  I also took an MRI for my neck (to look at glands and nodes) .  The MRI report states at least 4 nodes seen on left (neck) and approx 2 on right.      I had a neck node biopsied one on the left side of neck.  It came back benign.  What is worrying me is the collar bone lymph node.  The others are of concern too.  They are not going down.  This has been going on for about 6 weeks now..    Went back to my acupuncturist yesterday and he said they are getting larger and the one on my left groin is now present.  Not as big as the others.  Oh and just last week I went on Omnicef because I actually did come down with a fever, bad cold, I caught from my son, etc..  That still did not do anything to my nodes or the lump just got slightly bigger.     I took new blood count on 2/17 and it appears my white blood count is down - 3.0L - hemoglobin is 11.6 and iron is quite low at 21.    PCP says white blood could have dropped due to the cold I just got over but she is not certain.  Mono test came back negative but showed I had it in the past which was new to me.    My left collar bone lymphnode is scaring me and I am just afraid.  I am a mother of twins who are only 3 1/2.  Anyhow my appt with the hematologist is wednesday and a chest x ray Monday.    Can you give me your opinions?  Am I going in the right direction?  If so what kind of things shall I talk to the hematologist about?    Thank you in advance for reading and taking the time to respond.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronically Elevated Neutrophils",
    "content": "I am a 42 y/o female, not overweight, non-smoking, and have anxiety disorder.  Last August 2005, my psychiatrist wanted to evaluate my bloodwork to look for any physical causes of anxiety.  Everything fell within the normal range except for my absolute neutrophil count which was 8302 (range was 1500-7800).  Recently, I visited my GP to get to the root of some ongoing tachycardia that I had.  A complete blood chemistry, EKG, and echo were run.  All were normal except the neutrophils again.  Here are my January labs: WBC Count = 8.1 (4.0-10.5 range) RBC Count = 3.93 (3.80-5.10) Hemoglobin = 11.8 (11.5 - 15.0) Hematocrit = 35.9 (34.0 - 44.0) MCV = 91 (80-98) MCH = 30.0 (27.0-34.0) MCHC = 32.9 (32.0 -36.0) RDW = 13.2 (11.7-15.0) Platelets = 267 (140-415) Neutrophils = 81 (40-74) Lymphs=- 14 (14-46) Monocytes= 5 (4-13) Eos = 0- (0-7 Basos = (0 -3) Absolute Neutrophils = 6.6 (1.8 - 7.8) Absolute Lymphocytes = 1.1 (.7 - 4.5) Absolute Monocytes = 0.4 (0.1 - 1.0) Absolute Eos - 0 (0.0-0.4) Absolute Baso = 0 (0.0 - 0.2)  So, after this visit, my doctor gives me Verapamil SR to help with the tachycardia.  I have an allergic reaction to it after only two pills.  I got a slight rash from it that went a way.  A day or two later, I get petechecia on my back, sides of waist/ribs, hips, buttocks and upper thighs.  I return to my doctor (this is February) and he runs all my bloodwork again to check for blood counts.  He also runs different clotting tests (not sure of the names).  Again all is well, except for the darned neutrophils which at this time are at 77 versus 81 (still elevated over the norm).  Yet my complete counts are all within the normal range.   With my anxiety disorder, it is VERY difficult for me to be calm with this.  My doctor tells me that he is not concerned with this.  My allergic reaction and resulting petechiae have not helped.  So my question is:  in the presence of everything else being normal, what does a slightly elevated neutraphil count mean, if anything.    The medications I take are: Synthroid (thyroid cancer in 1995 treated, no evidence of disease) Prilosec for GERD.  I have not had any colds or infection in quite some time.  I did have two excision breast biopsies in late November.  Will anxiety cause this condition?  I feel very panicky most days, especially when at the doctor. Thank you, Christine\n\n",

Since you have had a recent exam, and your physician considers this finding unconcerning at this point, in my opinion, I would not worry. If your counts would change overall or other inconsistencies would appear then I am sure his/her recommendation would be to refer you to a Hematologist for an evaluation.

Generally speaking when levels drop to this value a transfusion may be recommended. A cause for your iron deficiency needs determined as well as your significantly elevated platelet value. Call your physician's office back. Do not rely on the Receptionist and wait on the line until the physician is able to speak with you.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 20 year old college student. In the past year I have lost roughly ten lbs (I am 5'7 120lbs). I experience extreme fatigue to the point that I don't feel like standing up. Im constantly thirsty and I easily get motion sickness. I also frequently get dizzy when standing up. No matter how much I sleep, its not enough. I never feel rested. I have tested negative for anemia. I had labs done and they gave me a blood sugar of 127 and a SED rate of 80. They were re-done and my blood sugar and SED rate were normal but my CRP was 15.6. The third set of tests show all levels are normal. Ive had an ANA for lupus and that came back negative. My thyroid was also tested (by a family doctor) and that was normal. I am not depressed, which has been suggested.  I also have a tiny hard lymph node on the side of my neck, its moveable and can feel semi irritated if I move it around.  Everyone in my family is extremely healthy and the only medication I take is birth control.Any ideas? Im tired of being tired.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Fatigue is a difficult complaint to assess. I am glad that your blood counts turned out well. You have also excluded lupus. Did you test for thyroid dysfunction? Typically the hypothyroid patient wakes up in the morning feeling well and later develops fatigue on physical activity. On the other hand, patients that report waking up feeling fatigued may be depressed.  Fatigue can accompany another set of conditions, which include, infection (bacterial endocarditis, parasitic infections, AIDS, tuberculosis, and mononucleosis) as well as congestive heart failure, diabetes, chronic liver or kidney disease, Addison's disease, anorexia or other eating disorders, arthritis, autoimmune diseases, malnutrition and cancer. Certain medications may lead to fatigue such as cancer chemotherapy.  Various sleep disorders such as insomnia, obstructive sleep apnea, or narcolepsy can cause fatigue. Other conditions include pain, hay fever or asthma and regular use of alcohol or illegal drugs like cocaine.  Chronic fatigue syndrome (CFS) is a condition that may present with flu-like symptoms and last for more than 6 months. This is a diagnosis of exclusion. CFS is not easily relieved including by rest.  Based on his assessment, your doctor would choose which investigations to perform next. This may include referral to a psychiatrist.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 37 year old female with no known health problems other than having high unexplained white blood cell counts at times. Over the last two months or so on three different occassions, I have had veins swell up in the palm of my hands and bulge. It doesn't happen anywhere else, but in my palms. I am not doing anything strenuous with my hands that would cause this. When it happens, I have a horrible burning sensation where the vein is bulging. After awhile, it will finally go down, but it stays very tender for the next few days and I always have a bruise to follow. This past Saturday it happened again, but this time my wrist is kinda sore.    Although I haven't had any veins bulging up anywhere else, I have had a lot of unexplained bruising on various other places. Could all this unexplained bruising be connected to these veins busting in my palms and what could possibly causing all of this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I really have no idea what the palm veins condition could be. I suggest that you show it to a doctor when it happens.  Regarding repeated bruising this should be investigated. Let me explain a few things about bruising and the normal body function of hemostasis (the mechanisms by which the body stops the bleeding process).  Hemostasis is usually broken down into two stages: primary and secondary. Primary hemostasis is an immediate (minutes) but unstable response to injury. The key participants are platelets (which form the platelet plug) and the blood vessels (which cause vasoconstriction). Secondary hemostasis, in contrast is a slower process (may take several hours) but results in a definitive fibrin clot (coagulation) that serves as the scaffold for vascular repair by the endothelium.  In disorders of platelet plug formation (primary hemostasis) the site of bleeding is usually superficial such as in the skin, mucous membranes (gingivae, nares, genitourinary tract). Petechiae are present and ecchymoses is usually small, superficial. Hemarthroses, muscle hematomas are rare in such cases. However, bleeding after minor cuts is more common than those with defective coagulation. Bleeding after surgery is usually immediate and mild in those with primary hemostasis abnormalities.  Lab tests used to evaluate primary hemostasis include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count. Bleeding time when prolonged in the presence of a normal platelet count and the absence of aspirin (or other NSAID) intake may suggest a platelet function abnormality or a von Willebrand's factor (vWF) deficiency.  Henoch-Schonlein, or anaphylactoid, purpura is a distinct, self-limited type of vasculitis that occurs in children and young adults. Patients develop a purpuric or urticarial rash on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs and on the buttocks as well as polyarthralgias or arthritis, colicky abdominal pain, and hematuria from focal glomerulonephritis. Despite the hemorrhagic features, all coagulation tests are normal.  I think your repeated bruising would be the more pressing issue. I urge you to consult your doctor as soon as possible to determine a cause.  Best regards.\n\n",

The excessive bleeding and the bruising point towards a hemostatic defect (clotting or coagulation problem).   The bleeding would obviosly lead to anemia if severe enough.

    "content": "Hello,  It would be very difficult to evaluate your case online. Especially when it seems most causes have been investigated by your doctor. I will try, however, to provide a few ideas.  A normal serum ferritin concentration does not confirm the presence of storage iron, because serum ferritin concentration may be increased independently of body iron by infection, inflammation, liver disease, malignancy, and other conditions.[1]  An increased ferritin (>400 ng/ml) occurs in iron excess and in the following: iron overload from hemochromatosis or hemosiderosis; oral or parenteral iron administration; inflammatory diseases; acute or chronic liver disease involving alcoholism; acute myoblastic or lymphoblastic leukemia; other malignancies (Hodgkin\u2019s disease, breast carcinoma, malignant lymphoma); hyperthyroidism; hemolytic anemia, megaloblastic anemia; thalassemia (normal or sometimes higher).  Ferritin is normally found mainly inside of cells, with only a small amount in the blood. When there is damage to organs that contain ferritin (especially the liver, spleen, and bone marrow), ferritin levels can become elevated even though the total amount of iron in the body is normal.  As long as your ferritin has not increased over the normal range it would just mean that your body stores of iron have been replenished.  References: ========== 1.

I have had several blood tests that have not revealed a cause.  My most recent test last month revealed  platelets were 321, my PT was 13.5, my PTT was 34.4 and my INR was 1.2.  Blood counts were as follows:  WBC 7.1; RBC 4.68; HGB 14.9; HCT 42.6; MCV 91; MCH 31.8; MCHC 34.9; RDW 13.1   AST was 17, ALT was 17.  Glucose was 82.  TSH was 1.0.  Vitamin K levels were 263.  I am not taking any blood thinners.  The only medication I take is 50 mg. Atenolol for skipped beats, .25 mg. of Zoloft and Klonopin as needed. I do drink alcohol and do not smoke.  It seems the least bit of trauma causes a bruise and there are many bruises that I cannot remember banging into anything.  I do not eat a lot of green vegetables and my doctor feels the bruising could be related to my Vitamin K level.  He suggested I eat greens everyday and take a multi vitamin.  I am getting very worried.  Could there be another explanation?  Does it appear that my blood is normal and coagulating properly?  Thank you in advance for your response.

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better by now.  An abnormal vitamin K level would affect your prothrombin time and from your results that isn't the case. While these screening tests screen for most of the coagulation and clotting factor defects, they do miss out on factor XIII deficiency.  Factor XIII deficiency is a rare disorder but requires a specific assay (eg, clot urea stability).  Another disease: Henoch-Schonlein, or anaphylactoid, purpura is a distinct, self-limited type of vasculitis that occurs in children and young adults. Patients develop a purpuric or urticarial rash on the extensor surfaces of the arms and legs and on the buttocks as well as polyarthralgias or arthritis, colicky abdominal pain, and hematuria from focal glomerulonephritis. Despite the hemorrhagic features, all coagulation tests are normal.  Are all your bruises superficial (skin)? Do you have regular menses or do you bleed excessively? Do you bleed after minor trauma?  I recommend that you should be evaluated by a hematologist.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 19 years old and i have a factor seven blood deficency.  At my last test I was 35%. I also have a supposedly \"common\" condition of having one breast much larger than the other (one side is almost completely flat).  After researching and trying out many different types of clothes, bras, inserts, etc., i'm still unhappy and considering getting an implant in the one side to make them even.  I've been to different plastic surgeons and of course, they say that surgery would be no problem, and that insurance might even cover it (though they never responded after I sent in pictures of my problem).  My hematoligist, however, has a very different viewpoint:  It would be very traumatic surgery, I would have to recieve Factor seven for 48 to 72 hours following, and because of the clotting factor issue it might not heal right from the excess blood and become even more disfigured.  Recently had a partner who ridiculed the (breast) problem and spread it all around campus.  i hope that somehow a surgery like this would work.  What's the answer?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would be more inclined to stick with your hematologist's point of view.   To help you answer your question though, you have to ask yourself if you are first able to receive factor VII for 72 hours. If that is not possible due to financial or other reasons then you shouldn't go for the surgery.  If on the other hand you are able to receive factor VII replacement therapy the next question would be whether you are willing to take the risk of surgery failure due to bad healing. The person to ask about what that risk is would be your hematologist. Obvioulsy he will paint a more dim picture. But if you are willing to accept both these factors then you can go ahead with it.  I won't be able to recommend one course of action over another as I am unable to assess the severity of the deformity or the severity of your bleeding tendency.  Best regards and good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Lower legs bruising very badly!",
    "content": "I was recently in the hospital with an undiagnosed rash that turned my whole legs black and blue, at first they were concerned with flesh eating disease. I was in hospital 10 day undergoing numerous tests.  Now almost 3 weeks after getting out of the hospital, my lower legs are bruising all over, with some bruising just above and around my knees.  My legs hurt extremely bad, I am using 2 tyelnol #3's every 4 hours and it still feels like I have deep charley horses, for lack of a better description.  My legs are also very weak, I actually fell the other day as my right thigh muscle just gave way.  My doctor tells me I have myalgia, which really is just leg pain.  It seems more than this to me but I don't want to become one of \"those people\" who rush to the ER and waste their time if this is nothing urgent.  I am unable to walk long periods and stairs kill me, I am crawling up them.  I work 6 days a week and can not afford anymore time off, what can be causing this?? Please help as each day there are new bruises and more pain. As a side note, while in hospital they did many blood tests and liver function was perfectly fine.  I am soo frustrated now though!  The doctor has prescribed the T3's as I refuse to take anything stronger and Elavil for \"myalgia\"  ANY IDEAS WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED!!!! I have no back pain at all or hip pain, it does not hurt to sit at all in case you thought this was from my back at all, I have been asked that before.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Daysma,  I am sorry to hear about all the pain you are going through and wish you a quick recovery.  I am really in no position to evaluate your case, however, I will try to give you a few ideas.  Hemostasis is usually broken down into two stages: primary and secondary. Primary hemostasis is an immediate (minutes) but unstable response to injury. The key participants are platelets (which form the platelet plug) and the blood vessels (which cause vasoconstriction). Secondary hemostasis, in contrast is a slower process (may take several hours) but results in a definitive fibrin clot (coagulation) that serves as the scaffold for vascular repair by the endothelium.  In the process of platelet plug formation, platelets adhere to exposed matrix molecules of the basement membrane both directly and indirectly through a bridging molecule, von Willebrand's factor (vWF).  In disorders of platelet plug formation (primary hemostasis) the site of bleeding is usually superficial such as in the skin, mucous membranes (gingivae, nares, genitourinary tract). Petechiae are present and ecchymoses is usually small, superficial. Hemarthroses, muscle hematomas are rare in such cases. However, bleeding after minor cuts is more common than those with defective coagulation. Bleeding after surgery is usually immediate and mild in those with primary hemostasis abnormalities.  Lab tests used to evaluate primary hemostasis include a complete blood count (CBC) with platelet count. Bleeding time when prolonged in the presence of a normal platelet count and the absence of aspirin (or other NSAID) intake may suggest a platelet function abnormality or a von Willebrand's factor (vWF) deficiency.  in contrast, those with disorders of coagulation (secondary hemostasis) are more likely to have bleed more deeply in the soft tissues (joints, muscles). Petechiae are absent, while ecchymoses are large and palpable. Hemarthroses, muscle hematomas are more common in coagulation diseases, while bleeding after minor cuts usually indicates an abnormality in primary hemostasis. Bleeding after surgery is usually delayed and severe in coagulation disorders.  In the evaluation of secondary hemostasis (coagulation), the aPTT, PT and INR tests all estimate the time required for clot formation after activation of anticoagulated blood in the lab. They are used as a screening test for coagulation factor defects.  Factor XIII deficiency is a rare disorder but requires a specific assay (eg, clot urea stability).  From your post you say that all your blood tests have come out normal? Your platelet counts are normal? Your bleeding time is normal? Did you get a von Willebrand's disease (vWD) screen? Have you had a PT and aPTT done?  My concern is that your joint / muscle pain could be the result of a internal bleeding in the joints or muscles for example.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The presence of persistant thrombocytopenia in the range you have described will require a bone marrow biopsy to reach a diagnosis.   Generally speaking thrombocytopenia can be due to defective production in the bone marrow or due to rapid destruction (usually by immune destruction).   Diagnosis of a platelet production defect is readily established by examination of a bone marrow aspirate and biopsy.   The finding of a reduction in the total cellularity of the marrow, along with a decrease in megakaryocytes, implies aplastic or hypoplastic anemia. This may result from drug toxicity.   A marrow that is fibrosed or infiltrated with leukemic or other malignant cells represents the syndrome of pancytopenia from infiltrated marrow.  After excluding diseases of the bone marrow the clinician should exclude the possibility of hypersplenism.  Certain non-immunologic causes of rapid platelet destruction include disseminated intavascular coagulation, preeclampsia, vasculitis, thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, hemolytic-uremic syndrome among other things.  Finally immunological destruction of platelets as occurs in conditions such as Idiopathic thrombocytopenia purpura (ITP) should be excluded.  Best regards.\n\n",

Her dr is sending her to a hematology consult but in the meanwhile I was hoping someone could tell me what these numbers could indicate.   Her history is gallbladder problems (stones) and she recently had a mass show on a mammogram but was told it was a benign cyst.  She is going this week to a surgeon for another opinion on that. Also her Aunt had leukemia years ago if that is an important detail.

    "content": "Hello,  I hope that your mother is feeling well by now.  Lymphocytes are small, mononuclear cells that migrate to areas of inflammation in both early and late stages of the process. They play an important role in immunologic reactions.  Normal lymphocyte count is in the rage between 16-45% of white blood cells (WBCs). Increased lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) in adults is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count greater than 4,000/mm3.   Lymphocytosis can be either primary or secondary. The reactive, or secondary, lymphocytoses are conditions that involve absolute increases in lymphocytes caused by physiologic or pathophysiologic responses to infection (especially viral), inflammation, toxins, cytokines, or unknown agents.  Lymphocytosis is also associated with stress and consequent release of epinephrine, such as that seen in patients who have had cardiovascular collapse, septic shock, sickle cell crisis, status epilepticus, trauma, major surgery, drug reactions, or hypersensitivity. Persistent lymphocytosis may be seen in patients with autoimmune disorders, sarcoidosis, hyposplenism, or cancer and in those who are long-term cigarette smokers.  Primary lymphocytosis, often called lymphoproliferative disease, include the leukemias, the lymphomas, and monoclonal B cell lymphocytosis.  Primary bone marrow disorders should be suspected in patients who present with extremely elevated white blood cell counts or concurrent abnormalities in red blood cell or platelet counts. Weight loss, bleeding or bruising, liver, spleen or lymph node enlargement, and immunosuppression also increase suspicion for a marrow disorder.[1]  Her doctor wants to rule out the primary bone marrow disorders outlined above, the reason being the progressive nature of her leukocytosis and the presence of persistant absolute lymphocytosis.

    "content": "My husband is 44 yrs old.  He works in a lab for a aluminum company testing samples.  He just recently had his physical at work and his hematocrit came back elevated.  He does not smoke, drink or use any type of drugs.  He is exposed to different types of dangerous chemicals each day.  When he received the results he called the medical department.  The nurse told him that the elevated hematocrit was nothing to worry about.  But today the medical dept. called him and said that the doctor wanted to repeat the test again because of the elevation.  The only meds he takes is Micardis HCT 80/12.5, Effexor XR 150 mgs, and Zeita all on a daily basis.  Should we be concerned because of this test and because of his exposure to the chemicals.  Thanks so much for your input.  msdi\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  As I mentioned in another post, polycythemia is the term used to describe an abnormal increase in the number of RBCs. This condition leads to an increase in Hb, Hct, or RBC in the blood count test.   The evaluation of polycythemia involves first the exclusion of relative polycythemia hemoconcentration that results from decreased plasma volume in conditions such as dehydration.  Secondary polycythemia can arise due to an appropriate bone marrow response to decreased tissue oxygenation, such as: high altitude, cardiopulmonary disorder and increased affinity for oxygen.   Secondary polycythemia with normal tissue oxygenation may result from benign renal lesions (renal artery stenosis, renal cysts, hydronephrosis, nephrocalcinosis, transplant rejection, etc.); neoplasms (renal, hepatic, ovarian, adrenal, cerebellar); endocrinopathies (Cushing's syndrome, pheochromocytoma).  Primary polycythemia or polycythemia vera is a myeloproliferative disorder in which the production of RBCs is not controlled by and is independent of erythropoietin. Besides an elevated hematocrit, patients with this disease also have leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, splenomegaly, and a hypercellular bone marrow with trilinear hyperplasia. In early stages, however, a high hematocrit may be the only manifestation.   In the absence of dehydration, a hematocrit greater than 60% is always associated with an increase of RBC mass and is diagnostic of polycythemia. For hematocrit values of 50% to 60%, the diagnosis of polycythemia requires direct measurement of the RBC mass. An RBC mass greater than 32 ml/kg in women and 35 ml/kg body weight in men confirms the diagnosis of polycythemia.   Once the diagnosis of true polycythemia is established, the major differential diagnosis centers between polycythemia vera and secondary polycythemia.  In your husbands condition it would important to know the hematocrit level? If all the other results came back normal or not? Does he have long-term exposure to benzene?  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  An elevated white blood cell count typically reflects the normal response of bone marrow to an infectious or inflammatory process (tissue necrosis, infarction, burns, arthritis).   Stress such as overexertion, seizures, anxiety, anesthesia can also lead to leukocytosis.   Drugs that cause leukocytosis include (corticosteroids, lithium, beta agonists).   Trauma such as splenectomy; hemolytic anemia; leukemoid malignancy can all lead to elevated leukocytic counts.   Occasionally, leukocytosis is the sign of a primary bone marrow abnormality in white blood cell production, maturation or death (apoptosis) related to a leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder (acute leukemias, chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders).  An increase in neutrophils is the most common cause of an elevated white blood cell count, but other subpopulations of cells (eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) can also give rise to increased leukocyte numbers.  The fact that your counts have remained stable for a whole year is a good sign. However, at one stage it would probably be better to get a bone marrow biopsy done.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lymphocytes are small, mononuclear cells that migrate to areas of inflammation in both early and late stages of the process. They play an important role in immunologic reactions.  Normal lymphocyte count is in the rage between 16-45% of white blood cells (WBCs). Increased lymphocytes (lymphocytosis) in adults is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count greater than 4,000/mm3.  It is necessary to distinguish between absolute and relative lymphocytosis. Absolute lymphocytosis may be defined as an increase in blood lymphocytes above 4,000/mm3. Relative lymphocytosis occurs when there is an increased percentage of circulating lymphocytes, but the absolute number does not exceed 4,000/mm3.  Relative, rather than absolute, leukocytosis occurs in a number of clinical situations, such as infancy, viral infections, connective tissue diseases, thyrotoxicosis and Addison's disease. Splenomegaly causes relative lymphocytosis as a result of splenic sequestration of granulocytes.  What you have is very mild relative lymphocytosis. I wouldn't worry about it either.  As for your second question, for many lab tests there are many different lab kits / counter machines being used. That is why your results should always be interpreted within the context of the normal range specified in the test results.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Cyclic neutropenia is a rare congenital granulocytopoietic disorder. It may be inherited in an autosomal dominant fashion.   Cyclic neutropenia can occur sporadically, but there are families in which cyclic neutropenia is inherited with one parent and more than one child affected. They are usually diagnosed before the age of 10.   As the name indicates, in this disease neutrophil counts show irregular, periodic oscillations in the number of peripheral neutrophils with a typical cycle length of 21 \u00b1 3 days. These cycles vary from patient to patient with some individuals being neutropenic during the whole cycle and others who have low neutrophil counts for only a few days and normal blood counts during the rest of the cycle.   The frequency of bacterial infections depends on the length of the neutropenic period that the patient experiences. Those who have a longer neutropenic period within the cycle suffer more frequently from infections compared to patients who have only short neutropenic phases.   Cyclic neutropenia is suspected if infections (typically aphthous stomatitis - inflammation and ulceration of the mouth) occur frequently in approximately 3-week intervals. A serial differential blood counts is needed (at least 3 times per week over six weeks) to search for the typical cyclical pattern of blood neutrophils in this disease.   Almost all patients with clinically obvious cyclic neutropenia have periods of severe neutropenia (ANC less than 200 cells/\u00b5l) (0.2 x 109/l) every 3 weeks showing some symptoms with almost every cycle, but significant infections (e.g. otitis media, pneumonia and bacteraemia) usually are infrequent.   Cyclic neutropenia occurs because of fluctuating rates of cell production by the bone marrow stem cells. In contrast to other causes for neutropenia, in this condition the marrow changes during the cycle, between normal appearance and that of severe maturation arrest of neutrophil production.   Other blood cells, such as platelets or red cells can also show oscillations with a cyclical pattern.   Glucocorticoids and G-CSF treatment prevent the episodic neutropenia and reduce infectious complications in some patients. Rigorous oral hygiene and judicious use of antibiotics at the nadir of the ANC are indicated. No predisposition to hematologic malignancies has been reported.   The underlying genetic defect of cyclic neutropenia has recently been discovered. This might lead to new therapeutical approaches for cyclic neutropenia patients in the future.  I would recommend you discuss this possibility with your doctor and to refer your son to a pediatric hematologist if he experiences cyclic infections.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to the results you have posted you have two elevated parameters: The monocytic count and the platelet count.  Monocytes circulate in the blood and then enter the tissue and terminally differentiate into tissue macrophages, which are important antigen-presenting cells.   Normal monocyte count ranges from about 4-10% of white blood cells (WBCs).   Monocytosis (increased monocytes) may occur in infectious protozoal diseases (malaria, kala-azar, trypanosomiasis), rickettsial (Rocky Mountain spotted fever, typhus), bacterial infections (subacute bacterial endocarditis, tuberculosis, brucellosis, syphilis).   It may also arise in inflammatory/immune ulcerative colitis, regional enteritis, systemic lupus erythematosus, sarcoidosis.   Congenital Gaucher disease can lead to monocytosis.  Neoplastic monocytic leukemia, myeloid metaplasia, recovery from agranulocytosis can all lead to increased level of monocytes.  Platelets are primarily responsible for initial hemostasis by aggregation at the sites of endothelial damage. The platelet plug is then stabilized by fibrin deposition from activated coagulation. Normal platelet count ranges from 130,000-400,000/mm3.  Increased platelet count (thrombocytosis or thrombocythemia). Platelets respond like an acute-phase reactant to tissue injury and many acute infections. Hence, thrombocytosis can result from acute infections; inflammatory/immune diseases (rheumatoid arthritis); mechanical causes/trauma (burns, postsplenectomy); metabolic/toxic causes (exercise, cirrhosis, iron deficiency).  On the other hand, it can also be caused by neoplastic and myeloproliferative diseases (polycythemia vera, essential thrombocythemia, myelocytic leukemia) or vascular hemorrhage.   If the causes above are excluded and your condition persists, your doctor may request a bone marrow biopsy to exclude bone marrow disorders.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Ferritin is normally found mainly inside of cells, with only a small amount in the blood. When there is damage to organs that contain ferritin (especially the liver, spleen, and bone marrow), ferritin levels can become elevated even though the total amount of iron in the body is normal.   A repeat determination of serum ferritin should therefore be carried out after acute hepatocellular damage has subsided, eg, in alcoholic liver disease.[1]  Please keep us updated.

Went to doctor .. complaints of diarrhea, headache, constant hunger( eat dinner and be hungry again within the hour if that)dizziness, confusion(described as cloudy feeling... kinda like when you have medicine head, also abdominal pain around umbilucus area..   anyways his blood test results came back.  His RBC was 6.1 HG was 20 heamtocrit was 63.3  I know that his RBC will be high due to lack of oxygen, his o2 sat is 87 rest and in low 70's upon exertion.(such as walking).  But is this the cause of HG nad Hematocrit to be high as well?  His Blood Sugar was 59, they said he was hypoglycemic but are testing him on Jan 6th for Diabetes. (Glucose testing after 12 hr fast).   He is scheduled to go to a Hematologist on the 10th and a gastroenterologist after that.    What do you think?  Last year blood test results were also high but cardiologist was not concern with this , his results then were   heamtocrits 59 HG 19.7   what is the concern now? SHould they have been concerned last year?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope your husband is feeling better now.  Polycythemia is the term used to describe an abnormal increase in the number of RBCs. This condition leads to an increase in Hb, Hct, or RBC in the blood count test.   Secondary polycythemia can arise due to an appropriate bone marrow response to physiologic conditions, such as: high altitude, cardiopulmonary disorder and increased affinity for oxygen.  At a moderately raised Hct level of 60%, the whole-blood viscosity is 2.5- to 3-fold that of blood with a Hct of 40%.[1]   Hyperviscosity may lead to headache, fatigue, visual disturbances, and retinopathy.[2]   Thrombosis is the most common cause of mortality in polycythemia, accounting for 29% of the deaths. Cerebral vascular accidents were the most frequent (34%), followed by myocardial infarction (13%) and peripheral arterial occlusion (9%), whereas venous thrombosis accounted for 26% of these events.[3]   In patients with secondary erythrocytosis, corrective action may not be needed unless the Hct is above 60%, except when there are severe symptoms attributable to hyperviscosity. Normalization of Hct in these patients is not desirable because there is a need for extra oxygen-carrying capacity.[4]  An Hct >60% is associated with spontaneous clotting of blood. A Hgb value >20 g/dl leads to clogging of the capillaries as a result of hemoconcentration. Hence urgent management is needed for these patients once the critical level is reached.

    "title": "High WBC and Gradually Getting Higher",
    "content": "Hello,  Approximately 3 yrs. ago my bloodwork showed a high WBC.  Not extremely high (I was told by the primary care physician, but enough to where he wanted me to have it checked out.)  I went to an Hemotologist and he had no specific answer for the elevated WBC. (I had 3 sessions of blood work done over a period of a year)  My WBC during that year remained the same.  3 yrs ago the lab work showed my WBC being 12.0 reference interval 3.8-10.8 and NEU being 7.5 reference interval being 2.0 - 7.0.  This October 2005, I was having some knee surgery and blood was drawn for my pre-op and my primary care noticed my WBC had went up some.  (Again not significantly high, just a few points).  WBC in October was 12.7.  Just a few weeks ago, December 2005 I went to the doctors complaining of fatigue, legs feeling extremely heavy, arms feeling heavy and tired at times but not as much as my legs and just overall feeling exhausted.  He tested my urine and found high protein.  He sent me home to return a week later to test my urine again and it was high then also.  He tested my blood again, to try to figure out the reason for the high protein level.  this time testing for thyroid (I do have a Hypothyroid Disease, Hoshimotos disease and take 250 mg of synthroid for it) Doctor also tested choloesterol, kidney and liver function, iron and a number of other things.  When the test came back everything was fine except my WBC is now at 15 (in less than 2 mos. it has gone up almost 3 points) I don't have any pain or pressure when I urinate (No UTI).  I'm starting to worry about this WBC.  Why would it be going up like that.  From what I know that shows a bacterial infection of some sort or at worst Lukemia.  I do have another appt. with the same hemotologist again soon, but I'm worried.  Some stats on myself:  Age 44, grosly overweight 320lbs., Hypothyroid/hoshimoto disease (it took them 2 1/2 yrs to get my thyroid under control and I am told this is an extreme amount of synthroid 250mgs daily) I retain fluid which i take lasix 40 - 60 mgs daily and I just started welchol 6 pills daily for cholesterol.  I take a multivitivitamin daily and other than feeling tired all the time and the fluid retention (which i contribute my leg pain to) I feel fine.  No depression (which I have had in the past), no stress.  I have arthris in my knees and degenerative disc in my back.  I don't get much exercise anymore but I do push myself to move and at least do my daily chores and go to work.  I smoke 1 1/2 packs a day.  (On the good side of my weight and my smoking, I have seen a nutritionist and am now on my 2nd day of not smoking) Im so tired of feeling tired I know improving these two factors will help a great deal.   My question is, could the high WBC be from and inflamed thyroid, or arthritis?  I have also been told that diabeties can make WBC be high (diabeties runs in my family, my mom and maternal grandmother) I have been checked but I don't have it).  I have symptoms of it, thirst, tired especially after I eat, I urinate alot only for about 3 hrs after my water pill has been taken then hardly none the rest of the day. (kidney was tested by blood work, showed it was fine).  Is there another test I should ask to have done for detecting diabeties, if diabeties is a reason for elevated WBC's.  And bottom line Should I be worried about Lukemia?  I have been good and listening to the Dr's about not worring about the elevation in my WBC, but I can't be good anymore, I am worried.  They say that some people just have higher counts than others, but why would it be gradually going up?  Thank you for your time.  Happy Holidays!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope your condition has been resolved by now.  An elevated white blood cell count typically reflects the normal response of bone marrow to an infectious or inflammatory process (tissue necrosis, infarction, burns, arthritis).  Stress such as overexertion, seizures, anxiety, anesthesia can also lead to leukocytosis.[1,2]   Drugs that cause leukocytosis include (corticosteroids, lithium, beta agonists).[3,4,5]  Trauma such as splenectomy; hemolytic anemia; leukemoid malignancy can all lead to elevated leukocytic counts.   Occasionally, leukocytosis is the sign of a primary bone marrow abnormality in white blood cell production, maturation or death (apoptosis) related to a leukemia or myeloproliferative disorder (acute leukemias, chronic leukemias, myeloproliferative disorders).Leukocytosis usually represents a response to tissue injury or invasion by pathologic organisms. Always inspect the peripheral smear to detect band forms and toxic granulation.  An increase in neutrophils is the most common cause of an elevated white blood cell count, but other subpopulations of cells (eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes and monocytes) can also give rise to increased leukocyte numbers.

    "content": "Hello,  Eosinophils are important in the defense against multicellular parasite infections.  Eosinophilia may be primary or secondary to an underlying disorder. Allergic or atopic diseases are the most common causes, with respiratory and skin diseases most prominent. Eosinophilic drug reactions which are usually asymptomatic, may be associated with interstitial nephritis, serum sickness, cholestatic jaundice, hypersensitivity vasculitis, and immunoblastic lymphadenopathy.  Almost any parasitic infection can elicit eosinophilia, but not protozoa and noninvasive metazoa.  Nonparasitic infections also may be accompanied by eosinophilia. Hodgkin's disease may cause marked eosinophilia, whereas non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, acute lymphoblastic leukemia and chronic myelogenous leukemia are less often accompanied by eosinophilia. Ovarian cancer is the leading solid tumor associated with eosinophilia. Connective tissue disorders with increased circulating immune complexes and vasculitis are often associated with eosinophilia.  I would suggest you do another CBC to check if your esinophilia has resolved or not. Please follow up with your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Leukopenia is defined as a  reduction in the circulating WBC count to < 4000/\u00b5L.  Neutropenia is defined as a reduction in the blood neutrophil (granulocyte) count. This can lead to increased susceptibility to infection.   In whites neutropenia occurs when the neutrophil count is less than 1500/\u00b5L. Blacks have somewhat lower neutrophil counts, the lower limit of normal for them being 1200/\u00b5L.  Neutropenia may be classified by the neutrophil count and the relative risk of infection into mild (1000 to 1500/\u00b5L), moderate (500 to 1000/\u00b5L) and severe neutropenia (< 500/\u00b5L). Acute, severe neutropenia caused by impaired neutrophil production is often life-threatening in immunocompromised patients.  On evaluating a case of neutropenia the first thing is to exclude secondary neutropenia resulting from an external cause.   Causes of secondary neutropenia include drugs, vitamin B12 or folate deficiency, malignancy, bone marrow disease and splenomegaly. Transient neutropenia often accompanies some  infections (eg, early-stage infectious mononucleosis, HIV and sepsis). Autoimmune neutropenias may be associated with the presence of circulating antineutrophil antibodies and may occur in isolation or with associated autoimmune diseases.  After excluding the above causes there remains a category known as primary neutropenia. This form of neutropenia is rare and includes cyclic neutropenia, congenital neutropenia and chronic idiopathic neutropenia.  Monocytopenia occurs with acute infections, with stress, and after treatment with glucocorticoids. Monocytopenia also occurs in aplastic anemia, hairy cell leukemia, acute myeloid leukemia, and as a direct result of myelotoxic drugs.   Are you currently taking any medications? The presence of mild anemia and mild neutropenia in your case could point to an early vitamin B12 or folate deficiency. Are you pregnant? Why did you need to go to a dermatologist? Do you have any autoimmune diseases? Did you have a recent viral infection?  Best regards.\n\n",

Have been to every Dr imagineable. No clue. Then about 4 weeks ago I got undressed one night and noticed that both of my legs from my hips to my calf were bruised. Front and back. 50+ on each leg. I went to the ER and they did blood work which they said came back within the \"normal\" range. WBC 6.5, RBC 4.5, and PLT CT 229. They didnt know what to tell me, so I went back to my Dr a few days later when the bruises had not begun to heal. She sent me to an Oncologist which I am still waiting to see. All of my symptoms include, fever (99 to 101.3 for three weeks straight), fatigue, sore throat, headache, bone and joint pain, excessive bruising, night sweats, and now this morning I found a pea sized lump under my left arm. The bruises have only gotten worse in the past weeks. Every morning I wake up with new ones, they are now on my arms, chest, side, and legs. Please help!!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply. I have tried to limit my movement, but I get bruises from wearing clothes. If I wear jeans, I have a bruise down my leg from the seams. I have to wear tshirts and sweat pants basically all the time but yet I still continue to get new bruises everyday. I am very careful about what I do and I havent done anything out of the ordinary lately that would have caused the bruising. I have never bruised easily. I hate going out in public right now because I have total strangers come up to me asking if someone has beaten me. I don't know what to say to them. I am being seen by an Oncologist on Wednesday, my Dr referred me there 3 weeks ago but I had to wait for my civilian referral to go through. Oh my sed rate on my last blood work was 5. I am guessing that it is normal since the Dr didnt mention anything was wrong. The only thing that was off on all my blood work was my potassium was low. 2.9. Does that make a difference?\n\n",

One of which noone seems to know what it is for PFA 100?? He said that he is trying to rule out all possible blood disorders before looking for something else. He said that he had never seen bruises like mine before and that they were very impressive. Thinks that maybe my platelets arent functioning correctly. My bloodwork had changed slightly from the last time.  WBC before 6.3 now 6.1 RBC before 4.5 now 5.1 PLT CT before 229 now 201  He said that he wasnt very concerned because they were still in the normal range. But he wants to do a ct scan to make sure there isnt anything else going on. Also wants to watch the 3 swollen lymph nodes I have. I under my arm and two in my groin. None of which hurt and are hard as a marble. Still don't know anything so Im still worried. Waiting......\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, At least it seems more apparent to me why your doctor referred you to an oncologist as opposed to a hematologist. It was probably the hard lymph nodes that prompted a referral in that direction. Hardness in a lymph node means that a malignancy should be excluded.  I had also thought about platelet function problems, however, many other hematological diseases need to be excluded.  As to why you do not know anything, its because at this stage your doctor does not know anything either. You will just have to be patient until the results come out.  Please keep us posted.

There are so many factors that can affect or change values.  The reason you may not have got answers on your RDW level may be because the doctor was not concerned about it.  Don't hesitate to call your doctor if after leaving the office and realizing you have questions.  They expect that and that's what they are there for. A high RDW level could indicate Anemia, but there are several different types of Anemia, so talk to your doctor.  You may be worrying for nothing.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Christie, During a bone marrow biopsy/aspiration an anesthetic is injected into the skin (generally the hip or breastbone area) to numb the tissue. Essentially a needle is inserted through the skin into the bone and a small amount of marrow is removed. The test may cause a feeling from dull pressure to a sharp pain and should subside quickly after the procedure is completed. There may be mild tenderness at the site of aspiration but there should not be pain after the procedure. The procedure takes approximately 30 minutes to complete but you may be asked to remain for an additional hour to assure there are no complications such as excessive bleeding etc. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. We sincerely wish you the best. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I'm trying to interrpret by blood test results and make sense of a variety of symptoms that have appeared in the past 4-5 months. I have Fibromyalgia diagnosed 9 years ago, which was realtively under contraol until January. I was still tired and had daily pains, but I got by. Have gone through several MRIs. EMGs, blood tests over the past 4 motnsh for new symptoms. Numbness and tingleing in both upper and lower limbs and lower back. Nothing additional is clear yet, ANA, Rf factor, creactive protein, thyroid, lyme are all normal.  Nothing neuralogical was indicated by the tests  Also, I have over the past few months had svere abdominal cramping, it comes in waves for a few days at a time. It at time is difficult to eat as the pain under my breast bone starts shortly after I start eating. The rheum also tested my B12 level which was 249, this is normal by some standards and low by others it seems.  Is this level an indication of anything?  The other new thing since my last appointment with the rheum is that I'm now two weeks late on my period - and i'm not pregnant.  My last period came a few days earlier than expected and lasted about 4 days longer than normal.   Now I'm wondering if all the symptoms that have begun to flare up are some how connected to hormones.  My sister had premature ovarian failure at 33, the exact cause was never determined yet. (she miraculously got pregnant 6 months after her period stopped)  My next appt with the rhumotologist is in June, and now I proabbly should make appt with my gynecologist as well. I hate waiting for answers.  Thanks Heather\n\n",

In August I started to have upper Back pain witch some times gives me hard time to breath but the most embarrassing thing is that I have some weird symptoms. On my left ear sometimes I hear like a \"whoosh\" and right after I have severe dizziness and I have to sit down or grab the walls not to fell down and break my neck. All my life I had Anemia and the doctor said I am even more anemic due the pregnancy (the suppected me that I have \"thalassemia\" but the hematologist will confirm this the following days) . Is there any relation between the Anemia and the \"whoosh\" sign followed by that enormous dizziness? To be honest with you I'm scared to tell my doctor about the left ear \"whoosh\" noise and the severe dizziness. For the Anemia the doctor prescribed me Palafer CF but I cannot tolerate it and right after I throw out. During all the first pregnancy I was throwing out and this pregnancy I still throw out but a little bit less.  I had a very difficult first pregnancy because of all that nauseas but this one is a little bit worst because of the dizziness and the ear \"whoosh\" noise. Is there anybody can help me understand those symptoms and is there any kind of treatment to follow?  I really need help becuase is starting to scare me...\n\n",

They report \"shadows\" in the cavity or her Gallbladder, which was removed some 15-18 years ago. I am so confused. If someone can help me i would REALLY apprieciate it. I am in need of A doctor's advice. Or someone. I have read up about the blood thing. As far as i can see it was a bad thing she was given the wrong blood type.. WHAT SHOULD I DO?????!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi daughter, First, I would like to extend my sympathies for the loss of your mother. You are correct in your understanding that people with type O+ blood should never receive type A+ blood. Transfusion reactions can be fatal but this would be next to impossible for me to state that this was or was not the cause of her death. My suggestion to you is call the facility administrator and request a peer review of the physician and staff that was providing your mothers care. Also request an unbiased review of the medical records (information contained in the records should be explained at the very least). Although, no matter what you are told, it will not bring her back but it may provide you with some understanding of what may have happened and give you some peace. You then can make your decisions based on the information received. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Low Iron & B12 - Infusions not helping",
    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 41yo white female in central Florida with relativly low stress, married 18 years, 2 adopted children. 7 brothers and sisters all healthy.   I was always a normal weight until I got married in 1986.  I battled back and forth with diets, excercise, etc for 15 years. The highest I've weighed was 226 and that was just 10 months ago.  As I sit here typing this, I am now 135.  I did not try to lose weight. It's just gone.   In June of 2004 I started losing weight, just a few pounds here and there but hadn't altered my eating.  I was getting more excercise at work - walking A LOT.  So I figured that was the reason.  Then I spent much of July vomiting on a daily basis.  I would not get nauseated, it would just happen out of the blue with little warning.  One day when I got sick, I lost a good 8oz of yellow fluid and thought \"Ok NOW we go to the doc\"  My GP sent my blood out for testing and a few days later informed me that I have H Pylori Disease (HPy count was 1660) and that is causing my weight loss (then 40 pounds or so) and vomiting.  They put me on a round of triple antibiotics and I went back 10 days later.  I was still vomiting and down another 11 pounds.  They then sent me to a Gastro Doctor.  He took some blood, did an exam and set me up for an Endoscopy.  That turned out fine, he found no problems.  He said he was concerned with my blood counts and took more blood.  The day after I was to go for a upper and lower bowel series and the following week, a colonoscopy.  The next day I could not hold down the barium and started vomiting quite a bit.  There was a quarter size dollop of blood in the vomit and my husband called the doctor.  They advised us to go to the ER immediatly, the blood work just got back and it was not good.  That was August 19th 2004 (in between Hurricanes no less)  I was in the hospital for 9 days.  I had every test imaginable, colonoscopy, MRI's and/or Catscans of my brain chest and stomach, doppler radar (or something like that...) on my legs, Sonograms & a Bone Marro Biopsy (what a joy that was, I'd rather have 3 colonoscopies)   I bet I also gave them 10 pints of blood while I was there.     I never saw the same attending twice.  It was so confusing, my Gastro Doctor came in twice but I barely remember it.  He pretty much cleared me of any Intestional problems. The doctor that released me had a good 10 min talk with myself, my husband and my father in law before I left.  Not one of us understood a thing he said.  The nurse in the room also didn't understand.  I followed up with one of the Hemotologists that saw me while there.  I know that my SED rate was as high as 93.  My Hemoglobin was as low as 7 and my iron was at 6.  I don't remember my Hematacrit.... I do have the documentation though.  All tests except bloodwork came back normal or near normal.  One of my stomach scans did show an enlarged spleen.  They ruled out any cancers.  They told me I had severe iron and B12 deficiency and had to have Iron Infusions & B12 shots starting immediatly until my iron levels increased. They discussed the possibility of a Blood Transfusion but I've never had one.  Last week I had my 7th Iron Infusion and 10th B12 shot.  My iron is at 12 as I type this.  I am constantly weak.  I get dizzy if I bend over to do something and stand up again. I'm pale with dark circles under my eyes and I'm just tired of all this.  My hemotologist suggested I may have Celiac Sprue, I've looked that up and have NONE of the symptoms except Anemia.  I don't know how much more of this I can take.  I know there was no iron in my marrow at all.  I know my body won't absorb it.  I eat foods rich in iron, I take iron & b12 supplements as well as my monthly infusions.  I continue to lose weight at about 10 pounds a month.  I have little or no appetite and I have zero strength & energy.  My family is worried, my employers and employees are worried and quite frankly, so am I.  There has got to be something someone missed.  I don't know where else to turn. Can someone please shed some light on this mystery.  I would be so very grateful.  Thank you for your time.  Ironless in Orlando\n\n",

    "title": "33 yr old, PE, blood clot different doctor opinions",
    "content": "Hello.  I am 33 years old, finishing 6 mths of coumadin. I had a blood clot in a superficial vein in left thigh, 6 mths ago that resulted in a signficant PE in my right lung.  I was taking Yasmin birth control pills at the time but also fould out that my sister (36 yrs old) had a blood clot, in her calf, at age 16 (cause was never determined and she was not on any medication at the time).  She did not have any blood tests at the time.   I'mf having all the blood tests done to determine any clotting disorder.  The hematologist I saw said that even if my tests show a positive result for a clotting disorder, he will not recommend anti-coagulation therapy.  He cited an article in a 2004 Hematology journal (that was also presented at the Hematology conference in 2004) that said positive clotting  disorders do not dictate the need for long term anti-coagulation therapy.  He said that stopping the birth control pills, which is a reversible risk factor, along with a baby asprin and vitamin each day should be my treatment.    I also have a family friend, who is a hematologist, that has been monitoring my situation.  He lives in a different state so he can't be my doctor.  He said, that for his patients in my situation, he would wait for the tests results to make an assessment but if  I do have a clotting disorder, he would most likely recommend anti-coagulant therapy (depending on the test etc).  And completely disagreed with the other Hematologist's recommendations - other than stopping birth control pills.  He was also surprised that the other doctor said to wait 4 weeks after taking the coumadin to finish the blood tests.  I am very conflicted about the different opinions.  Obviously, I will wait until I get  the tests results (if negative, then the opinion difference isn't an issue) but if something comes back positive, I'm not sure who  to believe.  I will most likely see another Hematologist, but I'll probably still be conflicted on what to do.  What would be your recommendations for a patient in my case?\n\n",

    "title": "duration of anticoagulation post DVT",
    "content": "The gold standard for anticoagulation guidelines come from a journal called CHEST.  These guidelines are based on credible trials that are reviewed by the an editorial board at CHEST.  The latest guidelines from CHEST (published in 9/04) suggest several  things based on your potential risk factors:  If your blood work comes back with either a Factor V Leiden mutation or a prothrombin 20210A mutation, there is a study called PREVENT (authored by Ridker et al. in the New England Journal of Medicine(NEJM) in 2003) which did a subgroup analysis of patients with these clotting disorders.  Their findings suggest 2 years of anticoagulation (warfarin) therapy reduced the incidence of VTEs by 6.4%.  If your blood comes back positive for an antiphospholipid antibody, there is a study called DURAC (authored by Schulman et al in the NEJM in 1997) which did a subgroup analysis of  patients with this clotting disorders.  This study recommended a longer course of anticoagulation  treatment based on the increased incidence of recurrent VTE in these patients  The CHEST guidelines, therefore, recommend an anticoagulation treatment of 12 months for patients with these clotting disorders, and they suggest that indefinite anticoagulation therapy may be appropriate.    Discuss these guidelines with your doctors, and pick a treatment plan that makes sense to you based on the trials that have been done so far.  Good luck.  Dr. S, PharmD\n\n",

    "title": "Neutropenia",
    "content": "2 years ago, my primary care physician ordered routine blood work.  My CBC showed an absolute neutrophil count of 0.5 with 1.4-6.5 being the established normals.  My platelet count was slightly low at 135,000.  Subsequent CBC's sometimes also showed a drop in Hgb and Hct (but within normal range). A hematology oncologist found no significant results in a CT scan, serum protein electrophoresis, ESR, flow cytometry, CMP + LDH.  With neutropenia as the only diagnosis, the oncologist suggested bone marrow aspiration, but also said that I may just be on the low side of the \"bell-shaped curve\" which constitutes \"normal\".  I have not yet had a bone marrow aspiration, but my primary care doctor is encouraging me to.  I have also recalled when reading about neutropenic conditions that I have worked with such chemicals as benzene and toluene with no real protection, radioactive Iodine-125 used to iodinate proteins used in hormone assays and I have had numerous mammograms trying to identify microcalcifications in my breast.   I will see the oncologist on August 24 to discuss whether I should still pursue the bone marrow aspiration.  I would love to hear what another Dr. might offer about my case.\n\n",

As you may already know, hairy cell leukemia is a chronic leukemia with dramatic response rates to several forms of chemotherapy. One of two drugs are usually chosen as initial therapy: either cladribine (Leustatin) or pentostatine (Nipent). They have response rates in the range of 80-90% (meaning, 90% of patients respond favorably to this form of treatment). Most patients remain disease-free 10 years after treatment with these purine analogs. Other viable options for treatment include: Interferon alfa and splenectomy. Your neutropenia could be expected to increase initially, especially with cladribine as a side effect to chemotherapy.  Please keep us posted and best wishes for a quick recovery!\n\n",

On Saturday I will receive a shot of Neulastin to boost my WBC and then I'll have a CBC every Monday to watch for remission.  I'm thankful there are such great treatments out there and I'm diagnosed at about the mean age of 52 (I'm 53).  I am in a very special group as it is very uncommon in women.  I've heard of one person who has had the disease for 30+ years, but is now relapsed and in need of the more experimental BL-22.  I am already a political activist and foresee  supporting the HCL cause.  Because it is rare, there is no government funding for research programs. Thanks for your interest.  I have found great support in another forum specifically for HCL.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello to anyone watching this forum, And thanks again to Rntdj.  Are you an oncology nurse?  You seem to have a wealth of knowledge.  I'm done with my Cladribine infusions, received a Neulasta shot yesterday and am starting to have a mild fever and joint pains as the malignant cells are being killed.  I feel confident this treatment is working.  It's a little tougher than what I presented to friends and family, but it feels like everything in my life thus far has brought me to this point and I will have the strength in me to do this.  My husband talks about how we'll look at this as we grow older--the before and the after.  When I'm relatively pain free, I feel a strange euphoria.  Probably just \"chemo-head\", ha ha!!!  This is a whole new world.\n\n",

As for knowledge, sometimes I feel like a very small fish in a very large ocean with so much to learn  but thank you. Sometimes illness gives you a different outlook or view so the approaches, decisions, and appreciations are taken less for granted (if that makes sense). I am glad to hear that you have a good support system with your family as this is an important encouragement. Now, since you are fevered, and have recently finished your chemo, you should promptly notify your physician and I will watch for future posts from you about your progress   Our best wishes.

    "content": "Hello, I am 26 days post 2CdA treatment for Hairy Cell Leukemia.  I feel great and after receiving a \"return to work with limitations\"  letter from my oncologist on October 27th, I did return on October 31st. I work in a hospital laboratory and  the limitations were not clear nor was there a defined time line for when the limitations would cease.  When I asked for clarification, my oncologist wrote a new letter which I received on Nov. 9th which says that I may return to work \"when my blood counts recover in 1-2 weeks\".  I work part time and have already covered 3 shifts before I got the second letter.  My WBC on October 31st was 1.9 with Absolute neutrophil count at 0.7.  Nov. 9th , WBC was 2.2 with Absolute neutrophil count at 0.7.  Before I was diagnosed, my absolute neutrophil count was as low as 0.5 and I was never restricted from work.    I feel I have had no guidance in this matter.  I'm sure I'm not the first person who has returned to work after chemo, so why is this so difficult?  I work for a small hospital in a large hospital system and I think they are already frustrated with the lack of clarity on my return to work.  Our laboratory is currently short staffed which is why I planned to return to work as soon as I could.    I don't want to put myself in jeopardy, but I'm so frustrated that I'm not being helped in this matter.  I called my oncologist's office when I received the second letterand heard nothing back.  What can I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi edcarta, Even though your cell counts were low prior to the chemotherapy the reason for a little more concern after beginning a regimen is because you may be even more susceptible to infection. Chemo not only destroys the cancer cells but some of the \"good\" cells as well. I would suggest that you make a specific list of requirements needed by your employer, for instance, how many hours you may work, what activity restrictions are evident, etc. As for a time frame, this could be listed as a preliminary time frame pending on the chemotherapy course and adjusted or changed as necessary. Take the list into the physician's office or call and speak with the nurse (not the receptionist) etc., as sometimes messages may get delayed or undelivered. In my opinion, the physician is probably unsure of exactly what your particular employer is expecting. I hope this was somewhat helpful and we are glad to hear that your treatment is going well  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "hi there,  im not a doctor or nurse but thought i would reply to your post. did your doc talk to you about your blood test results? since the EBV tests came back positive it sounds like you have EBV infection. it stands for epstein barr virus and causes the glandular fever illness or 'mono' as its called in the US. all of your symptoms sound like glandular fever, the dizzyness, headaches, rapid heartbeat, weakness, hot and cold thing, loss of appetite and the rest... also your recent post says you have red spots at the back of your mouth. this is common with glandular fever and sometimes you can get tonsilitis with it. if you develop white spots in your mouth then you have tonsilitis and should go back to your doctor so they could give you antibiotics. i know about glandular fever caused by EBV because ive had it twice so thought i would reply.  it can make you feel very poorly for a while, you need to rest up and take painkillers and take it easy for a while. its very important you don't push yourself so you give yourself time for your body to heal. it seems to vary from person to person how long it takes. you metioned the pain on the left side below your ribs, this could be an enlarged spleen which can happen with glandular fever and also an enlarged liver (this is on the other side under your ribs). on websites they say that the enlarged spleen should go down after a few weeks and you must avoid physical sports for at least 6 weeks to avoid any damage, but obviously since your feeling so unwell you probably wouldnt feel like doing anything like that! im not a haematologist but your blood counts look like thay are within the normal range of normal. maybe you could get your doctor to give you a letter or confirming that you have glandular fever from EBV and you could take time off work or college?  good luck and take care!

I have allergies to several things, including about six antibiotics and take Allegra and Singulair daily to control allergies. I also have Raynaud's.   I recently went in to have sinus surgery and had the pre-op blood tests come back abnormal. I have had several surgeries prior to this one and never had this happen. The pt/inr was prolonged. I was sent to a hematologist/oncologist and he has done two repeat pt/ptt along with cbc and ana and seratonin.   ANA was negative and the first cbc showed a low wbc. However the second cbc showed that the wbc had resolved itself, but then the Hemoglobin was high(15.6) and the albumin levels were high, as well (5.4).   He gave a vitamin K shot and did a repeat pt/ptt and that did not fix the clotting problem. He decided to give a higher dose of Vitamin K and retest next week.   I am more concerned over the elevated hemoglobin and albumin?? He mentioned something about Stress Erythrocytosis or doing a Lupus coagulation study?  Any ideas??   Thank you for the time.\n\n",

The only thing that appears wrong is that I do not have any iron stores in my bone marrow and I'm not able to get it from food or supplements.  Because they could not find any bleeding, I am starting IV iron on Friday.  My doctor seems to think he can get me up to around 13!!!  I will not know what to do with all the energy.

I talked to him over the phone and he just told me few results:  haemoglobin- 8.1 white blood cell count- 1.4 neutrophils- 0.55  he said that he would put me on folic acid for a month and then if i was still anaemic then it was probably my bone marrow. he said my folic acid was a bit low-160 but this is slightly up on last time (152) and yet hb dropped from 10.5 to 8.1 in space of 2 weeks. if it was my folic acid it doesnt make sense that it is a bit higher and yet more aneamic. my liver protein and albumin is a bit high too.  Its weird im not feeling stressed really, i just think i know that things are really not right. I could have leukaemia couldnt i?

Only one result came out abnormal.  Here are the specifics: WBC  5.8  (4.0-10.0) RBC  4.85 high (3.80-4.80) Hemoglobin 140  (120-150) Hematocrit   0.41 (0.35-0.43) MCV 84  (82-98) MCH 28.9  (27.5-33.5) MCHC 343  (320-360) RDW 13.1  (11.5-14.5) Neutrophils 3.1  (2.0-7.5) Lymphocytes 2.1  (1.0-3.0) Monocytes .3  (0.1-1.0) Eosinophils 0.2  (0.0-0.5) Basophils 0.0  (0.0-0.2) Platelet Count 263  (150-400)  I've never registered high in RBC before but my blood platelet count was registering abnormally high over a year period about three years ago.  I kept having to be retested as it went as high as 423 then it gradually came down into the 300 range and now it is 273.  I am a 48 year old female and in pretty good health otherwise.  When I asked my doctor what this slight elevation in RBC meant she said she didn't know and didn't offer any suggestions.  Could you? Sincerely, Pandora\n\n",

RBC levels may be elevated due to smoking, high altitudes, carbon monoxide exposure, kidney, heart disease, bone marrow dysfunction, etc., etc. In my opinion since your RBC level is only slightly elevated and all of your other lab values are with in normal limits, I would rate little significance to this level. Indications of disease states or dysfunction more often exhibit more than one abnormality. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I recently had two CBC's performed at two different labs. The first CBC was performed in an emergency room when I was there for severe abdominal pain (found out I have kidney stones). My RBC count there was 7.27 (with the normal range being up to 7.0). The second test was administered by my doctor at Lab Corp. My RBC count there (about four days after the emergency room visit) was 5.96 (with the normal range ending at 5.6). My doctor also tested for EPO levels (normal), TIBC (normal), Hb (normal), HCT (normal), MCV (normal), cell morphology (normal). basically all my CBC values were normal except for the RBC count. My doctor says he suspects polycythemia vera. Are my RBC's really that high?   I have been chronically dehydrated my adult life (now I am drinking 1 gallon H2O per day). I have type 2 diabetes, Metabolic Syndrome, Hashimoto's. I take Altace (2.5 mg), Levoxyl, Metformin (2x day). I recently had my blood pressure go up to 150/110. I am seeing my Dr. about the spike in blood pressure. I have had a headache for 2 days now and can't seem to shake it.   Does this sound like polycythemia vera? Everything I have read about it really scares me. I'm 41 with a wife and 2 small children. I am a former smoker (quit in 1988) and recently underwent lithotripsy.\n\n",

    "content": "Actually,  no, to me this does not definitely sound like PV, but I am not a doctor, just someone who went through all the testing for PV including a Red Cell Mass study and a Bone Marrow Biopsy only to find out I did not have PV.  Usually one will see increases in HCT and HGB in addition to Red Cells, and also sometimes increases in WBC and platelets.  I think it's too early to know if you have PV, or relative polycythemia or anything at all in addition to your kidney stone problem.  I am your same age with same family status and was scared at first.  I've since found out that the statistics you see on the web are years old and based on a much older population.  PVers now tend to live normal or near-normal lifespans.  Although many say the Bone Marrow Biopsy is the gold standard in testing for PV (soon to be replaced with the JAK mutation test of some sort), I actually learned something interesting from the Red Cell Mass study.  In spite of drinking a gallon of water per day (something I've done for 10+ years), I have a slight dehydration showing in my plasma levels, making my red cell lines appear higher than they actually are.  A bone marrow biopsy confirmed that I do not have PV.  Testing and testing through a hem/onc can get scary...and sometimes things are found that you weren't ever expecting to find.  Happened to me.  But I don't have PV!\n\n",

    "title": "Abnormal CBC's for over 3 yrs with no diagnosis in sight",
    "content": "**I tried to keep this short but its over 3 yrs of treatment.  I am 34, female, 6' and weigh 300lbs, I smoke (13 yrs), do not drink, no drugs or sex (other than my weight no risky behavoir).  I have had abnormal CBC's for the last 3 yrs that I know of.  I say that because I have always had chronic URI's and bronchitis so I have assumed they never caught them before.  About 2yrs before it drew attention I had some joint pain in my shoulder and later my ankle.  I went to the dr several times for a lump in my ankle and after about 7 months I had surgery to remove a mass which turned out to be a benign tumor of unknown origin.    I had several bad infections and then around 11/3 I had pain in my knees that got worse and worse with swelling.  It was when the Orthopedic dr ran a CBC to confirm I had RA (I do not have marker) that he refused to treat me because of CBC, he believed I had multiple myeloma.  This started my last few years of hell.    CBC results 11/2  WBC 33, RBC 7.6,  HGB 17, HCT 53.5, MCV 81.3, MCH 28.0, RDW 18.5, MCHC 37, RDW 17.5, Platelet 245, MPV 12.8, Neutrophils 69.2, lymphocytes 23.5, Eosinophils 68.3, Basophils 1.4, RBC Morph Normal, SED rate 2   CBC 7/3 WBC 16.3, RBC 6.31, HGB 17, HCT 51.6, MCV 81.8,  MCH 27, MCHC 33, RDW 15.5, Platelet 235, MPV 11.5, lymphocytes 21.9 (everything else was in normal range)  Over the next few months my pain worsened and I became increasingly fatigued. My PCP continued to treat me, running tests and sending me to experts and ruling out fibromyalgia, lupis and lukemia.  I went from vicodin to percodan for the pain 4 times a day and by 4/3 I was unable to work.  I went to the Mayo clinic and was not successful in getting any diagnosis.    I was treated in Vegas by a Hematologist for 6 months and he did a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy as well as a lymph node biopsy because MRI and CAT scans showed I had enlarged nodes and cysts throughout my chest stomach and pelvis areas.  By this time the dr's were treating my orthopedic problem and blood problem separately and unrelated.  My biopsies were consulted on by a dr in Bethesda at the naval hospital, one at the CDC, and one at the ACRC as well as one from a CD foundation.  All said the biopsies were \"non conclusive\" and my hematologist told me that I had lymphoma somewhere and it would just take time to show up.  The hematologist treated me until my insurance ran out in 1/04.   I had stopped taking all medication 8/3 because I could not afford them (I had been on glucophage, xanax, trazadone, lasix, prozac, and percodan).  I took vitamins and watched my diet and literally forced myself to be active and ignore any discomfort.     Gradually I was able to cope with the pain and was not getting as sick as I felt I normally did in the past but without insurance I did not see any dr until 4/5 at which time I had all my records sent to him and he ordered a CBC which came back as before, and he reordered the cbc insisting it had to be in error (as the PCP before).    CBC 4/5   WBC 18, RBC 6.7, HCT 52.1....all very similar to the first.  I was very upset and even a little shocked because I honestly thought I was doing better.  He sent me to another Hematologist whose partner was the first one I saw back in 2002 who dismissed me as being \"too large\" to examine.  I went to his partner only because I was assured they were the best in town.  He examined me, ran a CBC and informed me its all because I'm fat.  I am 6' and weigh 300lbs.  I know this is not healthy but I do not have any heart, liver or kidney problems at all and have been told repeatedly how surprisingly good everything is in light of my CBC's.  When I went in I told this dr I had just finished Zpac for a sinus infection and was on my third day of Clarithamyacin because it had worsened (I am now on my 8th day of my 3rd course of antibiotics for the infection).  CBC 8/1 WBC 22, WBC 6.7, HCT 58.2, MCV 84.2, MCH 29, MCHC 34, MPV 12.9, platelets 320, Neutrophils 71.0, Lymphocytes 21.7, RBC morph normal. SED 1  I began having pain in my ankle again and told my dr who said it was a slight sprain.  That was in 4/5.  The lump is now about the size of a golf ball and I went to an ortho dr who, after seeing my records and knowing about the previous tumor and how it did not show up on X-rays as anything more than a mass, told me I have arthritis and its only a bone spur (they did not touch my ankle and only looked at it from about 2 feet away).  I mentioned this to the Hematologist and he said as the one before him that my joint pain and problems have nothing to do with my blood tests and my fatigue and other symptoms.  This lump causes my ankle to be very sore and (not constantly but about once a week or so) I can hardly walk on it it hurts so bad.  It is also obvious enough that my coworkers have asked about it and it is not a soft lump it is hard like the one I had removed before. The one I had removed the dr said he had never seen anything like it, he had thought it was bone but it was a tumor.  I have been as forthcoming and honest as I can be about everything that has happened over the last few years. I do not expect a diagnosis or even a guess.  I just wanted to put out everything that has happened in hopes that maybe someone could advise me of what to do if the dr's are basically refusing to treat me.  These are not imagined ailments, even though I feel as if they are at times.  Dr's get very excited and optimistic at first and quickly get stumped and brush me aside.  I have finally found another job that I like very much and I don't want anything to jeopardize it but over the last 6 months many of my original symptoms have started to return.  Please, where do I go from here?\n\n",

    "content": "No.   Every test I have had has been (according to my dr) inconclusive.  He said that is strange because usually they can completely rule out lymphoma, but in my case the biopsies  are negative but symptomatic so they ruled out myeloma and castlemans disease but came right back to lymphoma.  I've never heard of Polycythemia Rubra Vera and I just googled it.  I have never had bleeding problems before and I don't think my spleen is enlarged, I know my liver is slightly but my spleen wasnt mentioned.  This current Hematologist seems positive all my problems are because of my weight, even though I have itching spells, pain in my bones, trouble swallowing, extreme tiredness, and chronic infections. I just finished the 3rd course of anitbiotics for my sinus infection and I still don't feel to good.  I will ask him about this though. thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-- An elevated white blood count can( a possibility, not an absolute) be an idicator of some cancers.  I would immediately go to a hemotologist or oncologist.   What is a white blood cell count?         White blood cells are cells of the immune system, responsible for protecting the body from infection and malignancy.  A white blood cell count (WBC) is ordered to check whether the number of white cells in the blood is abnormally high or abnormally low.  Patients with a low WBC are at increased risk for infectious disease.  Normal WBC count is 4.8 to 10.8 thousand WBC per microliter of blood.  Low WBC may indicate:  Overwhelming Infection  AIDS  Certain Cancers   Treatment for Cancer (either radiation or chemotherapy)  High WBC may indicate:  Infection  Leukemia   What is a differential blood count?         In a differential blood count (Diff), the numbers of different types of white blood cell are measured, to aid in a variety of diagnoses.   There are 5 different types of white blood cell:  Neutrophils  Lymphocytes  Monocytes  Eosinophils  Basophils  Normal ranges for a Diff are:  Neutrophils: 3150 to 6200 neutrophils per microliter of blood  Lymphocytes: 1500 to 3000/uL  Monocytes: 300 to 500/uL  Eosinophils: 50 to 250/uL  Basophils: 15 to 50/uL  High neutrophil count can indicate:  Infection  Certain Types of Cancer  Arthritis  Physical Stress to the body, such as following:  Surgery  Trauma  Heart Attack  Low lymphocyte count can be a symptom of AIDS.  High monocyte count can indicate infection, often bacterial infection.  High eosinophil count can indicate:  Allergies  Certain Skin Diseases  Parasitic Infection  Immature white blood cells of any type can indicate:  Bacterial Infection  Leukemia  Good luck. gin13\n\n",

    "content": "Following surgery eight weeks ago to remove a lemon size mass (lipoma) from my upper arm my oncology MD told me that my pre-op blood work was abnormal and I should have my general MD look into it. My GP (in whom I have very little confidence in) did further blood work that showed the following abnormal results: Glucose  53 CO2 19 Albumin/Globulin ratio 2.2     (Albumin4.8    Globulin2.2) Hemoglobin 9.2 Hematocrit 29.2 MCV 59.4 MCH 18.8 MCHC 31.6 RDW 18.0 Ferritin 3 T-4, Free 1.8 (TSH 2.08) She (my GP)  faxed me the results and scribbled across it that I was anemic and should take iron pills and get rechecked in 3 months or so. I was alarmed at all the abnormal results but when I called to talk to her I was only allowed to speak to the nurse who told me that if I had further concerns I should speak with a dietician.  It is alarming to me that my blood work seems so off balance but I'm not sure if I am overreacting.  I am a 43 yr old female in generally very good health. For a long time I have felt exhausted and have to will myself through each day, I also have experienced short waves of dizziness for about a year  but I attributed it to a very high stress level in my life (primary caregiver to 14 yr old son with severe disablities and medically fragile + 2 other \"healthy\" kids). The only other thing I've noticed is that although I've always been an active and petite person (5'2\" and 118 lbs), I have been gaining weight that I can't control with moderate changes in diet and exercise (I don't do either to the extreme). I assumed that it was age but now I'm not so sure. A few weks ago was the first time that I was unable to keep up with my family while hiking in the mountains. Now if I climb more than 2 flights of stairs or walk uphill I am seriously short of breath but recover quickly on resting. I have always had a balanced diet and don't feel that there is a simple dietary reason for all of this. I am a non-smoker and non-drinker.  I feel that I should have this looked into but by what type of physician. Does anyone have any insight into what this might be or what may be causing all of these results? What does all of this mean? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi PeppyCJ, Anemia, regardless of the causative factor may cause symptoms of shortness of breath, dizziness, fatigue, paleness of skin, etc. The red blood cells are responsible for transporting oxygen to all areas of the body and when there are to few, symptoms arise. When evaluating for iron deficiency anemia, red blood cells are smaller and more pale than normal. Additional blood tests to identify iron deficiency anemia would include a measurement of ferritin. Although lab values vary depending on the lab used your ferritin level is low and would indicate iron deficiency. I would suggest an evaluation by a Hematologist to identify this to be the only causative factor for anemia and an Endocrinologist for the abnormalities in glucose, weight gain etc. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I am curious though how you feel.  I had had several infections but I have always had chronic bronchitis and get URI's often.  I had had some problems with my shoulder and about 6 months later my ankle was hurting.  I was told it was a mild sprain but a lump kept getting larger over the next 7 months and 5 dr's visits it became the size of a golf ball and still was not showing on an xray as anything other than arthritis.  When they finally agreed to remove it, the dr was shocked to learn it was a benign tumor of \"unknown\" origins (no  clue what caused it I guess.) I kept having URI's and about a yr later in 2002 I was having pain in my knee and swelling.  I went to a Ortho and he drained fluid and ran a CBC for arthritis panel and this is how it came back.  This particular Dr refused to treat me and sent me to my PCP who sent me to ever expert in town for every test possible, including to Vegas and to Mayo.  WIithin 6 months of the first CBC (which Im sure was not the first) I was having severe pain in my joints and extreme fatigue to the point I had to go on medical leave because I was sleeping or in pain.. I have enlarged nodes all over and have had biopsies and a bone marrow biopsy all of which have been not neg or pos but inconclusive.. I have had all my records reviewed by the CDC as well as the Ak cancer research center and all are stumped.  I feel much better, but I think I have just grown accustomed to the discomfort. I now have another lump in the same foot and am once again being told it is only a bone spur casued by arthritis, I just have to laugh...  Good luck.\n\n",

I had been having heart palpitations along with excessive fatigue, in general feeling just plain lousy. The CBC came back with elevated WBC and he ordered an EKG which was normal. He repeated the CBC 3 days later, then sent me to Hosp. for a Periphial blood smear. By  the way the first CBC showed a WBC of 15000, the second showed a WBC 12000 with lymphocyte of 60 %. The blood smear came back and the WBC was 13000, with high absolute lymphocyte at 70 %. I asked if I had an infection, he said no.  When I pressed him about what the problem was he just said I have an \"overactive bone marrow\", and wants to repeat the blood smear in 30 days. Wants to do an abdominal CT scan, somtime this week. Can you please tell me what the problem is with my blood smear test ? Help me to understand. Is he suspicious of leukemia ? I looked up Lymphocytes (absolute), and mine seem to be very high.  I would really appreciate an resopnse to my post. It is really worrying me. I am new to this site,  and since I can't seem to get a DIRECT answer from my GP, hope you can help !  Thanks Cindy\n\n",

    "content": "I have been having concerns about shortness of breath and fatigue. Briefly-I am a 33 year old female with a history of anemia.  When I was 4 I was treated for anemia with iron shots for about a year. I was also anemic during my two pregnancies.  Two years ago my hemo. and ferritin levels were very low.  I was prescribed iron supplements but couldn't keep them down so I tried to treat the anemia with diet (more spinach, beans etc).  I rarely eat meat and haven't eaten red meat since I was a teenager.  My iron-deficiency anemia is due to heavy, close together periods.  About two months ago, I began to notice I was significantly short of breath after climbing a few flights of stairs, my heart racing, etc.  Often when I stand up suddenly I feel dizzy.  When I was a teenager I fainted a few times after doing this.  It was never checked out, my parents seemed to think it was because I am very tall (6'2\").  My concern is this-from what I understand anemia is symptomatic only when it's severe.  My anemia has been borderline for the past year so I'm worried that the cause of my SOB and fatigue is something more sinister, like pulmonary hypertension.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jamie, A high platelet count could be due to many conditions or could be even a normal transient condition. The bone marrow can be thought of as the platelet factory. So a good idea would be to check and see if everything is alright in the factory. Conditions in which the factory is working too fast are known as myeloproliferative disorders of which cancer is a cause (Chronic myeloid leukemia) although not very likely given your young age. Thrombocytosis could also result as a reaction to infection. Essential thromobocythemia is a benign condition where no cause is found. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Repost in hopes a Physician can help.....   Hi there,   I am a 41yo white female in central Florida with relativly low stress, married 18 years, 2 adopted children. 7 brothers and sisters all healthy. I was always a normal weight until I got married in 1986. I battled back and forth with diets, excercise, etc for 15 years. The highest I've weighed was 226 and that was just 10 months ago. As I sit here typing this, I am now 135. I did not try to lose weight. It's just gone.    In June of 2004 I started losing weight, just a few pounds here and there but hadn't altered my eating. I was getting more excercise at work - walking A LOT. So I figured that was the reason. Then I spent much of July vomiting on a daily basis. I would not get nauseated, it would just happen out of the blue with little warning. One day when I got sick, I lost a good 8oz of yellow fluid and thought \"Ok NOW we go to the doc\" My GP sent my blood out for testing and a few days later informed me that I have H Pylori Disease (HPy count was 1660) and that is causing my weight loss (then 40 pounds or so) and vomiting. They put me on a round of triple antibiotics and I went back 10 days later. I was still vomiting and down another 11 pounds. They then sent me to a Gastro Doctor.   He took some blood, did an exam and set me up for an Endoscopy. That turned out fine, he found no problems. He said he was concerned with my blood counts and took more blood. The day after I was to go for a upper and lower bowel series and the following week, a colonoscopy. The next day I could not hold down the barium and started vomiting quite a bit. There was a quarter size dollop of blood in the vomit and my husband called the doctor. They advised us to go to the ER immediatly, the blood work just got back and it was not good. That was August 19th 2004 (in between Hurricanes no less)   I was in the hospital for 9 days. I had every test imaginable, colonoscopy, MRI's and/or Catscans of my brain chest and stomach, doppler radar (or something like that...) on my legs, Sonograms & a Bone Marro Biopsy (what a joy that was, I'd rather have 3 colonoscopies) I bet I also gave them 10 pints of blood while I was there.    I never saw the same attending twice. It was so confusing, my Gastro Doctor came in twice but I barely remember it. He pretty much cleared me of any Intestional problems. The doctor that released me had a good 10 min talk with myself, my husband and my father in law before I left. Not one of us understood a thing he said. The nurse in the room also didn't understand. I followed up with one of the Hemotologists that saw me while there.   I know that my SED rate was as high as 93. My Hemoglobin was as low as 7 and my iron was at 6. I don't remember my Hematacrit.... I do have the documentation though. All tests except bloodwork came back normal or near normal. One of my stomach scans did show an enlarged spleen.   They ruled out any cancers. They told me I had severe iron and B12 deficiency and had to have Iron Infusions & B12 shots starting immediatly until my iron levels increased. They discussed the possibility of a Blood Transfusion but I've never had one.   Last week I had my 7th Iron Infusion and 10th B12 shot. My iron is at 12 as I type this. I am constantly weak. I get dizzy if I bend over to do something and stand up again. I'm pale with dark circles under my eyes and I'm just tired of all this. My hemotologist suggested I may have Celiac Sprue, I've looked that up and have NONE of the symptoms except Anemia.   I don't know how much more of this I can take. I know there was no iron in my marrow at all. I know my body won't absorb it. I eat foods rich in iron, I take iron & b12 supplements as well as my monthly infusions.   I continue to lose weight at about 10 pounds a month. I have little or no appetite and I have zero strength & energy. My family is worried, my employers and employees are worried and quite frankly, so am I. There has got to be something someone missed.   I don't know where else to turn. Can someone please shed some light on this mystery. I would be so very grateful.   Thank you for your time.   Ironless in Orlando\n\n",

With glucophage, obese patients (who usually have insulin resistance with susbsequent high insuling levels and glucose intolerance) start to have improvement in their glucose intolerance and hence the insulin levels may actually go down and the patient will lose weight, but i think that what you are having is not secondary to glucophage as i think it can not cause that much weight loss on its own, there should be other helping factors such as exercise and a good healthy diet. However, since you already lost a lot of weight and may be some of the symptoms that you are having might be due to side effects of glucophage, i suggest that you stop it. i know you have been taking it for pcos, so unless you are still trying to conceive, i don't see why it can not be stopped.  Besides cancer, rapid weight loss without trying to can be caused by new onset diabetes, over active thyroid gland and others such as hiv infection and if you were living in a country where worm infestations are common, i would have said worm infestation (if you have travelled to such a country before all this started, i suggest a stool analysis). i am sure that you had all these tested for while being in the hospital. i am also sure that all types of cancers where looked for either by scans or blood tests. Cancers that are not looked for as aggressive as others are usually breast and those of the female genital tract such as ovarian and cancer of the cervix. One cancer that is not easy to detect is melanoma. But, if cancer was the cause behind your weight loss, i think that it should be an advanced cancer and there would have been no difficulty in finding this cancer whatsoever because it would be so obvious (even a melanoma).  At this point, i am not sure what is causing this weight loss. i suggest that you repeat the investigations once more (or at least some of the blood tests) to make sure that you did not have something that was missed.  Regarding the b12 deficiency, this is usually caused by an autoimmune condition called pernicious anemia where an essential component needed for absorption of vitamin b12 is not secreted by the stomach anymore due to the destruction of the stomach cells secreting this substance (by auto antibodies). For treatment, either vitamin b12 is given intramuscular or intravenous monthly or both the missing substance and vitamin b12 are given orally, in the both cases the stores of the vitamin (the weekly shots) have to be refilled first.  Regarding iron deficiency anemia, the most common cause is usually chronic bleeding which is either from the upper or the lower gastrointestinal tract (added to them in females, bleeding from the female genital tract) and you had normal both upper and lower endoscopies. If the cause was from somewhere inbetween upper and the lower gastrointestinal tract, usually a bleeding scan is performed at the time bleeding is suspected. Regarding female genital tract bleeding, heavy menstruations included, is a thing that is assessed by history. In addition to iron loss, there is inadequate supply that can cause iron deficiency. This can be caused by either not getting enough iron in diet or not being able to absorb iron (rare).   Having a bone marrow biopsy means that everything was done. i am sure that they did it but was hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) excluded? Were your liver functions normal? Was erythropoeitin (a hormone produced by the kidneys that contorls blood production) level checked?  It does not take a long time to see the effect of therapy on blood production but the full correction usually takes a few months, so all the symptoms of fatigue and being pale and the other that are caused by the anemia are going to improve slowly.  i am not sure whether or not i have addressed all of your concerns, please, if i have missed something, point to it and i will try to cover it.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

If it is a computer generated count and a differential was not indicated or done I wouldn't put much significance in this at present. As for your cholesterol levels I would have to see the normal reference ranges for your lab because generally speaking these results really aren't abnormal according to general values. People are generally prescribed cholesterol lowering medications even when there are only minor abnormalities for those at a higher risk for coronary heart disease. My concern however, has then been any other methods to alter levels with diet changes etc. because with the elevations in liver function (although mild) I would question the use of Lipitor due to the documented effects on raising liver enzymes.

I think computer because at the bottom of the CBC results it says that anything marked with an asterisk was hand counted, and I don't see any asterisks.

Some other ranges I've seen on the web differ from these low/high ranges.  These results:  WBC 11 (high): Low 3.5; high 10.6 Hemoglobin 12.9: Low 11.9; high 15.1 Hematocrit 37: low 34.9; high 44.1 Lymphocyte, absoute 3.7: low 0.9; high 3.0  Thank you for replying.  It means a lot to me.  I am worried for many reasons.  Last year, I had barely a period for 8 months, then started bleeding around November and it hasn't stopped yet.  Despite starting 30 mg progesterone 20 days ago, the bleeding continues.  Not sure if I mentioned that in my previous post.  Biopsy came back borderline simple hyperplasia and ultrasound showed 1 small uterine fibroid and a few small ovarian cysts.  Doc says possible PCOS on that front.  I am getting more confused because if it is PCOS I understood that the progesterone would make the bleeding stop.  It is getting worse.  I am so thankful you answered me.  You are the second nurse who has questioned the use of Lipitor at this time.  I just turned 52 and this is the first abnormal cholesterol result I can remember, and a change in diet was not first tried. I am worried that something is elevating my liver enzymes and I would like to correct it now.  My mother had renal failure and had to be on kidney dialysis and I don't ever want to go there or anywhere like it.    I feel like my health is going to heck in a handbasket.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Eferrell,  The results of your blood tests are very slightly elevated.   This mildly elevated white count together with this mildly elevated lymphocyte count, might mean that you just had a viral infection like a cold.  Regarding the liver enzymes, i don't think that there is anything to worry about unless your ast and alt were really low before.  Possible causes for this minimal elevation in the ast and alt could be: 1. Diabetes. By mobilizing fat to your liver, a condition known as fatty liver. This can be detected by either an ultrasound or a ct scan of the abdomen. 2. You are taking multiple medications and some of these medications like metformin can cause elevation in the liver enzymes. 3. Viral liver infection otherwise known as hepatitis.  4. Rare diseases such as hemochromatosis.  Regarding your cholesterol profile, you are a diabetic and your ldl has to be 100 or less according to the guidelines. Yours is already 100, so i don't cthink that you need to take it. Discuss this further with your doctor  About your fatigue, atenolol can cause extreme fatigue and many patients stop it because of this side effect.   Lipitor can cause increase in the liver enzymes and can affect the muscles as well. So, if you have muscle weakness or muscle pains of any sort with which it is going to be difficult to assess the side effect of muscle pain and/or weakness (this is a very serious side effect as it might end in renal failure if there is severe unnoticed muscle damage), some health care providers choose not to use the group of medications to which lipitor belongs.  If you are really concerned, i don't see a reason why not have an ultrasound of the abdomen to take a look at the liver. Have some blood tests done to exclude hepatitis.  Regarding your bleeding problem, i am not comfortable discussing this as i am not a gynecologist but i think at your age, if there is any suspicion about cancer, the uterus and ovaries are removed.

However, this is with some caveats.  Some people who have had multiple blood transfusions do have increased sensitivity to certain  markers, called antigens, that are found in the donor blood.  However, in this particular situation, I am not sure why your friend is still receiving blood.  Unless your friend has a slow bleed where they cannot find the origin that requires periodic transfusions, or they have another disorder, such as renal disease or cancer that affects the bone marrow (the blood creating cells), then I could not speculate as to why they are receiving blood.\n\n",

    "content": "My name is Todd, and I'm a little nervous about whats happening now in my life. For the last 2 or 3 weeks, I've been experiencing dizziness, lightheadedness, and a feeling as if the room around me is spinning. This does not happen all the time, as it seems to come and go randomly. I went to the doctors, and they gave me:  1) An antibiotic for a sinus infection to see if that would clear up my head I guess and 2)Meclizine,  which is for dizziness. After completing the antibiotic and still taking the Meclizine, I still do have the same symptoms as above, and its making me nervous. Also at the doctors, I took a blood test. The following day I got a call that I needed to take another blood test because there are some irrigularities. The second test came back with the majority of the same irrigularities, and the doctor suggested I need to see a specialist. Here are the results that are listed as out of range:  RBC:  6.04 mill/mcL Hemoglobin: 17.8 g/dL Hematrocrit:  50.8 % Protein, Total      8.5 g/dL ALT           75  U/L T3 Uptake    26.8 percent  In my second blood test, which only was a CBC(Complete Blood Count), the  RBC and Hemoglobin are the only two that were not in range:  RBC:   5.94 mill/mcL Hemoglobin  17.6 g/dL  The doctor told me I have to go to a Hemoglobin specialist, but would not say anything about my results. Can anyone explain to me what these numbers mean or tell me what's causing them to be out of range? Or even possibly why I've been feeling so dizzy and lightheaded?  I've just been very nervous thinking about this. Thanks for any help I can get.  Todd\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Todd,  I would accept your Haemoglobin level and Red Blood Cell count as being within normal ranges.   Haemoglobin levels are age and sex-dependent: the normal range of Haemoglobin for a healthy adult male is 14 -18g/dL. The Red Cell Count of a healthy adult male is 4.7-6.1mill/mcL.  What is definitely out of range is your ALT (alanine aminotransferase), which is one of the tests of liver function. Normal range for ALT is 0-50u/l. I would have expected that, based on this ALT level, serial estimations of liver function tests would be conducted. Was this done?  What was your blood pressure when checked at the clinic?  Any examination of the ears?   Sinus, middle ear, and blood pressure disorders may cause symptoms similar to yours, so ask for a referral to an ENT unit if you are not improving.  I hope this information has been helpful. Thank you for contacting our website.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Solomon,  Thank you very much for taking time to respond to this post. In response to your questions, no other liver function tests have been conducted, but now it seems I should ask the doctor to possibly perform some other tests. I don't understand why she wouldn't have tested for the ALT level again when she requested I take another blood test. She didn't even mention that level to me, but rather only mentioned the RBC and Hemoglobin.    I don't know if what I am taking daily would affect my liver, but I am currently taking a multivitamin, a Vitamin C, and a Clarinex for allergies. Could this be affecting the high ALT level?  The nurse that took my blood pressure at the doctor's office stated that it was completely fine. The doctor examined my ears, and said they didn't look infected, but my right ear looked to be red inside. I think this, and the fact that I have a lot of congestion is the reason she prescribed the sinus infection antibiotic.  You also had stated that you would accept my Hemoglobin and Red Blood Cell count. Even though they are in the acceptable range, aren't they slightly high?  Thank you once again for your time and consideration.  Todd\n\n",

    "content": "I need some advice regarding my Hemolytic Anemia.  The first time that I wrote to this forum I was complaining about a pain in my left side which I did not suspect to be pneumonia related because there was no cough or flu symptoms.   I suffered with this for 1 week or so before I spoke to Dr. Mokhtar at this forum.  I believe that I joined this forum around Dec. 21.  Yesterday I went to my Hematologist.  She started me on Prednisone on May 11, 2004 because of a Hemoglobin count of 4.6.  My heart was beating rapidly that day.  I refused transfusion and was put in the Hospital for 8 days until my Doctor got me up to 8.1.  She used 80 mg. of Prednisone to treat me initially.  Then she slowly started tapering me down all the while watching my Hemoglobin.  I went from 80 mg, 40, 30, 20, 10, 5 mg. alternating day by day sometimes.  On Dec. 1  I went to the lab while alternating between 10 & 5 mg.   My bloodwork was fine.  On 12/27/04 My doctor told me to take 5 mg until my next appt. which was yesterday.  My Hemoglobin had dropped from 11.? down to 9.  Here is my problem: Now She wants me to go back to taking 40mg daily for  week, Then 30 mg. for 1 week and then get Bloodwork at the lab.  If the blood is good she will taper me back down to 20 and the 10mg and hesitate about going to 5mg.  I don't like the affect that Prednisone has on my face.  I just don't want to be on Prednisone too much longer.  In the long run she mentioned that my Spleen may not be doing it's job filtering.  Could the problem I had with my left side have been my Spleen acting up.  I don't have that pain now but I could not understand why I was having it there then.  My Dr. asked me if I had a recent pain anywhere lately but I did not mention this because it was back in Dec. and I was focusing on other aches that I've had recently.  She mentioned that my Anemia may be Prednisone dependent or that I might be facing a possible Splenectomy in the future if a determination is made that it is not functioning right.  I will be getting labwork in 2 weeks and seeing my Dr. in another month.  I feel as though 20 mg. of Prednisone daily would probably do the same thing that she wants 40 mg. to accomplish.  Any Advice.  P.S. I apologize if I spelled Dr. Mokhtar's name wrong.  Feel free to correct me.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sandy,  i am not a hematologist.  Hemolytic anemias are of various types but it sounds from your history that you have a type called autoimmune hemolytic anemia. With this particular type, the body produces antibodies against its own red cells which are destroyed mainly in the spleen.  The mainstay treatment for this ailment is to give immunosuppressant medications to suppress the overactive immune system of the body and at the same time supress the severity of the immune reaction that destroys the red blood cells as well.  The main immunosuppressants used by doctors are steroids. Steroids are used in a slue of illnesses with different regimens. The best one to decide the regimen used in a particular disease is the specialst him/herself.  So, even though we are all doctors, yet, i am not familiar with the regimens used for hemolytic anemia.  i know steroids have lots of side effects, but for the time being, i would advise you to stick with what your doctor wants you to do.   As for removing the spleen, it is sometimes resorted to in resistant cases of auto-immune hemolytic anemia. There are other immunosuppressants that can be used but still they have far more side effects and are used in cases where steroids and splenectomy fail to control the hemolysis.

    "content": "Hi,  I have experienced a drop in blood counts over the past year.  Primarily WBC, RBC, Hgb, Hct with a high MCV.  I then had blood drawn for B12 (much higher than normal), folic acid (normal), Ferritin (normal), Iron (normal) and TIBC (normal).  My GP referred me to a hematologist who informed me that I had some form of lymphoprolific disorder and needed a bone marrow.  I told him that I'm vegan and asked if it could be dietary and he said no it was obviously a production disorder hence the bone marrow.  The bone marrow was normocellular for age with a single nonparatrabecular lymphoid nodule (they attempted to do immunohistochemistry of the nodule but it wasn't present in the sample they received to use - and recommended clinical correlation).  The bone marrow also showed absent iron stores.  The hematologist told me that it was rare for a low white count to occur with low iron but possible, and not to worry about the lymphoid nodule as it was probably normal.  He presecribed iron capsules.  I'm confused because none of this makes much sense to me and don't know if I should seek a second opinion or try the iron for a month and have the blood draw repeated.  Thank You Delia\n\n",

While it may not be possible to make a correlation between depleted iron stores and the low white blood cells and the lymphoid nodule, we know for sure that you have low iron. So it makes sense to treat the iron depletion for the time being and wait and see. If your counts continue to return low then you may need another bone marrow biopsy.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kat,  What was your platelet count on the complete blood count? Why was a blood count checked? What were the symptoms that you have been having?  In general, interpretation of any laboratory result has to be in the context of a clinical setting.  If all your blood counts are low, red cells, white cells (that you already have) and platelets (which you did not mention), then most probably the bone marrow (organ producing the cells) is inhibited by something. This could range from a simple viral infection upto serious disease such as cancer.  If your red cells are only low, this means that you have anemia, which could be related to lots of causes and according to the red cells' size and shape, the cause could be determined by doing further tests.  If your white cells are only low, this could be the effect of a drug, a virus or cancer.  If your platelets are low, it could be secondary to destruction (many reasons) or no production.  i think the most definitive way to finding out what is going on is to have a bone marrow biopsy but this is an invasive procedure and before doing it all other venues (in my opinion) have to be explored.

EB count came down and then i developed another 'mystery virus' last december and coughing all the time, weight loss, enlarged spleen, night sweats...no proper diagnosis but i had a bone marrow biopsy which came back ok. i have taken imunovir (antiviral) since and my EB count has remained low so it isn because of this virus.  so i've been not feeling right at all since this happened a year ago and back in hospital for the cellultis and had other infections. i just feel very tired and a bit nauseaus, weak and achey, finding it very difficult to maintain weight and losing bit of weight, i weigh 45 kg and is hard keeping it up despite eating a lot.  you mentioned a few things which could cause white cells, red cells or platelets to be low individually, what could contribute to make both red and white cells to be low? i don't know about my platelets but im guessing they are within the normal range.  my doctor has requested me to have a repeat blood test in 1 months time, do u think this is soon enough?  also, if i pick up an infection with my white cells and neutrophils being this low, could i get quite a bit sicker faster?  thanks so much for your time, kat xxx\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kat,  Thank you very much for the update.  i would assume that your platelets count is normal.  Since this appears not to be your first blood count, it would be better to ask about the trend of the red cells and the white cells counts, are the counts improving or getting worse? Are you still taking any medications?  Valacyclovir can rarely cause low white count, low red cell count and low platelets as well. i am not really familiar with imunovir to tell you about its side effects.   If your doctor that you are referring to is an infectious disease specialist, that's fine, if not, i would recommend that you be seen by an infectious disease specialist.   Neutophils normally consititute about 75% of the total white cell count. If the count that you refered to as neutrophil count is what is known as the absolute neutrophilic count then by definition (cut off is 1500/cc) it is low but worries start if the absolute neutrophilic count is below 1000/cc and the risk of infection rises greatly if the count drops below 500/cc and if you get an infection, you will most probably be a lot sicker than a person who gets the same infection, but with a normal white count.  The things that can cause white cells and red cells to be low together is either bone marrow depression or a combination of any cause of each like anemia for any reason and then getting a drug or a virus that can cause your white count to go low. The problem could just be that you are anemic, something that is not unheard of in females of your age, because of menstruation (and you have been sick as well) and you taking a medication that is causing your white count to be low and if the medication is stopped or the dose is lowered, this might improve things.  There are medications that can be given to make the white count go up if need be.  Remember, i am just standing outside and looking in, your doctor is the one who has been following you all along.

    "content": "Dear Kat,  Thank you very much for the update.  The ulcers on your tongue and the sore throat were most probably secondary to the low white count causing a viral infection (of the throat) or a fungal infection (of the tongue).  Enlarged spleen is an anatomical description but an enlarged spleen can be also hyperactive and causing low blood counts but the platelets are the ones that should be low first because they have a short life span as compared to the other blood cells, so most probably this is not a hyperactive spleen.  There is an entity called cyclic neutropenia where, on regular basis, the white count decreases and then comes up on its own but you don't seem to fit this as your white count has always been ok and you never mentioned that you had repeated infections when you were young.  You never mentioned whether the dose of the imunovir was changed?   If this continues to be a problem i would recommend that you see an infectious disease specialist and a blood disease specialist.

Also, how about a new eb virus blood test to see whether or not you have a reactivation that might be the reason behind all this.

    "content": "Some advice would be great.  I am a military spouse and I am dealing with the military medical system which is at times hit or miss.  I was sent to the hematologist back in August with an elevated platelet count of 573.  Since then it leveled off at around 450 where it has been ever since (give or take 15).  In October my iron level dipped to an 11 and the hematologist said that was why my platelet count was high.  He gave me a three month supply of ferrex 150 and said I didn't need to come back.  I have been feeling lousy and had blood work done the end of November and it was still hanging around at 11 with my platelet count staying the same.  My latest blood work done 12-22 shows my iron is down to 5 and my platelet is still the same.  My glucose was elevated 137, and I was slightly low on potassium.  The doctor I saw asked me to redo the glucose (which I have done) to double check on diabetes, but didn't say anything much about my iron and my fatigue.  I am so exhausted that I quit my job at the beginning of this month.  I don't do anything but sleep when the kids are in school.    It is difficult to navigate the military medical system when each doctor I see is generally just doing a rotation.  The doctor I saw in hematology isn't even there anymore.  Is there anything else I can be doing for this at home?  I get scared when I feel this tired because it reminds me of when I had post-eclampsia 4 years ago with the birth of my son.  The fatigue and the headaches were not fun.  With the holiday season right now, I am tempted to just wait.  I am unsure of how proactive I need to be in this situation.  Thanks,  Kanani\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kanani, These tests denote iron deficiency anemia. The causes of iron deficiency are too little iron in the diet, poor absorption of iron by the body, and loss of blood (including from heavy menstrual bleeding). If you do not have obvious blood loss then you may need to be investigated for what is known as occult blood loss (e.g. in stools). A panel of investigations may be required to determine if there is anything underlying this anemia that is more serious.  The answer is Yes you should insist on another hematology appointment. Please keep us updated on the outcome of your visit.\n\n",

Not much clue here unless we know exactly what test we are talking about...but I would guess that perhaps it may be the MCV...or the Mean Corpuscular Volume.  If this is raised, it means that the average red blood cell size in your blood is slightly bigger.  Red blood cells can be bigger if the the person is a long term drinker, not necessarily just the night before...but perhaps my other learned coleagues can help here.  Red blood cells can also be bigger with some vitamin deficiency, notably B12 and Folate, or some blood disorders...but I would certainly be interested in what specific test we are looking at here...

She is 42\" in height and 42 lbs. in weight.  She lives with her father whom she reported a year ago, as helping her to throw up after she eats.  Blood test results show the following out of the normal range:  elevated white blood cell count:  14.9 platelets:  455 (high) neutrophils:  62 (high) lymphs:  29 (low) neutrophils (absolute):  9.2 (high) Glucose/serum:  102 (high) TSH:  2.079 T-4:  9.2  The dad has been administering daily since she was 7 months of age, prescription laxatives.  Until she was about 2 1/2, the laxative was Lactulose and he gave her at one time, as much as 8 tbl. daily; after Lactulose, it was Miralax and to our knowledge - that is still the laxative she uses.  She was diagnosed with mild IBS.  Could this long term use and excessive use of laxatives, have anything to do with the severe hair loss and abnormal blood results?  These results coupled with the severe hair loss in a 5 year old could indicate what likely medical conditions.  We are very concerned for her.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello JH, High hemoglobin values can be caused by a lack of oxygen (which can occur from living at high altitude), smoking, exposure to carbon monoxide, long-term lung disease, certain forms of heart disease, kidney disease, or polycythemia vera, a rare disorder of the bone marrow.  A high hemoglobin value can also be caused by too little water in the body (dehydration), a result of drinking too little; other causes include frequent diarrhea or vomiting, excessive sweating, severe burns, and the use of diuretics.   If you don't think any of the above causes are related to your condition then I would suggest follow up of your condition after a month provided you are not complaining of anything.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "JH, Thanks for the update. Your MCHC is a little high this means the amount of Hb per cell is above normal. Your hematocrit is on the higher end which means the percentage of your blood which is composed of red cells is a little high.   What were the comments in that blood report. There was no spherocytosis or abnormality in shape or form of the blood cells?  I think you should do another count within the coming month and compare to see if indeed something is developing in its early stages or if it was just a transient increase. If on the rise that would mean we may need more investigations to search for a cause.   If any new symptoms should arise then you should bring them to medical attention at once.\n\n",

    "content": "Serum ferritin is a storage protein for iron. It is also a good measure of the total iron stores. One of the causes of elevated ferritin is iron overload as in hemochromatosis.   When there is marked iron overload, as in advanced hemochromatosis, the serum ferritin concentration commonly exceeds 500 mug/L and may be >5000 mug/L. At that point iron starts to deposit in the various tissues leading to organ damage. Please check our hemochromatosis page for more details.  However, since serum ferritin is an acute-phase reactant, elevated values may result from chronic disease, such as inflammation (as in rheumatoid arthritis), or from malignancies. Liver injury from hepatitis or alcohol abuse also elevates both the serum iron and the serum ferritin concentrations. High values of serum ferritin may be observed in Gaucher's disease and in a rare familial disorder associated with congenital cataracts (the hyperferritinemia-cataract syndrome), without concomitant excess iron accumulation in the liver or other organs. Therefore, elevated values of serum ferritin concentration must be interpreted in the context of the presence or absence of these other conditions.  I am also concerned about your low TSH levels. An endocrinologist should have a look to exclude early hyperthyroidism. Especially that hyperthyroidism is one of the causes of elevated ferritin.  Best regards,\n\n",

A general interpretation of results is all that can be given online.  This does not mean you have a particular disease only that further investigation may be warranted in a certain area. Here is a very general or basic idea of what the tests are used for:  Monocyte=used to rule out infection, bone marrow injury, leukemia Albumin= used to rule out liver or kidney diseases Alt/SGPT=used to rule out liver damage Protein=used to rule out liver or kidney disorders Having tests results slightly higher than the reference range does NOT mean you have a certain disease.  It merely shows the doctor that he needs to explore a certain area and /or he can rule out areas to explore if the test was normal.   Please ask your doctor what these test results mean in your case.

He siad that he was very doubtful that I would have Chlamydia but he was going to check my blood for that anyway just in case.  Now, I won't be getting the results for a few days unles it's something serious.  So I was wondering, what can I do in the meantime to battle this extreme fatigue and tiredness?  I was wondering, what are the best foods and drinks to be having if I'm Anemic or Diabetic?  I looked online, and the symptoms look a lot like Iron Deficiency Anemia.  I noticed that I do feel a little better after I eat and if I don't drink so much tea (I drink a lot of tea every day).  I had cream of wheat for breakfast and I feel better than I did this morning.  I'm still tired but not even as close as I was this morning.  If you have any advise, please let me know. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Casweetheart: Unfortunately there is no quick cure for any of the possibilites the doctor mentioned.  For anemia you could take a multivitamin with high iron content or a tablet of Ferrous Sulfate(iron) which you can obtain at the pharmacy.  Eating a good amount of dark green leafy vegetables will help increase your iron consumption also.  It takes several weeks before you will show an improvement. If you are diabetic you will show a high blood sugar level.  Normal is in the range of 80-120 (some labs show normal as 70-110). Eating foods low in sugar content at regular intervals can control your blood sugar to prevent it from dropping too low and causing feelings of tiredness.  Treatment of chlamydia requires an antibiotic which the doctor needs to prescribe. So, all in all there are no fast cures here and no doubt the results from your lab work will be in before you will be ascertain the problem yourself.  It won't hurt you though to continue to eat healthy in the meantime and especially if it makes you feel better. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "I started noticing a rash on my legs about 6 weeks ago. I tried over the counter meds which didn't work. Then about 3 weeks ago I started bruising in the same area as the rash, but the rash had started spreading to my arms and torso areas and they also started bruising. I finally got worried and went to the dermatologist who mildly treated the rash, but was concerned about the bruising and ordered some blood work. They called me a few days later and said it had nothing to do with dermatology, that my lab work came back abnormal and that I needed to go to the ER no later than tomorrow to have everything checked by a doctor more  experienced in these matters.     So the next day I went to the ER thinking the worst and they started by repeating the same blood test. The ER doc walked back in the room and said...well, everything is fine...everything was normal and sent me home with different, stronger meds than the dermatologist. I finally got out of a nurse what the results were and this is all I know (of the first abnormal results)  platelet count was high AST was high ALP was high RDW was high  Should I be concerned about the different results? Should I get another blood test retaken? Should I be concerned abouth the first results and what do they indicate?  Please let me know so I can go from here.  Thank You\n\n",

I have been so tired lately, that the 45 min. drive to this dr. office just for the piece of paper was just not worth it. But I have a dr. appt. on Monday to follow up with all this and I am going to demand another blood test, repeating every test that they took originally. I was just wondering if these results alone could give anyone an idea of what it might have been, especially treated as though getting to the hosp. the next day was life or death, and the er doc. was understanding and said he did the right thing, was very nonchalant about the results he got, but no reason why there would be such a difference in the same test 2 days apart with no medication in between. I just confused about how that could happen and concerned that they should have done more to be on the safe side.   Thanks for your help\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  The reason I advised to get hold of the results is because it would be helpful if the exact values are known, and in all probabilities it's the ALT and not ALP that's raised. Lab results in itself maybe difficult to interpret without the clinical history and examination findings. On top of that, if the report itself is by way of mouth, much is left to assumption.   AST and ALT are liver enzymes that get raised when the liver is affected in any way, including alcohol and drugs. The RDW in itself leaves little to work on without obtaining the rest of the blood count results, especially the MCV.  Lab results are subject to variations depending on the method and expertise involved. They are not strictly delineated values that remain constant. They can change from individual to individual, and from time to time in the same individual, depending on the internal milieu of the human body.   Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

However, infection is a subtype of inflammation resulting from an infectious agent (bacteria, virus or other).   However, if the abdominal pain is still going on and an ultrasound of the abdomen has not shown anything, then i would suggest doing a computerized tomography (ct) scan of the abdomen as it detects things that ultrasound can't with great details.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have had my thryroid removed, and suspected it may well be that this was the problem After blood tests this proved correct. The Doctor increased my thyroxine intake from 100mmg to 125mmg daily. The Blood results also showed up that my platelets were raised 498000. The Gp then asked for a repeat test 21 days later. This test was done and it appears the platelets are still high, as are the red and white cells. HB was 13.5. The thyroid count is now high. Can the thyroid cause these levels to be raised ? My doctor asked if I had had a sore throat, and looked puzzled when I said no! If not any suggestions as to why these may have suddenly become high or raised. I still feel really tired and basically generally unwell. I have to go in a weeks time for another blood test to see if it is still raised. This has been going on over 6 weeks to date Thanks for taking time to read this. I just need someone to tell me roughly what could cause these things to happen.  Thankyou Deb\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am wondering if anyone can help me out here.  I am just concerned and worried and of course full of fear and anxiety at the moment.   The day after I gave birth to my son 15 months ago I developed massive nosebleeds that lasted about a week, I went through the cauterization, packing etcetc and finally they stopped and never returned.  It was pretty scary and the doctors wre baffled saying they had never seen anything quite like it before.  Anyhow, I am now 7 months pregnant and have just been released from the hospital after another episode and week stay a;lthough this time was much worse. They packed my nose this time the first time yet I still continues to bleed 4-5 times a day for about 4 days.  I had to take blood transfusions because my hemoglobin dropped to 70 whatever that means and they wanted to operate but wre afraid of putting me in to labour.  Anyhow, they finally stopped and the ENT's that were called in and treating me said that although nosebleeds are common in pregnancy, ones this severe are rare but must be due to the hormones etcetc.   They also hve put e on no lifting and bedrest for the remainder becauswe they say they can return at any time athough bedrest really didn't help all that much in the hospital.  I am just wondering if anyone is familiar with this and if there is any advice to prevent another episode.  I am full of fear and anxiety and keep wondering if something like this could kill me.  I mean, can you die of a nosebleed if you are trated in hospital for it???   Just overly paranoid I guess.  Anyhow, any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks   Jody\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jody, As you noted nose bleeds can happen during pregnancy because of the hormonal changes that occur during pregnancy. Basically there are two main types of epistaxis (nose bleeds): 1. One that happens from the front of the nose (anterior) 2. One that happens from the vessels in the back of the nose (posterior).  While the anterior variety is more common and less severe, the posterior variety can be quite alarming. The posterior variety could be arterial in origin and could be quite hard to control.  You are justified to be anxious. You should have a panel of investigations performed to rule out any correctable cause for increased bleeding tendency. You should also discuss with your doctor who to contact and where to go to if your nose bleeds should not be controlled with first aid measures at home.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your question here at The Doctor's Lounge.  The skin findings could be related to the polycythemia problems.  Dehydration complicates polycythemia by contracting the volume of blood and thereby secondarily elevating the red blood cell level that can be elevated in polycythemia to begin with.  It is difficult to provide you any specific diagnoses about your Father's medical problem without having the benefit of test results and physical examination findings.  Infectrious problems do arise in elder people and are not necessarily related to the polycythemia, although they can worsen the polycythemia problem when they do occur.  Sometimes primary polycythemia can cause more problems with the bone marrow (where the blood is made in the body) and an acute leukemia can arise.  Fevers can occur with this type of bloodprocess, although the majority of primary polycythemia patients do not develop an acute leukemia.  The white blood cell count being elevated could be due to a fever, could be due to other \"stress\" conditions placed on the body by an acute illness or could be part of the polycythemia process.  There are times in evaluating a fever of unknown origin that an Infectious Disease specialist is asked to help.  Sometimes a Hematologist is asked to help.\n\n",

    "content": "It seems that your doctor was trying to exclude that you had celiac disease (gluten sensitive enteropathy). What are the results of your other tests? Stool analysis? Blood counts? IgA and IgG anti-Gliadin antibodies are used to diagnose celiac disease. However, the test may be associated with false negative and false positive results. False-positives are possible as other gastrointestinal disorders are known to induce circulating antigliadin antibody, mainly Crohn disease, food protein intolerance, and postinfection malabsorption. Endomysial antibodies (IgA) is the investigation of choice since it has more sensitivity and specificity than the anti-Gliadin antibodies (IgA, IgG) for celiac disease.   I would like to refer you to the following pages on The Doctor's Lounge which I hope you will find useful for evaluating your condition: Diagnosis of diarrhea Diagnosis of steatorrhea Malabsorption Celiac diseaseRegards,\n\n",

I think since your symptoms are mainly gastrointestinal that a simple stool analysis is in order. If we find a high lipid content then a 24 hour fat in stool test will be required to diagnose malabsorption. Also the presense of indigested material would indicate indigestion. Both these conditions can easily be treated.\n\n",

Anyway I was just wondering what you can apply or achieve to remove paleness to the face.  Like black lines under they eyes, eyes dropped a bit, tired looking.  Just always tired looking like I got no sleep.  Im healthy, I excercise daily and always get sleep but it doesen't matter b/c it will always look the same if I get 1 hour of sleep or 12.  So I was just wondering if anyone has any suggestion to lighten up or is there something I can take, like I heard of an eye lifter but im not sure where to get it or if I should even bother.  Anyone have any suggestion on what to take or do at this type of situation.  I asked my doctor and he said it's normal but it's not, really bugging me looking tired all the time.  Thank you,  Danny\n\n",

However, I recently experienced a dip in my counts from a normal level at a time when I was eating a lot of soy in the form of soy burgers and chicken patties.  Since soy has estrogen-like properties and estrogen in large doses can suppress marrow production, is it possible, in your opinion, that the soy could have caused this present decline in my blood counts?  I also experienced very heavy menstrual bleeding while eating the soy.  Is it more likely the dip was caused by the bleeding?  The drop was in the RBC and platelet counts.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Autumn, A low platelet count could lead to heavy menstruation and hence lead to reduced RBC count. I don't think that there is any relationship between Soy and bone marrow suppression. Infact Soy has been used to counteract the toxicity in patients with bone marrow suppression due to chemotherapy.  Isoflavones (Soy) contain plant derived estrogenic compounds. However, the estrogenic potency has been estimated to be only 1/1000 to 1/100,000 that of the naturally occuring estrogen estradiol.  I have found only one study linking Soy to reduced platelet function. Although I must emphasize that this study is just a single study and doesnt seem to be supported by similar research. So it would be too early to draw any conclusions from it.  Either way i think you should refer to your hematologist especially if your platelet counts are below 50,000. If below a critical level of 20,000 you may need platelet transfusions. Please discuss with your doctor the advantages and disadvantages of stopping the menstruation altogether at times when your platelet counts are low. Best regards.\n\n",

I was told it could be nutritional, to take a vitamin and put on a few pounds, which hasn't helped.  My internist monitors my counts periodically but doesn't seem interested in finding out the cause, though thankfully my counts are only mildly decreased.  I just hope they stay that way.  I've been doing a lot of research to determine the possible cause myself.  I think I've read everything there is to read on aplasic anemia on the net.  It appears to be a very severe disease.  Is it possible to have only mild aplastic anemia?    One more question, please.  In your response, you stated that soy is used to counteract marrow toxicity.  Can you explain briefly how this is possible?  Thanks again!     Autumn\n\n",
