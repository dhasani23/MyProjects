    "content": "Hi M.Z.AL QUDAH, It would have been very helpful if you had included the following details. - when was the diagnosis made? - since when you have been symptomatic and what are your symptoms? - MRI features of the tumor, - did the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) cytology show tumor seeding? - when were the biopsy and third ventriculostomy performed? - what was the exact histologic type? - what kind of management you went through ( radiotherapy/chemotherapy)?, and - what has been the response to the treatment? (tumor size, your symptoms etc). Without these details, i am afraid, i can not answer your question adequately. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Please advise us on the possible pontine brain tumor treatment for this patient who has been detected for tumor in year 2000. The patient is a female aged 35 years with 2 children. First baby(girl) born in june 2000. Six months after the baby is born the symptoms came out (eye, mouth deviation).   December, 2000: Stereotactic biopsy was done. Findings: 3 fragments of Greyish white soft tissue measuring 0.5 cms \u2013 3 all was taken. The report reads \u2013 Multiple sections show brain tissue with occasional granular bodies. There is no evidence of a neoplasm nor is there evidence of any other specific lesion. It was non-diagnostic.  Dec\u201900 \u2013 Feb\u201901 : The patient was under ATT treatment.  Sept, 2002-MRI report: The brain stem lesion measures 4.3 x 3.4 x 3.8 cms. In comparison with previous MRIs the lesion is minimally decreased in size by absolute size and extended superiorly to involve left half of superior pons and right inferior colliculus region of midbrain. No change in morphology of lesion appreciated. No contrast enhancement noted.  November 2003: Second baby was born. Symptoms of deviation of mouth, inability to close right eye, inability to walk without support, diminished hearing have increased. MRI Report: 5.2 X 4.5 X 5.2cm lesion in pons.  July to August 2004: Radiation treatment was given.  There were no significant issues till 2009.  Subsequently in 2009 symptoms were visible again. Patient was on steroids for a couple weeks, about 8 months ago i.e during nov/dec 2009 and no visible improvement noticed.  Further a review of MRIs  of brain stem (with focus on pons) of the patient \u2013 one taken  during oct 2009 and  another  during june 2010  revealed that there is no significant growth  visible. Inability to walk has increased a lot. Symptoms of difficulty in gulping food, diminished hearing and speech issues appeared.  What is the possible treatment for the patient at this time as the patient was already given radiation. Are there any new technologies or medicines?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: tumor on pons: possible treatments options",
    "content": "Hi,  You indicate that the first biopsy report(December, 2000) reads as follows \"Multiple sections show brain tissue with occasional 'granular' bodies\". Are you certain it was 'granular', or perhaps, 'granulomas'?  Pontine tumors are the most common variety of brainstem tumor and unfortunately they also carry the worst prognosis. Pontine gliomas may be,   Focal-- perhaps < 5% iof all brainstem tumors and 20% or more of brain stem gliomas. These tumors are more circumscribed (contained within the pons) and occupy < 50% of the cross sectional surface area of the pons.These tumors may have cysts or tend to grow out from the brain stem(i.e., exophytic) or diffuse intrinsic type(tend to spread in all directions).  The majority of pontine tumors are diffuse intrinsic gliomas, which are most often high grade, locally infiltrative, and have a uniformly poor prognosis. A tendency for brainstem gliomas to follow a more indolent course in adults than in children has been noted. In adults, these tumors are more likely to be low grade and remain localized for unknown reasons.  Surgery may be possible in focal pontine gliomas. Radiotherapy has been the cornerstone in the management of brainstem gliomas. In adults, this may be followed by adjuvant chemotherapy.  Newer approaches: Currently temozolomide following radiotherapy is being investigated (in adults with diffuse high grade gliomas). A small subgroup of patients can be successfully treated with high dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue. [Oligodendroglioma with specific molecular changes (allelic loss on chromosomes 1p and 19q) have been recognized fairly recently to be a distinct subgroup with a better prognosis and a particular sensitivity to chemotherapy].Other modalities such as, angiogenesis inhibitors, radiosensitizers and other biological modifiers are being currently investigated in phase I/II trials.  Generally, focal masses and ring-enhancing (on a contrast-enhanced MRI) masses have the highest proportion of benign lesions (60% and 36.8%, respectively). Histological verification of all enhancing (especially ring-enhancing) and focal brainstem masses is recommended to identify patients with benign nonneoplastic lesions.  The main advantage of stereotactic biopsy lies in the diagnosis of benign masses in a significant proportion of patients with intrinsic brainstem masses and in providing a rapid and safe means for evacuation of the contents of cystic masses.  In your patient, the initial biopsy had most probably shown some 'granulomas' and perhaps Acid-fast bacilli (AFBs) were not demonstrated or grown in culture.So, she was probably started on anti tubercular therapy(ATT) empirically.The second MRI(september 2002) following the ATT had shown small reduction in size and a \"non-enhancing\" lesion.  Apart from tuberculosis, the other granulomatous disease that can affect the brain is sarcoidosis.Neurosarcoidosis occurs in less than 5% of patients with sarcoidosis. Cases of neurosarcoidosis involving the brain stem have been reported in the literature. Leptomeningeal enhancement on MRI is the finding that generally suggests a diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis. A biopsy is usually sufficient for a diagnosis and they show a good response to high-dose steroid therapy.   Although some patients show a rapid response to corticosteroids, many require prolonged steroid treatment or alternative therapies. The available alternative therapeutic agents include cyclosporine, methotrexate, azathioprine, chlorambucil, cyclophosphamide, hydroxychloroquine, and radiation therapy.  As your patient already had received radiotherapy, and the  suspicion of a granulomatous etiology (especially neurosarcoidosis)still remains.Every effort must be made to exclude this possibility. Only her neurosurgeon will be best placed to decide on the further course of action. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Based on this information I suspect that you are experiencing tension headaches.  When pain relievers control headache pain well it is often due to muscle fatigue and \"tension\".    The other possibility is a migraine.  Classically migraines are associated with light or sound worsening the pain.  The headaches are generally made a little better by sleep.    Brain tumors often cause a headache that is worse in the morning and is associated with nausea (although this is not 100% true).  If your pain is now getting better and you do not have any other neurological signs it is unlikely that you have a brain tumor and a CT scan may not be needed.  Also, if you are looking for brain tumors, an MRI is often a better test.  It is important to see your doctor and have a thorough neurological physical exam performed to look for any subtle indicators of a problem.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Nystagmus",
    "content": "Hello,  I was just wondering if I could have an opinion on this. I've been getting really irritated recently...about three or four weeks ago I came down with a bad case of nausea, fatigue (18 hours of sleeping...but I usually sleep about 12), hotness (no fever, just felt really really really boiling...was wearing bathing suit around the house), and some...abnormal digestion...minor intestinal pains, minor headaches. Went to the doctor after about 5 days. Gastroenteritis, he says. Says I should be better in a few days. So I go home, do the BRAT diet...I feel better - exceeeept, for the minor abdominal pains, sore left kidney (which seems to happen whenever I get sick, probably not related - dad suggested third kidney [three aunts had]), and still being nauseous - though, funnily enough, almost only when I read. It feels like I'm constantly getting carsick. So I go back, he says it sounds like I'm almost over it, and Gastroenteritis still fits. 'Come back in three days if you're still nauseous/abdominal pains.' Unfortunately, I'm very busy, and was going away for the weekend (for my 21st birthday, yay me), so I didn't have time to go back. I was still getting more nauseous when I read (or similar activities), and still having left kidney pains, a bit fatigued/drowsy (though not as much as before, and I usually am), but more importantly - been having every kind of headache imaginable (not like really painful but enough to be annoying, especially the cluster headaches that make my eye feel like it's going to pop out), and my neck feels kind of 'stiff' sometimes, like it hurts to look down or up...my main complaint is still the nausea. So I went back yesterday, and there was a different doctor and he wasn't taking me serious at all - which is a first, usually he's great - so I came home kind of peeved and decided to think it through myself. And I thought: nausea...reading...maybe it's my eyes. So I took my camera and recorded the 'follow my finger without moving head' thing...and I noticed I have the little jerky involuntary movements while doing it...I think that explains why I'm getting nauseous, especially while reading.   In short...I've recently acquired: >Nausea >Nystagmus >Headaches of various sorts almost constantly (and I NEVER used to get headaches) >Inexplicable anger (Also, I'm usually am a very nice and calm person - more apt to be sad than angry - but I've been recently getting so angry [sometimes for no reason at all] that I'll be ranting and swearing and just FUMING over the littlest things, and sometimes it's just so bad I don't even know what to do and I want to get away from it so much that I sleep it away as my only option...) >Problems walking? (I half ran into the doorframe and such a few times, and kept bumping into my friend when walking around town) >Word retrieval problems (even if I have just used or heard [like in a lecture at class] a word like 2 seconds before I won't remember it and will have to think for a few minutes) >Off and on neck pain/stiffishness  Does this sound like it could be brain cancer?...I tried looking up the combined symptoms of \"nausea, headache, and nystagmus\" and of the 15 conditions, most were teratogenic (so that doesn't apply) and the others were ruled out by lack of other symptoms etc. The only two that weren't were chemical poisoning (which chemical?) and brain cancer :/... Anyway, sorry for the big block of text, but I figure it may be useful to give details.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms could be caused by a number of conditions.But,i would first try to exclude \"Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)\".   Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC), or idiopathic intracranial hypertension, is a condition characterized by signs and symptoms of abnormally elevated intracranial pressure (ICP) in the absence of a 'space-occupying' lesion.  Can be classified broadly as - primary (idiopathic), meaning that the cause is unknown and - secondary, meaning that there is an underlying cause (other than a space-occupying lesion).  Pathogenesis is unknown, but most of the available evidence indicates that it could be - resistance to CSF absorption at the arachnoid villi(where normal absorbtion of CSF occurs into the venous blood or - Stenosis(narrowing) of some of the major intracranial venous sinuses(notably the transverse sinus)  Post-pubertal women (especially obese) are at a higher risk.  There are several other etiological factors (infections-notably middle ear infections and mastoiditis; drugs; endocrine disorders etc).  Most cases in adults will turn out to be of the primary variety.  Your profile indicates that you are on Bupropion. What is the indication for which you have been prescribed this drug?  This information is vital for diagnosing your problem.  Bupropion is prescribed for some of the following indications... - depression - smoking sessation - as an anti-obesity medication (bupropion given at 400 mg per day for treating obesity). - to treat selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI)-induced sexual dysfunction, - 'adult' attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) etc.  A number of factors point to a diagnosis of either - \"bupropion-induced Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC)- like symptoms\" or - simply, \"Pseudotumor cerebri\", in your case.  - possible obesity, - bupropion is known to cause 'mood swings', - bupropion is known to cause nausea, agitation, anxiety, insomnia, and headache,  - Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC) is common in obese women, - symptoms suspicious of PTC, disorders of peripheral and central vision (you seem to bump into someone or run into a door frame), headaches,nystagmus etc. - bupropion has also been reported to cause symptoms of Pseudotumor cerebri (PTC).

I went to the optometrist a while after I posted this a while ago and appaaaarently my eyes are perfect except a slight muscle problem or something, he said he could look into it but doesn't think it's so slight it wouldn't cause any symptoms.

Always popping and sometimes sharp pains, or I'll wake up partially deaf and have to pop them a bunch to get my hearing back etc...but I've been to an ear doctor before and he didn't find anything :/ so suggested maybe it was an 'on-off' sort of thing (which makes sense, some days are fine) or perhaps dental...I did have a lot of dental work, braces and such (I had a very large overbite and stuff). Am I getting off on a tangent? Haha...anyway, so should I maybe ask to switch my medicine?

I always thought it was because I'd worn my hair pulled up or back that day.  The soreness and tenderness on my scalp just popped up and I decided to google it.  I have no clue what it is and cannot go to a doctor because I have no insurance and no way to pay lab fees. :-/  If anyone finds out any definite answers please share. The soreness is magnified when i gently run my fingers through my hair.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 29 year old male who is currently undergoing chemotherapy treatment for a germinoma tumor. I was diagnosed with this tumor in 2005. It was located in the pituitary region of my brain. A biopsy confirmed that it was germinoma and I received 20 radiation treatments. After I was complete with radiation, the tumor was dissolved. I take hormone supplements: A testosterone shot, cortef and synthroid. My tumor came back this year to my cerebellum and to 2 large masses were found in my L spine. I received spot radiation treatment that got rid of the brain tumor and I have so far received 13 treatments of chemotherapy. I have fainted 3 times in the past 2 months, this never occurred before. My blood pressure drops and I pass out, the doctors have yet to confirm why this occurs. My white blood cell count drops about 5 days after chemotherapy, which is expected. I receive Neupogen shots to help maintain the white blood cell count level. I was scheduled to start my final week of chemotherapy this week, when my blood results came back extremely high for white blood cell. (57,000) My white blood cell count has always been low due to the chemotherapy. The doctor is doing ct scans before I start chemo again to see what the cause of the high blood cell is. I have done research online and read that it may be leukemia, but since I have prior existing health conditions, could this be something else? Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Germinomas usually arise from the pineal gland. Rarely they may arise from the infundibular part of the third ventricle and extend into the pitutary fossa. Germinomas arising from the pitutary itself are exceedingly rare, but have been reported.  Your white cell count level indicates that you probably developed what is known as a \"Leukemoid reaction\". Leukemoid reaction has been also described as one of many \"Paraneoplastic syndromes\". Some tumors are known to secrete a variety of substance (humoral factors/cytokines). resulting in Paraneoplastic phenomena.  One of the substances which has been reported to be produced by some tumors is Granulocyte colony stimulating factor(G-CSF). This can induce a \"Leukemoid reaction\".  'Leukemoid reaction' is a leukocytosis exceeding 50,000 WBC/mm3 with an associated significant increase in early neutrophil precursors. Hyperleukocytosis is presence of >100,000 WBC/mm3. Leukemoid reactions are generally benign.   There are no reported cases of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with intra-cranial  germinomas (to the best of my knowledge). However, there are numerous reportes of paraneoplastic syndromes associated with seminomas of the testis and dysgerminomas of the ovary.  Pegfilgrastim(a Peglycated form of filgrastim) has been reported to rarely (< 1%) cause a significant leukocytosis (WBC greater than 100 x 109/L).This was not reportedly associated with any advese outcomes.  I am not aware of reports of filgrastim(Neupogen) causing a leukemoid reaction.  Thus, a remote possibility of this being an adverse reaction to filgrastim(Neupogen) has to be considered. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: what is a angioma (cavernous) and what are the risks?",
    "content": "Hi,  Cavernous hemangiomas are congenital, developmental malformations of the vascular bed (There is a bit of  controversy as to whether these  are true vascular malformations or very slow growing tumors of capillaries).    In the Central nervous system (CNS), 'intra-axial' indicates that a lesion is 'within' the CNS and 'extra-axial' indicates outside of the CNS.  'Endophytic' refers to 'growing inwards'. 'Exophytic' refers to 'growing outwards'.Due to the high concentration of axons in brainstem, the symptoms due to tumors in this location can appear before these become detectable by neuroradiology.  Patients often present with pyramidal-tract symptoms,cranial nerve dysfunction, or cerebellar symptoms.They can bleed and cause infarction, thus producing symptoms.    Lesions in the brain-stem (mid-brain, pons and medulla oblangata) were not so long ago were considered beyond the scope of surgery and used to be irradiated. The reason behind this were as follows.... - the relatively small cross-sectional area that is tightly packed with nerve fibers getting into and out of the cerebral hemispheres and the cerebellum made surgery extremely hazardous, - difficulties in obtaining sufficiently large specimens for adequately categorizing by histopathology, - lack of imaging techniques such as CT and MRI(neuroradiology).  From 1980 onwards important advances in the field of neuroradiology, neurophysiology and neurosurgical techniques made it possible to attempt to classify these tumors based on CT and MRI findings. Perfusion and diffusion MR is becoming a more and more important tool.  The main purpose of these classifications was to identify which of the tumors would be amenable to surgical extirpation.  Image guided stereotactic biopsies became possible.   The use of intra-operative neurophysiologic monitoring (sensory and  evoked potentials) provides real-time information  about the integrity of brain-stem throughout the surgical procedure. Modern devices such as surgical microscopy, microsurgery (including 'neuronavigator-guided' surgery), bipolar bayonet forceps, contact laser (Nd-YAG) and ultrasonic aspirator(CUSA) greatly contributed to refinements in the surgical techniques.  On T2-weighted MRI, the combination of a reticulated core of mixed signal intensity (SI) with a surrounding rim of decreased SI strongly suggests the diagnosis of a cavernous malformation. Smaller lesions appear as (black dots)- areas of decreased SI. The sensitivity of MRI is based on magnetic susceptibility and possibly diffusion effects produed by the presence of excessive iron (hemosiderin).  Unlike the more common 'Gliomas', Cavernous hemangiomas produce what is called as the 'parenchymal window' , which is the most important parameter to plan the choice of surgical approach. \"Safe entry zones\" may be identified following modern imaging of the surgical anatomy of the brain stem.

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your father in law's condition.   Your question would be impossible to answer without a diagnosis. Not only is it important to determine whether this mass is benign or malignant but many other things go into play: Is it a primary or a metastasis from another tumor? Assuming it is a primary malignant tumor, the most common brain tumors are astrocytomas and with these it's important to determine the pathological grade. Grades I, II behave more less favorably while grades III and IV have a poor prognosis. Some reports indicate that patients who have Grade IV and do not receive therapy have an average survival of 3 months.  In many cases most of the symptoms can be caused by the edema that accumulates around the brain mass. This can be treated with medicines such as steroids and diuretics.   His doctors don't think it's even worth it to get a biopsy? Of course that could be the case, I am in no position to judge. You can always ask for a second opinion.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

So, day of, his wife noticed him making the odd hand gestures and he was talking nonsense, etc.  Upon going to the hospital, the gave him a CT and found a mass in his lung and one on his occipital lobe, like I said.  There was a biopsy done, results not in yet.  Although the doctors are already telling him that it is most definitely cancer.  Yesterday we spoke to dad and he said at this point he is feeling better than he has ever felt in his life.  According to my mother in law, he has been in great spirits.  I think he will be in the hospital through Christmas atleast.  The reason I wrote in the first place was to get a round about idea of what we can expect, my husband in obviously very upset and didn't want to think of his father's last months as dementia and losing sensory and motor skills one at a time.  If it is cancer, my father in law has had heart issues to the point of having his sternum removed and doctor's say that, for one, the brain portion is inoperable and even if it was, he wouldn't survive the surgery.  The same is the case with the amount of chemo or radiation he would need.  I don't know if any of that helps or not but as soon as I have more information, I'll post it.  Thanks so much for all your help!\n\n",

I am not saying it is, I do not have access to all the details.   If this is the case and without therapy then we are talking about months. Then again, I think doctors may change their mind based upon the result of the biopsy. One option that you should discuss with your doctor is the possibility of palliative radiotherapy to the brain.

    "content": "Hi   My father has similarly just been told his Lung cancer and brain mets and is untreatable rendering him with weeks/maybe months to live. I am hoping if this is entirely accurate and exploring possible solutions to this. Not really much information to go on but here is what i know: Dads Medical and work history: Worked in Merchant Navy for 30 Years, Worked in Monde division at Astra Zenica (Formerly ICI), for almost a year in Manchester and Has been a taxi Driver For the remainder, he Is 61 two weeks ago and has never smoked, drinks once ever two months at most, is relatively physically fit and full of energy usually. Never has had a cold since i have known him thats 24 years, no stomach ache or headache either. In this respect he is extremely lucky. He did however develop a couch 3 years ago with phlegm which turned into bloody browny phlegm about 9 months ago.  He had a pacemaker fitted in May 2008 as his heart rate was 30bpm at rest. I beleive one of his valves(bicuspid or tricuspid) was not functioning correctly allowing blood to seep in after contraction of the heart. In December 2008 He was rushed to hospital with really bad chest pain and told it was just pnuemonia even though there was a huge grey area in his lower left lung on X-ray.  He told doctor he was losing weight and throwing up on the medication they had gve him to which he said thats a good thing because slim is better.  After pleading with the nurse to change his medication he was sent home vomiting on taking it and still in pain and coughing. We got a new set of anti-biotics from the doctor and eventually the pain dissipated but my father become increasingly tired and doctors were unsure what the lung mass was. During April 6th my dad got a nasty headache in his right side and 2 days later began collapsing losing all feeling in his left side. CT scan two days later showed two 4.5cm masses in the right front and right mid brain and the primary being in the lung.  A biopsy was taken of the lung but only showed inflammatory cells so the doctors are not going to try and grade of diagnose the cancers and have said he has a few weeks to live. Thye said Chemo and radio therapy may aggravate the cancer and kill him. they haven't mentioned any trials or natural methods of fighting the disease just kept him on lose dose of atorvastin and aspirin.  Should i just accept this or keep plodding on trying to find someone who can treat my father? Any advice welcomed, thanks and sorry for drooling on and posting here but unsure how else to post.  Kind Regards  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry to hear about your father's condition.  Chemotherapy and radiotherapy can be effective in palliating metastatic lung cancer depending on its type. There are several types and which each require very different chemotherapy. That is why the pathology was important. Where in the lung is the tumor situated? Does it say it's peripheral or central?  However, for a patient to be able to receive chemotherapy or radiotherapy he must be fit. This is what oncologist's refer to as functional status. Is your father able to carry on with his normal chores during the day or is he bed ridden? It would be impossible to tell whether or not your father is fit to receive chemotherapy/radiotherapy without a direct medical assessment.  Small cell lung cancer is very responsive to chemotherapy. Brain mets are mostly responsive to local radiotherapy.  You are justified in wanting to seek a second opinion. It's just that here isn't the place for it. Please seek the opinion of another oncologist and let us know what your doctor thinks. An alternative would be to have a long discussion with his current physician and have him explain in details why he thinks your father won't be able to tolerate therapy.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Inoperable Brain Tumor",
    "content": "Hello, here is an update from the above:    My father was recently found to have been misdiagnosed with two brain tumour mets from a lung primary, in fact he had no cancer at all and a brain abscess rupturing is what killed him.    Now while i realise i cannot bring my father back, my mother and i are just so upset by this finding on top of him dying that we are looking for answers as to how doctors could make such a mistake.    He had a stroke april 6th and could not move his left side.  With a slightly raised temperature, irregular heart stats(although apparently normal for someone with a pacemaker) and slow speech he went to the hospital.  Since january the previous year he had been coughing up blood and sputum, had a persistant terrible cough and at times extreme difficulty breathing. Following a pacemaker fitted in May due to an admision to the hospital because of a faulty valve in his heart, he became like an athlete.  I beleive he was given a course of anti biotics aswell which he completed.      slowly the sputum cae back and the cough and then the blood and In NOvember 2008 he was admitted again with incredible chest pains.   They injected around 5 or 6 injections of morphine into his system which had little effect as he went moaning in pain to sleep.    After spending 5 days in hospital he was released with a diagnosis of lower left basal pnuemonia and given numerous pills,he was vomiting still  and could barely walk.  still in pain and showed all the signs of fatigue.    After getting slighlty better he was diagnosed with cancer on april 8th.  The doctor said he was definite it was brain cancer and that it would be months he has left.  He told us this on the 22nd of April, and my did died on the 4th.  we have read some literature and come to the conclusion the abscess although apparently deep in his brain and quite large was treatable.   survival rates vary but are very high above 80% in difficult cases.    Can you help me understand how a doctor could miss such symptoms and not look into them given his history of bacterial infections?  Additionally he had two lung punctures to get a biopsy of the cancerous tissue which came back negative just inflammatory cells before diagnosis was given.  This baffles me as to how someone can say it is lung cancer when the biopsy comes back negative.  please any advice is or questions welcome.  Regards  Paul\n\n",

    "content": "I had the same thing happen. Randomly, after dating the same girl for an extended period of time, I would get intense, debilitating headaches during sex or after climax. I went to see a doctor and she prescribed a blood pressure medication. Needless to say, this killed my ability to have sex. So I went off the medicine and it just went away. The total duration of the problem was about 4-6 weeks.  One thing I might add is that I was taking Adderall while in school. Being a stimulant, it gets your BP up and may contribute. Also, it seemed to happen more when I was laying on my back.  You should seek professional medical advice about it, regardless. It could be a sign of something more serious.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Terrible headache when indrenaline is pumping or during Sex",
    "content": "Hi, Exertion or effort headache is a benign headache precipitated by any form of strenuous activity including sports.Exertional headaches are frequently found in both migraine sufferers and non headache-prone patients.  Headaches occurring in relation to sexual activity are the so called Sexual headaches. Whether Sexual headaches are a variant of the effort headaches or they are a separate entity is not clear. The headache typically occurs de novo in an otherwise healthy person who has not been prone to headaches.  Apart from these, prolonged exertion is believed to act as one of the triggers for a typical migraine.  Sexual headaches tend to occur at sometime during the sexual activity,chiefly coinciding with an orgasm.Position is occasionally related, as the \"active partner\" seems to be more likely to experience sexual headache than the \"passive partner\".  But, one should always remember to exclude serious intracranial pathology before ascribing names such as these to headaches. Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I just had a series of MRI's of my Brian, Cervical and Thoracic spine. I had these MRI's yesterday (friday ) and when I looked at the Brain / Cervical images I noticed one that shows white masses. I am very worried about these. I'm 38, have never smoked, don't drink and in fact have not had a drop of alcohol in years.  I went to the doctors because I've been having serious nerve type pain in my legs and hips, tingling / pins and needles / foot drop and paralysis in my 3 small toes ( can't move or bend them ) on my left foot along with extreme coldness in my left leg.  This started about 6 wks ago. I've also had significant memory issues that have increased over the years along with blurred vision and sporadic bladder issues.  To rule out or in any connection, I also had a lumbar discectomy and laminectomy in Oct 08 so my doctors ordered these MRIs.  I was hoping that someone could tell me if these white spots were something I should be concerned about. I'm sure I'll hear from my doctor, i just was hoping to not have to wait thru the weekend. Thanks so much for any feedback.  RSC http://www.flickr.com/photos/44222043@N06/\n\n",

We are now waiting on more tests to see if he has tumors in any other location.  His symptoms are blurred/double vision, extreme migraine type headaches and he's very unbalanced in his walking.  Because of the location of the tumor he is not a candidate for any biopsy or any type of surgery.  I've also been told they will not be doing any radiation, which leaves only chemotherapy.  The drug I've been told they plan to use is Temador.  I'm scared out of my mind for him, and I have no idea what the future holds for him.  Is there anything at all you can tell me about his situation?  What success rate there may be in such cases?  Any type of prognosis?  I'm desperate for any information.

I see that you have left out some important information (the exact site of the tumor) that would have helped us to offer a better opinion. From the symptomatology,i assume that it is probably sub-tentorial. There is no universally recognised choice of therapy for patients with astrocytoma grade II.The clinical course is generally said to be unpredictable. Proliferation and genetic markers have been tried to identify subgroups of astrocytoma grade II with a rapid progressive clinical course. I hope this information turns out to be useful to you.

    "content": "I haven't had any headaches or any other ailments that would make me suspect I have a brain tumor. I don't remember bumping my head against anytying.  I have had a bump in the back of my head, however, for the last x years. I don't know exactly for long I have had this bump, but I have had it for an unknown amount of years. It's not too big. It's not something that's obvious to the eye. You can only tell it's there if you touch my head. If you were to look at this picture  http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Huma ... nes%29.svg I'd say the bump is about an inch to the right of the interseccion of the temporal, the pariental, and the occipital, in the left side of my head.  How come I never told about this to my doc? I keep forgetting. It's not like I am in pain, so it's easy to just forget about it and move on with my life.  I was told this wouldn't be a brain tumor, since brain tumors grow inside of the skull, but just to be on the safe side, I'd like to hear some opinions.  As I said, I've had this bump for quite some time now, so if it's something malign chances are I am ****** already, but it's good to know anyway.\n\n",

    "content": "I posted same question on headache forum but i don't get response...  first I need to explain my situation. im a 24 year old male working in security buisiness where I need to be in first class health. One problem with this is that when I need some other health care I need first to talk to doctor that works in our firm. problem is that he is able do decrease my health rating and I automaticly stay withouth job and medical insurance so I need some advice before I take any step further.   first my physical traits. I am 24 year old male, white, 190 cm tall and 110-115 kilo. in wheight almost top condition ex smoker, quit six months ago, ocasional weekend alcohol drinker and ocasional marihuana user. (two or three times / month) frequent stress, living in semi industrial town. I passed medical exam in january.  ok now for symptoms I have mild Headaches and it is more discomfort than Headache. they are localized on small area on several places on left side of the occipital temporal and parieteal areas. It feal like pain is near head surface and burnink like it is on skin or scull. in a last two days I developed mild numbnes in left side of face and a facial drop but I have history of facial nerve inflamation. pain comes and goes away. there is no pain after I wake up. pain starts when I start daily activities and sometimes ease up when resting, no pain when walking also. facial drop is only noticable when I close both my eyes and it does not make me dificulties when making expresions like smiling. I feal no weakness in extremities nor doo I have Seizures.    Maybe I should mention one detail that happened few moths ago that can be connected with theese symptoms. In abaout four or five months ago I had a wierd symptom that made me stop working out. The thing is that while I was dooing exercises I started to have headace. I neeed to describe situation. I was dooing incline bench press exercise when I felt a sudden sharp pain in back left side where head and neck join. second day pain was more severe and third day it made me completely quit working out. Pain was trigered ONLY by exercise. Later I didnt had any symptoms apart from short ocasional pains such as one that I described above untill 3 days ago when I felt discomfort in described place.   in my family there is no history of malignant deseases that I am aware of but there is rich history of Strokes in family, great grandfather, and grandfather died from Stroke, one grandmother survived severe Stroke while other survived mild Stroke. I did some bload, and urine tests. My sedmentation was a bit higher than normal 13/30 and that is only thing that was out of referal values ...   I should add that pain is relived when I lie down and it feals like it is 1 - 1, 5 inch in diametar. pain is burning and stinging like several needle`s stinging at once...  coul it be Stroke or tumor?  I really would apriciate if you could give me your opinion    please if I can have opinion I know that you cant tell me nothing withouth tests but I am in dificult situation...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi GTgoon,  I don't think that your pain is due to a stroke or migraine headache.  More likely, I think you may have a pinched nerve in the top of the neck.  The nerves that supply the part of the scalp that you are describing come from the top of the neck.  It is possible that the initial incident with the exercising may have caused a shift or other trauma to the nerve that is now being aggravated.    Seeing a neurologist may be helpful but seeing your primary care doctor is also a reasonable place to start.  If it is a pinched or irritated nerve physical therapy may be of some benefit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However,there is one thing that i fail to understand about your symptoms - the fact that you experience numbness in one half of your face along with the facial weakness. This is rather perplexing, as the facial nerve (seventh cranial nerve) which supplies the facial muscles (muscles of facial expression) is purely a motor nerve.It has no sensory supply to the facial skin. The facial skin is supplied by the divisions of the trigeminal nerve (fifth cranial nerve).I am unable to explain this presentation!\n\n",

The homeopathic doc is suggesting not to go to the ENT b/c they just would give me more meds that haven't worked. And I'm getting confused.

    "content": "Hello --  Normally benign positional vertigo (BPV) will respond well to Vertin (meclazine). If it hasn't (the Stugeron I don't trust), you really need medical attention. While I doubt this is due to a brain tumor (and it is odd how with any neurological/head-related symptoms this is the first thing people consider), something is going on and this apparently isn't just BPV, but something more troublesome, perhaps a bad case of labyrinthitis (inflammation of the labyrinth of the inner ear -- vestibular disease -- the most likely explanation for your problem) or perhaps a sinus issue. The ENT will at least be able to rule these in or out, and there are other, more potent medications that might work for you if this is the case. If the ENT cannot find the underlying cause then you definitely will need to be seen at a medical center, even if it means making an inconvenient trip). Hopefully the ENT can find the root of the problem and at the very least set your mind at ease, and perhaps prescribe something more effective for the dizziness, and perhaps, if vestibular disease, actual exercises to help correct the problem.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "I was also wondering if there was a way I could find out what a normal CT is supposed to look like. Since coming back I've noticed areas that cause me concern. I would feel more at ease if someone could just explain to me what's going on. And as the headaches have still continued (now 9 days out), with no relief from medication, I'm just frustrated.   There are 2 spots in particular that I'm curious about:  First, on my 12th and 13th slices that is a gray dot behind where the sinuses are in previous slices. In the contrast slices, it lights up. It's almost a perfect circle, so I'd just like to believe it's nothing. It's truly nothing, right?  Second, on my 15th and 16th slices, there is a dark spot at the back center, that extends about 1 to 1.5 cm into my brain and is about 1cm wide. In the contrast slide, about 2 cms wide lights up, about .5cm into my brain, and the dark spot is a little more visible. And in slide 16, it's about a 1.5 by 1.5 block of white with a little bit of white in various areas around it.   I just need some explanation, and right now, heading back to the city is not an option for at least another month.   Thank you for helping.\n\n",

    "content": "I gave birth to my first child in July. Everything went well...No problems at all. During my fifth month of pregnancy I started to see floaters and every once in awhile I would see what I can only explain an one speck of silver light (like seeing stars but only one speck)dot across my line of vision. About a month ago my muscles started to twitch. The seem to be twitching mainly in my legs arms and occasionalymy face. I have noticed that I have overwhelming fear that I will not be around to raise my daughter and today I made an appointment with someone that can help with post partum depression. Last night was my breaking point when I noticed that my right eyelid is slightly lower than my left. Today I have had blurry vision...I think this could be related to the amount to crying I have been doing today. I do not have a headache but every once in a while I will feel a little off...like dizzy but not room spinning dizzy. This has not happened in a few weeks. I am so scared and I just need to know if I am persenting symptoms of anything that is going to take me from my little girl...Please Help! Thank You!\n\n",

I do see just one every once in a while while just sitting. I should also say that during my pregnancy I noticed a decrease in vision. I had my eyes checked 3 months Postpartum and it was determined that I was far sighted and needed glassed to read and be on the computer. I work on a computer all day. I, because of my overwhelming fear google too much and I come up with seeing stars all the time could indicate a seziure due to a brain tumor of the occipital Lobe.  I did see a psycholigist last week who diagnosed me with paranoia and anxiey and Postpartum depression. My main concern are the Stars I see. Is this at all a symptom?\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with a pituitary tumor last year - the doctor is taking a 'wait and see' approach to treatment.  Currently, I do have some hormonal disturbances, like premature menopause, but the doctor thinks that it is not worth removing at this point.  Since I was diagnosed, I have developed lumps all over my body.  When they first appear, they are very painful - like a deep bruise but then gradually become less sore as time goes by although, they are still painful to the touch.  The lumps are everywhere - in my breasts, neck, chest, ribs, abdomen, arms, armpits, back of thighs and vary in size from 5mm-2cm.   It seems as though new ones are appearing every week and I could not possiby count the number i have at the moment.  I am wondering if they could be caused by the tumor or if I should have them checked out by another doctor.  My current physician is not concerned about them and has not suggested any further investigation but I am troubled by the breast lumps. There are so many that i would have no way of knowing which ones are okay and which ones could be something to worry about.  I would appreciate any advice.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possible Brain Tumor or Epilepsy",
    "content": "Hello --  While it is possible this sort of symptomlogy could be caused by a brain tumor, there's no particular reason to suspect that, and it strikes me as slightly odd that an MD would throw that in as a possibility vs. epilepsy, unless he was going to try and list all the possible causes, because there are many. In fact, the scattershot approach of ordering an EKG and CT (presumably of the brain) doesn't make a lot of sense without a complete neurological workup.   Your \"spells\" could be causes by a heart irregularity (and so the EKG would then make sense, but usually can be done in most doctors'  offices); an MRI of the brain would be more appropriate also, and hopefully if the EKG shows nothing then a neurological consult will be ordered,as you really do need a neurological workup to rule out partial seizures. The pre-episodal \"visions\" do suggest an aura such as many people experience prior to a seizure, wether it is focal/partial or grand mal. Many more people suffer from epileptiform seizure activity than have \"classic\" grand  mal seizures, although the appearance of either can eventually bring along the other with it.   In  any case, brain tumor would be pretty far down the list of causes.   I hope by now you've at least been worked up for cardiological problems and had them ruled out. If you actually meant EEG rather than EKG, then I hope a neurologist administered the test or at least reads the results. I  strongly suspect partial seizures, which may be managed with medication. An MRI of the  brain would help show up any sort of lesion on  the brain, which need not be a tumor to cause this sort of thing (although,  again, it's not impossible either -- it's just statistically rather unlikely).  I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "For years now I've had a hard (more rubbery than rock hard) lump on the back of my head (not my neck) about 6 1/2 cm behind my right ear.  I'm not sure if it changes size, it does sometimes feel bigger but it may be my imagination.  The size is 1 1/2 cm high, by 2 cm wide.  The skin is not discolored, and doesn't look different than the skin surrounding it.  It doesn't cause any pain but I do get headaches fairly often.  I used to get migraines but the headaches I get now feel like regular tension headaches.    I've asked my doctor but he always says it's a cyst without even looking at it.  I thought cysts were supposed to move under the skin.  I can wriggle mine, but not move it.    Should I be worried, given my family's history of cancer?

Sebaceous cysts are common in the scalp area. The size and feeling with depend on how tense they are as well as their location and the surrounding tissue. Again the movement is not a good indicator.   The fact that they have been there for so long and that you do not have any neck swellings (lymph gland enlargement) are all reassuring.   Should the swelling grow or should you complain of any new symptoms then I would recommend you report that to your doctor right away.  Best regards,\n\n",

Occipital root headache is due to compression of the occipital nerve root by conditions in the neck vertebrae (spinal column).   Tingling sensation over the skin of the neck may be present with this condition. They may occur on one side of the back of the head / neck. X-ray of the upper cervical spine demonstrates osteoarthritis and clinically there may be signs of tenderness on one side of the neck (C2-3 facet joint ipsilateral to the headache).   Occipital neuralgia is a specific condition that results from an inflammation or compression of the greater occipital nerve as it exits at the back of the neck. Pain may be referred to the neck.   On the other hand pain at the back of the head may also result from muscle spasm (tension type headache).   I hope this was helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Any brain tumour, whether benign or malignant can cause seizures. The anatomic site of the tumour makes some more likely to present with seizures than others.  Thus in individuals presenting with seizures especially a recent onset seizure, brain tumours should be excluded first.  The surgical removal of the tumour may result in recovery from seizure attacks although others may have intractable seizures.  Recurrence of seizures after surgical removal may be due to incomplete removal, tumour regrowth, or a residual cerebral hemispheric damage.  Any symptoms similar to what you have been experience before the surgery or suggestive of a neurologic problem warrants proper investigations.  I would advise you not to ignore your feeling and be checked by your doctor for exclusion of any serious cause. He may recommend and EEG and MRI brain.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 19 year old male who had a brain tumor removed from my right temporal lobe in January, 2008.  It was a low-grade tumor not suspected to be cancerous although the test came back inconclusive.  The surgery has affected my short-term memory and I have lost some of my left peripheral vision, otherwise I came through pretty well.  I've had a cold for the last couple weeks and took Nyquil for about seven nights in a row.  Lately I've been experiencing very brief nauseous spells lasting about 30 seconds to a minute - the same symptoms I had before I found I had a tumor.  Can over-the-counter cold medicines have an affect on those of us who have had brain tumors removed?  I know there is a good amount of alcolhol in Nyquil - could that be affecting my brain?  Are there any other OTC meds I should avoid?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is known that NyQuil may cause stomach upset with the sense of nausea and/or vomiting. Flu itself and viral infections give this feeling too.  However, if it is persistent or increasing or vomiting starts to occur especially in the presence of headache, it is important to be checked by your doctor considering your medical history. The fact that NyQuil has also CNS effects like nervousness or anxiety; trouble sleeping, and even headache should make you more cautious while using these medications.  You have to be always in close contact with your doctor for proper management. I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with your new symptoms to exclude serious causes.  Please try to avoid any medications without consulting your doctor and at least getting proper information about your medications from the pharmacist. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Diagnosis of any swelling mandates direct clinical examination. Diagnosis of any lump would be easier when associated symptoms and signs are present. Characters of the swelling like mobility, tenderness, pain, consistency (soft, firm or hard) and any systemic symptoms like fever and weight loss are very important too. However, at this site it could be of bone origin or soft tissue origin. Bony swellings are fixed and hard in consistency. This might be the result of any old trauma that when healed formed this swelling or from tumors.  Soft tissue swellings like: - Folliculitis which is inflammation of the hair follicle forming a swelling that is soft to firm, painful or tender, warm and may decline in size or disappear after recovery from the infection.  - Lipoma, a benign tumour of the fat cell that is felt soft mobile and not painful or tender unless inflamed and it becomes bigger in size too.  - Sebaceous gland (fat secreting gland) when blocked forms a swelling that is soft to firm, may be painful and increase in size when inflamed.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor, he might request an X-ray of the skull if any bone lesions is suspected. Pleas keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I have been to the doctors about 7 times and they have put it down to stress, or migranes. Thing is migranes last for hours and cause sickness, i have felt no nausea and the headaches go away after half an hour or so. Somtimes they only last for 5 mins. These ones are worse. I have also experinced right eye pain and ear pain in both ears, and little flashing lights I also have neck pain and it cracks alot. I am terrified its a brain tumor which isnt helping the whole thing. Im on propanolol What shall i do?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Headaches for 11 weeks",
    "content": "Hello,  This sounds like a migraine headache. Your description of the headache as well as your positive family history makes it the most likely diagnosis. Migraine is very common, and is one of the most debilitating headaches.  Migraine is a chronic condition of recurrent attacks of headache. Most (but not all) migraine attacks are associated with headaches. Migraine headaches usually are described as an intense, throbbing or pounding pain that involves one temple.  Sometimes the pain can be located in the forehead, around the eye, or the back of the head. The pain usually is unilateral (on one side of the head), although about a third of the time the pain is bilateral. The unilateral headaches typically change sides from one attack to the next.   Migraine headache may be preceded by an Aura of migraine, in which people may have numbness in one side of the face, flashes of light, nausea etc   Tension headaches to the contrary often begin in the back of the head and upper neck as a band-like tightness or pressure. Tension headaches also are described as a band of pressure encircling the head with the most intense pain over the eyebrows.  The pain of tension headaches usually is mild (not disabling) and bilateral (affecting both sides of the head). Tension headaches are not associated with an aura and are seldom associated with nausea, vomiting, or sensitivity to light and sound.  Tension headaches usually occur sporadically (infrequently and without a pattern) but can occur frequently and even daily in some people. Most people are able to function despite their tension headaches.  B blockers like (propranolol) is usually prescribed to treat migraine, however, it is more functioning when used before the onset of the headache. It also causes other neurologic symptoms like light-headedness, mental depression manifested by insomnia, and weakness.  Other causes to be excluded are chronic sinusitis, ear problems, and epilepsy. There is unexplained variable association between migraine and epilepsy, in some reports migraine proceeds seizures development, or coexist together. They both are induced by the same factors like hormones, anxiety, stress and alcohol. EEG is helpful.  ENT examination would be useful to exclude sinus and ear problems. If these are excluded then neurologic consultation for exclusion of epilepsy would be helpful.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him your concerns. Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

A thorough neurological examination should be done to exclude conditions like epilepsy variants. EEG may be useful.  Ear infections can also give similar clinical picture and should be excluded. Sinusitis may also give a similar headache but the pain is often exacerbated by leaning forward or head movement, the involved sinus are the sites where the headache is felt and tenderness on palpation of the involved sinus is present. An ENT consultation would be useful.  Other causes like cervical disc prolapse or problems should be excluded and MRI is the test of choice.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor and to inform him that your symptoms are still there, he might recommend ENT referral, if nothing can be found neurologic consultation and EEG may be helpful.

    "content": "Hello,  One of the serious effects of narcotic like hydrocodones is increase in the intracranial CSF pressure, resulting in undesired neurologic symptoms and respiratory depressant effects.  These effects are more likely and more severe if there is a recent head injury or any intracranial lesion or any cause that may increase the intracranial pressure. So physicians must check well the history of their patients before they prescribe it.  Regarding its effect as a carciogenic, there is no data that supports or reject this issue so simply there are no data. Interestingly, these compounds are commonly used in pain management in cancer patients.  I assume your physician asked you about a history of head injury or brain tumor mainly to be sure there will be no serious effects on the neurologic system or on the respiratory functions. You can always discuss with your doctor these concerns.  Hope you find this useful. Best regards.\n\n",

He seems to walk funny when he has a headache but walks and exercises fine when the headache is gone. He also gets headaches while exercising sometimes. I mentioned this to his pediatrician because I thought it was anxiety as it happens about every 3 or 4 days. He became quite concerned and ordered a CT Scan and had it done the next day. The results are being read by a specialist right now and we won't have them until next week because his doctor is away till then. My questions are: 1. The radiologist looked at the first scans and then ordered a dye to be injected and he did another scan. Is this a bad sign? 2. I watched the monitor and saw white spots on the scan. What could these be? 3. How accurate is a CT scan for catching all brain tumours in children? Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Mental Flashes-Could it be a tumor?  How do I ask a doctor?",
    "content": "A few months ago, I walked outside of my office and felt this weird \"flash\".  It was basically like deja vu in a way, except that it did not happen.  It lasted only a few seconds, and I could not place it.  A week or so later as I was walking out, I remembered it happening and before I could do anything else, it happened again.  It was odd, but the \"visions\" were few and far between.  Then, it increased to eventually get to where it is 3-4 times a day for maybe 2 minutes each.  I try hard to isolate and figure out what it is I am seeing.  There are certain things that  seem to \"trigger\" them, and sometimes they come completely out of no where.  There are flashes of things.  An Asian language, a red switch, something done wrong the first time, but was known for the second time. . . I can never quite lock onto it or relate it to myself.  Although the memories or flashes or whatever do not seem to be of anything sad, when they finish I am overcome with grief.  My heart is beating like crazy and sometimes I am shaking.  Lately, I have been getting terrible headaches that last for hours.  Usually my headaches are in my forehead area, but these seem to be over my whole head.  Sometimes they get to the point where I almost do not want to close my eyes for fear they will not open again and things will just end.  They are not terribly painful, but make me dizzy and are kind of consuming.   A few weeks ago, I watched a fictional show, and on it one of the characters had flashes that seemed a lot like I was having.  Quick at first and then longer and closer together.  On the show, it turned out to be this memory from his past, but were coming across that way because he had a tumor.  Obviously, it kind of freaked me out.  If I go to a doctor and explain this, I think they will give me some Tylenol and tell me I am stressed or something and I will feel dumb and will have wasted $50 or so.  If I do not go, though, and later find out something really was wrong. . .    I can not tell if I am being paranoid or not.   I do not have a regular doctor, or would probably feel more comfortable.  I also had a big problem with a doctor when I was a teenager that has caused me to feel a bit skeptical of doctors.  My mind tells me to trust doctors, but my memory tells me I am on my own.     Not sure if any of this will help, but just in case: I am a female, 26 years old.   5'6\" 175 pounds I have been losing weight by cutting calories, but doing it gradually (25 pounds over about a year).  There have been no changes to what I eat, just how much.   No tobacco, drugs, or alcohol. I generally have between 6-8 glasses of water each day.   Oversleep a lot (many days 12-13 hours).   Usually have around 40 oz. of caffeine each day. I do not take any medicine, except for Aleve during my periods.   My job is a basic desk job with an evening shift. Although I have stress, it is not at an unusual level. Nothing traumatic has happened recently.   I decreased elevation by around 2,500 feet when I moved, but that was over a year ago.   I do change elevation at least 4 times a week (but only by a few hundred feet as far as I can tell. . .basically from the valley to the top of the mountain and back). I do not have any allergies that I know of. I have never had any surgeries. I have never given birth or been pregnant. My bowel movements are generally once a week except during my period, when they are daily. My periods seem about regular, but were extremely heavy when I was in my teens.  The \"flashes\" have happened at home, in the car, in a store, and at work.  Both night and day.  Both with other people around and without.    Any ideas or suggestions welcome as to what might be causing this, what I might be able to do on my on, or what to ask the doctor (and what kind of doctor to see).  Any other information that I can provide, please let me know.   I really appreciate anyone who spent their time to read this.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nadia:  There are a number of different things that could be causing these symptoms, some psychiatric and some \"somatic.\"  (Somatic is the new buzz word for purely physical symptoms.)  Going through your symptoms as a psychiatrist, I'd say there is a good likelihood that you may have Panic Disorder or Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder.  You did mention no recent traumas, but what about past trauma?  Going through your symptoms as a physician, however, I noted that you don't have a regular doctor, and so you may not have had a general physical exam in a while.  At your age, there is a possibility that your symptoms may be caused by thyroid dysfunction, and that is a simple blood test.  Anytime there is a symptom such as headaches that become more frequent, or that have changed in character, such as intensity, location, duration, etc., a visit to your primary care provider is in order.  It would be my expectation, that in absence of other symptoms, at least a CT scan of your brain, would be of interest.  At a minimum, a thorough neurological examination is required.  Another potential cause is something such as pheochromocytoma, but this is a very rare condition.  (A pheochromocytoma is a tumor of the adrenal glands in which too much of a hormone is produced which can cause the racing heart, increased blood pressure, and other symptoms.)  If there are any known major illnesses in your family's medical history, you should maybe jot these down and take this information with you when you visit a primary care provider.  I wish I could be more specific, but hopefully this gives you a place to start.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nadia25,  Sorry for the delay: There appears to be two main possible causes for your symptoms: unusual kinds of seizures can cause such symptoms, and I think that you might have these evaluated first by a neurologist. A tumor is possible as you considered and should be ruled out. Migraine headaches and other conditions should also be considered I would not panic and expect a tumor, but one should be on the side of caution and evaluate it to be sure.    Afterward, if nothing is uncovered, your symptoms may represent what is called a dissociative disorder, in which a forgotten memory suddenly appears, but not the entire memory, just a fragment of it, and in a brief, \"flash\", such as yours. In such a situation, a psychiatrist can help determine if this is so and what is best to do about it.  Good luck.   -Eliot Seigle MD\n\n",

    "content": "I have a lipoma in the right quadrimental plate cistern.  It was originally found 20 years ago due to a buzzing and roaring sound in my ears and was 3mm.  Four years ago I suffered a temporary stroke-like episode that caused severe numbness to my left side and tremendous pain.  The MRI showed the lipoma at 9mm.  The numbness went away and full function of my left side has returned with only a marginal reduction in strength in the left extremities.  I have chronic headaches and my doctors all say a lipoma is NOTHING to worry about.  Should I be concerned or just deal with the headaches?   In addition, I am now experiencing chest pain that feels like a tightening or squeezing in my chest that is sometimes accompanied by profuse sweating and dizzyness\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Intracranial lipomas are rare benign congenital neoplasms (0.1 to 0.5% of all primary brain tumors). They usually develop in the midline and are associated with other cerebral developmental disorders (in 50%). They are known to be slowly growing and seldom cause symptoms or require surgery.   They are usually discovered accidentally with CT-Scans and associated  symptoms are thought to be due to an associated mid line disorders or vascular variants.  When surgery is indicated, all attempts are done to make surgical manipulation the minimum (incomplete removal) to avoid complications.  Your history is suggestive of an associated intracranial vascular problem that caused stoke and possibly causing your current symptoms.   If your symptoms persists or progressive I would advise you to contact your doctor and do a new CT Scan or MRI brain. It is important to follow up the lipoma (size and appearance) and to exclude any other associated anomalies.  The character of your chest pain makes exclusion of cardiovascular problems essential, considering also your strong positive family history for heart disease and being a chronic smoker. EKG and echocardiography are recommended investigations to check for cardiac functions.  Only by direct clinical examination and complete history the proper investigations can be recommended to reach the final diagnosis and the specific treatment.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This swelling could be of skin, subcutaneous tissue or bone origin. Characters of this swelling like its consistency, mobility, relation to surrounding tissues, etc would make it easier to suspect possible causes.  You may have been recently exposed to a minor trauma that caused inflammation of the skin and subcutaneous tissue of this part resulting in a localized collection of inflammatory fluid that is felt as a swelling.   It could also be related to one of the previous traumas you have been exposed to. One of them may have been severe enough to cause bone injury that when healed caused an elevation in this part of the skull.  Feeling of nausea when it is touched is difficult to be explained before clinical and radiological examination.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor who may recommend a  plain X-ray skull or CT Scan of the brain.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to tell the nature of this lump from what you described. However, it is quite clear that she has neurological symptoms suggestive of nerve compression.   This lump could cause some compression symptoms similar to what you have mentioned. It could be a subcutaneous or bone related swelling and only direct clinical examination can guide us to further confirm its nature.  But it is less likely to think of brain tumors since brain tumors are not externally apparent as you described and usually manifest with: - Nonspecific symptoms like headache, nausea and vomiting. - Specific signs and symptoms are usually related to the location of the tumor. Brain tumors can be seen by CT scan or MRI of the brain.  She also has bruises which suggest bleeding tendency that might be unrelated to this lump or indirectly related through the excess use of analgesics for example.  I understand your worry and I advise you to convince her go for direct medical consultation.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

We rushed her to the ER (same hospital that did the surgery) and the CT scan and MRI did not show any shunt malfunction.

She said the pain was tolerable while lying flat, she had extreme pain and pressure when she sat up or stood up.  This went on for 3 to 4 weeks.  Last Thursday 11/29/07, I took her to an appointed (not medical related) and she slumped in her seat, said the pain was unbearable and her vision was very blurred.

I learned this this morning, and I am really trying to remain calm as difficult as it is. The neuro is consulting surgeons and radiologists on what the next step is, and he has said that a biopsy is almost certain (which is terrifying). What are the real statistics here? I know I am not going to die from this thing any time soon, unless it grows very rapidly, on the MRI picture (the large print with like 30 small pictures on it so maybe a 3\" x 3\" picture or whatever dimension) the tumor was about the size of three popcorn kernels set next to each other ( the non-popped kind). It is not a big tumor, but it is larger than I wish was there. I am 20 and a male, no smoking, illegal drugs, drinking. What could have caused this and where is this going, what will my next few months be like trying to get this all figured out?  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Headaches = Brain Tumor?",
    "content": "I am a 25 yr. old male, and for the past week, I have had a dull headache plus a feeling of light headedness.  I am kinda dizzy, but it isn't vertigo when everything seems to be spinning, just a feeling of light headedness.  This headache is usually in both temples, and it seems to come and go.  It never wakes me up, and it usually feels the best when I lay down.  I haven't notice any vision or hearing problems.  This feeling usually starts in the morning or early afternoon, and then subsides in the evening when I am about to go to bed.  I am not vomiting, and I don't have much feeling of being nauseated.  One other symptom is that I usually have a soar throat most mornings when I wake up, and then that quickly goes away.  I am really not that congested either.  I am not really in severe pain; however, it is annoying.  Also, the headache gets better if I am active and moving around.  When I am sitting or standing, that is when it tends to be the worse.  Could this be a brain tumor, or something common like sinuses or allergies, eventhough I don't know if I have any allergies or not.  Should I go to the doctor?  I have tried taking Tylenol and Excedrin, but it doesn't seem to completely take the headache away.  I am now going to try and take sinus medicine.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I would be unable to assess the seriousness of your condition but these symptoms are not diagnostic of brain tumors. Brain tumors may manifest with a range of symptoms. Some have no symptoms at all while others are associated with very severe symptoms such as neurological symptoms (e.g., paralysis), coma or death. Headache is one of these symptoms and the difficulty lies in its mainly subjective nature. Patients tend to describe headache in different ways. So your complaint may actually fall into this category.  We generally do not depend on headache alone to suspect the presence of brain tumors. Many other symptoms and criteria are taken into consideration.  Please refer to your physician who will be able to assess your condition and properly advise you on what you should do.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Good evening.  22/F History: PAC,PVC, MVP. orthostatic hypertension, angina, pars plantis of eyes, migraines, multiple surgeries for ovarian cysts and removal of cysts on body ( finger joint, eyelid, leg), short term memory disfunction, unknown nerve damage causing numb spot in back upper beside spine. Family History:Cancer, High BP, Stroke, Diabetes, Cardiac, Lupas, Blood Clots (all mother /father) Meds: Midrine for migraines  Within the past 3 weeks the following symptoms have occurred: Right pupil now visibly larger than left. Right eye impaired with a shaded/grey tint to everything making visibility difficult and off balance. Left leg from knee to ankle completely numb.  3 episodes of blackouts (hit head twice on asphalt). Dizzy spells with confusion. Headaches.  Today, left hand went numb on top and pinky began to tingle.  Sometimes lose balance walking and veer to one side. Have not mentioned to doctor, but over weekend I lost ability to speak for several hours (3). Words were in my head but could not pronounce them from mouth. Went to bed like this, woke up normal next day. A CT of brain performed a 2 weeks ago showed \"looks to be\" pineal cyst (not excluding neoplasm\u2019s) with calcification and abnormal large blood vessels. All this will be confirmed with MRI next week. The rapid progression of these symptoms has me worried if next week may be too late. I doubt a small pineal cyst would cause all this. But I am not a doctor, so I ask for you advise. Should I ask my doctor to pursue further sooner?  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree that a pineal cyst is unlikely to  cause your symptoms.  I am quite concerned about your symptoms.  There are a few possibilities.  One is that you are having transient ischemic attacks (sort of like chest pain before a heart attack; TIA's are often warnings of a future stroke).  You are quite young so this makes stroke much less likely; however, it is a serious enough issue to make it worth while to evaluate.  Another possibility is complex migraines which can produce a variety of neurological symptoms.  Seizures are also possible.  I agree you should have the MRI done.  I would also recommend you see your doctor as soon as possible to discuss your symptoms and start the work up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If it is not a recent change and you just discovered it after a hair cut, then it could be your normal skull shape.  It is of consideration if there is a recent change and there is any associated symptom and sign suggestive of a pathological cause like pain and tenderness.  It is advisable to contact your doctor; he may recommend an X-ray skull to better define the nature of this swelling and to decide further management.  Best regards, Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Pineal cyst/tumour (?) diagnoised yesterday",
    "content": "Hi there,  Last week I went and had a CT scan in realtion to dizzy spells that I had been having for the previous 3 weeks (since going off OCP), about one a week.  My doctor told me that this was only precautionary and that he expected that it would all come back clear.  On the scan they found a 21 x 22x 12mm (which is moderate according to my GP but seems to be HUGE in my books) pineal cyst or more correctly what they believe is 'likley a simple pineal cyst'  They then went on to say that a it may also be a epidermoid cyst though due to its positioning this is less likley.  They then recommended I undergo a MRI.  The cyst iself was 'slightly hyperdence to the CSF\" and did not light up at all when I was given the contrast agent (iodine by iv)  My GP told me that this meant that they were 'almost certain' that it is a pineal cyst, 'no' it is not a tumour and 'no they did not order the MRI beacause they want to make sure it isnt a tumour, they just want to get a better look at it\"  He said that I shouldn't be worried and that there is a one in a million chance that they would need to do anything about it... although he did say that my husband and I should stop trying to fall pregnant until this matter is resolved.  So I guess my question is should I be worried that it may actually be a tumour?  If my CT results say it is likely a cyst  does that mean they are not sure or that it is a cyst but to cover themselves legally I need to have a MRI? Or since they hypothesised it may be either type of cyst is the MRI being done to work out which one?  Or is the MRI just so they have a clearer idea of where exactly in the pineal gland ithe cyst is and what is may be resting on?  My GP was very sure (again he used the term almost certain) that it is a cyst and that it is nothing to worry about (apart from the dizzy spells which he believes are unrelated and due to panic attacks) I have no symptoms (all my blood work was normal FHS and LH specifically as well a a bunch of others) and is a incidental finding.    I am absoloutly terrified  (very emotional and very panicy) that it is a tumour and/or that if it is a cyst I will need brain surgery.  Am I overreacting to just a cyst or should I be going into the MRI thinking that there is a distinct possibility it is cancer because the CT wouldn't be able to tell the difference between the two.  Surley if there was even a posibility given its location and its size I would been have advised to go straight to hospital.? How often will a CT show somthing to be a cyst (would they call it this if they were not 100% sure) that and then a subsequen MRI will show to be a tumour?   Thanks for you time and in advance for your reply.... as you may be able to tell Im an emotional wreck at the moment!  Ohh Im 26, female and have no notable medical history.  I went off OCP 1 week before this began (dizzy spells), had them for 3 weeks ( 3 in total), had a 28 day cycle (like clockwork) and havn't had a dizzy spell in a week and a half.\n\n",

    "content": "CT scans are very helpful in imaging the brain; however, they don't give quite as good pictures as an MRI.  The MRI is often recommended to get more precise measurements and locations as well as get a better sense of a masses composition.  It sounds from your report that the radiologists have recommended the MRI just to get confirmation of their initial findings.  Based on the CT, the likelihood of it being a simple pineal cyst is very high.  The MRI will help verify this.    Most tumors will have blood flow to them.  Your CT findings show this not to be the case, so a tumor is less likely.  I would agree with your primary doctors interpretation based on the report you have shared.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They haven't been so bad until now. It'll always start from the back right side of my skull shooting to the front. Feels like someone just stab me with a screwdriver in the head. It'll last for 15sec or less. When this happens to me my vision blurs for 30sec or a minute.  Of course making me lose my balance if standing or walking. This has happen to me yesterday. I was going to take a shower and out of no where this sharp pain struck me in the back of my head shooting to the front. Yes, I lost balance and my vision was blurred. Today I woke up and ran my fingers along the back of my ear and notice a bump knot like on the bottom of my skull.  It's a hard knot that doesn't move but hurt to the pressure but not touch. As of now I just feel slight pain on my right side of my skull. I feel tingling sensation around my eyes to the back of my skull where this bump like knot is just behind my ear below my hairline. Does this has anything to do with my sharp pain headache? Sometime I'm afraid it'll occur when I'm driving and cause an accident. So, I don't drive when I'm feeling tire. But again this pain will come out of nowhere.  I would like to see a doctor but then again I'm one of those people who has no insurance. What can I be suffering from? Anxiety? But that doesn't explain the bump...\n\n",

    "content": "Given all your husband's symptoms it is likely that your husband has an infection, likel due to a virus.  Infections very commonly cause lymph nodes to swell.  The location you are describing the lump in is one of the commonly affected lymph node chains.  Lymph nodes that are swollen to help fight infections commonly are tender and can feel fluid like although they typically are described as rubbery feeling.  While, by odds, this is the most likely explaination, there are some other possible causes.  It is possible that your husband does have a cystic structure that has subsequently caused an infection that may be the cause of the headaches, etc.  These types of infections typically will require antibiotics to clear.  Since the symptoms have been going on for a few weeks I competely agree with him being seen by a doctor for a full examination.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "title": "Arachnoid Cyst?",
    "content": "I am a 30yr. old female and have been extremly ill since the end of July 2006.  I have tested positive for Mono and RMSF since then.  I was sent to the U of U Medical Center for the ID Specialist.  She had no way to test to see if I had active mono or previous infection and the RMSF showed past infection.  I have had an MRI of the brain with the findings as follows: Posterior to the right cerebellar hemisphere is a sharply demarcated oval extra-axial cyst (2 x 1cm) which follows CSF attenuation/signal pattern.  Following contrast no enhancement visible.  Brain parenchymal pattern shows multiple small deep white matter hyperintensities also within the basal ganglia bilaterally.  Left maxillary sinus shows (1.5cm) smoothly outlined cyst with high T2 signal. Interpretation: Posterior right cerebellar extra-axial fluid collection following CSF signal intensity.  Findings compatible with an arachnoid cyst with other etiologies much less common.  Rarely this might represent some type of neurenteric cyst. Left maxillary sinus cyst. Also on a CT of my abdomen I showed a small (5mm) cyst on the left kidney lower pole. Are these cyst related?  Could they be making me so ill?  (Headache, nausea, pain, can't stand loud or mutiple noises, locking jaw, eye twitching, extreme fatigue, etc...)  How serious is an arachnoid cyst and what other etiologies could it be?  What is a neurenteric cyst? Is the deep white matter and basal ganglia hyperintensities related to the cyst? Any help would be deeply appreciated!!!  My first physician only mentioned my sinus cyst, said it was benign and not to worry,  I had to request my results and found the arachnoid cyst on my own.  The Infectious Disease Specialist seemed concerned by the MRI results.\n\n",

They are generally benign, incidental findings-even when quite large.  The cyst of the kidney is also likely to be an incidental finding.  An occasional renal cyst is relatively common.  As for the other findings on your MRI, I am unable to comment.  I am not familiar with what this may indicate.  I hope this helps a little.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Most of the time the pain is so minor that medicine is not necessary. Generally I wake up with them and they seem to start in the back. I am worried because of the frequency and a couple of other symptoms. I get some tingling in my left had sometimes and I do tend to zone out sometimes. I don\u2019t think the zoning out is a minor seizure as I don\u2019t seem to have any black areas but now I am not sure. I also often have trouble finding words. Never basic words, but lots of umms before I come up with the correct ones at times ( I work in sales so I talk a lot).  What is the incidence of brain tumors? Do my symptoms match the profile?   I am seeing a Doctor tomorrow but looking for some feedback here as well.  Thanks.\n\n",

I am female. There is no history of brain tumors in my family, although there is a history of heart disease. Past surgeries are ovarian cysts ( the ones with hair skin teeth) I presently have a ovarian cyst on my only remaining ovary and a \"growth\" on my uterus.

    "content": "Hello,  There are many causes of chronic headache. It could be one of the primary headache syndromes (more common) or a manifestation of an elevated blood pressure, neck problems, eye problems, ear problems or sinus problems. Primary headache includes tension type headache, migraines and cluster headaches.  Brain tumors may present as intermittent deep, dull aching of moderate intensity, which may worsen with exertion or change in position and may be associated with nausea and vomiting. On examination there maybe neurological signs.  Sinus headache is usually worse in the morning and on bending over. It may feels like a painful fullness. The area over the sinus is usually tender. If present it may show on the CT scan.  I would strongly recommend that you get an examination. If your daily headache is of recent onset or is progressive in intensity then you may require further investigation by CT/MRI.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "painful scalp after dental procedure",
    "content": "Hi - I am 31years old male, no previous serious illnesses and no history of such in my family. I can say I felt depressed a lot for some time after the sudden death of my father in summer 2005. I did not see doctor for this and it went away slowly. Not taking any medications.  I have been to a dentist for deep cleaning of both lower and upper teeth on right side only. I had one-half of my mouth anesthesized for the procedure. Two days after, I developed (presumably) some infection, had painful gums and lymph node on right side of my neck. I have also developed very strange and quite intensive pain in the skin on right half on my head. The pain was sharp, triggered by touching the skin, sometimes cramping suddenly without any stimulus. I felt it on right side of the face, forehead and a little on the upper half of the back of the head. I had very painful hair too. It stayed for two days and than went away.   Three weeks after - I went for the deep cleaning of the left side of my mouth - the same procedure as for the right side. Precisely two days after I developed the same symptoms as the first time except this time on the left half of the head. Painful gums and lymphnode. The pain in the skin involved only ear, fore head and top of the back of the head (no face) but it was quite a pain. I could not touch my hair since the pain that caused almost made me cry. Often I had sudden onsets of it (2-3sec long) without apparent trigger. The chewing on the left side was nearly impossible due to the pain in ear and in the area where the jaw joint is. The whole thing lasted for 48 hours and was only partially responsive to 800mg tylenol/8hours.  This pain I describe feels quite different than regular headache. I suffer from these. Had two quite intensive one day headaches since begining of 2006. I attribute these to stress.   I remember now  that I'd sometimes have painful scalp/hair on one side of head but not as intensive as these two recent events.  I'd very appreciate any advice on what this might be and what I am supposed to do - I am afraid that painful hair would signal to my primary that I am a waste of his time.  Thanks Pavel\n\n",

Thankyou for using our site and I hope I will be of help to you.  Regarding your condition, Does your hair hurts the most on combing it, or it hurts all the time?! is it at the fron of your scalp or all over your scalp!? and you are neither diabetic nor hypertensive,right?  If you do a random blood sugar test and a lipid profile,and something like ESR, we can attribute your headaches to something called temporal/giant cell arteritis. Its treatment is corticosteroids but the only definative confirmation of the disease is a biopsy,but let's not jump into conclusions before we underline what we have first.  temporal arteritis can present with attacks of headaches(moderate to severe),jaw claudications(pain in the muscles of mastication),arthritis,etc since it can be categorized as an autoimmune disease.But at the end of the day it can be controlled. I don't think it is related to a brain tumor though. If you have a family history of cancer and you want to do a CT scan of the brain with contrast that is fine,but not necessarily unless you are at risk.  Best regards,\n\n",

I'm not an oncologist, so please have your friend discuss any of my recommendations before trying them as many chemotherapy medicines have interactions that can be important to know about.    The old stand by for itching is diphenhydramine (Benadryl).  This really only helps with histamine related itching-not likely the cause of your friends itching.  It generally makes people feel sleepy and takes their mind off the itch.  Hydroxyzine is a \"stronger\" form of histamine blocker that can be helpful for more severe itching.  Also, doxepin can be of help for itching.  (Again, please talk with her oncologist before starting any medication.)  Also, topical steroid creams can be of some help.  Over-the-counter creams are limited to low potency medications like hydrocortisone.  Stronger ones are by prescription only.  Some of our other members are more experienced with oncology and may be of more help than I can be.  I hope your friend can find some relief from her itching.  Hope this helps\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A skin reaction to radiation therapy may result in red and sore skin, like a sunburn, that may peel. This usually develop gradually after several sessions and tend to calm down two to four weeks after your treatment has finished.    I would like to add some more detailed instructions that might help. General instructions for reducing skin complications due to Radiotherapy are very essential and include: - Daily wash using unperfumed soap and warm or cool water for the affected area and only a soft towel should be used very gently to dry. -Talcum powder, lotions are not allowed as it can increase skin reactions.. -The skin in treated area is sensitive and patients should avoid exposure to sun or cold winds e.g. wearing silk or cotton scarf. -Initial use of a plain, non-scented, lanolin-free hydrophilic cream is very beneficial in preventing radiation skin reactions, but it should be stopped once  there is a skin breakdown.  There is  no sufficient evidence to support or avoid the use of topical agents like corticosteroids, sucralfate cream, or specific dressings in the management of radiation induced acute skin reaction.    Many radiation oncologists suggest that low-dose (i.e., 1%) corticosteroid cream may be beneficial in reducing itching and irritation ( by their clinical experience). However, Itching is a considerable side effect that warrants close follow up for fear of further skin complication if improperly dealt with.   Thus, -Don't use creams or dressings to the affected area (unless prescribed by your radiotherapist after direct examination) and caution must  be taken to prevent the overuse of corticosteroid cream. The value of oral agents (like., enzymes, sucralfate) is also not conclusive but no evidence of harm from them.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Last year I suddenly lost my sense of smell and subsequently had some strange smells I couldn't describe or seem to lose. As a result my dr. ran some blood tests and sent me for a head CT scan. My prolactin level was raised at 67 so he decided to also do a pituitary CT scan. I had the scan in Sept/05 and the scan diag a 7mm left sided pituitary tumor(not pressing on optic nerve), which I understand is relatively small. I'm in Canada and plagued with long wait times and currently waiting for a referral to a neurosurgeon (wait times to see endrocronologist are over a year in my province) in the meantime I asked for repeat of my prolactin level - it came back at 14.   Recently, I've had some severe attacks of vertigo.  One bad attack lasted a full day (room spinning every time I moved my head and bad nausea) and mild vertigo continued for a couple of weeks.  I've also had stabbing pains on the right side of my head right above my ear.  After mentioning these systems to my GP he arranged for me to see the neurosurgeon sooner, which is hard to do out here.    Is it possible the pituitary tumor from the CT is another type of brain tumor?   Are there any questions I should ask or tests I should request (blood tests, etc - I'm hoping he requests an MRI or at the least a repeat CT) from the neurosurgeon?  I'd like to be prepared and knowledgable before I see him.  Thanks for your time and any and all advise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling well now and that the results of your investigations were favorable.  Functioning microadenomas of the pituitary are common in women and may lead to a syndrome known as galactorrhea-amenorrhea syndrome. They rarely grow large enough to affect the neighboring optic chiasma.  Vertigo is caused by many diseases some of which are related to the vestibular apparatus in the middle ear (peripheral) others are related to the CNS (central).  Peripheral causes of vertigo include diseases of the semicircular canals such as benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease and vestibular neuritis (viral infection) as well as ototoxicity from drugs such as environmental chemicals (e.g., lead, mercury, tin) and some medications as well as alcohol.  Medications known to cause ototoxicity include aminoglycoside antibiotics, antineoplastic chemotherapy (cisplatin) as well as some antidepressants, antihypertensives, loop diuretics, anticonvulsants, aspirin, some cold medicines and quinine.  Central causes of vertigo include diseases of the vestibular nerve, brainstem, and cerebellum such as head trauma, stroke, hemorrhage, migraine, multiple sclerosis as well as tumors such as acoustic neuroma.  Other causes may include systemic diseases such as cardiovascular insufficiency, renal or liver failure.  My best guess is that your vertigo may not be directly related to your pituitary adenoma.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear XOXO,  It is not so clear from your description how much your skin is damaged and how deep the injury has affected this part.  Post-traumatic skin changes or sequel are better examined  by a dermatologist. If the condition is simple and only conservative measure would help, it would be appropriate to start treatment as early as possible. Conservative measures include certain topical treatments and  physiotherapy  If these measure do not work or the condition is severe from the start then the surgical correction is an option if you are very upset with these changes or if it is causing disfigurement.  Reconstructive techniques range from simple scar revision to a complex techniques to help patients back to a more normal appearance and function.   it is better to take an appointment for your doctor to be examined and for proper management.

    "title": "Meningioma",
    "content": "I am a 57 yr old female.  I have previously been diagnosed with SLE, RA, sjogrens disease and osteoarthritis.  I have had a hysterectomy, knee replacement, galbladder removal and surgery to repair a foot which was injured in an accident. Family history includes: Mother:  breast cancer, osteoporosis, diminished lung capacity, high blood pressure, acid reflux, asthma Father:  deceased (Alzheimers Disease), skin cancer Grandmother:  stomach cancer, RA, high blood pressure Grandfather:  skin cancer Sister:  Multiple Sclerosis, Grave's Disease Sister:  Pituitary tumor (disappeared), asthma Brother:  Asthma Current medications: Predinsone, Methotrexate, Effexor, Ambian, Aciphex, Placqunil, Glucosamine/Chondroitin, Fish Oil, One-a-day vitamin, Caltrate-600, Folic Acid, Imitrex   A 2 cm meningioma with \"a tail\" just showed up (Jan. 9, 2006) on an MRI taken of my head.  I was referred to a neurosurgeon who said it is located awfully close to my optic nerve so he is therefore skeptical about using Gamma Knife as a viable procedure to remove it.  He sent me to a neuro-opthamologist and took my films to a \"Gamma Knife convention\" meeting (I believe this is a group who attended a Gamma Knife convention.)  3 of the 4  \"gamma knife convention\" group of neurosurgeons said gamma knife was out of the question...as did the neuro-opthamologis.  They say it is surgery or wait/watch.  The danger of waiting and watching is the chance it will grow into the optic nerve or close enough to make the surgery very risky as far as damage to the optic nerve. I am wondering where is the best place to go to get treatment for this; or get a second opinion.   I am also wondering if something like steroids could make it reduce in size or go away.  I have been on varying amounts of steroids for 3 years and on methotrexate for 1.5 years (which I thought was a possibility for treatment of meningiomas). I have Lupus and had been having, what I thought was, migraine headaches which were increasing in number and intensity.  I ended up in the hospital with one a couple of weeks ago.  I was on Topamax, Imitrex and pain medicine..not to mention the other meds I take for Lupus (Methotrexate, Prednisone, Plaqunil, etc.)  Both the neuro-surgeon AND the neuro-opthamologist said they didn't think the meningioma was the cause of my headaches.  Yet when my rheumatologist increased my steroids this week from 1.5 to 2 mg per day, I already feel some relief from the tingling on the side of my head and I have not have a bad headache since then.  The neuro surgeon thinks it may be best to do a craniotomy.  I am NOT wanting to do the surgery and had hoped something like the gamma knife, the cyber knife or FSR might work. Where is the best place to take care of and cure something like this? All of my eye tests checked out fine. The headaches, however, are debilitating and occuring every other day until I increased the steroids.  Would relief from steroid indicate swelling around the tumor?  I am very concerned about the right path to take.  I don't want my vision impaired by either neglect or gamma knife/surgery.  I also would like relief from the \"tumor headaches\" What do you think?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kammi,  In treatment of meningioma, Total resection is still the primary curative approach for meningioma. Complete resection is the goal in surgical treatment however, being slowly growing benign tumor,  less invasive approaches are considered in certain type of patients .   When the risk of surgical removal outweigh the advantages of complete resection, alternative therapy like Radiotherapy is considered. Radio-surgery is a highly focal, closed-skull external irradiation in which an imaging-compatible stereotactic device for precise target localization is used to deliver the radiotherapy dose.  Selection of patients who are candidate for radiosurgery is very important. In general, eligible Patients with meningiomas are those with Well defined lesions by CT or MRI, of tumor size less than 3.5 cm in average diameter and located at least 5 mm from the optic chiasm or nerve.  You have mentioned that the lesion is very close to the optic nerve. That is why your consultant did not encourage Radiosurgery using the Gamma knife due to the high risk of optic nerve injury.  I am not a specialist in this area however, , Observation according to your MRI results is not a very safe approach, again due to high possibility of optic nerve compression.   An expert neurosurgeon would be more helpful in giving you detailed in formations about the best approach in your condition and how to be followed up.  Best regards,\n\n",

I don't want to lose my life to this if it is not necessary.  I can barely breath because they took me off of the cardiac depressants and put me on regular high blood pressure medication and a medication that would inhibit ectopic beats.  Since ectopic beats with atypical tachacardia can be very harmful.  But, it does not keep my heart beat down enough so that I can function and breath.  I am bedridden most of the time because I cannot breath if I stand up for very long.    Please, there has to be a doctor somewhere that has some suggestions as to what to do.  I keep getting the door shut in my face because of not having insurance or enough money to run the MRI with contrast that I need in order to get a correct diagnosis.  I just need some help.  Please.

    "content": "unfortunatly not having insurance will be a deciding factor as to which tests are run, considering the hospital will probably have to eat the cost. HOWEVER, this does not mean that you are not entitled to have full tests run, regardless of the cost. If you were to go to the ER with problems they would have to run all the nessesary tests. If you go to your primary, it would be considered a non emergent test, as far as I understand. This is my suggestion for you. Ask your primary doc why he isnt running these test. Either he feels no need to run them or the lack of funds or insurance is the factor. Then ask him what you can do to get these tests done. Do you qualify for medical assistance? definatly check with your doc, he has come across this before I am sure and he should have a TON of references for situations like these.

Not a doctor, but if they see this and respond different, then I must be wrong!!!  Wait and see what happens.  Don't junp to conclusions to quickly.\n\n",

It hasn't gotten any bigger  (at least I don't think so) and is not painful. It is very hard, feels like bone almost. I went to see the doctor couple weeks ago about swollen lymph nodes in my neck/jaw area and the lump on my head. He felt my neck/jaw, stomach area (pushing down and that) and around my collar bone and the lump on my head. I had really no other symptoms, and he said it might be a mild case of mono. But he didn't do any tests. Well one thing I left out and didn't really think about it is I always feel dizzy/ light headed. I have been for a month. I feel fine otherwise. The only other symptom I had was a stiff sore neck. But it feels fine now. What could this lump be   I've been searching Google all month for answers, but I haven't found much. This is really bothering me, I've been thinking about since I found it.  Please help me!\n\n",

It is mostly that I am really dizzy, I have also had blurred vision when I first wake up in the morning that lasts for about three minutes, and the eye doctor told me this  is not normal.  I have come extremely close to passing out a few times, and I get more dizzy when I am trying to concentrate on something, such as driving! I have really odd sensations in my head, a lot like pressure mostly in the back. I often times get dizzy after standing up for any length of time, and this has been getting worst!  I went for a walk tonight with my dad and I was having trouble walking my legs felt sore, and kind of numb, and my head hurt a lot! Does anyone have any idea as to what this might be?

Unfortunately, the symptoms you describe could indicate a lot of things, so I am not going to make any guesses.  Anticipate going for some bloodwork, though to rule out things like lyme's disease and endocrine imbalances.  Anticipate also an MRI on your head.  This will check for any anatomical inconsistencies.  Good luck and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "I really don't know where this post belongs because the symptoms are so weird, but scary.  I'm just putting it everywhere I can think of that has something to do with the head.  I am looking for information anyone might have related to this very frightening new problem I have. It started one night about a month ago as I tried to go to sleep. I was without ultram that night due to a mistake by the pharmacy. I take this medication on a daily basis. As I tried to fall asleep, I would hear a very loud pop inside my head. I would jump awake, startled and my heart was racing. Nothing like this had ever happened before. I concluded that it must be either a reaction to not having my medication, or a myoclonic jerk. I didn't experience the problem again until last week. This time I was sitting at work - not asleep or trying to go to sleep, and I had my medicine - when again I hear a very loud pop inside my head. It was as startling then as it was the first time I experienced it. But this time, when it happened I also felt like an electrical current was running through my body and my vision dimmed. It was all over in a second, but was quite frightening and I felt oddly drained and somehow disassociated from myself. I decided it must be stress. Despite all my best efforts, it keeps happening on a daily basis. It's never the same time each day. I can't identify a medication that seems to be causing it. I haven't changed anything about my schedule or diet. Now it's beginning to happen multiple times per day, and the after effects seem to be lasting longer and getting more severe. I'm also experiencing some short-term memory deficits.  I will pull up in my driveway at home, but have no real recollection of leaving my office and driving home.  I can also have a conversation with someone and then immediately forget what we discussed.  I am quite frightened.  I have a long and confusing medical history but I've never had anything quite this bizarre. I am also having problems with flushing, almost constant low grade fever, numbness and tingling in my hands and feet, profuse sweating for no apparent reason, a need to constantly swallow and headaches. My gp, I feel, is convinced i'm psychotic. I know it is a bizarre set of complaints, but they ARE happening. I am on the verge of believing my gp must be correct, but thought I might reach out to some medical forums before I actually commit to being psychotic. I had a similar problem earlier in life with my endometriosis. My doctors had no clue and told me I was crazy. I found great help in an online forum that eventually led me to the top endo doc. In the country. I'm hoping for the same here. Please help.\n\n",

Rethink what you are doing, make sure you are not taking other medications with your Ultram, not drinking alcohol, taking the correct dose and not using herbal products. You need to stress to your doctor right away what you are experiencing; you may be having pre-seizure warnings (auras). You are having neurological problems from something and need to see a doctor, a Neurologist would be good.  I put this same answer under you other post as well.\n\n",

However, I have taken those same medications for some time without any sort of side effects, and after consulting my pharmacist, he doesn't feel any of the other medications I take should be interfering with the ultram to cause this new problem.  I also do not take any sort of herbal supplements and my daily multivitamin is only vitamin - no herbal additions.  So, heeding your warning I have made an appointment with a local neurologist.  Unfortunately, there are few specialists in my area so appointment dates are more than a month away.

I was free from it for years and it came up again when I stopped using the injectable.

I first thought it was because I had started smoking,,so I  quit immediately, but they are still there, they do not seem to stop even after my cycle. What happens is when I tilt my head i feel it. Or when I lift myself up from lying down, or when i lye down. Sometimes when I bend. I do not fall but I will feel like the the ground is spinning really fast then it goes away. Please help. Other prooblems I have are sneezing a lot ,accompanied by itching of ears and throat and sometimes a blocked or runny nose. Another one is my bowel movements are once every two to three days, I do not really eat a lot but, I always have breakfast,which is usually bread ,and supper which is also bread usually.  For lunch I usually eat a balanced meal but in small quantities. Lastly ,I have thrush occuring 4 times in a period of six months, and my doctor had suggested I test for sugar diabetes. Can you please opinion on that one. But I have not had it now for the past three months. Otherwise I feel healthy,strong,I excersized a lot so could lose weight.I stopped recently coz its winter this side of Africa.\n\n",

Sometimes there is a development of crystal like formations that form in the inner ear (whether from an ear infection, injury, etc.) and when they come in contact with certain structures it causes the sensation of dizziness or spinning when rolling over in bed, changing position of the head, etc.,  and is intermittent (comes and goes). I would suggest that you have an evaluation by your physician to identify the causative factor. When one has diabetes (especially uncontrolled) there are effects on the immune system and this reduces the bodies ability to fight off candida etc. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Are you also suggesting to me that the sneezing and itching ears and throat could somehow have something to do with the vertigo? I also experience blocking of the ears and ringing. At some point I used to have sharp electric like very quick pain in my head just above my right ear. it would happen mainly when I've been chewing gum. Can you also please take your time and let me know why I have this constipation, from the infor I gave about my eating habit. Does it have anything to do with it. I am preparing to go see the doctor about the vertigo, I hope it is nothing serious. Thank you once again for your time.\n\n",

It is vital that you or your friend, who suspects possibly having a tumor, to notify the parents and make an appointment with  a physician studied in testing for such medical issues.   Usually, you can contact your local hosptial and get a referral to a neurologist, who would be able to run tests and find out for sure if your problem is a tumor.  There are certain signs to indicate possible tumor activity: visual problems, headaches, dizziness, and nausea.

    "title": "PLease!! I am lost! Brain tumor?",
    "content": "Hello,       I am fourteen years old and this is my first time using this site so excuse me if I make any errors. But the reason I am using this site is because I am worried that there is something wrong with me. Possibly a brain tumor. I have been going back and forth with my pediatrician and I am not getting any answers. I had a CT scan and it was normal, but I was told that not all brain tumors can be seen on CT scans. Is this true? Here is a list of my symtoms..     Vision loss----- Blackness that closes in from the sides and tops of both of my eyes. This occurs mostly when I either stand up or sit up from laying down or when I stand up from sitting down. When this occurs my vision goes black as I said and I get really weak all over my body and have trouble walking and feel really unstable, but not like I am going to faint. Occurs at minimum 10 times a week.         Other problems with my vision------my vision skips. Kind of like when you switch slides on a slide projector. This occurs both when I am asleep and when I am awake. Another problem is, this happened only twice and it occured this very morning, I got a balck webby spot in my eye. Also I have trouble concentrating on certain objects and my vision goes double and I can't see to clearly. This occurs on and off, but is worse now.       Back pain-----Pain in my lower back and in my neck. Didn't happen often but is getting more frequent and more painfull.        Constanst feeling of being tired and weak--- No matter how much sleep I get I am always tired and drained of energy. All day every day.         Headaches-----I get little sharp headaches which can last from 10 seconds to about a half hour, and once that headache goes away it is more than likely I will get another headache right after it. Occur most everday and a minimum of 15 per day.         Change in behaior---- This may be just hormones, but it didn't used to occur. I am a good natured person and I hate the thought of cursing or yelling, but now when someone is talking to me or someone else or doing something I just can't stand it and want to swear at them and scream even to my parents. It is most definetly not me. It's like my whole behaior has changed.          Teenage Development----- I know some people deveope more slowly than others and I don't mind how I am, but I am not developing almost at all in my front. I have gotten I guess you might call it a period, but it wast brown liquid the first time and the second time I only hjad a little blood. These two possible periods occured over the time of a year and I don't have any spotting. Also I have a large amount of hair in my pubic area which seems strange for a person who hasn't got a lot of development going on.         Pain------I get shap very hurtful pains in my body right aroung my heart. This happens during the day anytime, but most often in the morning and when I lift my arms above my head when I am in the shower.                   Well those are all my symtoms, and sorry I wrote so much. I have been sewarching for answers about this for what seems like forever. The first symtom I got was the loss of vision in my eyes, then the others. Now all of my symtoms are getting more constant very quickly more and more worse. What should I do? Any idea what is causing this? Could it be a brain tumor? Please help I am worried and my doctor is not helping me to get answers no offense because she is awsome.  PLease help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,              Involving which kind of doctor i saw I visited a optometrist 1st and then after consulting with her was directed to see my pediatric MD. My optometrist did all sorts of tests, but found nothing wrong. My M.D I think is kind of in the dark about what is happening with me. I tryed to find informatioin on the internet that might be causing me to have the loss of vision and this is what i found something called hypoperfusion which sounds like what I have been experiencing in my eyes------ -------------Hypoperfusion----- This occurs in patients with critical carotid stenosis, cardiac arrhythmias, elevated intraocular pressure, or increased intracranial pressure. Such patients describe progressive dimming or shrinking of the field of vision from the periphery inward, lasting as briefly as a few seconds. Transient visual obscurations may be positional, occuring when the patient sits up after lying flat, or stands up after bending over. -------                It sounds like that is what I have and where it says what it is caused by it lists critical carotid stenosis, cardiac arrhythmias, elevated intraocular pressure, or increased intracranial pressure. So I looked up critical carotid stenosis and it seems that it occurs in older people and the same with cardiac arrhythmias. So I don't think I have those and I looked up  elevated intraocular pressure and I couldn't find a whole lot on that except that it was related to glicoma and with all the tests that my eye doctor did I think that she would have seen that I have increasesd intaocular pressure. Which left increased intracranial pressure which symptoms are.....  \u2022 headache \u2022 ringing in the ears \u2022 nausea and vomiting \u2022 vision problems, such as blurry vision or double vision \u2022 feeling tired and wanting to sleep \u2022 painful eye movements \u2022 neck pain \u2022 hearing loss \u2022 unsteadiness while standing or walking, known as ataxia \u2022 weakness, which may occur in only certain parts of the body or throughout the whole body ... According to the symtoms it would seem that I fit the criteria. I get headaches, my ears ring sometimes but it has happened for awhile and most people get it so I ignore it, I have nausea, vision problems I definetly have, I am always tired and wanting to sleep, sometimes I have painful eye movements, I get neck pain, I have recently been experiencing sudden hearing loss which occured in one of my ears while I was at gymnastics about a week ago, and I feel unstaedy while standing and walking when the eye thing happens and this morning I felt like that without the eye thing happening.  So I looked what might cause increased intracranial pressure and found that it was caused by \u2022  brain tumors \u2022 bleeding inside the skull, such as intracerebral hemorrhage \u2022 infection inside the skull, such as encephalitis \u2022 blood clots, known as hematomas \u2022 certain medications \u2022  head injury or trauma.    You might see where I worry a little, but you are most likely right in saying that i probebly don't have a brain tumor. It is just that it is hard to get your mind off of when things keep pointing to it like the information that I found. My doctor set an appointment up with a neuroilogist for May because I think she ran out of ideas, but May seems like forever in the distance and I just want to figure out what is wrong with me, and it doesn't help that my symptoms, whatever they are being caused by, are getting worse.Thankyou again and if you have any more advice I am more than willing to accept it, and I will try and take you up on your advice of seeing an opthamologist MD.  Hope to back\n\n",

It would not be a bad idea to make another appointment with another eye specialist, opthamologist for sure.  NOT just an optometrist, but someone studied in visual diseases or more involved disorders.  You need a visual field test as well as testing for your retinas and optic nerves.  I suggest calling your local hospital or physician referral service for advice on such an eye specialist.  You may want to ask about a pulmonary speicalist while you are at it and get the name of a neurologist as well.  It does not hurt to be too prepared.  Take care  cjhdd\n\n",

After you've done all the scanning and it is proved that your brain doesn't have any physical problems, then go to an eye doctor. 3. Check whether you've got a malnutrition; 4. If it proved that you don't have any physical problems, then you should regulate or accomodate your mentation. Sincerely, everybody could get some psychology problems including me.  [/i]\n\n",

    "title": "Pituitary Gland Tumor?",
    "content": "Hi. I am 38 years old and am hoping that someone can take the time to answer a few questions for me.  About 4 yrs ago I had a lymph node on the left side of my neck that was swelled horribly and my doctor could not get the swelling to go down. After seeing a specialist we decided to remove the gland, which came back from pathology as being \"benign\". Now here it is 4 yrs later and in the same area I have another lymph node that is doing the exact same thing. After getting a CT w/contrast it was 2.5 cm, my doctor put me on antibiotics and sent me to the same specialist that I saw in 2001. He said that since the last lymph node was benign that the chances were extremely high that this lymph node would be the same and that we should leave it and that my doctor should find the reason that this keeps happening. My doctor kept me on antiobiotics for 1 month and the lymph node started to reduce in size. Now that I have been off the antiobiotics I can feel it starting to swell again. I haven't been back to see my primary since I have noticed the gland swelling again because last week I had my yearly pap smear appt. While I was there I explained to my doctor that my right breast has been having some sort of \"leakage\" on and off for the last several months. He checked my breast and told me that we would have to take some tests, which we did. After the exam we discussed what medications that I take and then explained to me that I may have something wrong with my Pituary Gland. He has taken blood and also a urine sample. Does this sound like a tumor to you and more importantly could both of these problems be related to each other?  Along with the gland that has been swollen, I have also been tired like my body has been trying to fight some sort of infection. That has been one of my biggest complaints.  My test results from my Gyno should be in by the end of next week and I am so worried. If you can help ease my mind by talking about this with me, please do.  Thanks for your time. mcw49\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  I am not an Endocrinologist, so issues about the pituitary and any hormone problems associatd with it are a bit outside of my area of expertise.  It would seem reasonable to me to run some tests to see if any type of hormone imbalance problem exists that could be contributing to the leakage of fluid from your breast.  If the leakage is bloody, then a moe detailed check of the breast is in order.  Regarding the lymph node, the majority of lymph node enlargements are not due to any type of caner.  However, one should neverthless remove it (called an excisional biopsy) if an enlarged lymph node does not resolve with antibiotic therapy and/or grows despite antibiotic therapy.  Sometimes enlarged lymph nodes can contain fluid and thus get larger.  Did your CAT scan show any other areas of enlarged lymph nodes or is the neck lymph node an isolated enlargement?  Again, sometimes removing a lymph node is the only way to ascertain if it is benign (or reactive) or malignant.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Gordon, I appreciate you taking the time to respond to my question here at the lounge. It is nice of all of you doctors to spend your extra time answering all of our questions here.  The first lymph node was removed as I mentioned about 4 yrs ago,  and this second node has responded to one month of several different types of antibiotic treatments (one different antibiotic per week). It did go down in size, which was great but still continues to flare up for no reason. Both nodes were on the left and both were isolated. I always seem to have a low grade fever, like my body is trying to fight something, but tests show that nothing is there. I have explained to my doctor that my symptoms remind me of when I had mono about 15 years ago.  As for the breast leakage...I think the two are totally separate events.  The leakage is not bloody and my tests from my pituitary gland did come back okay, so I am much relieved about that! At least my brain is okay \"I think\". haha   Please let me know what you think about the gland if you have any ideas. I am curious...if they were to take out this gland as well, what if it happened again? Just keep taking them out? Can't we just find the source or is it possible to never know?  Thanks Dr. G, I look forward to hearing from you again.  Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Michelle It is to your advantage to have yourself checked out completely.   I can appreicate having the lymph node removed and following the present node. Anytime our bodies demonstrate such issues, we must take care.  As for the possibility of a pituitary tumor, have you had a prolactin blood test, CT Scan or MRI of your head? Usually the MRI is best to determine if there is a pitutary tumor. The prolactin test is vitial to check if the tumor, if there is one, is secreting type.   It would be to your advantage also, to see and endocrinologist. He or she is more equipped to deal with endocrine issues and would be able to direct you as to the proper measures to take if, indeed you do have a pituitary tumor.   Michelle,  there are several symptoms associated with pitutiary tumors that would stand out. Headaches, visual problems, dizziness, nausea, just to mention a few.   I encourage you to continue in your quest for answers to your current medical situation.  It is never too much to take of yourself and find out NOW, rather than later.   Take care  cjhdd\n\n",

    "title": "Pituitary Gland Tumor",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 21 yr Old male, in reasonably good health. I have been having headaches for the last few weeks now, including nausea. I was admitted to Hospital about 5 days ago for them to run tests and try to get some answers as to why i was expericing my pains.  After having a CT scan and an MRI scan of my head, several blood tests and numours other tests I have been advised that there is a very small 3 milimeter \"nodule\" on my pituitary gland. The doctors have told me that they don't think that this is causing my problems, but have carried out other tests to try and find out what is.   I just wanted to know if anyone could offer any advice on this \"Nodule\" or growth, and is it something I should be over concerned about, as I worry easily and I am frientened that this may grow or become cancerous.  Are this Puturity Gland growths common?   Thanks in advance  Sean\n\n",

    "content": "Hello jinkus I send you my prayers and hope that you will weather your news with courage.  I am an endocrine patient and had Transphenoid surgery for an invasive pituitary adenoma in 1978.  It is generally accepted that pituitary adenomas are not cancerous, but may cause visual issues.  There are those adnomas that do secret prolactin, mine did. I have taken Parlodel since my surgery. Ususally, a blood test is taken to determine the Prolactin level if one has a pitutary adnoma. Normal prolactin ranges between 0-30, at the time of my surgery, my level was over 1000.  Happy to say, now it is   around 1.1  jinkus, based on any headaches, and any visual issues, I would suggest you insist on further testing, and even seeing another doctor. I do hope you are seeing an Endocrinologist for this case? If not, please make an appointment. It would also be to your advantage to see an Endocrine Neurosurgeon, just to get his opinion on your case.   I would rather take these extra measures now, than wait and be faced with other issues down the road.   Take care jinkus and keep in touch  cjhdd\n\n",

    "content": "Hi coreyt1111, I am sorry I am not a radiologist, and MRI interpretation requires expertise. I can tell you however, that to interpret brightness in an MRI scan depends on many things. In magnetic resonance imaging, the emitted radio signal from a particular tissue depends on a combination of that tissue's T1 and T2 values. In constructing an image, to help the radiologist make an accurate diagnosis, the MRI machine can use the tissue T1 to control the brightness of the image pixels (a T1 image) or it can use the tissue T2 to control the brightness of the image pixels (a T2 image). Usually, a radiologist will request both T1 controlled and T2 controlled images. In a T1-controlled image, tissues with low T1 values will be displayed as bright picture elements, or pixels, on the computer monitor and tissues with high T1 values will be displayed with dark pixels. In a T2-controlled image, tissues with high T2 values will be portrayed as bright areas on the image and those with low T2 values as dark areas. Thus, a T1-controlled and a T2-controlled image for the same exact anatomical area can look quite different. In a T1-controlled image, one particular spot may be bright white. In a T2-controlled image, the same identical spot may be displayed as gray. That's because an MRI image is not a photograph. It is actually a computerized map or image of radio signals emitted by the human body.  Hence the interpretation of a brightness would depend on the whether the iimage is a T1 or T2 image and whether it is normal to have brightness in that area or not. Did your MRI report suggest a brain stem tumor?\n\n",

    "title": "Headache and Neck Pain for Weeks",
    "content": "Greetings,  I am a 41 year old mother of 2. I have been having low grade headaches (about a 5 severity) and severe neck pain for about 10 weeks. Starting this week I have numbness in my left foot, left hand and sometimes my lips and tongue after a few hours after getting out of bed - I also have the need to urinate more often. . I am mildly dizzy and slightly sensitive to light. The neck pain wakes me at night. I take Advil and can go back to sleep. The pain is worse in the afternoon/evening. The pain starts in the neck and base of the skull then radiates upwards. My neck cracks and creaks when I move it. And most of the time the pain seems really focused in the neck area.  I was in a \"fender bender\" car accident in early November and didn't start to experience any of this pain until mid February. I have been told that delay in pain is not unusual.  Of course I am freaked about brain tumor or cancerous problems with my neck or the back of my head. I have a second follow up next week my my PCP. I am able to function and take care of my daily responsibilities as a stay-at-home mom, but the psychological impact of chronic pain is taking its toll and I allow my imagination to wander in all sorts of scary directions. My family has had a devastating winter loss of a pregnanacy and the suicide of a parent. I know that my emotional state is compounding this (I am seeing a therapist too), but I am wondering what tests can be performed to rule out the scary stuff and how I can convince my PCP to order these tests.  I guess I need some reassurance and advice. Thanks for your time.   Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I was wondering first off, can cancer of one body part spread to be a brain tumor?  Okay secondly, I have had some symptoms lately.    1.  Chest/Throat/Head pain when breathing deeply in.  If I take a deep breath in, I get a sharp, odd pain in my throat, top of chest, and top of head.  It kind of makes me feel woozy afterwards.  2.  Double Vision.  I have had an eye injury in my right eye that left me with 20/400 vision, so I became less dependant on that eye.  I had double vision, but in the past week, it seems to have moved farther away from where it used to show up.    3.  Blurry Vision.  I have to blink a few times every minute or more to keep my eyes crystal sharp, so I don't know if blurry vision means all the time blurry or just temporary.  4.  Top of head pain.  I have a pressure type feeling on the top of my head, it feels like there is a gas inside wanting to be let out.  It feels similar to throat pain when you feel something is in your throat, and you burp, it comes out.  5.  Temperature changes in feet.  I can feel my feet become warmer, like liquid suddenly becomes warm, then can change to cold.    6.  Static/Grainy vision.  If I look at a blank white wall, I can see tons of VERY VERY little grains moving around or kind of blinking.    7.  When standing up after laying down, I kind of black out my eyes, they turn all sorts of colors and dots appear, then when I am fully balanced, I become fine.  I also lose balance while this is happening.   History:  I have been known to have ear infections more often than the regular person.   I also have had \"chronic\" clogged up sinuses, they come and go, mainly once a month.  I usually take Allegra-D.  I also read that blurry vision and poor circulation of the feet might be a diabetes thing.  I am not sure if I have poor circulation, but I would like to figure out what is wrong.    I sit at the computer a lot of the day, infront of a screen maybe 2 hours at a time maybe 3 times a day?  I am Sixteen years old, and a Male.    I am very worried that this can be a tumor, please help me out.  And if you do not think it is, please point me into the right direction.  I think about all these things ALL day, and feel like my life will be shortened.  I am scared, this is no secret.  I thank you very much,  H.A.\n\n",

If these symptoms have not lasted more than a couple of weeks and are not progressive then you should not worry about it. If you are feeling a lump or nodule in your scalp its probably just a skin infection but get it checked anyway. Brain tumors are usually accompanied by neurological manifestations as opposed to localized tenderness. Headache is usually more severe and maybe accompanied by blurring of vision or vomiting. If the condition progresses, new symptoms arise or does not resolve within a week then you should have someone look at it.\n\n",

I believe she was misdiagnosed with a stoke at another hospital on Jan 9th. As her health seems to faulter we took her to another hospital and was told she had Glioblastoma after a biopsy was done.  I realize the the effect of this cancer and that it is one of the worst you could ever be diagnosed with however, I refuse to give up.   Ive been reading anything and everything I can get my hands on and Id like to see if I could get some feedback on a few things.    Ive looked into several treatments (outside of just radiation and chemo)    Ive come across two things.    Cesium and Tremador.     Cesium seems a little risky from what ive read but a friend of mine brought it to my attention after one of her friends was diagnosed with Liver cancer.    He was given no chance of survival, sent home from the hospital with no radiation, no chemo and directly to hospice.    He began a self treatment of a multivitamin that contained cesium and he's alive today after 2 years.    He went in for a screening and they found no trace of the cancer.   Now I don't know details of how long it was before he went in for this recheck, just that when he did the cancer was gone.   Does anyone have any information on Cesium or tremado?      My mother has 0 chance of actually beating this cancer statistically speaking so If someone told me that standing on my head while balancing a pickle on my nose would work I WOULD TRY IT.   She went from a  healthy 65 year old person whom worked every day as a retail manager to a hospital bed and no chance of survival.  She was sent home from the hospital a few days ago with a steroid and dilantin.  She's been scheduled for radiation on Tuesday and currently her mood has changed from very happy to VERY angry and suspicious of us all.   Any information that anyone could give will be appreciated.   Cheryl\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  I am sorry to hear about your Mother's situation.  As you have probably learned, glioblastoma multiforme can be a most aggressive and dificult to treat brain tumor.  Usually radiation therapy is offered, but it is not designed to eradicate all of the disease.  Various chemotherapy drugs have been used, most with limited benefit.  There is an oral chemotherapy agent that is often used, called temozolomide.  It does have some side effects, such as nausea, vomiing, fatigue and low blood cell counts.  However, it does have good penetration into the brain tissues and does have activity against various brain tumors.  There are various clinical trials around the U.S. (are you in the U.S.?).  The large medical centers may have trials.  Unfortunately, glioblastoma can be a tough cancer to treat.  Treatment is also based upon a patient's medical status, with people of frail or poor medical status not often able to tolerate the potential side effects of chemotherapy  I have not heard about any type of nutritional supplement being of help.  When you mention Cesium, are you referring to it as a form of radiation therapy or as a supplement pill?  You may want to consider getting an opinion from a cancer doctor who specializes in brain tumors.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   Thank you for your response.     When I mentioned Cesium I was referring to either of the forms.  I had read that it was a form of radiation but also that you could take it in supplemental form as well.  Is it possible to use cesium in a supplemental form while getting other treatment(not neccessarily while having the radiation form cesium but perhaps with another)?  Is one more powerful than the other and does anyone know if its had any effect on glioblastoma?     If I understand this cancer correctly its compiled of several different kinds of cancer cells which is what makes it so difficult to treat with one kind of chemo.  Does the difficulty in treating it mean that its not possible to treat each type of cell involved seperately with different types of radiation/chemo?  They had her on a steroid to keep swelling down , they took her off of it on Saturday (her last weened dose) and today (tuesday) she had 2 seizures,one after another,  was taken back to her doctor and put BACK on Decadron.    She hasnt had any kind of radiation therapy yet or Chemo.  I guess im trying to gather all the information and ideas that I can before they do anything to her.   They've basically said they will do radiation and chemo but they arent giving her much hope because its glioblastoma.  This is a problem for two reasons 1.  Chemo will put her through hell if its all for nothing (death soon anyway) and 2.  Because she's my mom  and I would hate to see her go through this all just for an extended amount of time with her (seems selfish) , will it really be quality time if she's sick from chemo and radiation anyway?  I don't mean to sound negative or ungrateful, just trying to be realistic while I hold off the thoughts of what this whole thing means for my mother and my family.  Ive got a father that is just losing his mind over all of this and between trying to calm him and doing as much research on the internet as possible im finding myself lost in gobs of huge words and clinical studies.    So far Ive found several clinical studies.  There is one treatment center in Houston that is doing a clinical study using antineoplaston.  From what Ive read of it it looks promising, but Im not the type to just jump into the first thing I see.   Although,  Im on sort of a time limit with this task  and Im trying to keep my mind on Quality of treatment over rushing into the first thing I see.    Im in Michigan and Houston is one heck of a hike without more information.       I know better than to take any recommendations and run with them as though they are absolute fact, I know that anything here is only informational.  Im just desperate to reach as many people as I can to get as much information as possible for my mom.    Thanks again for your time.  Im sorry for the rambling on..  Cheryl\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Star_Light294,  i am not an oncologist but i think it depends on the type of the brain tumour itself. But i think as a brain tumour grows even if benign it has a local effect by compressing the tissues surrounding them or because of the size of the tumour increased the pressure inside the skull and i think these are indications to remove the tumour.  Sometimes the tumours are attached or too close to vitals areas of the brain and it is difficult to operate on them because of their proximity to those areas for fear of destruction of these areas.  He has to have follow up ct scans of the brain and make sure that the brain tumour is not growing at a fast rate and i think that a biopsy is a good choice.

    "title": "Re: Headaches",
    "content": "Dear momgonzo4,  Headaches have many reasons.   If you think that the headaches are caused by a brain tumour, there is one important symptom missing in the triad of increased intracranial pressure. This symptom is projectile vomiting without being preceded by nausea. The other 2 symptoms that you mentioned were headaches and blurred vision.  The blurred vision and headaches can be caused by problems with vision. If you are becoming short sighted and you are not wearing prescription glasses, you can have blurred vision and headaches secondary to that as the lens of the eye tries to compensate and then becomes stressed and the stress causes the headache.  If you work on a computer all day long and you are sitting in an uncorrect posture, this will cause stress on the muscles of the back of your neck and shoulders and this will give rise to a headache.  Headaches can be caused by increased blood pressure, so, you have to have your blood pressure measured.  If you are concerned that your headaches are caused by a brain tumour, you should have a physical examination by your doctor and then he can decide whether or not a ct scan of the head is warranted.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It could be that you are dehydrated especially if you are taking a medicine such as a diuretic, or drinking too much cafienated drinks (coffee, coke.. etc). Alcohol also has diuretic properties.  Other causes include infection in the mucosa of the mouth or a post-nasal drip due to chronic sinusitis. If you have an increased production of tears this could be a very rare cause. An even rarer cause is due to brain lesions such as a new epileptic lesion, brain tumor or a migraine.  If you are not dehydrated and do not have sinusitis then you should seek an appointment with your physician.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, I am glad you saw a neurologist. In your last post I gave you a list of possibilities for the salty taste in your mouth which included the possibility of a brain tumor. Your neurologist has had a better chance to evaluate you since he has assessed you in person. He would be able to weigh out all the options and consider the likelyhood of one of them more than the other. However, and from a purely speculative point of view, I think your neurologist is mainly ruling out the most dangerous cause (brain tumor) before he considers other less dangerous (and more common) causes of your symptoms.  I would advise you not to worry about the scan its just part of the medical diagnostic process.  If it were a brain tumor which type would it be? I suspect what you mean is would it be benign or malignant? That would be hard to tell even for your neurologist at any point. If it were a brain tumor then your age could hint at a possible malignant lesion. However, certain details would make us suspect a benign tumor: the long duration of your symptoms (months) is more common with benign lesions. Indeed the symptoms themselves, are more common with a steadily growing tumor than a malignant one. However you should know that with brain tumors in particular the spectrum between benign and malignant types is a rather continuous one (there are so many types that behave at varying degrees of aggressiveness ranging from purely benign to low malignant potential to agressive).  Only a biopsy would determine the true nature of a brain tumor and its behaviour. Again, I remind you to not worry!  Please post the results of your scan to this topic.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi psmadden,  Calcification of in the brain could be a million things. From tumors, to vascular anomalies to even metabolic diseases. The distribution of calcification is very important at determining its source. If its located in one area it may suggest a tumor. If its located in the course of known vessels that may suggest a vascular malformation. If its widely distributed it may be a metabolic disease.  Physiological calcification is seen in the pineal gland and choroid plexus from the age of approximately 8 to 10 years.  Pathological calcification may be seen in the meninges (lining of the brain), brain parenchyma (brain substance), including the basal ganglia (an area in the center of the brain), and in the cerebral vasculature. Calcification may also be seen in intracranial tumours such as craniopharyngioma and in areas of necrosis following infection, haemorrhage, or infarction. Gyriform calcification is seen in neuroectodermal dysplasias such as Sturge Weber syndrome. Dural calcification is seen in chronic subdural haematoma and in Gorlin's syndrome. Extensive early calcification may be seen in the choroid plexus in patients with neurofibromatosis.   CT is the most sensitive means of detection of intracranial calcification. MRI is less sensitive to the detection of intracranial calcification than CT.  Can you tell us what the report says about the distribution?  It may still be that the calcification is urelated to your symptoms and just something discovered along the way.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  If possible, i'd like some info and opinions. 4 1/2 years ago, i noticed a semi-sharp hard lump on the back of my head, in the center, that i assumed was a deformity of my skull. 2 1/2 years later, i began noticing a little tension, some slight throbbing and strange feeling in the back of my head, seemingly in the same area as the lump, especially after masterbation or when i would lean my head back. From about 8 months ago until now, i began noticing the feelings getting stronger, more frequent, sometimes slight pain, especially when i lay down or exercise, and feels like its affecting also the right and left portions of the back of my head. It feels like tension in the back of my brain.. no throbbing, just tension. I notice the feelings several times a day, at least 4 or 5 times a day, and sometimes noticable for hours at a time. Twice though, i felt severe tension and moderate pain, felt like i was going to pass out or the back of my head was going to explode. I also notice slight visual disturbance (blurred vision, trouble focusing, \"floaters\" and static things.. almost every time i look up into the sky on a sunny day, it looks like thousands of specks floating around in all directions that resemble fireworks exploding), also some speech impairment, confusion, difficulty in understanding what people are saying, slow brain thoughts, dyslexic type symptoms.. whenever i try to talk, i get my words mixed up, and often find myself repeating myself in mid sentence, and saying things i didnt mean to say or getting myself mixed up and end up making no sense.  Anyhow,i'm a 20 year old male,  those are my symptoms, and i'd greatly appreciate any info. Oh yeah, and the reason why i havnt seen a professional: I hardly ever leave my house, and when i do, my parents know exactly where im going, and i am wanting to wait until i get a car and go visit a professional without having to risk my privacy. I'd like to tackle this head on with my familys support, but i would like to have an experts opinion on my situation so i know what to expect so i can approach this subject with my parents appropiatly. Sorry for the long message, Thanks for taking the time to look at it.\n\n",

First, let me start by stating that any infomation provided here does not and should not replace your seeing a doctor to evaluate and examine you for the problems you report.  Such problems are statistically more likely to not be related to a brain tumor than they are to be related to such.  Nevertheless, the problems you describe have been present for a while and are causing you problems.  Thus, they should be checked out by your family doctor.  Sometimes, a referral is made to a Neurologist for further evaluation.  Your problems make me think of migraine type processes.  I cannot state that they represent a brain tumor.   I would recommend that you do see your family doctor for further evaluation.  It would not be an unreasonable idea to have a brain scan, such as a CAT scan or an MRI, as part of the evaluation.  One could also consider trying migraine treatments the next time that you get the problems to see if such treatments work.\n\n",

This happens about 2 to 5 times a day but other than the sound, nothing else happens, ie. I don't feel a sudden faint, my vison doesnt blur, its just the sound, I'm guessing its brain fluid.  Other symptoms that I think are associated with it or constant phelem and mucus.  I always wake up with a lot of that although I don't have the flu.  Also my skin and muscles feel weak.  If I were to press or punch my arm, leg, or stomach area, I would have intense pain for a good 10 seconds but this never happened to before.  Its pain that a regular person would not feel.  I'm guessing its some sort of brain cancer, I used to smoke pot for about 4 years and quit hoping the brain sounds would go away.  I don't know what else could have caused it, can you please let me know what kind of brain disorder the sounds are associated it?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Li-Fraumeni syndroime",
    "content": "My apologies for the delay in answering your question.  The Li-Fraumeni syndrome is one of many discovered hereditary cancer syndromes.  It does not define just one type of cancer, but a cluster of various cancers seen together or in a family.  Just because one family member has the Li-Fraumeni syndrome does not imply that all family members will have it or develop a cancer.  It does increase the likelihood that family members will have the syndrome, however.  Furthermore, many cancers are common, especially in an aging population.  So-called \"family\" histories of cancers are not true hereditary syndromes, but rather the presence of common cancers in different family members at risk for such common cancers.  Physicians should maintain a clinical concern for hereditary cancer syndromes in the appropriate context.  There are genetic tests that can be done to evaluate the Li-Fraumeni syndrome.  Such tests should be done only at reputable cancer genetic centers, where counseling about the test can be undertaken and reliable results obtained.  No cancer genetic testing is 100% foolproof.  In addition, there are probably countless other hereditary cancer syndromes and gene changes present that we as physicians do not know because they have yet to be discovered or identified.  Hereditary syndromes or diseases can \"skip\" a generation, depending upon the complexities of their transmission from one generation to the next.  Some people have the \"full blown\" hereditary syndrome whereas others just have a \"trait\" and are not affected by the associated cancers or diseases.  In addition, there is a term called \"penetrance\" which, simply stated, defines the characteristics of a hereditary gene process with regard to its becoming clinically apparent or \"silent\".  A gene that has a high penetrance almost always results in a clinicallly apparent outcome, whereas a gene with a low penetrance is usually not associated with a clinically apparent outcome.  In order to better understand the complexities of cancer genetics, it is always best to under go hereditary cancer genetic testing under the care of a trained cancer geneticist who can individualize such testing on a person to person or a family to family basis.\n\n",
