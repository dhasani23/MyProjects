    "content": "My husband had a quadruple bypass 8 weeks ago and has healed very nicely, yesterday he went to his pre-op appt to get things done for his gall bladder removal this morning and his EKG came back abnormal with T-wave abnormality; anterior ischemia.   He hasn't had any tightness in his chest since they did the bypasses, has genetically high cholesterol and very small veins and arteries. one of the grafts that they did from the harvested vein in his leg was showing signs of disease already. THis is the first ekg since his release from the hospital and I was shocked to see this considering he's been exercising daily, low fat, low cholesterol, low sodium diet, been on his plavix, lisinopril, baby asprin, metoprolol, co-q-10, Vita E8, vita D3 and the Vytorin until last friday when they removed two of those and he wasn't able to take his meds this morning but took his metoprolol and vytorin as directed last night. I am concerned as he is only 37 years old and active duty military with one year left in the service.  What does  this mean and will these results from yesterday's EKG be forwarded to his Cardio-thoracic surgeon and Cardiologist...... should I be concerned at all and what should we do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, clbouchie,  What a trying time for you and your husband.  It would be usual practice to forward the results of your husband's recent electrocardiogram to his cardiologist; however, it would be a good idea to double check to see that it was done.    An electrocardiogram traces the electrical activity (depolarization) of the heart beat, and the most basic description is designated as the P, QRS and T waves.  Very briefly, the P wave is a normal beat in which the electrical depolarization spreads from the right atrium to the left atrium, resulting in the beat of the upper chambers of the heart.  The QRS portion is the rapid depolarization of the right and left ventricles, resulting in the beat of the lower chambers of the heart; since the ventricles are larger than the atria, that portion appears larger on the electrocardiogram.  The T wave represents the repolarization (or recovery) of the ventricles.  Ischemia occurs when blood flow is decreased through one or more of the arteries in the  heart muscle; in this case, to the anterior portion of the heart.  The main risk factors that can lead to ischemia are elevated cholesterol levels, elevated blood pressure, and diabetes.  Ischemia can be the result of coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis), in which plaques formed of cholesterol and possibly other cellular waste products build up on an artery wall and restrict the blood flow.  This is the most common cause of myocardial (heart muscle) ischemia.  Some other conditions include blood clots, causing a sudden ischemic event which may lead to heart attack; coronary artery spasm, which is brief and temporary; and severe illnesses, such as those leading to blood loss.    Medications used in the treatment of ischemia include aspirin, which reduces the tendency of blood to clot, and nitroglycerin, which temporarily relaxes/opens arteries; and beta blockers, which relax the heart muscle, slow the heart beat and decrease blood flow, with the result that blood flows more easily.  Cholesterol medications include statins, which interfere wwith the synthesis of cholesterol in the body; niacin, which boosts \"good\" cholesterol; fibrates, which are usually used as an adjunct to other cholesterol medications; and bile acid sequestrants, which help block fats.  Calcium channel blockers, which relax and widen blood vessels by acting on the muscle cells in the arterial walls, which slows the pulse and reduces the heart's workload.  ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors, which inhibit arterial constriction and helps relax the blood vessels and lower blood pressure, and Ranlozine, which helps relax the coronary arteries and is used when other medications aren't effective.  The cholersterol lowering medications target lowering LDL (low density lipoprotein) or \"bad\" cholesterol and boosting HDL (high density lipoprotein) or \"good\" cholesterol.  Of the medications that you listed, Plavix is used to prevent blood clots, lisinopril is an ACE inhibitor, metoprolol is a beta-blocker, and Vytorin is a statin.  Bypass surgery is an option, as your husband has had.  \"Stenting\" may be used, which consists of inserting a specially prepared thin tube into a narrowed artery, where a balloon is inflated that widens the artery, and then a small mess coil (stent) is inserted to keep the artery open.  Familial hypercholesterolemia is a genetic disorder, with high cholesterol levels, particularly LDLs, which results in early cardiovascular disease, often by the age of 30 or 40.  Treatment is with statins, bile acid sequestrants or other cholesterol lowering drugs.  There is some early indication that a weight-reduction drug called Relacore reduces LDLs and boosts HDLs, but that is preliminary.  In severe instances, LDL apheresis may be used, which is removing LDLs in a treatment similar to renal dyalisis.  In severely resistant instances, liver transplant may be considered, though this is uncommon.  Recommended lifestyle changes are to stop smoking if one is a smoker, exercise, a healthy diet, and having regular monitoring by a physician, which your husband is already doing.  With the combination of contributing factors that your husband is facing, there is real concern about managing the long term effects of his condition.  A conference with his cardiologist is the best place to start, asking what would be the best long term plan to optimize his overall health.    I wish you the best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi clbouchie,  I was asked to review your post and see if I could add anything. Faye certainly covered the matter thoroughly and it might be helpful to print that out and keep as a general reference. However, I still have a question or two that might help clear this up. First, when the EKG came back abnormal (\"anterior ischemia\"), was this the machine's computer analysis or had the EKG actually been read and signed off on by a cardiologist? The EKG computer repertoire is not only somewhat limited, but, like all computers, has no sense of context at all. For instance, many people who've had recent heart surgery will show abnormalities that have been present since early stages of the original disease. Also, due to that limited computer \"brain\" there are some abnormal findings that are rather common, and this is one of them. The only way it can be clarified is to have it read by a live doctor (who won't even give that computer analysis a second glance). Also, T-wave abnormalities are common and often innocent or non-specific. Again, in someone with a recent heart surgery, they are more likely to show up. This may now be a \"normal\" for your husband. Even if a cardiologist from the center where the pre-op workup was done read and signed off on this, your husband's cardiologist is the one who should have the final say in giving or witholding cardiac clearance for what should be a fairly simple (probably laparoscopic) surgery. While this may, in fact, signal some new problem (your husband's relative youth suggests he will likely have some additional future problems, since this is almost certainly a genetically-caused disease pattern), 8 weeks post-op is really awfully soon to see such a significant change, so odds are that's not what it is.   Given the meds, regimen and recent surgery, your husband shouldn't register ischemia on an EKG even if the process actually has begun again. To find such a clear sign, while not impossible, would be a very rare thing indeed. Far more common is the simple, out-of-context computer analysis. I hope your husband's cardiologist will look at this and find it to be withing normal limits (WNL) and give him the green light for the gallbladder surgery. Please let us know how this all turns out. I'm betting on it being a very common computer error.   Good luck to you both!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi clbouchie, I am really fascinated by the very thorough, informative and thought provoking replies to your post. As it has been pointed out very clearly, only your husband\u2019s cardiologist will be best placed to infer from his latest EKG and decide whether the T wave abnormality does represent an ischemic change or otherwise.  Although slightly out of context (as the following excerpts pertain only to EKG changes in the first 3 days following routine CABGs), i felt that I should share with you, and the readers at large, this very relevant information.    These excerpts are from a very interesting study published in 2006. \"Electrocardiographic Changes after Coronary Artery Surgery\". Kerim Cagli, MD, Cemal Ozbakir, MD1, Kumral Ergun, MD1, Vedat Bakuy, MD, Renda Circi, MD, Pinar Circi, MD Asian Cardiovasc Thorac Ann 2006;14:294-299  The authors had tried to establish the \u201cnormal\u201d EKG changes that may inevitably occur following routine, successfully performed CABGs.  The background scenario is as follows.  Take a typical prospective candidate for a CABG. He/she will have an underlying coronary artery disease, and the EKG findings that go with it. Certain non-physiological procedures performed during the surgical procedure, including cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB), cross-clamping, hypothermia, hemodilution, cardioplegia, as well as postoperative complications (hemorrhage, graft occlusion, arrhythmias) have detrimental(NEGATIVE) effects on the electrical and mechanical activity of the heart. However, restoration of blood flow to the myocardium has a POSITIVE beneficial effect. Interpretation of a postoperative EKG  and trying to differentiate normal from abnormal findings is not obviously easy.  In addition, several postoperative factors including degree of ischemia, tissue oxygenation, blood pressure alterations, electrolyte disturbances, use of antiarrhythmic and postanesthetic drugs, pain control, and duration of surgery make the analysis of postoperative EKG changes all the more difficult.  Despite improved techniques in intraoperative myocardial protection as well as surgical techniques, some degree of myocardial ischemia inevitably occurs during CABG, but only a minority of patients develop an actual myocardial infarction (MI). The diagnosis of MI after cardiac surgery is more difficult than at other times because of the nonspecific ST-T wave abnormalities and occurrence of  nearly universal elevation of cardiac enzymes.  Open heart surgery affects the amplitudes of R, S, and T waves in the EKGs in many different ways. Decreases in QRS voltage because of large effusions and formation of a QS complex (pseudoinfarction pattern) are just a few well-known examples.  The authors surmise that while operative procedures may be predominantly responsible for the changes (NEGATIVE) occurring on the 1st postoperative day, changes observed on day 3 might be the due to the POSITIVE effects from relief of ischemia.  Thus, this study highlights the difficulties in interpreting post-CABG EKGs.  Although it has nothing to do directly with your husband\u2019s condition or management, I hope this information is useful in some way. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: CARDIAC ARREST",
    "content": "Hello -- You certainly were fortunate to have been revived. Your left ventricle seems to have sustained significant damage from the heart attack, and when this happens the ejection fraction can drop dramatically. Once it gets as low as yours was, the risk of cardiac arrest becomes quite great, and yet is largely unpredictable. The ICD is a very good protection against any future episodes, but your LVEF having dropped to 21 per cent does place you at risk of other problems as well, although you seem to be tolerating this low output pretty well.   All the medications you're on do seem to be appropriate, but the combination of some of them may actually have contributed to the additional drop in already low LVEF. It may be desireable to have the medications reviewed to see if anything could be eliminated that might be weakening the heart muscle.  There are a number of treatments under study currently and some are being used in some areas. These range from stem cell implantation (this would probably do no harm and might well help, but is still a very new field of therapy), and there are sometimes surgical approaches to \"tighten\" the left ventricle so as to increase the cardiac output. Much depends on the condition of the free wall of the left ventricle.   Almost anyone with such a low LVEF is a likely candidate for an eventual cardiac arrest, and the ICD is a pretty reliable protection although not 100 per cent guaranteed. It is usually successful in preventing arrest. The medications should also help keep things under control somewhat. With rapid development of alternative therapies (such as surgical resection of the ventrical, bi-ventricular pacmakers, etc.) you may well live out a pretty normal lifespan. Much of this depends on how well you tolerate the low output, and again, I must say you seem to tolerate it very well so far.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please keep us updated as to your situation.\n\n",

    "title": "Dizziness, jaw pain, fatigue, chest and arm heaviness....",
    "content": "I'm not sure if this is the best place to post this because I'm not sure the nature of my illness, but I figure this forum is probably as good as any.  Especially since I'm trying to rule out the worst.    I'll start from the beginning.  In North Carolina.  About 4 weeks ago after eating some Texas Pete covered raw oysters along with a Fat Tire beer, I wound up with a tight, uncomfortable and unfamiliar knot deep inside my chest centered over my heart region shortly after this dinner.  After it did not subside, at about 2:00AM early that morning I decided to visit the ER thinking it was probably not a big deal but I'd much rather be safe than sorry.  That was the advice I was given anyways.  I do not visit medics or hospitals very often, and in fact did not even have my health insurance sorted out at the time (never needed it), nor did I have a regular doctor.  I guess I figured I'm entitled to a visit at least every once and a blue moon.  The ER ended up running an EKG, doing some blood work and taking some chest X-rays.  All of those came back negative.  What then was wrong?  The doctors said that they didn't have a clue but it wasn't my heart, and promptly scooted me out of the hospital with the advice to return if symptoms evolve.  So after being discharged at about 5:00AM that morning and going to class for that day, I noticed that my left arm had become slightly heavy and easily fatigued.  It was a bit of a labor to turn the steering wheel using my left arm/hand.  On that note, I returned to the emergency room with my new symptoms.  They again ran the same set of tests with the same negative results.  I began to figure that it might have something to do with carrying my heavy backpack on my left shoulder for the first time ever in life (my right shoulder strap broke), but they disagreed.  By this time I'd began to show other symptoms, primarily of fatigue and a shortness of breath.  I also seemed to be doing a lot of heavy sweating in class, making it hard to take notes and concentrate.  I figured I would go back to my apartment and sleep it all off.  After eating and hopping in the bed, however, I was immediately jolted up by a sensation of muscle cramping and the inability to catch my breath.  By this time, I was really afraid I might actually be having some sort of a heart condition.  I immediately checked my chest for a heartbeat, but I couldn't feel anything.  Probably because of my slow heartbeat (45 BPM).  Thinking of perhaps the worst, I rose to my feet promptly to check again, but it seemed the cramping in my legs and muscles would not let me move very quickly.  It was as if my legs and arms were going to sleep in response to me trying to use them.  After the cramping symptoms subsided, I was able to make it back to the ER.  This time I was certain they would find something.  Again, however, they found nothing and gave me some medicine for acid reflux and educated me about panic attacks.  Acid reflux can feel like heart pain I was told, but when I asked about my left arm symptoms the doctor told me he didn't know how to explain that.  Afterward, I was then discharged upon taking a Prevacid and told to return if my symptoms change.  Shortly after this time my symptoms were nearing their height of intensity.  I had developed a fluttering heartbeat, jaw pain, dizziness that made it impossible to focus, heavy fatigue throughout the body, the inability to catch my breath even at rest, and headache.  I could do little more than slump in a chair.  It felt as if I were dying, and I felt the hospital was probably making a mistake.  The headache I could explain through my loss of appetite, but the other symptoms were all very foreign to me.  I was afraid to leave the hospital lobby, and was in no shape to drive home anyways.  I spent the night in the lobby.  After deciding that hospital was not going to help me and gathering up enough strength, I returned back home to Atlanta to be watched by my family and treated under their watch.  Symptoms continued to worsen.  The left side of my face had now went numb.  I went to my father's doctor and after hearing my symptoms, he did the same thing the hospital did; look at the total absence of any risk factors, conclude it probably isn't my heart and then send me out the door without a clue or a direction to point in.  Then I went to see my mother's doctor and he told me it was probably the flu because of flu season, acid reflux since my mom has acid reflux, and anxiety since its not my heart.  He then gave me medicine for all three.  In the mean time I scheduled an appointment with a cardiologist and was offered a nuclear stress test by my local hospital on one of my subsequent visits.  I took the stress test, but would be unaware of the results until much later.  After seeing my scheduled cardiologist, who was affiliated with a different hospital, he reviewed my stress test results and said it came back technically abnormal.  His remarks were that the stress test itself was invalid, and to prove it to me he promptly ran an ultrasound on my heart showing me that the regions the stress test results claimed were scar tissue were in fact still functioning just fine.  I then scheduled a cardiac MRI in order to evaluate my heart function at the next level.  The acid reflux regime I was on, centered around two 40mg doses of Protonix per day, seemed to be helping.  Constant abdominal bloating had become an issue over the course of my troubles, so PPI's kept things reasonable.  The flu medication did not seem to be helping, and I choose not to immediately take the Lexipro.  By this time by left arm weakness had graduated into a terrible pain in my bicep that was so intense it kept me from sleeping at night.  Sometimes I would have to let out a yell when I moved my left arm too quickly.  After noticing a rash on my arm where the doctors had drawn blood from repeatedly, I choose to take some Benadryl to at least relieve some of the itching. By the middle of that night, I noticed that my pain had disappeared from the chest and arm area.  This had revealed clearly the underlying heaviness in the left chest and left arm region.  After having increased trouble breathing one weekend in addition to all of my other symptoms, I went to the emergency room again.  They gave me a CT scan of my brain in addition the normal battery of tests they do to evaluate heart function.  All were negative.  They again sent me home with information about Panic attacks.  After being sent home and seemingly doing a little better, I decided to take the Lexipro and head to bed.  I waited before taking the Lexipro because I did not know how my body would react to that type of drug and I wanted to have a decent amount of strength built up in case I did have a bad reaction.  I didn't think it wise to be experimenting with drugs while in such a weakened state.  After taking the Lexipro it seemed I would have a decent night sleep.  I woke up in the middle of the night even more dizzy than I'd felt before.  I decided that it was nothing and laid back down.  Later on I rose up again to turn over and I was still just as dizzy.  I then sat up on the bed, noticing that it took a great amount of energy and breath.  I then tried to make it thirty feet to the bathroom and by the time I did I was out of breath as if I'd just run a marathon.  By the time I made it to the hospital I had to be wheeled in, I was totally stiff in the neck, shivering uncontrollably and I could not speak.  I was then admitted to the hospital.  The Lexipro, I believe, induced a bad reaction.  After staying there for about 4 days, I was discharged in order to make my appointment for the cardiac MRI.  The MRI came back negative, but while I was in the hospital I noticed that my chest pain responded to nitroglycerin tablets.  I dismissed that, however, as simply the smooth muscle in the esophagus relaxing because thats better than thinking about the alternative explanation.  I also visited a chiropractor who investigated my spine and took some X-rays.  He said everything looked normal, but that I should check for either lyme disease or mercury poisoning.  The neurologist I visited thought everything was just stress, but indicated that he could not explain my armpit pain (presumaly swollen lymph nodes) or my stomach troubles.  He did not do any real testing beyond banging my knee, feeling around with his hands and visually inspecting areas.  In the meantime my symptoms had continued to evolve and somewhat improve.  Shortly after my cardiac MRI, the heaviness in my chest had traveled to my upper right chest and right arm as well, fatiguing them also.  I had weird pulsing, slightly painful sensations on my inner thighs.  My dizziness was still present (albeit somewhat reduced), and my overall quickness both physically and mentally still seemed slow.  Physically, my arms only move so quickly and my hands cannot open and close very rapidly.  My hands are very slow, quick to get tired upon use and this slow hand speed state seems to be least pronounced when my elbows are resting on something (early in the morning after I wake up my hand speed seems to be 100% or near).  Sometimes I get cramping and numbness traveling down specific fingers (never my index).  My jaw is always in a slight amount of pain and seemingly restricted to movement.  My armpits began to hurt very badly spontaneously out of the blue, to the point where it hurt to rest my arms by my sides.  At times, would feel as if I'm drowning in fluid and my head was in a pressure grip, especially when I lay down and especially if I forget to take my reflux medicine.  Overall, though, I was improving.  One day after seemingly feeling half way decent, I decided to go for a brisk walk.  When I tried, my symptoms returned.  The very first thing that happened is my jaw began to hurt and become stiff.  Then the dizziness returned.  Then the shortness of breath.  Very faint left upper chest pain.  In no time flat I had to take a seat, and then I had to go home.  After laying down my symptoms slowly subsided, and by the next morning I was ready for my GI doctor to give me an abdominal CT scan and an endoscopy.  The abdominal scan came back totally negative, and apparently so did the endoscopy (with the exception of apparently having little higher acid) as best I could glean from conversation.  He will let me know the full report next week.  While I left some stuff out for brevity and probably some symptoms because I've forgotten, but this is all basically where I'm at today.  One of my concerns moving forward is that my cardiology workup was incomplete.  A volumetric CT scan, which is offered here in Atlanta, would be able to visualize any partial blockages in my arteries much better than a thallium stress test would.  My understanding is that a volumetric CT is above 90% certain while a stress test doesn't even approach that level.  Its also my understanding that cardiac MRI's only evaluate heart function and is less effective at resolving flow through tiny arteries.  I say that is a concern because of the people you read about who ace their stress tests and their ultrasounds and their EKG's and still wind up having a heart attack because they had undiagnosed angina.  I don't want to join their ranks.  Another concern is some sort of vascular blockage.  During the height of my left arm dysfunction it had a weaker pulse around the wrists than my right arm.  But when I took the blood pressure around the biceps of both arms, it was similar.  In any case, I was worried that I might actually have some sort of a weird circulatory inhibition elsewhere besides my heart that might be causing these symptoms.   If those are not the key lyme disease or some sort of degenerative muscular or nerve disease is my worry.  The diagnosis of stress concerns me because of the way it is diagnosed, and because of the high price of being wrong.  \"Stress\" is usually the catch all diagnosis that is thrown out there when the symptoms seem not to fit a pattern for a single disease or when the doctor simply doesn't know what the heck is going on.   So here I am.  Still suffering.  Out of school.  Life on pause.  Looking desperately for help and not seeing any light at the end of the tunnel.  Anything would be appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- This is the sort of story that drives clinicians crazy -- as you've probably noticed. The problem is you don't sound like an especially anxious person, although your voluminous (and very useful) notes here suggest you may have done just enough research to warrant some anxiety over the symtpoms, which consequently blurs the line between anxiety symptoms and somatic ones. So. Here we go:  Your initial complaint certainly sounded most like GERD, especially because of what you'd eaten. You were wise to have it checked, and given the circumstances, findings and recent food intake, plus your relative youth, it seemed reasonable to send you on home. However, after that the symptoms start to sound more classically cardiac in nature. This could be because they were or because you'd acquired just enough knowlege to cause you some worry, since learning the basics about given organ system diseases isn't but half the program, the other half being the knowlege of how to place them into the proper context given age, risk factors, history, etc. This is why medical school takes so long to complete. On the other hand, a well-informed patient is more likely to survive a life-threatening problem than one who simple accepts any response given. It's a fine line we tread with these things.  To keep this somewhat shorter than your post, you've had symptoms that could be attributable to heart disease, although your age and otherwise good health do argue against this. You've also had some neurological symptoms, and not the sort that would be attributable to anxiety. GERD seems a likely comorbidity for you regardless of whatever else is going on, which only clouds the issue, as you yourself have pointed out, since esophageal spasm will, indeed, respond to nitro, something the average patient wouldn't know. In this respect you either have learned too much for your own good or should go into (I'm quite serious now) the allied health field or nursing. You are on the brink of being pretty well educated about some of the more arcane aspects of diagnostic medicine. This is not normal, and I don't mean that in a bad way. It can pose problems, however, and those could be resolved in the academic setting. You could learn the rest of this stuff and become an excellent technician, nurse or even PA or doctor. You have an interest.  Meanwhile, just what is going on here? At a distance it is difficult to say, but it would seem there are comorbidities competing for attention and confusing the issue. You probably do have GERD. You may at this point also have some anxiety that wasn't previously present -- or you may have just enough OCD to have revealed some latent anxiety, OCD being an anxiety-based disorder and much more common than generally assumed. You also could be correct in your suspicion about occult heart disease. Your youth and health (and presumptive negative family history) all argue against this, but you're also aware of small vessel disease, which, again, the \"normal\" patient would never be aware.   I believe you should have a one-time comprehensive cardiac workup including nuclear stress test. While not the gold standard (that would be an angiogram) it is highly sensitive, as opposed to stress test without scan (far less sensitive and specific) and is certainly more sensitive for CAD than echocardiogram, which will only reveal structural abnormalities, old scarring and abnormal chamber sizes. You don't have any of those, clearly. If you have small vessel disease it is a diagnosis of attrition, since it rarely can be detected by even angiography with any reliable certainty. By the same token it also rarely is life-threatening, but can show up as sluggish LV movement on echo, which you didn't have. Thallium scan can't show up scarring but only possible (suspect) ischemia. If you had a positive nuc scan and the echo was normal you're still a candidate for angiography, given your symptoms. You're also a candidate for a neuro consult, however, as some of the symptoms are distincly neurological.   If I were you I'd want to draw a line of determination of cause, rule out the worst, then relax once that's been accomplished (if in fact the worst is ruled out) as the rest of the possibilities aren't life-threatening, but would only be annoying. If I were your cardiologist I'd want to avoid the angiogram, since if there is any CAD it is likely small vessel disease unlikely to show up at any rate, but -- because of the positive nuc scan and symptoms some of which are fairly classic, I would spring for the angiogram anyway. This means there is enough doubt either way that you'll need to find a doctor who'll do what you'd like him to do, or at least persuade your cardiologist to do something he suspects isn't warranted, to mollify the patient (and possibly a one-in-a-million rarity, heart disease in an otherwise healthy young man).  This becomes a question of who can outlast the other. I'd go for the gold standard in this case because it could eliminate a lot of doctor and ER visits over the coming years with the remote possibility of uncovering the unlikley Big Problem.   Hope this helps you make a decision as to how to pursue this. Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated as to how this all unfolds. And do consider a career change (unless you're already in the medical field) as you do seem to have an aptitude for this sort of work. But first get this thing sorted out. And keep in touch with us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Just curious. Did you ever find anything out regarding your case?  I am in the almost exact same boat as you. I have had cardiolite and thallium stress test, tilt table test, echo, blood work, ekgs, xrays, chest CT scan, abdomen ct scan, 64 slice ct scan of heart, right heart cath. my symptoms are getting worse. My cardiologist doesn't think it is a spasm and I also asked about Microvascular disease but they all think I am nuts.  They just give me anxiety meds and say we don't know. I am 34 y.o. female, 5'4\", 110lbs. They tell me you need to work out. My cholesterol is fine, my blood pressure is low (they tell me to eat salt) My symptoms are chest pain that radiates, sometimes back back, sometimes palpitations, sometimes shortness of breath. I get horrible jaw pain and left arm pain. They are sending me to a neurologist and to Cleveland Clinic. I am miserable, and worse. I think I have looked up everything under the sun and still think it is cardiac related whether it be prinzmetal angina, microvascular disease. I know they gave me medicine in the cath to trigger a spasm and said nothing happened. BTW...all of my tests were fine. I am so frustrated I could scream. It is affecting my marriage because my husband thinks I'm nuts since the tests are all coming back normal. I am a pretty stressed out person and it doesn't help worrying about it.  I am not too active, I have a desk job.  I also drive over an hour to work everyday. When I get home I usually play with my 2 year old cars or something.  Most of these symptoms happen when I am sitting down.  Just curious as to what has came out of your symptoms, testing? Thanks :)\n\n",

    "title": "My Father's ruptured MI broke all the rules?",
    "content": "Hello  (this was posted in a different site/forum, but it's inactive there and now i have found this site hoping someone will help!....thanks!)  I'm hoping there may be someone who can provide me with some reassurance or information.....or just tell me what you think was going on for my father. I need to understand everything.  My father died suddenly 5 weeks ago from an acute ruptured MI, haemopericarium and a circumflex artery thrombosis. He'd never shown any signs of heart disease over the years (he was 64 when he died). He never seemed to have angina on exertion and would spend long hours in the garden doing heavy work. His blood pressure was always normal as far as i'm aware (he always told me it was normal but unless i see his medical records i won't know for sure)............but i don't think he had any other tests, he never went to the doctor. He was never ill.  He'd had two days of indigestion and died on the third day. Strangely the indigestion had eased that day, but had just started up again minutes before he died. I'd phoned a medical helpline the day before and they said it sounded like a stomach bug and that we should watch out for a 'crushing chest pain,' but otherwise let it run it's course..........well we did that didn't we! The crushing chest pain occured about 20 seconds before he died.  I have many concerns and obviously i'm trying to process all this so any help you can give me would really be appreciated.  Firstly - i've been having panic attacks ever since this happened, worried that it would happen to me. I think if it hadn't happened 'out of the blue' then it wouldn't be so scary - although it would still have been as devastating.   So my question is are there usually warning signs before a heart attack? Is it usual that the person will get tested and be found to have high BP or high cholesterol, or angina first? My doctor keeps telling me that this probably didn't happen out of the blue, that my dad would have had some symptoms which might have been picked up had he been given relevant tests (but there was no reason for him to request those tests).  What i'm coming to is if you have ok BP, ok cholesterol and no angina, pass a stress test.....statistically what would be the likelihood of a heart attack happening out of the blue? I know things happen, but statistically - is there any info on this?   Also does a ruptured MI mean that the heart muscle ruptured? My doctor says yes.  Did the heart muscle rupture because the indigestion my dad was having for two days was actually a heart attack (for two days!!!) which destroyed the heart muscle?  How does someone have a heart attack for two days? Or was it unstable angina? and why was it not felt in the chest but in the stomach (with lots of belching)?  My biggest fear is to suffocate, i'm claustrophobic. In my mind a heart attack would feel like suffocating? Is this true?  I'm also very worried about what my father experienced. I know he wasn't particularly worried about the indigestion, although he was uncomfortable. He was laughing and joking minutes before all this happened.....why had the indigestion eased slightly that day?  Ok form this point on I really need to understand what dad was experiencing. He mentioned that the indigestion was back, but still not as bad as the day before...then he said there was a pain in both armpits, but he said it was mild. He had a bit of a nervous laugh. I asked to feel his pulse (i thought i might get some reassurance as he always had a strong and steady pulse)....it seemed to be racing slightly.....  he looked to see my reaction, saw the hesitation on my face and began to stand up, saying he had to call a colleague  he then launched into this phone call (did he know?)  while on the phone he suddenly started rubbing his chest, it still seemed incongruent with his general level of health so i still didn't pay much attention - although i was also watching him like a hawk  he quickly finished his phone call and then looked straight ahead at the wall, he appeared to be muttering under his breath - like someone does when they are thinking something through...  but he didn't answer me or ever speak again after this point (was he already losing conciousness?)  because he looked as though he was deep in thought, i thought he was, something to do with the phone call maybe.....  then he took a sharp intake of breath and looked around at us - at this point i realised he had come around from something and that maybe he wasn't fully concious before - though i had thought he was  no sooner had he looked at us then he turned quickly and stared back at the wall and seemed startled - something was happening in his stomach.....this was all happening so quick so i'm not sure how accurate i am being but i remember getting really frightened because it looked like something was about to burst out of his stomach.......just when i thought it might he seemed to go calm and it all stopped again....  then he leaned forward on the desk....he seemed to be trying to lift his head to our calls but couldn't, then slumped forward.  I know this is awful reading - but I would welcome any 'expert' at all out there, anyone with any knowledge to tell me what seemed to be happening.  I'd like to think that because dad seemed to be calm quickly then it must have been because he was losing conciousness. I hope so. Also earlier, at the start he didn't answer me at all but seemed to be muttering under his breath whilst staring at the wall....losing conciousness there too? and if so, why did he have a sharp intake of breath, seem to come round and turn to us momentarily? How could that have happened if he had had a cardiac arrest?  Sorry for the negative thread, but the more i can get my head around all this the easier it will be for me in the long run.  Thanks for reading, i really appreciate your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My Father's ruptured MI broke all the rules?",
    "content": "Hello -- First I'd just like to say in all sincerity I am terribly sorry to learn of your loss. It would have been difficult enough without having witnessed this relatively rare phenomenon. I will explain to you what appears to have happened, and I hope it will give you some sense of order to overlay this horrendous experience.   Before I begin to explain I'd like to insert here, for the sake of any passing readers, that three days of indigestion, even three hours of it, is a red flag and should be investigated, especially in men over the age of 50. If there is a long history of gastroesophageal reflux this is still a long seige of a specific symptom. Please don't let it get by as \"likely\" indigestion when more often than not this sort of symptom is suggestive of a cardiovascular problem. It often presents this way.   Now then: the circumflex artery, one of the major arteries feeding the heart muscle, and so one which is often stented or bypassed, serves the left ventricle usually around to the back of the heart. It takes off from the left anterior descending (LAD) artery, the one known as the \"widowmaker\" because the LAD is the primary trunk line for the left and bottom parts of the heart and often can shut down rather quickly. Since each one of us is somewhat different in terms of coronary vascular anatomy, some are more dependent on one artery than some others may be. For instance, some may have a dominat right coronary artery (RCA) which is large bore and reaches further than some of the other, retiring RCAs. Some may have a dominant circumflex, and it would seem this may have been the case with your father. When the LAD or circumflex artery becomes blocked or severely narrowed (myocardial infarct or unstable angina, now often called acute coronary syndrome -- ACS) the large and strong left ventricle can be weakened significantly, so that it becomes flaccid, develops an aneurysm or sometimes can even rupture, especially if the blood supply has been reduced for a period of time. Again,this is likely the case this time, as your father had symptoms for several days, but they weren't textbook classic symptoms -- and while it's great to recognize those textbook presentations, about half the time -- and especially if the injury is taking place low in the heart, it can manifest at epigastric distress often mistaken for indigestion. If this does not respond quickly to an antacid, there's a good chance, especially in males over 50, there is something else going on. I wouldn't accuse the advice line person of mishandling this, I can only say I am far more conservative and would have addressed this somewhat differently. Unfortunately advice lines do rely a lot on textbook scenarios. Your father's situation was a little different from those illustrations in a textbook. This happens. It is relatively rare but far from unheard of.   Now then: Your panic attacks are very normal given the circumstances, but the triggering fear is unfounded. While you now have a family history of heart disease and so must count that as a risk factor, the chances of having the exact same thing happen at any future time is almost nil. You're pretty young to even be a candidate for advanced heart disease, but your father was in the prime range -- and sex -- for it. The fact it wasn't a classic presentation may have been the fatal flaw in all this. You should have a baseline cardiological workup for your own peace of mind and for future comparison purposes, but not because this sort of thing is likely to ever occur again in your family or even in anyone you know. Heart disease is common (including in post-menopausal women). This particular outcome is not.  There are sometimes warning signs before a heart attack, sometimes not. Often even the signs are atypical enough (and especially so in women, who almost never have the textbook presentation) that they are often missed. This particular one was an atypical one that is known among emergency medicine people and cardiology experts, but not widely recognized generally, which is unfortunate. The problem rarely happens out of the blue, but it can show up fairly abruptly, which is how the word \"attack\" came into use. It's not there, then it is. Your father actually had two days or more of warning symptoms, but they're not classic, so they were missed. No one can be blamed for this in a system which is evolving slowly toward greater awareness and caution. No one wants to make anyone a cardiac neurotic, but sometimes this is avoided at the patient's peril.   The \"out of the blue\" heart attack, even following comprehensive cardiac workup including stress test is almost legendary. The reason is sudden rupture of plaque in a major artery, suddenly blocking or narrowing it. This happens quite often. It doesn't reduce the value of the workup, but is something we are still learning about as we go. Knowing this happens has already taken some of the mystery out of the problem of the apparently healthy person falling prey to an attack like that. In your father's case a regular (annual) exam might or might not have picked this up, but there was no justification based on prior symptoms, at least any he'd reported (and might not have recognized anyway).  A rupture of the myocardium means precisely that. If it is found on autopsy or angiographic exam, it's a literal rupture of the muscle due to prolonged or profound lack of blood supply. This is not always even painful, let alone classically so. In men it is more often, but not always. So much depends on the way the vessels are laid out in an individual. And yes, the \"indigestion\" was almost anginal pain manifested that way as it often is. The heart muscle was being compromised a little more each minute this persisted. These drawn-out events are the ones most likely to cause the most harm if there is no intervention. An MI is often a culmination of several days (or weeks or even months) of vague symptoms. The belching is caused because the part of the heart affected often lies near the diaphragm and affects the phrenic nerve. Swallowing of air to relieve the discomfort (presumed to be indigestion) also contributes to the belching.  An acute heart attack may quite often -- but hardly always -- be accompanied by shortness of breath if not actual sense of suffocation -- but also vague or classic discomfort (\"crushing\", \"squeezing\", \"vise-like\", \"constricting\" are words often used to describe the pain, as well as \"indigestion\"). Prodound fatigue, shortness of breath, palpitations, all these can be symptoms -- or not. Women tend to have more often atypical and rather vague symptoms, but a sense of something being wrong is often another strange red flag. It can be \"just\" anxiety, but it also is often reported in conjunction with vague symptoms.  Pain in both armpits is slightly atypical but not as much as one might think. It's always something that should grab the attention.   The final events you describe sound to me like someone just realizing something may be terribly wrong and trying very hard to figure out just what to do and how to do it so as to avoid causing an uproar. This is extremely common whether the \"attack\" is \"massive\" (a much abused word) or placed so as to do minimal damage, and it is very difficult to guage the severity by the intensity of the discomfort. Some terribly painful, classic presentations wind up causing minimal to no damage, while some very subtle ones can wind up causing terrible consequences. This is why they all need to be treated the same -- with a healthy dose of concern but not panic.   Your dad was very likley losing consciousness near the end, but even cardiac arrest isn't always absolute, and sometimes a person will simply have a very disrupted heart rhythm which corrects for a time. In the case of myocardial rupture there is also sometimes a \"grace period\" when blood is trapped inside the pericardium -- then slowly puts so much pressure on the outside of the heart it can't function any longer or the damage simply becomes too large.   There is a terrible immediacy to the experience you had, and if there is anything positive in it that would seem to be your father's concern for you that he not upset anyone, and that he was very aware of you and was simply put in a position where there was no quick and easy answer available by the time he realized what was happening.   It is terribly sad, yet there is this strange sort of bonding that can take place in events such as this. I feel this is what happened.   You are in no special danger of having the same thing happen to you but even if that were not a concern of yours you have undergone an enormously traumatic experience. It might be well to have someone with whom to talk this through. Panic attacks are common in survivors of these sorts of events.   Again, I am terribly sorry for your loss. I hope I've helped clear up some of the mystery involved and that you will seek some assistance in dealing with the aftermath of this loss. Please follow up with us here as needed. My very best to you and your family.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: My Father's ruptured MI broke all the rules?",
    "content": "Hello John  Thankyou so much for your comprehensive reply.  I really appreciate it.  Unfortunately i've had numerous panic attacks since i typed out my post and before it got accepted and i got your reply.  You reply was very reassuring but there is one thing that's bugging me.  I get a lot of 'indigestion,' myself.  It's so mild that i wouldn't even have normally noticed it or called it indgestion.  Rather it's a feeling like there's a bubble or pressure building up in my chest, I feel it rise and then my throat makes a funny noise  (lol that's the best way i can explain it), sometimes that will be followed by one hiccup and then it's relieved.  I cannot emphasise how mild this is and i'm only talking about it because i'm concerned now that the only possible symptoms that dad had over the last few years was 'indigestion' - and belching.  He didn't have anything nearly so uncomfortable as he had in his last few days, but he would occasionally say he had indigestion, belch and then after about 10 mins it was gone.  So i've started looking back in my memory to see if dad had any of these symptoms on exertion.  I can't remember any but the only thing i can remember is that when i used the computer at his house, it was upstairs, I would call him up and i was always aware that after climbing the stairs he would often belch.  Wierd memory i know but i remember it.  So now i'm worried that this 'bubble' feeling i get in my chest/stomach/throat area is similar.  An atypical angina?  As i say i would never have even noticed it, it's not distressing apart from the worry of what it means.  I don't belch, it's just something i hardly ever do, but i get a feeling of a bubble inside my chest that needs to burst....and then i get a feeling that it has and it's relieved.  I've checked to see if i get it on exertion and I do seem to.  often during the day if i am out walking to my mothers' up a hill i notice it.  I'm not short of breath - in fact i feel fit enough to run but i'm only walking, but i do feel this sensation then.  It does seem to lessen if i stop walking, but it doesn't go away after 10 minutes, more a gradual thing....and there are other times i will exercise and not get this sensation.  I remember having it bad at a wedding once years ago, after eating creme brulee.  I was driving a friend home and was so uncomfortable.  I attributed it to indgestion then, but now it would really scare me.  At the time the only thing that seemed to help was, oddly enough, going to bed and lying down.  Sometimes i find just calming down and resting helps.  My primary physician feels it is unlikely to be angina, more just normal movements of air in the oesophagus.  I'm just hoping that my dad's side of the family haven't got some rare disorder where they don't feel chest discomfort, just indigestion.  My dad's mum had terrible indigestion and belching in the last 5 years or so of her life, she died of a heart attack....the only one, never any other symptoms.  My doctor says it's not relevant because she was 81 when it happened.  Anyway, sorry for the long post....i'm really worried about this sensation now.  What do you think based on your experience?  I now you can only give your opinion.  It's the lack of classic symptoms in my dad that bothers me.    You mention the chances of having the exact same thing happen to me as what happened to dad are almost nil.....do you mean the lack of classic presentation?  or the rupture?  or the suddenness of the attack?  When you say this sort of thing is unlikely to occur again in my family or even in anyone i know - again what do you mean?  a heart attack?  or the kind of heart attack that dad had?  The reason i ask is i found what you said reassuring but not quite sure in what way i should be reassured (ie what do i tell myself when i am in the middle of a panic).  My doctor has agreed for me to see a cardiologist but told me that after seeing one i need to allow myself to be reassured, as he thinks it's likely they will reassure me.  He has also arranged for me to receive CBT for the anxiety.  A related issue i do get irregular heartbeats from time to time.  Tonight when i was walking home my heart was racing and when i took my pulse i noticed that at times it paused before resuming the beats.  I felt 'fluttery' in the chest.  I've had a heart monitor on before now (before my dad died actually) but i know it didn't happen when i had the monitor on.  I keep being told these ectopics are normal but until i've had a doctor actually see them on a monitor I'm not happy.  They seem worse just after my period.  Strangely enough i feel better, more calm, resting heart rate is about 68, but i notice the irregular beats more.  Premenstrually my heart beat seems more regular but also more forceful and resting at about 80 bpm.  Do you have any thoughts on that?  I'm sorry this is a long and rambling post, i really appreciate you reading it if you have....and thanks again for your post above it really has helped me a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome.   This bubble sensation in your chest: From the description it really does sound like air trapped in the esophagus, and of course you can feel and hear it move upward, then relieve it with a belch. Here's the whole deal about that, and it may be very important, your understanding this: Most of the gas causing belching is due to swallowed air, during eating, drinking, and especially in anxious people during sighing, which is something almost never done awares by the subject. It is also something people do, just as you've been doing, to relieve trapped gas or feelings of indigestion, so it tends to keep the cycle going. We swallow air consciously in order to belch, thus replacing some of what we just released. In your father's situation not only was his MI likely near the bottom of the heart (so innervated by the same sensors as the diaphragm), so likely causing some epigastric discomfort resembling indigestion (which he would naturally try to relieve by swallowing air to belch), but he may also have felt some shortness of breath on the stairs, which would cause deeper respirations and more swallowing of air. Anxiety also plays a role, to varying degrees, in those symptomatic of some sort of heart problem and is commonly seen in people who suspect, viscerally, they may be having a heart attack but lack what they feel is evidence for that.  It is also common and normal to suffer from anxiety and panic disorder following an experience such as you've had to endure. One part of this would be increased air swallowing. It's almost impossible to notice we're doing it. It's okay though.  Now then, to try and clarify more what I said about you needing not worry about having \"the same thing\" happen to you as did your father: Specifically what I meant was it is statistically highly unlikely you would have the same vessel, located in exactly the same place, become the culprit vessel in some future possible heart disease; it is even more unlikely, if you were to develop heart disease, even in the same vessel, for anyone to have myocardial rupture because of this. The chances of there being some sort of statistically near-impossible anatomical anomaly passed along is literally incalculable. That being said, we know you have a family history of heart disease (your grandmother and father), so it is prudent to live a healthy lifestyle, manage stress (starting with the terrible anxiety you're currently feeling), and have regular medical checkups that include an EKG. Fairy simple, really.   Atypical presentation of symptoms is farily common, so you could say there is a second-tier of semi-classic symptoms, especially for women, who are far more likely than men to present with more vague or at least less classic symptoms. They also seem to tend to get more advanced warning with these as opposed to men. This almost always occurs in postmenopausal women, but the classic signs are good to know and the less-classic ones are too. They include profound fatigue for no apparent reason, noticeable shortness of breath (very difficult to parse out in an anxious person, unfortunately), prolonged nausea (also common with indigestion and GI viruses of course), and mainly pain in places remote from the center of the chest, such as the shoulder tips, upper arms, neck, jaw and upper back. It should be borne in mind any pain or soreness that can be duplicated by motion, manual pressure, postural change, deep breathing, etc., is not cardiac related. A dull ache in one of the mentioned areas, along with unusual fatigue, nausea or shortness of breath, especially in a postmenopausal woman, should be considered a yellow flag. Classic symptoms are always a red flag.  The need for reassurance should, in theory, be helped by receiving reassurance, but what happens is the \"what ifs\" get tinier but they keep showing up on the radar, because of course we cannot eliminate all risk from the experience of being a live human. It becomes an obsession if not worked through, so I do, for the sake of your emotional quality of life, urge you to seek help with that. It's not an easy do-it-yourself project!  Your doctor is essentially correct in that your grandmother's having died of a heart attack doesn't \"count\" because of her age. For her generation she had lived quite a long time. Your father's dying was a little closer to premature. This does not indicated a trend, but rather what might be considered a statistical accident. Nevertheless, we now would \"count\" your father's relatively early death due to heart disease as positive family history. It may well have been a totally freak event -- certainly parts of it were -- but you're not likely to forget it, ever, and the reassurance of doing the most to eliminate th potential of heart disease in yourself should be worth a good deal, at least so long as it doesn't in itself become obsessive. The goal is actually to live normally and reasonably (stay at a healthy weight, keep saturated fats low, treat naturally-occurring high colesterol under control with statin drugs if necessary, exercise and enjoy doing it, etc.).   I also concur with your doctor about you having a cardiology consult, which should be a good way to establish a baseline of knowlege of your cardiac status, reassure you, and become a useful part of your medical record for future comparisons (and continued reassurances).   Your heart actually is more likely to be more regular (fewer PVCs) premenstrually. We don't know exactly why this is so, but it is a thing noted a good deal and has been found in at least one formal study. Even so, the slower the resting rate the more likely a PVC will sneak in here and there. In most People (there are some who do the opposite), increasing the rate lessens the likelihood of a noticeable premature beat. For this reason many people learn to get up and do somethng physical when they are bothered by PVCs at rest.  No need to apologize for the long post! It's all helpful to others and this reassurance process can be quite complex, as I've pointed out above. I'm happy to do what I can to help clear up things, but do bear in mind you've suffered a remarkable emotional trauma and undoubtedly are suffering a degree of PTSD. Some formal help will likely be necessary to break you out of the cycle of finding new possibitlities to question. It's normal. I'm happy to work with you this way.\n\n",

    "content": "Thankyou John  I really do appreciate your time.  You are the only person that's really gone through things with me comprehensively.  Since i wrote last i've probably had less panic attacks.  I've started taking B vitamin complex and .....well i don't know yet but it seems to be helping, along with the advice you have given.  I have had one worrying symptom recently.  I've told my doctor.  I had a list of symptoms which i said i wasn't worried about if they didn't mean anything bad (the 'indigestion' that i describe above is one of them).....but one symptoms was dfinitely physical and completely unpsychological in my opinion.  Basically i was laying down on a sofa and someone asked me for a telephone number.  I jumped up and walked over to a desk to get it.  I felt fine but by the time i reached the desk i was dizzy, almost blacking out, and heaviness in my chest, neck and both arms.  I just kept telling myself to breathe and i would eventually get enough oxygen.  This was the case and the symptoms disappeared within about a minute to two minutes.....or maybe a lot less, not sure.  My friend was totally oblivious to this.  I was able to continue functioning normally despite not feeling normal.    The chest and arm heaviness made me feel that my heart couldn't keep up with me, with what i'd done.    I think i have had this in the past, as well as when i was a lot younger.....but of course i have never thought of it as heart related before now.  Dizziness i'd understand as postural hypostension....but the chest heaviness and the arms....?  The doctor said it most probably is postural hypostension and also said he'd be more worried if the heaviness was only down the left arm.  Well i expect in the past when this has happened it has just been the left arm.  It has never worried me because i've never related it to the heart functioning before and always thought i'd 'got up too quick.'  It's possible i've had milder versions of this if i over did things strenuously, like charging up flights of stairs at work, i mean a few floors.  At those times i linked it to my lungs not expanding enough because at times i have a bit of asthma, usually mild, but probably i don't treat it when it should.  My doctor said he feels confident there's nothing wrong because I passed the stress test and i didn't have any symptoms when doing that.  Also i've been back to my martial arts class and am coping there ok, although i notice fleeting dizziness there if i jump up from kneeling too quick (but it's fleeting, not like what i described above....possibly because i'm already exercising at the class and not in a completely relaxed state?).  Generally i'm coping well at the class and going there has done a lot of good for my anxiety.    However what i described above was intense heaviness in the chest and both arms and shortness of breath.  I was not having any type of anxiety or panic at the time.  I've also noticed that when i get home from work (i'm on my feet all day at work), and stand from my seat on the train, i get a headache.  Sometimes it lingers for about 30 minutes.  All this i've told my doctor.  I'm convinced my doctor thinks i'm crazy at the moment.  I'm just being vigilant.  I cannot just unquestioningly trust anyone at the moment that's all.  I will email my doctor and empathise the intensity of those symptoms.  Meanwhile i was wondering what you think?  Is angina like symptoms part of postural hypotension?  I can't seem to find much information on that.  I don't get these symptoms usually when exercising and actually really enjoy exercise.  It's definitely sudden exertion and mainly rising after sitting....  Thanks again John!  I do hope that others are being helped by reading this too and i do appreciate your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Just briefly, sorry for a second post, I thought i might add that my cholesterol was measured at total = 3.6, LDL = 2.0 and HDL = 1.19, ratio (don't know which) was 3.0.  My doctor tells me that is low and not a risk.  However I've noticed that the HDL is lower than the LDL.....should i be trying to change this, or is it the ratio that's important?  I should also mention there are times when i feel that i can't get enough air in my lungs, and i sigh a lot and yet my peak flow is ok....this is usually premenstrually.  I could test out whether taking some of my asthma medicene helps i guess?  I don't get any chest heaviness then, but because my peak flow is ok i've often wondered is it related to the asthma or not?  At those times i just wish my chest would expand wider when i breath in, but it doesn't.  I'm pretty sure at times i have taken asthma medicene and it has worked, even though it's not classic asthma.  thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there and you are entirely welcome.   What you describe as the unusual incident of chest heaviness, weakness or weightniness in both arms and presyncope (near-faint) upon getting up and having walked a short distance before feeling all this is absolutely classic for orthostatic hypotension. I know, that doesn't sound right, but what often happens (not every time, but occasionally) is the upper body (head included, of course) starves out momentarily, and some people actually get quite a distance before this hits them and some of those actually wind up on their knees or their faces. It is especially provocative to stretch upon getting up then walking -- at least without standing in place for a second or two -- since this is often done unconsciously, feels really good til the drop hits, and essentially is a Valsalva maneuver, which causes the heart rate to slow as well as the blood volume to drop precipitously. It won't happen every time, but coupled with your experience of jumping up from a kneeling position during martial arts classes. Why this is more mild is simple enough: Your cardiovascular system is already working more efficiently because you're in the midst of something physically and mentally challenging.   These symptoms, graphically described by you, do not match up with what would be considered angina or otherwise cardiovascular disease, surprisingly enough. What you've experienced is a very unpleasant variant of orthostatic hypotension, and again, one would be well advised to stay for a moment before bouncing off across the room after rising, and especially if there is an involuntary, unconscious stretch included in the getting up. Trust me on this, it's classic, and while it's not the heart that causes it directly, you certainly could fall and hurt yourself (speaking from experience here). Best to get up, wait a sec, then if it still starts to happen, slow down, stop if necessary, bend forward at the waist or simply get down on the floor before you fall down. It shouldn't happen too often, but frequency varies. It also can be worsened by inadequate fluid intake.  On the upside I am very happy to learn your panic attacks seem to be on the wane. You're doing really well. I don't think this most recent issue is one to write off to anxiety, either. It's a very real phenomenon and can be quite scary, all by itself. I'm glad you came back here to ask about it. It's not at all unusual, but if it's not explained clearly it can be a very worrisome thing. Not dangerous in itself, but no one likes to pass out (at least I wouldn't think so).   Good to hear from you, happy you're doing better, please do stay in touch. Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mild Pain after PCI+stenting",
    "content": "Hello -- Much depends upon the character of the pain you're having. While it would seem unlikely you'd be having angina given the recent opening of the arteries and considering the medications you're taking, it's not impossible there could be a different, perhaps smaller, vessel stenosed. If the pain occurs with exertion, during stress, or if it is very similar to pain you experienced with the initial MI, you should at least notify the doctor, and to be safe probably should just give him a call anyway, to let him know this is happening. Since there was no open surgery the pain wouldn't be due to post-surgery soreness. It could, of course, be something totally unrelated to the heart, and this is what we hope for. But since you had two of the major arteries at least partially blocked at some point, and since you've managed to avoid any actual damage up til now, I wouldn't take any chances. At least give your doctor notice you're having some pain. Also, if you can, please reply here and try to describe the nature of the pain you're having presently.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please keep us updated here.\n\n",

After the 1st PCI I had sever pain, cramps and numbness in legs, speacially in the morning while going to job, but at job it was less. This complain was also disappeared by B compex,  at that time I took B Complex for 2 weeks. I added Vitamins my self with consultation of my son who is also a physician (MBBS) going to join residency in medicine soon. I am a MLT working in transfusion services in KSA.  I am feeling much better since taking B Complex. Shall I Continue?  One correction in my past posting, please read Lipitor in place of lipitrol. One of small artery was bocked by the stent in RCA. My cardiologist told me after stenting that I may have burning due to this closure. I felt some burning but after starting Neurobion, I donot feel it also. Only some times a little.

    "title": "Re: Large number of stents",
    "content": "Hello -- Stents are an option available when any one of a long list of things make them preferable to bypass. Multiple stents are becoming more and more common, and in diabetics, in particular, are often seen as preferable to the sometimes slowed healing caused by diabetes. The stents go in, assuming patient is anatomically agreeable, and the job is done without having to worry about tissue healing problems. This is just one of many reasons for this, but given the particular history you have, this number of stents as opposed to bypass is entirely unsurprising, as is the fact there was significant damage to the inferior part of the heart, something which often escapes the awareness of diabetics whereas others would have felt pain and perhaps been seen and had intervention done sooner.   I'd say in your specific case the number of stents isn't excessive, although it is possible you've reached the theoretical limit. This is impossible to say, because it varies with each patient. The important thing is you're doing as well as you are and that you continue to do so.   Good luck to you. Please keep us updated here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Why are Young Females Naturally Protected from Heart Disease",
    "content": "Hi  I've read in many places that young females are naturally protected from heart disease.  Does that mean young men are not?  How does it work?  What does the young female body do to fatty deposits in the arteries?  Does it clear them more efficiently or does the laying down of deposits not happen so much?  I'm very interested in the mechanism involved.  As i'm 39 what can I do to try to keep that protection as i get older?  Does HRT help maintain that protection?  My mother started her menopause at 39........I don't think i've started mine yet but i am thinking ahead because my father has just died suddenly at 64 with an acute ruptured MI (you will see about this in another post).  In the last year i've noticed a lot of irregular heartbeats.  I've had a normal stress test recently, BP is 120/80, cholesterol was good apparently (inc the good cholesterol)....and i had a 24 hour monitor that was apparently normal (haven't seen the results for myself)......unfortunately those irregular beats did not occur when i was wearing the monitor.  I've wondered if the irregular beats have started up since trying to wean myself off Zopiclone (i've been taking it for about 7 years!!!  i know!  but a very stressful environment for sleeping mean't that my doctor allowed this, it was the lesser of two evils and now he's trying to get me off the drug).  I'm now down to half of the drug per night but the other night i lowered the dose further and the next day i had a funny quivering feeling in the back of my throat - involuntary.  The next morning i noticed two bruises on my tongue!  They would only have occured if i had bitten hard on my tongue i think.....worrying me as to whether i will have a seizure if i lower the dose further.  I have been constantly at my doctors recently because of anxieties about my own heart since my dad died.  I'm embarassed to keep going to them so haven't told them about this.  Thanks for listening.  Any advice would be appreciated.  It would be great to understand how females are protected too.  Is there no way that protection could be transferred to men medically?  Sorry if that's a silly question.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Why are Young Females Naturally Protected from Heart Disease",
    "content": "Hello there -- I replied to your post regarding your dad's MI. I hope that was helpful and that this will be also. The reason young women (actually premenopausal women, who in reality are quite young now, since the whole age paradigm has changed) are protected from heart disease, or at least enjoy a layer of protection men do not, is estrogen. This is a known protective counter-risk factor for women prior to menopause. Men simply don't get this one. I wish we did!  HRT has become controversial in recent years, since it both confers continued protection against heart disease but may also (depending upon which studies you choose) my confer risk factors for other non heart-related problems such as certain cancers.   In all people the best protections, long-term, against heart disease, are a good family history and a healthy lifestyle (primarily diet and exercise), along with regular checkups that include blood lipid measurement and c-reactive protein measurement annually. If either is abnormal, medical management of the lipids should be begun promptly and aggressively. Also, of course,there is the issue of smoking, which is a separate, controllable risk factor.  Your dad having died of an MI (a fairly unusual complication was involved as you know) may or may not count as positive family history, depending upon what his cholesteral levels had been (if known) and if he was considered to have premature coronary artery disease. Unfortunately, this is often something impossible to know when the person in question appeared healthy and had no special reason to have these items checked on a regular basis. For this reason it's especially important for you to know what your other, personal, risk factors are, what your cholesterol level is and the breakdown of the various contributing lipids; also that you live healthy, maintain a healthy body weight, and in general do all the prudent things to avoid potential heart disease. C-reactive protein (CRP) is one indicator, as is cholesterol. Very high cholesterol levels would suggest a genetic problem. Luckily this can be attacked medically with anti-cholesterol drugs. In fact, with a positive family history the main difference from someone without that factor, is simply being more aggressive in maintaining a healthy lifestyle including regular exercise.   Your dad's tragic coronary event took place at an age where we do start to see a lot of heart disease and MIs. While he was still pretty young -- and now would be considered a young man having had an MI -- he was approaching the statistical area where it's not too surprising to see heart disease. The fact his first known event was a fatal one is terrible, but again, was a rather unsual outcome, not something which in itself is a heritable syndrome. Heart disease can be, but the particular chain of events in his case was just really horrible luck.   The premature heartbeats you're currently feeling (palpitations) are normal and common in the healthy population as well as in those with heart disease, so are of no diagnostic nor prognostic significance. However, they do occur more often in people who suffer from anxiety. We discussed this in your other post, and it's unsurprising you would currently be feeling more of these and perhaps noticing them for the first time. Again, to ease your mind and clear the air, a comprehensive cardiological workup should be done for you, just as a baseline for future reference. We all could benefit from that sort of information being on file. In your case it could also either expose a familial tendency to heart disease (but not to the specific event your father suffered) or it could totally let you off the hook in that regard.   Once a woman has passed through menopause, she is then on an equal footing with men re: heart disease, except that HRT may be considered. While this is not currently offered to men because there's been no clear advantage demonstrated, research continues for both genders. Meanwhile, the best way to avoid problems, again, remains living a healthy lifestyle and keeping those annual appointments just to keep an eye on things.  Oh, and the likely bitten tongue was probably just that. With intense anxiety often there are nocturnal things that turn up that hadn't happened before and this is one we see. I'd refer you back to my response to your other post and the suggestion to consider counseling and CBT to help you work through the emotional trauma you experienced. This could, in the short run, improve your quality of life a great deal, even as you begin to take all the standard precautions we need to in order to avoid heart disease, even if there is no family predisposition.  I do hope this is helpfful. Again, my best to you and of course please stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been getting a feeling of short flutters (as fast as an electric shock) in my chest, around the breast bone and in the centre of the chest.  It can occur over and over again for maybe 10 minutes at a time all throughout the day and during the night too.  It's been happening for the last 3 days.  At the same time I have had an uncomfortable feeling that my throat and airways are too open and it's far too easy to breath!  Is this anything to worry about? I don't know whether it has anything to do with it but I haven't had a drink in the last 4 months and a few days ago I had one glass of red wine.  Could it have triggered anything?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- What you describe is very likely premature heartbeats, either ventricular (PVCs) or atrial (PACs) or perhaps some of both. This is an extremely common phenomenon, only some people feel every one of them while others are totally unaware it is happening. It's a really benign thing, everyone has it happen at some time or another, and there are so many benign causes it would be impossible to list them all here, but even drinking a little wine can sometimes cause a few flutters. It's fine.   The sensation of inhalation being \"almost too easy\" is also common, although I don't think I've ever heard anyone complain about it. The cause of this sensation is unclear but is suspected to be the reverse of throat tightening (globus sensation), and if the subject is somewhat anxious to start with and suffers from globus sensation anyway, it relaxing (something else wine can cause, among other things), the change in sensation could be disconcerting, I suppose, just because it is so different. It can't be a bad thing, however, and is probably worth embracing and enjoying.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Collateral Vein(s)",
    "content": "Hello -- The collateral blood flow, in those fortunate enough to be able to form them, function as arteries, not veins. They will develop in certain people and not others, and they are essentially new arteries, but not native ones, so looked at as a peculiar phenomenon. The important thing is that they do work. As to the effect on EF, it depends upon the amount of damage to the left ventricle already present, the course of the collaterals, etc. In other words they can sometimes have a dramatically salutory effect and improve cardiac output significantly. In others they do nourish the muscle but if there is too much scar tissue the improvement in actual LVEF can vary from a lot to a little. This will become more clear over time in any given patient. The more regular and progressive the cardiac rehab program, the better the outcome, as a rule.  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, As you had undergone the Carotid Endarterectomy in the very recent past, the symptoms and signs that you mention could be the usual post operative sensations that patients tend to feel after surgery. Of late,the procedure of performing a 'patch angioplasty' while closing the incision in the carotid artery is gaining popularity.This has been shown to decrease the incidence of embolic complications especially in women.A Dacron mesh or a vein patch is commonly used. There can be a weakness at the area of the patch, but as i said, in your case it is too early to attribute your feelings to 'complications'. In course of time,as healing of tissues continues, your symptoms hopefully, will get better.If you feel that the problem is getting worse, do not hesitate to consult your neurosurgeon. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor, my mom is 58 yrs old. In the last two weeks she fainted twice without any reasons. It scared me very much and then I just found out that this happened twice last year too. Her blood pressure now while she takes Atenolol and the other pills is most of the time good 124/68 but I realized that her pulse dropps a lot most of the time her heart rate is between 43-55. It just scares me seeing her pulse lower than 50! Also she complains about chronic semi numbness on her pinky, ring finger and little bit of her palm in her left arm. She has headaches also and use to take Ibuprofen and just read on line that it's not good to use this while on Atenolol.   She was diagnosted with some heart problems 20 yrs ag( arrythmia, cardipathy ischemic...) and also they believe that she had a small heart attack 8 yrs ago. In 2000 she was diagnosted with high blood pressure so they put her 2 yrs ago on Atenolol 50 mg one pill/day; Tertensif ( indapamide 1.5 mg) 1 pill/day; Preductal ( diclorhidrat trimetazidine 35 mg ) 1 pill/day; Also they gave her Theo SR 100 to help her breath easier ( this year she was just diagnosted with mild emphysema). My question is what she should do now in order to bring her pulse a litle bit higher and keep it around 60? Also , what other pills should she usef or headches instead Ibuprofen...something safe to use while taking Atenolol? Should she decrease the pills dosages? Thank you sooo much and God bless!!!

NOW.... take the b/p and pulse regularly.  IF you see these low puse rates, call the doctor and ask before giving atenolol or any other b/p cardiac drugs.  But you must get his/her personal advice.   Your mom has too complicated a history for anyone to really know what to do for her unless they see her in person and take into account all the problems she has. As for headaches, perhaps some tylenol would be better.  Just a thought.  But again don't take my word for it, ask her doctor.  Tylenol is normally not a drug to affect the heart/b/p the way the NSAIDS do such as Ibuprofen, Aleve, and Aspirin and many of the prescription anti inflamatory meds.   As for the pulse rate, the doctor will have some suggestions. Best of Luck, Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

    "content": "I have had chest pain off and on my whole life and just over a year ago they discovered a 2\u201d ancient schwanoma in my chest cavity along the spine.  The dr said he had never seen someone so happy to have a tumor (I thought this would be the end of my chest pain issues).  I had surgery just over a year ago to remove a tumor from my spine.  They took out rib tips t3.t4 to get it out.  Lately I have been having episodes of stabbing chest pain in the center of the chest, sometimes with left arm involvement.  Three weeks ago I had such an episode that lasted for about 45min and the following day I had alot of soreness in my chest and upper abdomen.  ER said I was fine.  Yesterday I had stabbing pain with sweating.  The stabbing pain lasted only 1min but I felt like crap the rest of the day with a few random stabs from time to time.  There was no pressure or tightness, but it did make me light headed.  This morning I am sore around the chest and upper abdomen again and still feel kind of out of it.  In the last few days I have had occasional stabbing pain in the left upper inner thigh area. I have had chest pain off and on my whole life, but not this severe and it did not have the light headed crappy feeling.  I am 6'1\" and 238lbs.  My cholesterol is well controlled on crestor 10mg.  I do not get much exercise, and have been somewhat afraid to following the surgery and chest pains.  My diet is not great.  I have had alot of indigestion lately and sometimes it feels like the food gets stuck above my stomach.  I have had numerous times where I felt light headed and week without chest pain involvement.  The last few months have been miserable.  Any thoughts would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stabbing chest pain + feeling faint",
    "content": "Hi there --  While I would of course want to have anything scary ruled out up front, your pain doesn't sound much like it's cardiac-related. It of course is possible, but stabbing pain is rarely cardiac related, and soreness and tenderness afterward is even less like any sort of known cardiac syndrome. Again, this does not mean there is no heart disease, only that they symptoms would be very atypical. I still think at least a cursory rule out should be done, however, with EKG and echocardiogram. You do carry some risk factors, including sedentary lifestyle, overweight, and a borderline family history in your father having had a heart attack at what is now a relatively young  age. Once this hurdle has been cleared you'll need to be seen by a neurologist, as the most likely cause, assuming no structural heart problems are found, is a nerve issue. You definitely fit the profile for this.   It does also sound as though you may have an upper GI problem, and this could also be contributory to the symptoms. First things first, though. Cardiology consult first, then maybe an upper GI exam, then most likely a trip to see a neurologist, in that order.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "CAROTID ARTERY STENOSIS",
    "content": "Hello I am a 46 yr old caucasin woman, 120 pounds, 5'4\". Am a smoker, non-drinker.  Past history of high cholesteral, but currently at 192 total, 55 HDL, 72 Triglycerides, but do not have my LDL numbers. Blood pressure in the past was always normal, however, is now at 146/86. My BMI is 24.9%. Recently, I was able to attend a health fair in my area due to having no insurance and tests could be done at a great rate. I felt it important to get some testing done due to issues I've had at least over the past 3 years and in some cases longer.  I had a Vitamin D test and am deficient at a total of 12.  I also had a heart echo and carotid artery ultrasound. The heart appears to be functioning properly, altho the arteries could not be seen. My left carotid artery has a 24% stenosis and the right has less, but there is some buildup.  First, I have read that carotid artery blockage is typically secondary or comes after  coronary artery blockage. Is that a possibility? How do I find out or know if I have blockages in my heart vessels? I have had and am having many issues that appear to be related to 'heart' problems. Tingling and numbness, some weakness, in the left arm and hand, armpit, neck, also with 'hot spots and itching\" on the left arm as well as at times in my left calf muscle area in which it itches deeply under the skin. I also have shortness of breath, dizziness and sometimes nausea. Slight dull headaches. My vision has gotten worse over the past couple years, but has been more like a double vision issue or I will see type on a computer for instance as a brown/green color but knowing it should be black. I see white stars sometimes too.  I have chest pains that seem to be best described as a gripping, yanking, twisting, flip flopping feeling. At those times, I can't move until it has settled. There is always some kind of dullness pains in my arm or chest. My speech sometimes gets messy--more like a feeling of being scrambled, I will pronounce words backwards for instance or can't seem to find the right word. I don't think as clearly as I used to, maybe an age related issue? As I write this, the headache is dull, the arm is tingling and has a hot spot and my chest feels deep and I am a little dizzy.  I had some blood tests run as well and all seems to be ok in most the testing. The CRP(R) was a 0.5. My CA 125 was a 5. My TSH was 2.18. Calcuim at a 9.0. Hemoglobin was 14.5, Hemorcrit at 43.5, WBC 7.1, RBC 4.41, platelets 226, MCV 98.7, MCH 32.9, MCHC 33.3 and RDW 13.7. My Total Cholesteral was 192, HDL 55, Triglycerides 72, they didn't do the LDL.  CO2 was 24.  I just a couple days ago started taking about 3000 IU of Vitamin D3 ,and also started taking low dose aspirin every other day as I don't tolerate aspirin well due to ulcers/stomach problems in the past, so I take that before bed.  I guess I am not sure what to do from here or what all this means. I know I must quit smoking as a priority and am working on this. I also think I am experiencing pre menopausal symptoms, such as occasional night sweats and irregular periods. Any insight would be so greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Your LDL, by default, is 122. HDL is known and 20% of triglycerides make up VLDL for the total of 192. Tri-G's are remarkably good, which is a plus, and HDL is high, which is a plus as well. LDL, absent heart disease, is fine.   These health fair tests are a great screening thing, but are far from the gold standard. If anything funny shows up in one of them then it needs to be  followed up with a \"real\" exam. Your cholesterol shows up as generally very good. Blood work in general is very good. No obvious structural heart problems, which is great, but there is some beginning carotid stenosis, though not enough, according to the test you had done, to account for the symptoms you're  having. However, this should be repeated to be certain it was an accurate reading. You do have some symptoms which could be attributed to carotid stenosis,  so this should be explored in more depth. Also, you have some potential heart symptoms, although it's hard to say without at least a 12-lead EKG and preferably a nuclear scan/stress test. This would be appropriate anyway, with  your stated symptoms and your age. You could very well be having pre or perimenopausal symptoms, but are also having some other, less specific things happen. None of your symptoms are age-specific, except those that  might be related to menopausal changes. You are a smoker, so you have at leat one significant risk for heart disease. For this reason alone it would be reasonable to now have a baseline heart workup. If nothing  shows up in this exam,  the specific symptoms can then be addressed individually. For instance,  tingling, numbness and itching are likely not cardiac related, but could be due to premenopause or neurological issues. The speech and memory problems are not age-specific at all, but could be related to carotid stenosis, which needs to be rechecked. Chest pains, in  a possibly premenopausal woman must be considered potentially cardiac and so the cardio workup. I suspect there are probably several things going on  separately, some almost certainly innocent, others possibly smoking-related or hormonal. A thorough physical with empasis on heart needs to be done for baseline purposes. You may find you're really quite healthy, as the tests thus far would indicate, but you do have some symptoms  that deserve special attention.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

My echocardiogram showed that my heart was very strong. These attacks continue off and on yet all I know is that the testing shows no damage to the heart or occlusion of the arteries.

    "content": "Hello - The more intrusive/invasive tests you've had constitute the gold standard for diagnosis of  cardiovascular disease, so between an angiogram (I believe you meant catheterization where you wrote \"cauterization\"?) and the thallium scan/stress test do exclude cornonary artery stenosis causing ischemia.   Further, it is very true that resting 12-lead EKGs, while exteremely useful, can also produce no-specific or even sometimes outright misleading information.   You haven't described the symptoms which have led you to show up at the ER with presumptive heart attack symptoms, and I would really like to know more about them. In the meantime I can offer one possible explanation for your problem, assuming the symptoms you describe actually are consistent with an incipient coronary event, and that is this: there is a third possibility which lies between panic attacks and occult heart disease: Printzmetal's angina, a form of coronary artery spasm. This is not always associated with coronary artery blockage and can occur in otherwise perfectly normal hearts. One coronary artery will, intermittently (and sometimes with great predictability, but not always) go into spasm. When this happens the classic symptoms of heart attack usually appear, along with the classic clinical signs such as ST elevation on the EKG. However, within 20 minutes the symptoms subside and the EKG abnormalities, if  seen at all, tend to go away. The  patient and doctors are left frustrated. This is only one possible explanation for what's been  happening to you, and if  the episodes you've endured have been associated wtih periods of unusual emotional stress this could be the answer. It is possible to diagnose  this condition by provocative testing during an angiogram by introducting a drug into the suspect artery which will cause a susceptible artery to reproduce the spasm. If this test (ergonovine is usually the drug used to  provoke spasm) then the condition is treated medically. But first we need to look more closely at the clinical picture of your episodes and see if we can find some even simpler  explanation.   Please, if you care to, share some of the details of the events which have caused you to seek help at the ER. The more details you can  provide the better.   I await further  information.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 36 years old male, I've had a week off work recently for the Japanese national holiday 'Golden Week', I have just been inactiuve lounging around at home, over the past few days.   When I wake up in the morning, I sense a discomfort in the center of my chest.It goes away after a few seconds, it does not spread to other areas of my chest.  Also 2 days ago, I noticed a kind of pressure in my chest, that occured about a minute after going from a lying to a standing position. This happpened consistently that day each time I went from lying to standing. It hasn't happened today or yesterday.  I went jogging yesterday and today for 20 minutes, and that did not cause any discomfort.  My blood pressure is normal. I should also mention that I had bronchitis from March to mid April this year, and was coughing everyday.   I am concerned as my family has a history of heart disease and heart attacks on my Father's side.   Do you think my problem is heart related?  Thank you very much in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: brief discomfort in center of chest on waking",
    "content": "Hello --  Your chest discomfort isn't consistent with any typical presentation of heart disease, but it is consistent with a certain orthopedic problem: costochondritis. This is usually caused by an inflammatory process involving  the  colagen connective tissue between the  ribs and the breast bone. This can also be caused by strain from coughing and sometimes becomes chronic.  It is usually felt most upon rising in the morning and just as you describe. This usually will respond  well to over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin or naproxyn, but may sometimes be stubborn.    Where heart disease is concerned, because you do have a positive family history for this, you are wise to be watchful, and now would be as good a time as any  for a baseline workup, but what you're experiencing right now is almost certainly musculo-skeletal and benign.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 62 year old male with Hx of a three vessel CABG six years ago.  At the time, I had been an endurance cyclist for eight years and went for a physical that included a treadmill test consisting of Bruce Protocol.  The results were positive for significant ST segment elevation, blockages confirmed with heart cath and the operation was performed three days later.  There were numerous complications following surgery including excessive bleeding, bilateral pulmonary effusion, congestive heart failure, abnormal liver and kidney function, right side heart enlargement and associated conditions such as pedal edema, ascities, etc.  To make a long story short, with diet and exercise, I have made remarkable progress.  My HDL is 42, my LDL is 59, triglycerides are 85, my EF is 67%, by B/P is in the 105/68 range and I demonstrated no signs of ischemia during my target heart rate during a recent nuclear stress test.  Overall, there appeared nothing wrong EXCEPT the radiologist noted a \"perfusion defect\" in the anterior septal region before and after the treadmill test that was \"suspicious\" for an MI.  This was based on the absence of this defect on an identical test two years ago.  If I had an MI, I was certainly not aware of it and would have immediately contacted a health care provider if I had any of the signs of a possible MI.   My question is if there is anything, other than an MI, that could cause such a defect?   Are there false positives in this kind of test?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Perfusion defect anterior septum",
    "content": "Hi there-  First of all congratulations on the great work you've done recovering from a traumatic CABG surgery. That's extremely impressive, and not everyone chooses (or is able) to accomplish what you have. Good work.  Now then: the most recent stress test/nuc scan showed an anterior septal perfusion defect called \"suspicous for MI.\" Is it possible this could be a false positive? Yes. While the odds are less in favor of that than they would be in someone without the history you have,  false positives can occur and do fairly regularly if not frequently.  This is one possibility. Another is silent MI, which tends to occur mostly in diabetics and the elderly. You don't mention diabetes and are certainly not in the \"elderly\" class, so this seems fairly unlikely. A third possibility is that sometimes a defect can show up temporarily for reasons that are not clear, then resolve later. With no symptoms and only a \"suspicous\" possible post MI lesion, it would seem nothing much has happened in terms of practical application, and may not have happened at all. (I am familiar with appearance and subsequent disappearance of such  lesions over a period of months or years in people with positive CAD histories. It can be perplexing). My advice would be to go with your cardiologist's recomendations regarding this finding. The radiologist is obligated to not everything and anything that isn't \"to spec\", even when there have to be other abnormalities which should be showing up as well. The very fact that just prior to your CABG you had ST segment elevation would suggest a possible infarction. There may have been a borderline injury that shows up now in the course of remodeling. Again, followup with your cardiologist is the important thing here. It could absolutely be a  false positive -- or false possible positive, since it may be concluded this was artifact when your doctor has looked at the pictures. We do see false positives on a fairly regular basis, athough I don't know what the exact statistics are for this.   With no symptoms and significant improvement in all areas I wouldn't be overly concerned, and would expect the cardiologist would make an issue of this if he felt it deserved it.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "MRI shows possible ischemic vs. multiple sclerosis",
    "content": "HISTORY: Elevated blood pressure and heart rate accompanied with dizziness and tremors in hands with numbness in finger tips on Christmas Eve 2008. PCP sent me to a heart doctor who did an ultrasound, heart monitor (24 hours), EKG, nuclear stress test accompanied by scans of my heart. Results came back normal with no blockages.  Feb. 13, 2009 I experienced high blood pressure (142/85 with a heart rate of 104), dizziness so intense that I was dizzy even laying down with me eyes closed. Taken by ambulance to emergency room, ct scan of brain (normal), EKG, given fluid intravenous for dehydration and dismissed 8 hours later feeling fine again. I also reported tinnitus and a feeling of fullness in my ear that has been ongoing for some time. No history of headaches.  Heart doctor sent me to an ENT who did a hearing test that indicated loss of hearing in the left affected ear and sent me to a neurologist who ordered an MRI with and w/o contrast and an MRA of my brain and neck on March 28, 2009.   MRI results: Scattered T2 hyperdensities are present in the bilateral frontal white matter. Diagnostic considerations include ischemic vs. multiple sclerosis plaque. There is no MRI evidence of 'enhancing lesion' in the brainstem to suggest acute process.  MRA results: No MR angiogram evidence of aneurysm.  The neurologist (who did not look at the films, only the report) had his office call and say the results came back normal and to follow up as needed.  So don't know what to do now as the doctor says nothing is wrong, but symptoms persist. My blood pressure is back down to normal (116/75) but still have the ear problems and bouts of milder dizziness. I am the type of person who rarely goes to the doctor and this is making me not want to see a doctor ever again because I have now spent about 6 months of my paychecks with no results. I don't know what to do.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: MRI shows possible ischemic vs. multiple sclerosis",
    "content": "Hello --  I am so sorry you've had this experience with no satisfactory medical outcome. It seems the MRI first confused everyone then led them off the track  of the real problem, which is the symptoms.   The symptoms you describe, prolonged, severe vertigo, tinnitus and loss of hearing in one ear, are all typical of Menier's disease. This can be associated with MS and also with ischemic brain changes, but the radiology report really does describe a relatively normal brain with some nonspecific artifact which could be unrelated to the symptoms, and even if it is related, they would be treated the same way: symptomatically.   There are several  considerations involving Menier's syndrome, including avoidance of aspirin, treatment with meclizine or other anti-vertigo medications (meclizine can be  had over the counter and is often very effective; stronger ones require a prescription), and exercises to help adapt to and ultimately \"short circuit\" the dizziness. The fact that you're dizzy when lying down strongly suggests vertigo and when it goes this long, with hearing loss and tinnitus, it is extremely likely to be Menier's. A repeat MRI of the brain later might yield some further insight into the possibility of MS, but right now it seems to be at best a marginal possibility (and is often difficult to diagnose for long periods of time). Meanwhile you need the troublesome symptoms to be treated, and I can't understand why that hasn't been done. It should be noted that the initial episode may have featured numbness and tremors because vertigo (and especially Menier's) often trigger an acute anxiety response that includes hyperventilation (often unrealized by the patient) with subsequent tremor, numbness and even severe carpal spasm and faintness.  This is not meant to imply anxiety is at the bottom of this, only that it can be a prominent complication of it and will often blur the issue. The MRI information is virtually meaningless at this point, but it should be repeated within six months of the first one, for purposes of comparison. Frequently, odd as it may seem, doctors will only read the imaging report and not actually see the films. They have this much faith in the radiologist's readings, for better or worse, and sometimes this is actually an advantage because they are not always nearly as good at reading the films. Strange, but true.   I do hope this is helpful. I'm glad to learn the problem  has improved and may be resolving. I still believe at least meclazineshould be tried to help resolve most of the remaining symptoms. If you can't find generic, at least you should be able to find either Dramamine Less Drowsy formula or Bonine, both being brand names of meclazine.   Please follow up with us here as needed and again, I hope this is helpful.  Goood luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Is it normal to have pain a year after bypass surgery?",
    "content": "I am a 37 year old woman who has coronary artery disease.  I had a mild heart attack in March of 2008 followed by  a triple bypass March 28, 2008.   Since the surgery I have been experiencing off and on pain in either my chest, the top of my arm, the shoulder blade, and in my wrist.  I know the wrist sounds weird but I never had \"typical\" heart attack symptoms.  I had an almost constant burning in my chest for over a year no matter what I ate (or if I ate).  I was tired but other than those two things I really didn't have any other symptoms.  The night that I had my heart attack my chest burned really, really bad (like really bad indigestion and I wouldn't have thought anything of it had it not been for the fact that the bones in my wrist hurt so bad I couldn't move my hand or my arm.   I went to the ER three days later because my chest was still burning and the wrist was still really sore.  The cardiac enzymes showed a heart attack.   I had a cardiac cath which showed three blockages.  They couldn't stent them so they did bypass.  Since the bypass I have had pain off and on in my chest on the left side.  It isn't the burning like I had before - it is more like pain but it really hurts.  Nothing I do takes care of it.  I have tried OTC medications, Bengay and nitro.  The nitro MIGHT ease it just a little but not much.  Some times my shoulder blade or the top of my arm hurts with it.  The bones in my wrist will ache sometimes as well but it isn't as intense as it was the night I had my heart attack.     My cardiologist seems to think all of this is muscular related but it is scaring me.  I have had EKGS ran since the surgery and they came back normal.  Before the surgery the EKG showed an inverted T wave (whatever that is).   I had a stress test done a couple of weeks ago and passed it.  The only thing noted was that I had a \"hypertensive response\" but I think that was because I was told not to take my BP medication before the test.  I am not putting much confidence in the stress test because a week before my bypass I jogged almost a mile when my car broke down and never felt a thing in my chest so...  I have also had an ECHO done because in addition to the CAD I have a leaking valve that was not fixed during the surgery.  The cardiologist had said it is only leaking mildly.  I did not go to cardiac rehab after because at the time I didn't have insurance.  The cardiologist thinks this might be part of the problem.  My question is:  can pain a year after the surgery still be muscular?  The cardiologist said that the next step is another cardiac cath.  I don't want to go through that again if I don't have to, but I don't want to take the chance of not doing it if there is a problem.  The pain is NOT exactly like it was before but I have a hard time determing if what I am feeling is angina or muscle pain.   If anyone can enlighten me as to how long muscle pain lasts or if I should have another cath I would appreciate it.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it normal to have pain a year after bypass surgery?",
    "content": "Hi there --  Your question is a very good one, and deserves a thoughtful answer. I'll try to give you that. While  your symptoms at present are not the same as what you felt before and  during your heart attack, and while it is possible to have pain (not muscle pain necessarily, but sometimes nerve pain) for this long post CABG, it seems to me at least suspicious enough to warrant a thallium scan stress test (unless that's what you had -- you only mention \"stress test\" as in stress test, plain).  A plain stress test is not nearly as useful as one with nuc scan, and is still less invasive than an angiogram. If your doctor isn't willing to go the half-step to do this and clear the air, then I guess either a  second opinion or an angiogram are your two best alternatives,  because what you describe would raise some flags for me, especially in a woman,  since women usually do have atypical cardiac pain, as opposed to men, whose \"classic\" pattern dominates all the textbooks. The reason for that is that for ages men were considered to be by far the more likely gender to develop heart disease, and women were pretty much discounted, even though they have it every bit as often as men, only usually later, unlike you, who are one of those exceptions that just disproves the rule.    I do think there's sufficient cause to look further, and while I certainly understand -- and empathize with -- your desire to avoid an angiogram, it may be the best way to clear this up.  Women also develop heart disease sometimes in different patterns than men, too -- more small vessel disease, which is more difficult to spot without more invasive testing. However, I do think a stress test with nuclear scan would make the most sense -- again, unless that's what was done recently. Oh, and the pre-surgery inverted T-wave,  while sometimes a \"normal abnormality\" can also betray cardiac  ischemia, which it probably did in your case. It's a matter of how deeply it is inverted. Many people have flipped T-waves that mean nothing, but deeply inverted usually means something more is going on. The absence of this doesn't  mean there's nothing going on, either, though. While it's likely all is well and the pains may be due to nerve injury from the surgery, the only way you can really relax is to have some tests done that are fairly cut and dried,  and I think yuo deserve that much at least.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed,  and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I am a paramedic who underwent a triple CABG in 2002.  Since that time, I have had pretty much continuous chest pain which is best described as a feeling of having a lump in the left side of my chest or like someone sitting on my chest.  I have had a left side - right side heart cath, two left side caths, two nuclear stress tests (physical treadmill test) as well as four echos over the years and ischemia has been ruled out as the cause.  The nuclear stress test has demonstrated no perfusion defects and an ejection fraction (the strength of my heart's contraction in the ventricles) at 67%.  The best guess by several, and I do mean several, cardiologists is that it is \"chest wall pain\" most likely caused by the traumatic nature of open heart surgery.  They do refer to it as \"atypical\" since the duration has been so long.  However, I come to realize that it is something that I have to live with.  I might add that it is unrelated to exercise and, in fact, often abates during exercise.  I continue to work as a paramedic and live an active lifestyle.  It is indeed wise to consult a physician about this condition but I wanted to share my experience with you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 90% + blockage in LAD and RCA",
    "content": "Hi there --  Your mom should, first of all, get cardiology clearance for making the trip. It  would probably be fine, assuming she's been stable up til now, but it's just the 8-10 hours in the air with no place to pull over that is of concern.   It's not even certain (though it it likely) that she'll need either bypass surgery or angioplasty with stenting. If she's well enough to consider making this trip she may be relatively asymptomatic, and if so she may have developed significant collateral blood supply, a sort of homemade bypass some  hearts develop on their own and which makes the question of invasive corrections less urgent sometimes.   Since she has 90 per cent blockage in two of the major arteries, her coronary anatomy would determine which approach might work better. If the affected vessels are pretty straight, angioplasty may be preferable, although bypass tends to last longer (statistically) and  provides more concrete results, One recent study has found neither improves most outcomes over managing things medically, but when there's almost no room left as now, it's kind of a tossup, since most thoracic surgeons prefer to not do fewer than three. That LAD really needs to be opened up if there's no collateral flow, though.   Recovery time post bypass is anywhere from a few weeks to a few months, depending on the individual and unforseen complications. Post angioplasty is usually a matter of days into weeks.   Again, cardiac clearance from a cardiologist, specifically for the flight,  would be wise. Also, if she's symptom free, it's a better bet that nothing will happen during that half-day it takes (roughly) to get here from the UK.   I hope this is helpful. It's definitely and deliberately a little vague, because there's a lot we don't know about your mom's situation. If you can fill in the picture more,  there's still some  time before the flight. Hope this is hlpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Hopefully there was just something lost in translation, because that's an awful way to describe the outlook for a discharged heart attack patient. I'll try to give you a little clearer explanation, even without knowing the particulars.   Your dad had a heart attack -- myocardial infarction (MI). This means part of the heart muscle died. That's what a heart attack -- MI -- is. Myocardium is the heart muscle. Infarction is the death of living tissue. Every heart attack that isn't aborted results in some dead cardiac muscle. How much and where are the important things I don't know, but I do know your dad was sent home after recovering from the MI and pneumonia (the latter being a common complication of MI, so don't feel too concerned about that). The usual follow up therapy consists of rest, graduated exercise, dietary changes as appopriate, and sometimes medication to lower cholesterol and often a beta blocker to reduce workload on the heart early on.   Depending on the amount of actual damage (scarring) the heart may or may not have to work harder.  Cardiac rehab is one of the most effective ways of getting the heart built up to utilize what working muscle is left. Sometimes it's a lot (we're blessed with more heart muscle than we usually need) and sometimes it's just a tiny scar. The heart, depending on the location of the injury, can often accomodate a pretty large amount of damage and still work very well, assuming the disease process is slowed or reversed, and often there is \"nothing more to do\" because that's all that's required. But to put it in those terms can certainly be  unnerving and if that's how it was trasmitted to you, it was very clumsy.   I hope this is helpful. If you have any more specific information I could help you interpret the prognosis better, but given what I know so far, your dad survived the acute episode and pneumonia and now will start doing things to ensure the remaining heart muscle will serve him well for a good long time.  Please follow up withus as needed. Good luck to you and to your dad.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your current pain does sound like probable costochondritis, there are several reasons I feel you need to get this checked right away anyway. First, you have a very serious family history risk factor for heart disease. Second, you state that although you don't like to use the ntg spray due to the headaches it causes (and I can empathize with you on  that), it does seem to work when you use it, which suggests at least some of the pain may be cardiovascular in nature. There's also that blood pressure issue and the weight problem. FInally, six weeks is entirely too long to have to wait for results of an important clinical test when those results are generally available by the next day.   There's also that ever-present possibility of more than one thing going on at the same time and clouding the picture.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Sharp pains in chest reminiscent of electric shock",
    "content": "I'm a 36 year old woman who is experiencing what feel like electric shocks or stabbing type pains on the left side of my chest.  Most pains are located just below the breast, or run right across the left breast from the center of the chest.  These are the most common ones and can occur, randomly, between 20-30 times a day.  Only once did I have a similar pain start below the breast, to the left of the breast, mid rib cage.  It shot up to my armpit and down the inside of my left arm to my elbow and was much sharper than the most recent pains.  It lasted about 30 seconds and then dissapated.  Most of the \"shock\" pains last about 5 seconds and disappear.  I can't physically do anything to reproduce the pains... they just come and go when I least expect it.  Today, a very sharp pain woke me out of a sound sleep.  Other symptoms I have been experiencing lately is lethargy, and anxiety due to what's been happening.  I work out regulary (bodybuilding and cardio since age 29) and have had to stop because my heart rate becomes very hard and fast just running up a flight of stairs after doing something as simple as laundry.  I don't take any bodybuilding supplements or take anything out of the ordinary that would cause any of this.  I've also been feeling a little lightheaded as of late, but that seems to come and go.  I typically have the blood pressure and heart rate of a 12 year old, but lately have been experiencing a boost in both.  Daily caffiene intake consists of two 6 oz cups of coffee in the morning, and pretty little else.  I have had an EKG which came back normal, and am waiting on the results of an ECG, which the guy that did the exam said looked and sounded pretty normal, but ultimately, I would have to wait for the cardiologists to make the final call after they viewed it.  To me, these don't feel like anxiety attacks.  I've had those before and am very familiar with the feeling in the chest of tightness, sweats, dizziness, feeling of difficulty breathing, etc... but never have I felt these sharp stab/shock pains.  Could this be a blood flow issue to the heart?  Am I on the brink of a potential heart attack?  I don't sleep well due to the fear of not waking up should one of these not be just a little pain, but something more severe.  Any advice, or direction that I should be looking in, would be most appreciated.  It's frustrating becuase the NP who has been helping me with this matter seems to almost be getting \"annoyed\" because anything she does for tests, all come back normal.  I think she thinks I'm a hypochondriac.  I'm not.  I spent the better part of three years avoiding doctors because I didn't have insurance.  Now that I do, I'm just trying to get a few things straightened out that have been of concern to me.  Thanks in advance for any help that can be offered.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sharp pains in chest reminiscent of electric shock",
    "content": "Hello -  The good news is that cardiovascular-based pains never feel like that. They may follow the same general pathway, but heart pain is rarely even described as \"pain\", and is never sudden, sharp and fleeting. This sounds like a nerve problem,  a neuralgia or possibly herpetic pain (caused by a nerve inflamed by a virus, usually herpes simplex). It's certainly not \"all  in your head.\" In fact it seems to be in  your left chest mostly. Healthcare providers sometimes become frustrated when they can't hang a diagnosis on something, and  neuralgia in this pathway is fairly unusual, but so long as it retains its present character it's unlikely to involve the heart in any way. Also, cardiac pain (or pressure, squeezing, whatever passes for \"pain\" in a given individual) rarely occurs in the left chest either, but usually begins beneath the sternum in the center of the chest, then begins to radiate out to one or both shoulders, the neck, throat and jaw, and down one or both (either/or) arm/s.   A nerve in the heart pain pathway,perhaps the phrenic nerve, sounds as though it is irritated or inflamed. Again, this is often due to a passing virus,  sometimes for reasons that never become fully clear before the thing resolves. If it becomes disruptive there are medications to help block this sort of pain, but the \"shock\" type doesn't usually last too long. The lethargy and lightheadedness could also be attributable to a viral infection. These, of course, are difficult to ID unless they produce enough specific symptoms (like a rash along the course of the nerve involved, which seems unlikely in this instance but still could happen).   Once you've ruled out cardiac involvement (and you should, no question) if this continues, you may need a referral to a neurologist to get to the bottom of the cause or at least find a way to medically manage it. Neuralgia-like pain can be so disruptive as to be disabling if it becomes chronic.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed and update us after you get the cardiologist's reading of  the EKG.\n\n",

I went to the doctors and was told that they don't think its a problem with my heart and was asking me about stresses in my life which i havent really got any.    My syptoms are:  -Uncomfortable feelings in left side of chest now and then. -Slight tinglin and tightening in left hand.  I have been fine all day but it just starts when it wants and sometimes is worse when im eating and ive just been drinking alot of water all day to try feel better. I am 24 year old and im a binman so im very active and go gym 5 times a week and do alot of cardio.  Sometimes i get slight feelings in my chest in the week but hardly.  I get quite paranoid after ive felt it once and its hard to shake off unless I eventually get to sleep which is a hard job.  I can see my stomach basically beating like my heart because must be beating hard and if I try and sleep I can usually feel heartbeating in my head and its really annoying me.    Ive read same sort of symptons and seen that its palpitations and its common and isnt life threatening but obviously abit disturbing.  Is that right or should i go back to doctors?  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest problems day after drinking alcohol",
    "content": "Hello -  If you're having palpitations with this, that would make a lot of sense. Some people do note a lot of palpitations (and accompanying chest discomfort) after drinking, and sometimes it's actually a sustained arrhythmia called atrial fibrillation. Most times, though, it's just isolated premature heartbeats. This is the likely explanation, but of course it's impossible to know this for sure without being your being examined to have other things ruled out.   Still, while heavy drinking can, over time, damage the heart muscle, you're too young to have done this sort of damage as yet. You most likely are having some heartbeat irregularities, which are common anyway, and can be much increased by intake of alcohol.  That being said, you should at least have a routine electrocardiogram (EKG) done, just to be certain you don't have some obscure genetic problem and aren''t causing yourself a more serious problem (atrial fibrillation, while not in and of itself harmful, if sustained for long periods can lead to formation of clots resulting in stroke). It would be reasonable for your doctor to at least do an EKG when you present with chest discomfort and palpitations. These are also very often associated with stress and anxiety, so it's not an unreasonable question; but all the most serious things should be ruled out up front. It sounds like you tolerate heavy exercise quite well, so it's probably just something caused by the drinking. It would still be nice to know exactly what, if anything, is happening. If there's nothing then you might want to take the next step and look at stress, anxiety and other emotional issues. First things first, though.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: uncomfortable blocked, electric feeling in chest",
    "content": "Hello -  The sensation you describe sounds a lot like it could be caused by GERD, and it definitely doesn't sound like even atypical cardiac pain. It's actually helpful that you know what angina feels like to you, as this can help you determine what's not going on, at least.   You wouldn't be able to literally and directly feel your blocked artery, as the pains caused by that are referred to other nearby areas (and  sometimes not so nearby), and are usually a dull, waxing and waning discomfort.  But you already know best how you'd describe them, and this doesn't feel like that. Cardiac pain is almost never  sharp or stabbing. GERD pain can feel just like angina or it can cause a lot of other, more varied sensations. What you describe seems likely related to that.   Needless to say, if you experience anything new in terms of symptoms that come on with exertion and go away at rest, or if you experience angina of the type you're already familiar with, you should notify your doctor right away or, if it's significantly different (more severe in particular), just dial 9-1-1 and let the ER figure out what's going on. Never hesitate if you're in doubt. However, so far, what you describe does not sound at all like cardiac pain.  I hope this is helpful. Take care of yourself and stay in  touch with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Weak heart",
    "content": "Hello -  Your father does have several major risk factors for heart disease and stroke, so it's not too surprising these things have happened. The problems now are, first, to help his heart to work more efficiently and to increase the left ventricular  ejection fraction, which is what that 30% means. The left ventricle is pushing out 30% of  the blood in the chamber with each beat. It should be at least 45-50 per cent. Because of this he is at increased risk of dangerous heartbeat abnormalities, so he may be given an implantable defibrillator. Some weakend hearts actually have been successfully strengthened by use of a special type of pacemaker, but it's not the approach of first choice. Medication and other therapies may help get this output to increase.  Pneumonia is one of the most common problems seen in ICU patients in general, and especially in patients who have had bypass surgery. They will need to make sure his lungs are filling with air (that he is  able to breathe fully and adequately). As his chest heals this should improve, but for now they may give him a device to help him practice deep breathing.   Post bypass patients also are very commonly anxious and depressed (sad) so this is fairly normal. Hopefully as the days pass and if he begins to improve, this also should improve. A positive outlook may be difficult under these circumstances, but it is essential to his recovery. I hope you can help him to look on the positive side of things (he's had two of his coronary arteries repaired, for instance, and his  heart may grow  stronger with time, slowly advanced activity and medication).   It is always difficult to see a loved one in such a situation, but it's very good that you spend time with your father now.  Understand that his mood is normal for this situation and it should improve. Let's hope that with proper therapies he regains some more  of his normal heart function, as he can then build  upon that.   I hope this is helpful to you. My best to you and  to your father. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

At the beginning of August, as part of my work (I am a senior youth worker for the international YMCA movement), I spent 10 manic days managing a stage area working exceedingly hard and working excessively long hours from early morning until way past midnight at an international YMCA Festival in Prague, Czech Republic, with few breaks, missed meals and insufficient/unsuitable food and insufficient hydration.   At the end of the Festival just as I was preparing to relax for a couple of days when POP! the left side of my face went numb. I was taken to the hospital and underwent a CT Scan and carotid ultrasound, MRI, ECG and other tests. My blood pressure was 170/110. I was diagnosed as having had a TIA.   Back home in the UK I am in the system and in the care of the stroke medicine team at my local hospital and (one month later) on a regime of aspirin 75mg, Ramipril 2.5mg (increased dosage), Diprydamole 200mg(x2), Simvastatin 40mg.  My blood pressure is remaining stubbornly elevated.  My question is  Now that I am back home, and given my history of normal blood pressure, why hasn't my blood pressure come down naturally now that I am out of the extremely stressful environment of the Festival?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Sometimes some  event serves as a trigger to set off or aggravate an underlying condition which can cause the  blood pressure to become and remain elevated. This seems to be what happened with you. It can be something as simple as overwork which flips that \"switch.\" The literal switch is called a barostat, and we all come equipped with a pair of them. They can be \"reset\" sometimes by prolonged stress. You also could have an adrenal tumor, which simply means there is more adrenaline going into your bloodstream at any given time, and this could have been \"switched\" on by the stressful period. These are not readily reversible things. Sometimes, over time and with proper medication,  the problem will resolve, at least for a while. If it is due to a tumor it can sometimes be corrected by surgery. The baroreceptor problem may soon be able to be  corrected in some patients by a device not unlike a pacemaker. Then again, you may just have developed essential hypertension that was programmed into your future by your genes. That would mean medication to control it.   Meanwhile,the first order of business is to control the blood pressure so as to avoid any future  full-blown stroke, and to also manage the stress which may have triggered the hypertension. One thing at a time, and first order of business is to prevent a stroke, which means controlling the hypertension. Then there is time to work on the \"why\".   I hope this has been helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 44 year old female. I have also had a past history of normal to a little below normal blood pressure readings. However, I was injured at work a few days ago and while at the hospital my blood pressure was 166/?. I don't remember what the bottom reading was. I thought it may have just been the trauma but today I went to the Dr for a follow-up visit and while my blood pressure had gone down, the top number was still at 133. My last annual checkup was in september and my blood pressure was fine. My cholesterol is fantastic, says my dr. At that time she told me that with my blood pressure and chol. that I had a very low risk of heart disease. I do smoke and that is a big negative. I have no family history of blood pressure problems. I do not drink and I am on no medications. My question is, why has my blood pressure gone up so fast and so high. I tried to call my dr today to ask but I coudnt reach her. Should I be alarmed by this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dailyn -  The most likely explanation is something that's buried in my answer to the previous poster. Many people, when in the ER or otherwise involved in an unexpected emergency (or just painful) situation may note a marked increase in blood pressure. Most people have some rather dramatic variations in pressure during the course of a day, depending upon what's going on at the time, and most of these go unnoticed because most people aren't checking their blood pressure on a regular basis. You're right to check yours since you got a high reading at the hospital, but hospitals are often very stressful places to be, and those who's bodies react to stress with increased cardiac output are sometimes called \"hot reactors.\" This same phenomenon is what's at work in \"white coat syndrome.\" While you apparently don't have this problem, you may still have been feeling a little bit \"energized\" by being in a clinical setting. In both cases the attending personnel (or doctor in the second case) should have rechecked multiple times to see if your BP settled down over the course of each visit. When a pressure appears that's inconsistent with a known patient (as in the case of you at your doctor's office) or a higher-than-acceptable pressure shows up (as with your hospital visit) the standard practice is, at the doctor's office, to recheck later in the visit to see if the pressure has dropped to a more \"friendly\" level. In the ER setting the standard of care is to check a patient's BP at a certain set interval (one is usually there a couple hours at least, usually longer) and record those readings. Early ER readings are often quite high in people with no problem, due to the trauma, as you mentioned.   Smoking, by the way, will eventually cause a slow but progressive increase in BP, and can cause spikes as well. That's all the sermon you'll get from me on that. :)  Sometimes when something like this happens it seems to flip a \"switch\" in the regulating system (as I think I mentioned in replying to the earlier poster) and this may sometimes stay \"on\" for a while. In a few it winds us marking the onset of a diagnosable blood pressure problem, but in your case it would seem your doctor (or you) should probably just recheck your pressure a few times, at random intervals, to see if it's normalized. It takes three consecutive resting readings higher than 140/90 on different occasions to even start thinking seriously about possible medical treatment. Since your history has been pretty much spotless, and since your doctor's office reading was only marginally high (\"normal\" would be anywhere from 140/90 on down to the point where you'd be suffering from low BP symptoms). It should have be rechecked, but probably due to that excellent history it was taken as within normal limits (WNL) and will be compared with a reading the next time you happen to be there. If you have the opportunity to check yours (at home or on a drugstore machine) you may find, depending on your level of relaxation, prior activity, state of mind, etc., it may be closer to what's normal for you (generally that would run between 100 - 120/60 - 88).   I hope this helps. Please bear in mind that if you're the least bit anxiety prone, concern about this could cause it to be higher than in the past every time you have it checked because you'll be thinking about it specifically. This isn't an \"all in your head\" answer, it's just the way our regulating mechanism works.   Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 20 yearold female and for the past 2-3 months i've been having worrying symptoms.  I'n my family so far everyone from my mums side of the family has died from a heart attack. We also have a history of diabetes, lung & breast cancer.  It started off as what i thought was indegestion but then after taking many meds and weeks gone by i realised it just had to be something else.  I'll use the most extremt example of what happened..  Was sitting at home relaxing watching tv as normal when I felt my heart starting to \"flutter\". It was very strong and i was having to lean over for about 2 mins to deal with the feeling- aswell as taking quick breaths. Afterwards my chest (in the middle to left side) seriously starting hurting very bad and within 5 mins my left arm had gone numb and i got what i can only describe as shooting pain in my left shoulder so i shouted on my mother. By the time she got upstaires i almost fainted so she called an Ambulance. After them telling me it must have been \"nothing\" i went to the doctor to get a second opinion. I explain this happens alot so so i had a stress test  which came back fine and this is also not anxiety related. I also went for an ECG scan, but during i tried to explain it wouldnt show anything as i wasnt having one of my attacks at the time, and as expected it didnt. Im now worried by doctor thinks im putting this on as he seems to disregard all the symptoms i list to him aswell as my family history. I would just like some advice on maybe what to do or what this could be as the pains are now more frequent and hurting more and i would like to know what this is asap!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest pain with left arm going numb",
    "content": "Hello -  I can well understand your concern, especially with the positive family history for heart disease. While there may be something going on that involves your heart, I don't think it is ischemic disease. First, even in the classic few families where heart disease is rampant, age 20 is pretty young  (those families often have members who develop significant disease by their 30s, which is still awfully young compared with the general population). This does not mean you can''t have heart disease, but it does make it less likely. There's more arguing against ischemic disease, however. For one thing, you've had a stress test, EKG, and possibly (it's not entirely clear from your post) a nuclear scan of the heart. At any rate, you've certainly done enough to elicit any symptoms that would be caused by ischemia. So what could this be? There are several possilities. First, you might have mitral valve prolapse (MVPS) or at least MVP syndrome, which is often documented without proof of actual prolapse.  People  who suffer from this relatively benign disorder often have palpitations such as you describe (as do most of us, but MVP-ers tend to have them even more); they also often have atypical chest pain (\"stabbing\" is usually not a descriptor used by people having a heart attack); they often have combinations of symptoms (which is what a syndrome is) that include lightheadedness or faintness, anxiety (you seem to have ruled this out, but the patient is often the last one to recognize or acknowlege anxiety -- strange, but very true); finally, they often have fatigue, shortness of breath or other symptoms, but yet tolerate excercise very well. So this is one possibility. You would need to have an echocardiogram to know with any certainty, and sometimes this, as mentioned above, does not show up the prolapse anyway,  although if you get lucky it will.   Since I'm not willing to write this off to MVP, which is one of the most common benign heart abnormalities (actually considered a variation of normal by some doctors because it is so common), I'll give you a second possibility, less likely, but still possible: coronary artery spasm. In this sort of event, which can be totally random but usually occurs occasionally (and in some patients even on a daily basis), one artery supplying the heart muscle can go into spasm and nearly close itself off. It usually lasts from 5-20 minutes, rarely any longer, and during the acute episode the EKG often appears to show an infarct in progress, only to return to normal as the episode subsides. While this is far more rare than MVP, it is also more common than generally thought, but is often difficult to catch and prove. The symptoms are similar to heart attack, but the pain is usually quite a bit more severe than in a textbook heart  attack, in which pain is substernal, insidious, and usually described as pressure or squeezing. This problem can be diagnosed by more invasive methods than an echocardiogram, usually by performing a cardiac catheterization, during which a substance is introduced into the heart via catheter or IV line, which will provoke spasm in an artery which is already prone to this. A positive result strongly suggests coronary artery spasm (generally known in medical circles as Prinzmetal's angina). This is then treated medically, with drugs, sometimes the same family that is used in stubborn MVP syndrome, although with the latter it is preferred that no medication be prescribed unless the symptoms  are consistently and severly disruptive of the patient's life. In the case of Prinzmetal's angina it is more important to try and prevent the episodes, as they can, though rarely, cause actual damage.  So then: your first step would be to determine if you have MVP and/or MVP syndrome, with or without anxiety as a complicating factor. This is the most likely answer, and is most common in otherwise healthy young females. The spasm problem usually (not always) occurs starting in the 30s and more males have it than females. If you have MVP syndrome (with or without proven prolapse), you may be prescribed a type of drug called  a beta blocker, which usualy helps prevent the kinds of episodes you described, or at least makes the symptoms  more mild. If anxiety is found to be complicating the issue, an anti-anxiety drug may also be added. Usually, though, cardiologists prefer to avoid medicating the patient if possible.   I hope this is of some help to you and perhaps eases your mind some. Please follow up with us as needed,  and let us know if you've had an echocardiogram already, as well as a nuclear scan. Good luck to you. Stay in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Background:  39 yo, female, 50# overweight, FHx Heart Dse (Father) Hypothyroid since 1999, on Synthroid Hx 2 gall bladder attacks 3 years ago immediately after fatty meals, unresolved A lot of family stress due to adult teen rebellion A lot of occupational stress due to new job involving weekly out of state travel 4 days missed Synthroid dose (last week) - temporarily lost meds   In a busy evening of clothes shopping with family I neglected proper hydration and hadn't eaten in several hours, so my husband and I shared a caffienated chocolate bar and went on with shopping.  About 30 minutes later I began to experience a little racing heart rate and deep sternal pain which radiated to my back.  It worsened so I promptly found my husband and sat down for a few minutes then decided to lay flat in our car until he was done.  We proceeded to the ER. I was quite emotional and anxious. My EKG showed \"T wave abnormality\", CXR was normal, CT Angiogram normal (r/o pulm emboli caused by frequent travel), CMP/CK/Myoglobin/TroponinI were all within normal range except Potassium and Calcium I noticed were on the low value of normal which I attributed to dehydration.  My urine was very concentrate at that time (gold).  I was given fluids by IV and we waited for time to pass for repeat CK/Myoglobin/TroponinI.  Second EKG showed \"T wave abnormality - consider anterior ischemia\".  After fluids urine was very dilute (clear).  The repeat CK/Myoglobin/TroponinI were normal and we deduced together that this must have been a nasty Gall Bladder attack that radiated and presented unexpectedly 24 hours after a high fat meal, but only 30 minutes after chocolate.  I have been instructed to take a baby ASA daily, rx'd nitrostat to have on hand and to schedule to see a Cardiologist.  But this doesnt explain the EKG findings...nor if the K+ and Calcium were significant.   Did the pain cause the Anxiety/Stress or did my Anxiety/Stress cause a heart problem?   Could this heart finding on my EKG have been caused by dehydration, stress, and/or missing 4 days of synthroid?   I have traveled this week and am not optimistic about getting in to see a Cardiologist quickly due to my travel schedule.  Should this be considered urgent?  My pain is gone since the episode originally occurred and I am eating small fat-free meals under the assumtion that this was a gall bladder attack. I understand that this may not be enough information but your opinion(s) and tips would be appreciated.  Thanks,  CRP\n\n",

    "title": "Re: T wave abnormality",
    "content": "Hello -  Thank you, first, for a fairly comprehensive report of the episode and the immediate findings. It's a lot more than we usually get to work with.   While there is a history of cholecystitis and this could  have accounted for all the symptoms (along with some dehydration), there is also the family history of heart disease, which cannot be overlooked, especially with the neatly overlapped classic cardiac symptoms and T-wave abnormality. It's not much, but it is enough to make a case for you to be seen by a cardiologist first, and take care of business-as-usual second. It's just not worth the risk.   Women often present with atypical heart symptoms, but when the present with classic ones that shouldn't be considered somehow \"outside the box.\" While there is a very good chance this episode was a combination of chocolate-incited cholecystitis and some dehydration (and yes, the latter certainly could account for the T-wave abnormality, especially if it was flattened or flipped), one's gallbladder is a good deal more forgiving than the heart when something goes wrong, which is underlined by the fact that if the gallbladder goes bad enough, it can be removed and thrown away. That doesn't apply to the heart, which, once damaged, stays damaged.  Stress also may have played a part.  It sounds from the lab results as though you have no damage as yet, and of course you may not have any heart disease at all. But the symptoms and the EKG do, in my humble opinion, warrant making the time for a visit with a cardiologist.  If your heart is, in fact, fine, you can go about your business free from anxiety and uncertainty.   Best of luck to you. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While T-wave inversion is a common, and often non-specific finding on EKG in otherwise healthy people,  finding it in a single lead, along with symptoms (even atypical symptoms such as you have experienced) makes it suspicious. The fact that the stress test was equivocal but the nuclear scan was negative leaves you still wondering if you do, in fact, have heart disease. Since you also have some risk factors for heart disease (specifically diabetes and smoking) as well as these unclear findings, your best chance of knowing for sure what's going on would be to have an angiogram, where the doctor could see, with certainty, if there is any significant disease or not, and if so, at that time, likely correct it by stent placement. If there were none on angiogram then you could relax, knowing your cardiac anatomy is normal and the pains are from some other cause.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of  luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: abdominal aorta - severe pain and palpatation",
    "content": "Hi there -  Since your hemorrhagic cyst was located on the left, it would seem logical that sequalae would occur in that region also. The angiogram no doubt was aimed toward the region where the cyst had been, which would likely involved one of the smaller arteries feeding the ovary. And that was quite a huge cyst you had, so there is no doubt some change to the blood supply where it was. You don't mention your age, which is also usually a factor in abdominal aortic aneurism. If you're under 60 it is far less likely in general.   The \"hook\" shape you describe could be quite normal,  depending upon where it's located in the scan. Unfortunately, so far there's no uploaded picture, but I think you can rest fairly easy that this isn't due to an aortic aneurism, although it could be something going on with a secondary vessel on the left side -- and that is just a wild guess. More likely there is some nerve injury from the original cyst and/or surgery.  You mention palpitation in the heading but not in the body of your post. I'll just say that if that's what you actually meant (instead of palpation, or manual probing of the area and feeling something in the abdomen that feels \"wrong\"), palpitations are not in any way directly associated with or a symptom of aortic aneurism.  The pictures might be helpful. Knowing your age would be even more helpful. All that said, I  still seriously doubt you have an aneurism, but a simple ultrasound could rule that in or out and rule in or out any other structural problem as well.  I  hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

It never really gets bad, and most times it just feels like someone is gently pushing on my chest. Imagine like a cat or something lying on my chest when im lying down, thats sort of like what it feels like.   In addition, I have been having this weird pain in my back sort of middle right side. Its a pain that I only have in the morning and it only happens when I breath deeply. I have been to the doctor and she thinks its muscular because it goes away for the most part once i'm up and active.   I also have been experiencing what I can only describe as momentary hot flashes or power surges down through my arms. THey never hurt, they're just kinda wierd.   I don't think i have any family history of heart disease or anything like that. I have just had a physical exam and the results were normal with nothing appearing out of order. When I was younger, I had an EKG, and echo, etc. and also wore a holter monitor because I always would complain of feelings like my heart was skipping a beat. The doctors all said that it was just normal heart rythms that I was obsessing over and not to worry about it.   anyway, anybody have any insight? What should I do?  concerned Jason\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jason,  What you describe doesn't really sound like  it is heart-related, but of course you want to be certain. One thing that argues against it being your heart is the constant discomfort; another is the fact that the  back pain can be reproduced by breathing (never a heart problem). What it does sound like,  in fact, is possible  asthma, which can present insidiously, causing a sense of tightness or pressure in the chest as well as causing sorness in the auxiliary muscles (which often are affected in the back as well as the base of the neck). The sensation going down your arms is unclear as to origin, and I  generally subscribe to the conservative approach,  meaning rule out the serious stuff first. For that reason  you might want to have an EKG done, just to be sure there's no atypical heart symptom showing itself here, but I feel, based on the description of the thoracic symptoms that you could have new asthma (or perhaps bronchitis, even). Then again, it could all be muscular.   Once you've ruled out the biggest concerns, the lesser ones don't seem quite so worrisome.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "hi,  I am a typical Indian boy of 24. I am 6'2\" and weigh about 120 kilos(240 pounds). I used to be an average smoker. (about 10 ultra-mild cigarettes a day, now ihave quit though). I have never eaten anything non-vegetarian. I rarely drink. I am a very \"karma-aware\" person too.I am not a fitness freak but I do walk a lot and take a lot of stairs ( I would probably climb 11 floors a day 3-3-1-1-1-1-1). About two months ago I sweated profusely in an airconditioned bus ( i never bothered about it, because I am a little nauseated(?)/uneasy while in a bus and have puked in 3 out 4 cases where I have taken a bus) .. and then over a couple of days I was having a sense of muscle pain in my chest (left side)(nothing new, has happened quite a few times) so I thought I could exercise a little. I did Some skipping, stretching and pushups, I lied down to relax, and then there was shooting pain all over my chest. Then I had pain starting from my underarms going up to my middle finger ( pain as if one nerve is being pulled, kind of ). since I had just exercised i couldnt differentiate between excessive sweating. I started feeling a bit uneasy. Suddenly I started to burp and fart and then I puked. I felt tremendous pain all over my chest while puking. I just had a cup of tea and a biscuit 15 minutes before I started my exercise.  I just lied down. Later went to a surgeon near my house. I had a BP of 140/100. He advised me to take a stamlo Beta and to take rest and later in the evening I had a Lipid profile and an ECG taken, as per the docs advise.  the next day evening I went to a Cardiologist and he again took a ECG and an echo and said I had a Myocardial infarction and my right ventricle was affected ( he said typically people have their left one infarcted). I was admitted into a hospital for observation and medication.Values for Lipid and Echo with time intervals :  ******** (total cholestrol was 160 mg/dl). exceptions were with triglyceride at 190 mg/dl (test within 24 hours of pain) and Triglycleride/HDL C.Ratio 4.75.

Myocardial infarction (attack) is always bad. It is a permanent damage to a specific part of the heart. Can I not exercise, smoke, have physical activity any longer ?  Exercise - Yes, after a period of rest and consulting with your cardiologist.  Smoking - Strict no  Physical activity - Yes How bright are my propects of more heart diseases) ?  Little more than rest of the population. So its important for you to be on regular medications.  I am due for an Angiogram very shortly. I think I will get itdone after taking medication for a month.  Angioplasty(stenting) yes or no - The decision will be taken only after the angiogram.  Kindly post the angio results too when done. The treatment should remain pretty much the same with little changes.   Important for you -   Serious weight reduction (i advice you to consult a dietecian too)  Maintaining BP, Blood Sugar (if elevated), Lipids within normal limits.  Cardioprotective drugs to prevent further episodes. I am now on medication of :  Clopigrel 75 mg(twice), Ecosprin 150 mg(once), Pantodac 40mg(once), Storvas 40mg(once), Covance 25 mg(once), Metoprolol 12. 5 mg(twice), Angispan TR 25 mg(twice).

Conditions like change in the lifestyle, genetic conditions like hyperlipidemia etc can cause early myocardial infarction. Its certainly not that rare. And definitely not impossible. I only smoked some cigs. thats it.  Its not that only smoking caused the damage. The damage is ultimately caused by combination of multiple factors. For your body, some cigs could be equivalent to 10 times more. in a month or two the heart muscle will regenerate and your heart shall be as it was before the attack happened. Is this not correct ?   The infarcted area is healed by fibrous tissue formation (scar). It takes few months to heal after which you can resume your normal activities.

    "title": "Re: heart attack at 24. How bad was it ?",
    "content": "Hello happybuddha-   Judging from the most recent tests I would give this interpretation: you have some evidence of coronary artery disease (although no specific measurements of any narrowings, if there were any -- and they'd need to be greater than 50 per cent to warrant consideration of an interventional procedure, if then). You do have a tendency, according to the report, to develop clots, which can cause heart attack if a clot lodges in an artery, but no clots of significant size were seen.   If the report did not find any left ventricular dysfunction and did not show evidence of any injury to the heart muscle (more easily seen, actually, on echocardiogram), then you may not have had a completed heart attack, although you may have had an acute myocardial infarction that was not completed because the clot dissolved before any damage was done.   It's also not necessarily true that \"any damage is bad.\"  It's not good, it's not something one wants, but assuming the heart disease process that caused the damage is under control and the damage was not great, then one can generally return to a perfectly normal life and functioning. It depends on how the left ventricle is affected by the scar that is left. If you had an incomplete heart attack then it's possible no scar (damage) occurred. What you need to do, at a minimum, is to maintain a healthy weight, eat low-fat, low sodium foods, drink plenty of fluids, and probably be placed on a cholesterol-lowering drug and perhaps a blood thinner like Plavix, since you have a tendency to make clots.   Assuming you are on the correct regimen it is entirely possible you could have a healthy, normal life. Just make sure you have a good cardiologist follow your problem  on a regular basis.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello DIane -   First, my apologies for the late response. I just found this post (don't know why it didn't show up for me earlier) and hope everything is well with your mom now.   Neck pain is one of a whole galaxy of atypical symptoms which can occur during a heart attack. This happens far more often in women than in men, though both can have atypical symptoms. The classic signs (which you obviously are quite familiar with) should never be ignored, of course, but especially in women  it is important to take note of odd things like difficult-to-localize pain or discomfort in the neck, jaw, throat, shoulder, arm or hand (especially the ulnar aspect of the wrist, the side nearest the pinkie finger). If the pain can be duplicated by movement it is probably not cardiac related, but if it seems to be independent and occurring for no apparent reason, it needs to be checked out. Thank goodness your mom was seen by a very thorough cardio team!  Hopefully as a result there was little to no lasting damage.   As for the lifestyle changes, they usually involve weight loss if needed, a graduated exercise program (preferably a medically supervised cardiac rehab program), and dietary changes. These are all usually things which would benefit anyone but are sometimes necessary post heart attack.   Now then: the Lipitor question. Statin drugs were once held somewhat suspect because they could possibly cause liver or muscle injury, but are now considered to be very safe for the vast majority of patients, and a routine blood test to check liver and muscle enzymes every six months can reassure everyone that nothing untoward is happening. On the off-chance that a random patient might  feel muscle aches, especially in one or both legs, the tests should be done, as this sometimes is an early sign of an unwanted side effect, but these are now found to be far more rare than previously thought. On the other  side of the equation, Lipitor (and other statin drugs) can dramatically alter the lipid profile, lowering overall cholesterol and especially low-density lipoproteins (LDL), which is crucial to heart health, especially in someone who has established heart disease. Some studies even suggest that Lipitor and other drugs of that family may actually reduce plaque already in the arteries. There is a widespread perception that Lipitor in particular is \"horrible\" but, in fact, doctors are beginning to recognize it is anything but. There are even implications for so many other sorts of side-benefits that it may someday soon become regarded as something like a vitamin. So please try and reassure your mom of the safety and  efficacy of this amazing drug.  And again, I hope your mom is by now doing well and hopefully will soon be back to her yard work,  which is probably one of the reasons she came through the initial episode so well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane,  You're very welcome. I'm happy to hear your mom is doing better. It can be a slow process for some people, depending on a lot of factors. The important thing is recognizing the positives, and also the managing of the disease that is now known to be present. Plavix is a great help in keeping blood flowing where it's needed.   By cardio therapy I assume you mean cardiac rehab, which is a tremendously positive step. Hopefully it helps set the tone for her future. It can be a life changing experience and a lot of fun, too.   As for your own cardiac health, you know there is a family history, so it would be well to be followed on a regular basis, but without undue anxiety or overconcern. If you have any lifestyle changes to make which would reduce your risk, then this is the perfect time to start implementing them.   I wish the best of health for both your mom and you. Thanks for the update.\n\n",

    "content": "Age 40, Non-Smoker/Non-Drinker, Non Exercising, Slightly Overweight (5'11\" - 195 lbs) - Family history of heart problems and high blood pressure.  Had a shoulder injury(or so I thought) at work.  Did not report it because of how negatively work looks at - on the job injuries.  Pain was a dull aching pain, varying in location from my left chest to left arm and left inner back.  Injury happened approx.7 weeks ago.  I nursed the injury thru to the Holidays, using my left arm as little as possible. (Very stressful, very physical factory type work) Went to a (GP) General Practioner Dr. 4 weeks later when I had time off due to the Holidays.  Upon my suggestion, the Dr. sent me for a Exercise Stress Test(no injection - just ECG and Exercise) and blood work.  The specialist reading the test let my GP know that the test showed Cardiac Ischemia.  The blood work showed high cholesterol:  Cholesterol 221 mg/DL Triglycerides 193 mg/DL      HDL Cholesterol 40 mg/DL LDL Cholesterol 142 mg/DL   The GP doesn't think that I had a heart attack, he said that he still thinks that it seems to be a shoulder problem, even though we can't find any area of direct pain.  However, he did put me on Cartia XT 120 mg (Cardizem) to lower my blood pressure and gave me Nitroglycerin to take if the pain gets worse.  He also said to take a baby aspirin (81mg) every day.  He said that my blood pressure was high.    Under the medication(Cardizem and aspirin) my blood pressure is: 149/95 with a heart rate of 59.  I tried to get my GP to do additional tests (possible xray or some sort of injection stress test), he did not send me for these because he still thinks it's possibly shoulder and the fact that he has set me up to see a Cardiologist about 4 weeks from my first appt. with him.  I moved up this appt the most I could, it is still two weeks away.  My main question is: Am I possibly doing more damage to my heart every day, by not being on true heart medication if I suffered a heart attack?  (the dull/aching pain has been the same since the day it started occasionally it does increase but then returns to the same aching state.)    Should I go to the Emergency Room instantly?  The blood work shows about 20 different values that were measured.  Besides the high cholesterol shown above, a few other values showed high.  SGPT/ALT 84 BILI, Total 1.6  My GP said don't worry about these values, so I'm not as concerned with these values.  Although I did read something on the internet where high figures for these can indicate liver disease or cancer.  So secondly,   How important are these values?  Thank you for your time, consideration and experience.  Any addl. info. would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "The previous message is an old message that I thought was rejected by this forum.  I posted a message after this, titled - Do SGPT/Bili values relate to Cardiac Ischemia?  It asks some of the same questions that were in my first message.  I just had a heart catherization done four days ago after many other tests.  After the procedure, the doctor told my wife that he has ruled out a life threatening condition, but I still am not able to get an answer if my arm/shoulder pain is heart related.  Many different tests were done, but the results from these tests almost seem to be a secret.  I have a hard time getting answers thru my cardiologist office.  Many times, I'll get a nurse that will say write down your questions and the doctor will address them at the next visit.  I don't know if the office is piecing together the big picture or what?  Side Note: GP wanted me to go on a Low Fat/Low Cholesterol diet, which I did for the most part follow. It did improve all my cholesterol values to high average values with my main cholesterol being reduced from 221 to about 176 in about 6 weeks.  I am just kind of venting here, but my main question to the cardiologist is if my pain is heart related or not.  After denial a while back, I was convinced that it was related to my heart.(From all the pieces, it just seemed to make sense. Failed Nuclear Stress Test- Cardiac Ischemia, relief from chest pain after using a Nitro Patch)  After the catherization the Dr. commented to my wife that - he(meaning me) is doing good and he mentioned something about 10-20% platelets.  I don't know exactly what this meant, but it sounds better than the blockage that I had expected to hear.  My main frustration is in wanting to have some answers or feel some results.  I might follow up with more info. in another message here after I recover a bit more from the catherization. (sore hip due to probably being on my feet too much yesterday.) My next visit to the cardiologist is now 3 weeks away.  I assume that because this date is so far off that there isn't anything urgent going on with respect to the heart.  Currently, it has been over eleven weeks since the start of the pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Healthy1 -   Hopefully this finds you well and having gotten some answers. I have read both your posts, and of course it seems you have run into that \"horrible coincidence\" situation wherein there is a likely musculoskeletal injury (work-related) which could have happened at the exact same time as an insult to the heart muscle. However, the symptoms don't match up exactly with the findings, so your doctors are hedging their bets on a definite diagnosis and trying to reduce your risk level.   The main symptoms,  the ache in the shoulder and adjacent area, would initially be suspicious, given your level of cardiac risk (more about that in a bit). However, if the discomfort has been relatively constant without progressing or going away, this lessens the likelihood of it being heart-related and more likely orthopedic in nature. Of course, manipulation of the affected shoulder, and range-of-motion testing, should at least elicit some joint or muscle pain. If it doesn't, this makes the diagnosis more difficult. Have you had any imaging studies of the shoulder and also the thoracic outlet on the affected side? I ask because you could be suffering from a simple mechanical injury, but at the same time this caused your doctors to discover that you were, at the time, at fairly high risk for a future cardicac event. It doesn't seem you have had a heart attack as yet, so that's all to the good. You have also lowered your risk a good deal by simple diet and exercise, which is very impressive and earns you tons of points for taking your health seriously!   The  SGPT/ALT 84 and BILI, Total 1.6 values are fine,  but not germane to your heart's health. The lipid panel was and, early on, troponin and CK enzyme levels might have been helpful. Your blood pressure is (or was as of your post) still too high, but not enough to set off any flashing lights or buzzers. An upward adjustment of your BP medication may have been in order, and by now may have been ordered. You probably should also be on a beta blocker of some sort, since you did exhibit some ischemia on your stress test. It is not clear, however, whether this was clinically significant or not (one can have minimal ischemia, which is suggestive but not diagnostic, or one can have clinically significant ischemia, which is diagnostic). The follow up post mentions the heart catheterization, which is pretty much the \"gold standard\" right now for determining the degree, if any, of heart disease. The report your doctor gave to your wife was definitely vague and I can understand your frustration. What you can read into this, however, is that while the doctor may have seen some narrowing in one or more locations, they apparently didn't warrant any sort of intervention, or that would have been done right there and then most likely. I  suspect what he saw was evidence of disease, but not to the extent that it met the criteria for immediate invasive correction (such as angioplasty, with or without stent placement). I suspect as well that your doctor wants to follow you as you continue to improve on your very good diet-change results and other lifestyle changes (stress management, regular aerobic exercise, etc.).  The \"10-20% platelets\" was possibly a misunderstanding of \"10-20 % plaque buildup\", which  is made up, in part, of blood platelets along with calcium and cholesterol. If that is the case, it would indicate some heart disease but nothing immediately life-threatening. The measure used to justify invasive measures is usually greater than 50% and sometimes 50-70%. Less than a 50% blockage is usually treated with diet, exercise, and cholesterol-lowering medications.  As to the question of whether or not you are \"damaging your heart\" by continuing your normal activities, the answer would be a qualified \"no.\" Usually if your heart is functioning and does not have a problem which warrants immediate intervention, then you won't damage it by doing normal activities. However, so long as you are deemed to be at increased risk of a cardiac event, your risk during exertion also increases beyond that of someone with no heart disease.   For all these reasons, and especially that infuriating shoulder ache with no apparent associated tissue or bone injury, plus your definite risk factors, your doctor is right to follow you carefully, but being conservative and considerate of your needs overall. I would expect the followup visit you had scheduled probably clarified a lot of these things for you, and I hope this writing finds you in good health and enjoying some peace of mind as well as relief from the shoulder pain, whatever may have been causing it. You've done extremely well at reducing your risk, and you've cooperated with your doctor very well, so you are doing all the right things and hopefully by now you have reduced your risk and improved your overall health a great deal.  I hope you will update us shortly and that all is well.\n\n",

While a reaction  to Lipitor could certainly cause any number of reactions, including a cough, as Ms. Jones mentioned, Altace is almost assured of causing a temporary and very annoying dry cough. Patients are encouraged to try and tough it out because the risk vs. benefit ratio is so great in favor of using the drug. Hopefully that's passed now and won't start up again (it usually does go away). Hope all is well there.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amber,  Heart murmurs are frequent and of various kind. many of these murmurs are 'innocent' or functional and nor related to any organic heart disease. Some of the murmurs are associated with either valvular heart disease or a congenital heart disease. In children these murmurs abound. As age advances most of theses innocent murmurs disappear.  In a child when a murmur is detected, the concerned doctor usually investigates it and determines if it is innocent or serious. You were diagnosed with a heart murmur at 6 but you have not provided any other detail so I presume it was an innocent murmur.  Now at 27, the type of chest pain you have should have nothing to do with that murmur. The shooting type of chest pain is characteristic of some intrathoracic muscle pull, a muscular chest pain or even a push from the abdomen due to 'gas' or a dyspepsia. You may try out some OTC pain reliever along with an anatcid and if not better, kindly see your doctor.  I am sure you will be alright within no time!  Apurva\n\n",

If yes, she is a likely candidate for silent isachemia and may not even be realizing that she is having angina. If she is a not diabetic and if she can perform all her physical chores without symptoms, then just because a stress test shows some abnormality does not necessarily mean another cath.   Courage trial specifically says that 'OPTIMAL' pharmacological treatment is equally good or even better than PCI. Chronic stable angina can be very effectively treated by proper therapy and your wife's current status is- Coronary disease yes but she does not even have an angina.  However you may suggest to your cadiologist if he thinks it fit to order a stress thallium. This will show if the blood perfusion of the heart muscle is actually taking place or not and in which territory and how much. It is entirely non-invasive. If stress thallium is significantly abnormal, one may think of going to the cath.  Apurva\n\n",

However you are describing a classic symptom complex related to a heart pain. This being so, it is more likely if this symptom of yours comes along when you do some physical activity. One factor to keep in mind is if there is a history of premature heart disease in your family or a history of familial dyslipidemia [abnormal cholesterol].   Also to consider if you have any diabetes or high blood pressure, whether you smoke or not and if you have a thyroid disorder or not.  I feel mostly at your age the pain is not likely related to the heart. Possibilities are a bronchitis, or a muscle pain. However looking to the classic symptom complex you are having I suggest you check with a physician and get an EKG, an X ray chest, and if necessary an Echocardiogram and a traedmill test.

I can't return to work without my physician signing a clearance letter. He stated, \" If I had a regular like office job it would be no problem to return to work, but he wants to do a cardiac cath to ultimately rule out anything.\"  I don't really want to do the cath because I'm asymptomatic and its invasiveness.

    "content": "Age 40, Non-Smoker/Non-Drinker, Non Exercising, Slightly Overweight (5'11\" - 195 lbs) - Family history of heart problems and high blood pressure.  Had a shoulder injury(or so I thought) at work.  Did not report it because of how negatively work looks at - on the job injuries.  Pain was a dull aching pain, varying in location from my left chest to down left upper arm and occasionally the left inner back.  Injury happened approx. 8 weeks ago.  I nursed the injury thru to the Holidays, using my left arm as little as possible. (Very stressful, very physical factory type work) Went to a (GP) General Practioner Dr. 5 weeks later when I had time off due to the Holidays.  Upon my suggestion, the Dr. sent me for a Exercise Stress Test(no injection - just ECG and Exercise) and blood work.  The specialist reading the test let my GP know that the test showed Cardiac Ischemia.  The blood work showed high cholesterol:  Cholesterol 221 mg/DL Triglycerides 193 mg/DL      HDL Cholesterol 40 mg/DL LDL Cholesterol 142 mg/DL   The GP doesn't think that I had a heart attack, he said that he still thinks that it seems to be a shoulder problem, even though we can't find any area of direct pain in the shoulder.  However, he did put me on Cartia XT 120 mg (Cardizem) to lower my blood pressure and gave me Nitroglycerin to take if the pain gets worse.  He also said to take a baby aspirin (81mg) every day.  He said that my blood pressure was high.    Under the medication(Cardizem and aspirin) my blood pressure averages: 145/85 with a heart rate of 55.  I tried to get my GP to do additional tests (possible xray or some sort of injection stress test - that I read about on the internet), he did not send me for these because he still thinks it's possibly shoulder and the fact that he has set me up to see a Cardiologist.  I moved up this appt the most I could, it is still a week and a half away.  If I suffered a heart attack, Am I possibly doing more damage to my heart every day, by not being on true heart medication? (the dull/aching pain has been the same since the day it started occasionally it does increase but then returns to the same aching state.)    The blood work shows about 20 different values that were measured.  Besides the high cholesterol shown above, a few other values showed high:  SGPT/ALT 84 U/L BILI, Total 1.6 U/L  My GP said don't worry about these values, so I'm not as concerned with these values.  Although I did read something on the internet where high figures for these can indicate liver disease or cancer.  Do these values have any relation to a past heart attack?, or do they relate to the Cardiac Ischemia at all? (if the bloodwork was done approx. a month and a half after a possible attack)  Thank you for your time, consideration and experience.  Any additional info. would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

There are a number of things that can cause these numbers to be elevated.  It may simply be a viral infection.  I would suggest you have these values repeated in 4-6 weeks to see if they have returned to normal.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Zephyris,  There are a few possibilities for your pain.  Given your age and the description you have provided this pain is quite unlikely to be from your heart.  It may be a muscular strain of one of the intercostal muscles (the muscles between the ribs).  Another possibility is a condition called pleurisy.  This is inflammation of the lining of the lungs/chest wall.  This pain often can be triggered by an infection, possibly likely the cold you've had.  It typically is worse with deep breathing.  A third possibility would be a condition called costochondritis.  This is inflammation of the joint where the rib bone becomes cartilage.  This pain is typically located just a lit ways from the breast bone and it can be reproduced by pushing on the area that hurts.  Both pleurisy and costochondritis are quite common.  Both are treated with anti-inflammatory medicines.  If the pain persists or worsens I would suggest you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Fortunately you've provided enough information that I can say with reasonable conviction that no, the pains you describe do not sound like they are cardiac-related. In fact I would have said that anyway, but given the history of anxiety, the negative cardiac workup, etc., I feel they are likely related to the anxiety itself, although of course there are other things inside the thorax which can hurt. The fact that the pains are diffuse, usually sharp and fleeting, and are not aggravated by exercise all just add weight to the idea that these are not at all cardiac in nature. You've done all the right things in getting yourself checked, but the concern over the pains still lingers, which is a common trait seen in those with chronic generalized anxiety.   Without making any sort of referral I feel safe in saying that with the picture you have drawn with your history and symptoms that the pains are not cardiac in nature but quite possibly due to chronic generalized anxiety (GAD). You might want to look in that direction for relief from your concerns.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - This sounds like a classic Chicken and the Egg problem. If, indeed, your problem is anxiety-related, is it being cause by anxiety or is it simply producing anxiety? Or is it something else that could be treated, but is happening to someone who is already anxious by nature?   You've had a pretty comprehensive workup and have come out smelling like a rose. The  symptoms have returned. Is this a problem? If you see it as one then it is. If it causes you anxiety and limits your enjoyment of life it's a problem. It also could be something totally unrelated to your heart (there's a lot going on inside one's chest). You do have GERD, which could account for some of this, but parts of it also sound like chest wall tenderness due to some inflammatory process. Since you cannot provoke the pain by exercise you have pretty well ruled out, along with the extensive medical workup, the heart as culprit.   That doesn't make it feel any less threatening, though, does it?   It would not be wrong of you to bring this matter to the attention of your GP once again. Perhaps, since it is a rerun now, he/she would  be more inclined to explore more obscure causes such as costochondritis or some other  non-cardiac cause, and help you to get rid of it or at least get comfortable with it.   You've been good with this. You deserve to be able to enjoy your life without undue anxiety and possibly without this pain as well (although pain alone is a lot easier to deal with than the anxiety is can cause).   Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 51 year  male. In 2002 I started getting pain in the left arm and left jaw which at times were acute. It was initially treated as spondylytis (I have that too but slight) but another ortho suggested a cardio check up. TMT and angiography revealed \"Left anterior descending 80% stenosis\" and \"Left circumflex 100% Distal stenosis fills retrogradly via RCA\". In layman terms I was given to understand that one artery is 80% blocked and another 100% but the latter has natural capillary bypass made by the body. Please confirm this is what the medical terms mean.  Subsequently I underwent an angioplasty in 2002 where a medicated 'cypher stent' was inserted for the 80% blockage, nothing could be done for the other one.  Pain in left arm mainly forearm on effort (walking etc) & in stressful situations has not left me even after all these years although the intensity is less. Even immediately after the angio these sypmtoms were present. Often I notice that when I go for my morning and/or evening walks after about 30 - 35 min of brisk walking the pain seems to ease slightly. Slow leisurely walk the onset of pain is much later or not at all. These days it seems the onset of the pain is much earlier (within the first 5 to 7 min) than 5 years ago.  I wish to know the reason for this pain. Is part of it psychological? Doctors vaguely tell me it is because of the 100% blockage and that I have to live with it , why??  My current medications are Concor 5/Repace 50/Tonact TG/Lonazep 0.25  Brgds Ajoy\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ajoy,  You are correct that your angio report indicated you had an 80% block of one vessel and 100% block of another.  The 100% blocked vessel was still getting blood flow behind the blockage but from the other direction.  Most of the blood vessels of the heart do have some connection to each other and can allow filling backwards but this is not ideal.  I would recommend you see your cardiologist again now that your symptoms are worsening.  It is possible for other arteries to slowly close off or the stent to close off.  You may need further imaging studies or stress testing.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When they open the chest nerves get cut.  It can take many years for nerves to fully heal.  During this time they may cause significant pain.  The arm pain may be referred pain, although the tingling makes me think it may be pain from a pinched nerve closer to your neck.  With chest and arm pain it is important to make sure it isn't coming from your heart.  If your doctors have ruled this out is may be worth looking into the nerve issue some.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - This is a tough one, for a number of reasons. I am assuming  your dad was hospitalized for several days at least following the most recent  heart attack. Was there any intervention  done, such as angioplasty or stent placement? If he was diagnosed as havng had a myocardial infarction it would seem likely there would at least be an angiogram performed to see if there might be any occlusion that could be opened up. On the other hand, if  the infarction was apparent but resolved without intervention then it is at least somewhat likely that  your father may be having spasm  of one coronary artery. This is  often difficult to pin down once the spasm has stopped and so subsequent episodes of chest pain may be suspected of being the result of this form of angina, which can occur without any actual coronary artery disease being present.  In running this by you I am giving your father's doctors the benefit of the doubt. I have to do that  because otherwise what is being done would seem unorthodox to say the least.  I would add that PVCs  are common in the general population and even moreso in post-MI patients, but as long  as left ventricular function is preserved, they are not of much consequence. I would think the event monitor  is  probably being used to determine if, during episodes of chest pain, your dad's rhythm strip shows any ST elevation which then resolves.    All this is speculation,  and it would really be helpful to know more about the situation, specifically: was  your dad's most recent  heart attack a completed MI or was it a coronary event which resolved on its own? This latter might well explain why the doctor  has chosen to use an event monitor or other telemetric device, instead of attempting to open up a clogged artery. If  this  isn't the case I have to admit to being quite puzzled by the approach. Again, more info would really help.   Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - First I apologize for taking so long to reply, but I have been extremely busy, out of town, for the past month. Hopefully things are still  stable with your father.  In reading your update I see that a stent was placed in each episode, the most recent was a completed MI, and that your dad is paying out of pocket to stay in cardiac rehab (a great idea if one can afford it). You also state that, per your mother, your dad's EKG still shows elevated S-T segment somewhere. Taking  all this into account the only thing I can think of is that your father may have developed some pericarditis (one of the few non-vascular causes of S-T elevation, along with unique chest pain). Your dad would appear to be tolerating the rehab program, and when S-T segment elevation becomes chronic (one would think it would have started to resolve long before now, post-MI unless pericarditis had developed) one has to suspect a mild pericarditis, probably with some perfusion into the sac around the heart. The  pain from this is usually sharp, often  pleuritic, gets worse when the patient is supine  and  improved when the patient sits up. There also may be some mild fever. IF this is the case, treatment is either by aspirin, one of the NSAIDs, or sometimes oral steroids. It can be visualized usually on chest  x-ray. Something else may be going on, but this is my best guess at this point, and if correct, it is rarely life-threatening and is usually easily treatable.   If there is no evidence of pericardial perfusion then something really peculiar is going on, or perhaps your father is one of those rare people who, because of the nature of the MI, develops a chronic or long-term S-T elevation post-MI. It is rare, but it can happen.    Hopefully this is of some help.\n\n",

    "content": "I suffered a MI two years ago at the age of 34 and had one stent placed.  I am currently taking following medicines:  Plavix, Aspirin, Lopressor, Lisinopril, Folic Acid, Effexor, and multi-vitaman.  I've been scared to go back to the dentist since the heart attack because the day prior to my MI I had been to the dentist and was diagnosed with gum disease and had two teeth pulled.  I know that I still need at least one more tooth pulled, two cavities filled, and a root canal.  I'm terrified.  Is it true that you have to quit your meds prior to having dental work performed?  Is Sedation Dentistry an option for folks with heart problems?  Should I first get prior approval from my cardiologist before visiting the dentist?  I would appreciate any information regarding dental work for folks with heart disease and/or prior heart attacks.    Thanks, Delia\n\n",

There are certain cardiac issues such as valve problems that require prophylactic antibiotics prior to invasive dental work.  There may be reasons for your cardiologist to clear you for any dental procedures - only your cardiologist is familiar with the aftermath of your MI (myocardial infarct) and what medications (if any) need to be modified, stopped, or started prior to invasive dental work. Your cardiologist can also best advise you regarding any sedation requested or required during the dental procedures.  Please let us know what the recommendations turn out to be!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear wanza639, I have a few questions that may help point a finger in the right direction in determining why you have such unusual fatigue.  At this moment I doubt whether your back plays any role in this. On the other hand, Celebrex lists fatigue and somnolence among some of the side effects.  How long have you been taking this medication? You may wish to ask your doctor if there is a relationship between this medication and your symptoms. I am also interested in the fact that you are a long term smoker, and are already diagnosed with Asthma.  Many smokers also have COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) which can be a debilitating lung disease.  Many Asthmatics and COPD'rs have sleep apnea - a condition in which you bluntly stop breathing in your sleep.  Do you find yourself waking yourself with a loud snore or a snort?  Does your partner notice you breathe unevenly in your sleep?  You have already listed two of the significant findings of people suffering with sleep apnea: an unrelenting fatigue, and feeling sleep all the time. This is because your body isnt getting enough rest!  Your doctor can recommend a sleep study which will verify - or nullify - any concerns about sleep apnea contributing to your symptoms.  Perhaps asking for a change of meds will help you determine if the Celebrex is contributing.   In either case, please keep your primary care physician informed of your concerns.\n\n",

In general, this is a very valid position.  As you mention, though, surgery at 78 is never a simple thing.  A quadruple bypass is also a bit more risky than a single or double bypass.    I wish I were able to give you a simple yes or no answer but this really comes down to a personal decision between your family and your doctors.  I would recommend that you talk with a cardiothoracic surgeon that will be doing the procedure and get their assessment of the risks as well as the benefits of the surgery.  Also,  I would recommend that you talk with the anesthesiologist about the risks of anesthesia.  Talk with her primary doctor as well to see if there are any concerns about surgery from that perspective.  The more information you can get the better you'll be able to make an informed position.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello biman - You pose a really good question. The first thing that needs to be addressed, however, is medical supervision of the treatment of arthritis symptoms. The most effective class of drugs for relief of pain and joint inflammation currently is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), and aspirin falls into that category. In fact it was the first and only such drug available for many years.   While up to a point it is OK to self-medicate for arthritis pain, if it is going to be a long-term thing (and it usually is) then your dad needs to consult with his personal physician and perhaps even a rheumatologist, in order to weigh the risks vs. benefits of the various possible treatments. Sometimes steroids can be beneficial as well, but almost all NSAIDs, as well as all steroids, carry similar risks: potentially dangerous stomach lining irritation (especially true with aspirin), increased bleeding potential, and for most steroids and NSAIDs (except aspirin so far), also the potential increased risk of developing or worsening heart disease.   This may sound like a no-win situation but it isn't. It just makes things more complicated, which is why they need to be guided by a medical professional. Aspirin is, of course, almost a routine preventive measure for heart disease and stroke, with most people over the age of 50 (especially those already diagnosed with heart disease) urged to take one 81 mg. pill per day to help prevent clot formation. However, aspirin in larger doses is no longer the standard for arthritic pain relief because of its uniquely powerful ability to prevent blood clotting (which on the one hand often is the cause of heart attacks and strokes, but is also necessary to keep us from bleeding to death from little day-to-day cuts and bruises). While the other NSAIDs also have some degree of bleeding risk attached to them, it is not as pronounced as with aspirin.   There is a sub-class of NSAIDs which have been very effective against arthritis pain and inflammation, the COX-2 inhibitor group, which are much less likely to irritate the stomach, but some of them have been removed from the market due to the fact that there seems to be a strong link between use of some of these drugs and the development or worsening of heart disease. Even the over-the-counter (OTC) drugs such as Ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) and Naproxyn (Naprosyn, Aleve) are now suspected of increasing heart disease risk, and so whatever medication is used (and needless to say, something has to be done for chronic pain), it really requires a doctor's expertise to determine, based on the individual patient's history and health issues, which drug or drugs to use.   Aspirin as a pain medication has fallen out of favor for the most part, because of the marked increase in risk of stomach irritation and bleeding. It still works and works very well, but for most people the risks outweigh the benefits. Your dad's doctor can determine what the most appropriate pain management would be for him, and it could well include one of the COX-2 inhibitors still on the market. It all depends. There's a lot to consider. I would advise your dad, however, to not embark on a self-medication plan that includes aspirin. If his doctor winds up deciding that would be best (which is very unlikely) then great. But other than the one \"baby\" aspirin per day that most middle aged and older adults are encouraged to take, it's a good drug to avoid.   To answer your last question, families where arthritis is widespread usually carry a far greater risk for inheriting the problem, and it's relatively rare to find a lone person with severe arthritis in a family where there is no history of it. Our biggest hope for those who may inherit this painful disease is that research is constant and medical advances are more likely by the day.   Please steer your dad away from the aspirin idea and get him to bring this problem to the attention of his person physician ASAP. There's a lot that can be done to improve the situation, but a there's no substitute for the active involvement of a doctor, especially where there are other health issues involved.  Hope this answers your question. Please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 yr. old female.  I had a baby 3 months ago and mentioned to the ob about recurring pvcs in last year.  She sent me for ECG and 24 hr. holter which showed t wave inversion in lead 3 and t wave biphasic in avf and V6 and slight sinus tachycarida.  Then went for echo and stress test.  Both came out fine.  I had several pvc's after stress test but cardio said they were benign.  I often listen to my heart and have recently noticed a whoosh that lasts for a minute or so in the middle of the beats but then goes away.  I am feeling anxiety about this and think about it often.  My questions are, should I be worried that I had a previous MI.  (I did have an ECG done after my first pregnancy 4 years ago and it was normal)  Can anxiety affect my ECG twice?  I felt anxious both time I had them done recently.  Did the echo miss a heart murmur or can anxiety make this happen for a short time and then go away.  ( just went up the stairs and felt very anxious-listened to my heart and heard the whoosh but it went away quickly)  I had a murmur in my first pregnancy that went away.  Could it still be there, and will it go away?  OR is this all just anxiety related and I should stop worrying.  I didn't tell my doctor about the whoosh sound but other than that she seems to be quite unconcerned.  My dad and his dad died in their 50's of heart attacks so I am quite concerned about this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sk8tr - Your ECG abnormalities are very non-specific, and in  light of two unremarkable and essentially normal readings they mean even less.  However, to answer one of your questions, yes, anxiety can affect the orientation of the T wave in a given ECG. So can changes in position and hyperventilation. In the absence of other significant symptoms, they don't usually mean anything.  Same thing with the PVCs; they are so common in the general population, despite the distinctly unpleasant sensation, and almost always are without any clinical significance, even if frequent and complex. That's just a fact. They can drive a person crazy, but unless there are other, far more significant symptoms  and problems (which trust me, would far overshadow the PVCs) they are meaningless.  Then there's the \"whoosh murmur.\" This is a major issue, because - there's no delicate way to put this - it requires a very highly trained ear to interpret the sounds a working heart makes. It  takes years of training and practice, and what you are hearing is likely normal sounds, since I feel quite certain your doctor has listened to your heart numerous times. No significant murmur will come and go like that, other than the \"click\" murmur of mitral valve prolapse,  which often disappears for years at a time. Even when it does show up, it usually has no real meaning, except as a way to make the diagnosis of MVP,which, again, is almost always benign. And  a \"whoosh\" isn't even a click. It could be your own breathing you're hearing.  In short, it sounds like  you are a very healthy young woman who has become  very attuned to her body's routine business. Nothing you've mentioned suggests trouble, but  several things suggest robust good health, including a very normal stress test. which would have exposed most  problems you could have had. The only troublesome  thing you've mentioned is that you're trying to listen to your own heart, which most doctors wouldn't even try. Too  hard to be objective.  Hope this is  helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am 17 years old and last night I smoked marijuana. I do it occasionally and I never have problems but this time I did it using a gravity bong where you inhale a lot of smoke. I had done it once before and had really bad results. I started to spin and black out. I have no idea why I did it again but I did and this time immediately after doing it I felt the same symptoms. I started to get scared and drank some water and went outside. It started to get worse and worse and a panic set in. I went to lie down but suddenly I felt my heart beating at an incredible speed and had trouble breathing. I immediately thought this is what a heart attack must feel like it but my friends told me to sit down and relax. For the next 30-45 minutes I fought off the pain while I had many of what I now know are heart attack signs or warnings including uncomfortable pressure, pain that went to my left side including my arm. It wasn't that painful on the arm but it was a discomfort. I was feeling like I would faint before, was nervous sweating and very cold. My friend covered me in blankets and felt extremely scared hoping something terrible wouldn't happen. My one friend who was there the previous time trouble happened, the whole time thought this is what you said last time and didn't take it too seriously and thought I was panicking from the drugs. I asked him if we should call 911 as I was debating it in my head but he really thought I would be fine. An hour after I started to feel better and two hours later I just felt \"high\".   Since I felt better, my friend at the end of the night said...\"see he is better now. I know it wasn't serious and you said the same thing last time. I'll know next time if it happens just to leave him alone and let him wait it out.\"  This angered me because I didn't have the same thing last time and I could be in real danger next time.  I would like to know how serious this was. Did it have to do with the Marijuana? Did I have a heart attack? Next time this happens should I call 911 immediately. I have always been told that marijuana has never caused a death before reportedly so it made me feel a bit better but I was extremely nervous. None of my friends believed it was serious. Was it? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello miketimith - Chances are you did not have a heart attack, but you may have experienced a really unpleasant combination of anxiety/panic (which is often mistaken by pot smokers as feeling \"paranoid\" - an unspoken fear that either the substance will cause one to lose control or will wind up getting in some kind of trouble) along with understandable physical symptoms considering the use of a gravity bong, which may have caused you to momentarily displace too much oxygen. Remember, we aren't designed to run on smoke, but on clean air! I know it seems obvious, but people tend to forget that the particles and carbon monoxide that are inhaled are toxic, no matter what it is that's burning.   A great deal of smoke (along with a little air) held for an abnormally long time (as smoking pot is usually done) can cause blackouts, palpitations and a lot of other things such as you described, simply because of the initial slowing of the heart during the deep inhalation and holding of the smoke, plus the smoke itself. Afterward the heart is hungry for oxygen and so will beat a lot faster for a while, trying to compensate for what just happened.   The pain you felt in your chest is only slightly suspicious. I would suggest seeing your doctor if at all practical (pain in the chest is not a bad reason for a doctor visit) and explain to the doctor what you've told us here. Your doctor can rule out any possible heart problem, but it doesn't sound like that's what's going on, despite the pain (which normally wouldn't be left-sided but in the center of your chest). It's worth checking out for your own peace of mind, but I think the larger part of it was simple smoke inhalation (that's what kills people most often in building fires, you know).   I'm not going to lecture you on the wisdom of using marijuana. You're old enough to know what you're doing, for better or worse. What you may not realize, though, is that \"a lot of smoke\" does not belong in the lungs. Ever. The fact that it got there in attempt to get high only makes everything worse.   If you've had no further problems since the incident, and have only had bad reactions when smoking pot, the obvious fix is to not do that! Again, regardless of what other problems pot use may cause (and that is a very controversial subject not up for debate here), we were not designed to function with smoke in our lungs any more than we were to function with water in our lungs. Think about it.   Good luck with this, and feel free to follow up with us.\n\n",

I know I shouldn't be doing pot but only negative affects have happened from doing this gravity bong but if this was to happen again what are some required steps I should take?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - Well if you're asking what you should do if you have this sort of reaction again, first of all, avoid the gravity bong if you don't want it to happen, as the reaction seems to be getting worse instead of your body becoming used to it. This isn't really surprising, for reasons I've already mentioned. It's that foreign stuff (smoke) vs. oxygen. Also, don't underrate anticipatory anxiety, as it works on an unconscious level, which is why it's so difficult to get people to look at it as a contributing factor. You'd had a bad experience before, so you may have been anticipating it happening again. But basically you seem to be asking \"How can I remedy a possible reaction to something I know I shouldn't be doing and that has caused a bad reaction in the past?\" There's no good answer to that. If you insist on doing this to yourself you run the risk of having further and possibly more severe reactions. It could be that your herb is contaminated with something or treated with something and no one's telling or knows. Trust me, this happens a lot more often than is realized.  I can't very well advise you on how to avoid that reaction, because it's an established pattern and rather like asking how you can keep putting your hand in the fire without getting burned.   There's probably some other way you could spend the time devoted to getting high, but if not, then why go for a hit so strong that it hurts you? There's more of a problem here than simply smoking dope and having a reaction. At age 17 you have got to have reasons for wanting to get so wasted that you'd risk your health and safety.   As for the reaction you have, the only way you can even come close to knowing what to do is to rule out any undiscovered heart, lung or neurological problems that may cause you to react so acutely. That means bringing the matter to the attention of a doctor, and you seem to have ruled that out along with not doing this stuff. You said \"I know I shouldn't be doing pot.\" Why is that? Do you think it's bad for you? Do you think it's wrong:? Are you concerned with getting in legal or parental trouble? Or are you concerned that it may be hurting your health? All those are pretty good reasons to not be doing it, and the one that brought you here to seek advice would have been enough for a lot of people to back off from it simply because that kind of reaction is so far from feeling good that it almost doesn't make sense to want to go back and risk having it happen again.   I honestly don't know how you could avoid that happening when we don't even know for certain why it happened. My suspicion is it was simple smoke inhallation complicated by the psychogenic effects of THC on the nervous system, but if that doesn't tell you what you need to know then I don't think we can help you much more.  I hope you'll give all this some serious thought. You're not being judged - you're being answered as one adult to another, although I do have quite a few years on you and legally you have a little ways to go before you're an adult in the eyes of the law - or your parents. That's something else to bear in mind: you're not as old or as experienced as you may think. You're at probably one of the most difficult ages you'll ever (hopefully) see in your entire life. Seventeen can be horrible. It doesn't have to be fatal, though.   Again, I wish you luck. I\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 23 year old female. I am obese and have GERD. I have a family history of DMII, HTN, Hyperlipid, CA. I just had pre-op testing performed yesterday. I'm scheduled to undergo Gastric Bypass Surgery next Thursday 1/11/07. I received a call today from my surgeon's office stating that my EKG was abnormal and I needed a cardiac clearance. I work in a clinic, so one of the Internests there ordered another EKG on me, they also retrieved an EKG that was done pre-op for my gallbladder surgery in January of 2002. The EKG from 2002 and the EKG from today we practically identical. They both stated \"Normal Sinus Rythm, Septal Infarct Age Undetermined, Abnormal ECG\"  I have 2 questions.  1) Am I stable to undergo surgery if the previous EKG was in 2002 and there have been no changes in it. (In which I've also had GallBladder Surgery and Back Surgery since that EKG)  2) What exactly does it mean? I mean it's obviously a correct diagnoses if 3 different EKGs show it. I mean, is there anything I can do, will losing weight help that? Thank you very much for your time. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello nursekelly83 - There are a number of things here that can be addressed: first, each EKG needs to be read, even though what the machine \"sees\" and prints on it is the same, because there can be changes withiin certain parameters. However, it seems likely that since you were OK'd for surgeries in the past with the same finding, and you are rather young, it's likely you will be given the green light again. And there may be a good reason for this other than what the EKG machines have picked up: in obese females (and even some who are simply short of stature) it is sometimes very difficult to get a \"normal\" reading because of anatomic variations, especially in the distances between \"landmarks\" and the thickness of fatty tissue. So the \"old septal infarct\" may well be only an artifact. Apparently no doctor has ever urged you to investigate further, and this may be why. The EKG may actually be normal, and the only way for that to be made official is for it to be read by an MD. The machines we have now will not accept a variant without putting a label on it, so it's a good thing a doctor has to read and sign off before the actual finding goes in your chart.  You do have some familial factors which could be significantly reduced via the planned surgery and reduce your risk of a future coronary event, which makes it more likely you will get cleared for it. Meanwhile, to answer your bottom-line question, an MD will have to actually read the newest EKG, compare it with the older one, and make the call. There's no way around that, but I suspect it won't matter, as the reading of the machine is likely just artifact.   Good luck to you. This is an important step in protecting your health.\n\n",

    "title": "Young with neck pain",
    "content": "Hello,  I'm a 23 year old male who maintains a good level of physical activity.  I swim and bike and I try to run; however, my problem is when I encounter the run.  Over the summer I attempted a triathlon, and about a minute or two into the running portion a stabbing neck pain surfaced.  Thinking it was temporary or part of acclamating myself to the run (I'm not yet an avid runner) I continued to run.  After a couple miles I noticed the pain got worse and thought it best not to continue running.  The pain slowly dissapated that initial time,but I could feel it lingering for three days, which is when I contacted a physician for advice.  The doctor said take ibprufen if the pain reoccurs and to stay away from heavy lifting and strenuous exercise (something I tried to do for 3-4 weeks, but eventually went back to my activities).  The pain lay dorment until I would run, in which case the ibprufen had little to no effect on the pain (either before the exercise or remedying it after the activity).  I know the first instinct would be to characterize as a nerve pain, and it very well could be, but the pain seems a little different than nerve pain.  From my experience it is not muscle or joint pain and it didn't feel like nerve pain either.  The pain is strictly on the left side of my neck (where the neck meets the shoulder shooting up my neck).  The intensity of the pain, while running, increases as time goes on at the same pace and as I increase my pace, and sharp spikes in pain occur with each heart beat and breath taken.  I would almost say it's artery pain, but I've read that doesn't exist.  Additionally, my chest does tighten up while I run (always has, but never with significant pain), which, with the neck pain, adds to the fear that something is preventing proper circulation and oxygen delivery to the brain.    What can it be?  And, of course, what can I do about it to keep a high level of physical activity or remedy the situation?  Thanks,   S.  Summ\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to your description, the pain could be due to: -Neurological -nerve irritation- mainly Herniated disk and or -Muscle spams  (the two possible causes are commonly associated and coexist).  Even so, in most of the cases with upper  back or one sided neck pain, strain of the back muscles and ligaments, is the primary cause.   Muscle spasm alone can cause this pain which can be an unidentified cause but  in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, overuse and certain types of work.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain.  Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   Herniated disk is a condition in which the inter-vertebral disc press on his nerves,  Spondylosis which is similar to arthritis but affects the spine etc.  MRI is of choice in the diagnosis.  These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical).   Non surgical treatment include, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities.    I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to go for a MRI scan for proper diagnosis as the condition did not improve till now.  Direct clinical examination  is essential.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am  female aged 50 year old.  In 2002 I was hospitalised with T-wave flattening and St segment.  The diagnosis was perhaps unstable angina. A week later - Meanwhile I had a thallium test which was normal, a stress test sub optimal level because I was very unwell. an echo showed hypokinesis of the left atrium wall and mitral regurgitation.   EF ~50%.  Mitral valve prolapse.  2004:  All the above normal  15 Nov 2006.  I think I had an MI.  I felt very unwell, nausea, pain in chest, strange sensation in the left arm.  It was about 9:00, went back to bed.  When well enough went to A&E about 12:00. Felt better. An EKG at 13.20 showed R-Wave progression.  Another at 18:20 showed R-Wave Progression  R, 15mV V3-V6.  Two days later I was worried and went to a private cardio.  The same results on ECG.  (I am no longer using the national health system her ein the UK due to rationing of health care).  An echo showed LV mildly dilated at 5.7 cm.  Systolic function slightly sluggish, ?mild hypokinesis of inferior wall seen in parasternal short axis.  Mild functional MR.  Trivial Triscuspid Valve regurgitation.  Conceivable cardiomyopathy.  EF(Tecih)0.611 not sure what is this and FS 33.2% not sure what is this.  This was done privately.  I am in the UK at present and was under the NHS (social care) but have now decided to pursue this privately and pay for my own care. No cardiac enzymes were performed in A&E when obviously it should have been done.  I did phone the doctor afterwards and was quite upset as to why he had not done it.  He said that whatever happened was before I arrived in hospital.  This happened in the UK where socialised medicine is abysmal and unless you see a cardiologist privately, the care at these hospital is very limited.  I am seeing a different cardiologist tomorrow for a second opnion because of interpretational differences.  Which questions should I ask and which tests should I ask for?  What are the chances that indeed the R-Wave progression would confirm or exclude a diagnosis of an MI on that day.  If so, that type of infarct and what injury did it cause.   I believe I am lucky to be alive and that I did have a heart attack on 15 Nov 2006 judging by my own clinical symptoms.    I would be grateful if you could let me know which questions I should ask this cardiologist tomorrow for a second opinion.  Thank you for your help. Daisy\n\n",

Post MI, with hypokinetic inferior wall Ejection fraction by Teicholts method is less likely to be in the range of 0.61, which is absolutely normal.   You say you have Mitral prolapse too. This is an innocent condition, to be largely ignored if asymptomatic. However the presence of Prolapse itself cause ST and T flattening and the vague chest symptoms that you have.  Poor progression of R in chest leads can be due to cardiomyopathy. Chronic lung disease, (COPD), or very old Anterior MI.  Ask your cardiologist if you really have any heart disease.

(run high 130's/80's.)    2.5 mg altace for a month.  Xanax XR .5mg daily for a month, Prilosec OTC for a month.  Starting in November I was getting shooting pains in my arms, jaw, legs, and chest.  Rarely lasted longer than 5 seconds.  Started to get a bit of chest pressure at that time.  Early December, had dead center chest pain for 45 minutes 7 on a 10 scale.  Went away, but next morning still felt like a 4 out of 10.  Went to ER.  BP 220/110.  Took an asprin. BP eventually fell on it's own (no nitro).  Chest X-ray clean, Blood enzymes clean, ECG, clean.  Nuclear Stress test with exercise - no problems.  EF 61%.  Released by PA with no diagnosis other than follow up with PC.  PC says it's not cardiac.  I still get shooting pains in my arms, chest, neck, face quite a bit.  Going to PT for that.  It might be helping.  Ran standard blood tests - clean.  Chest pressure comes and goes.  Though, I burp all the time.  I also have a hard time sleeping on my sides (worse on right side) I wake up a lot with chest pain and burp most of the time.  I went for a GI consult, they did a ultrasound of my gall bladder, and I'm scheduled (in like a month) for a upper GI scope.  Exercise doesn't make the chest pain or shooting pains worse, in fact, most times it helps improve it significantly.  So, should I push a Cardiology consult (I realize my background and negative nuclear stress, would dictate not doing much else right?)    I understand the thought of anxiety, but man, this is happening quite a bit and it's ruining my life.  Not much of a family history.  Had a grandfather die in his 50's, but he smoked 2 packs a day, drank heavily etc.  I've never smoked, and rarely drink.  All this really came on in November.  Realistically, would a cardiologist do much else?  I doubt I have enought symptoms to be cath'd (nor would I want to be unecessarily).  Like I said, exercise helps.\n\n",

    "content": "You said, \"Exercise doesn't make the chest pain or shooting pains worse, in fact, most times it helps improve it significantly\"  In chest pain of cardiac origin, exercise would increase the work load of the heart and thereby your symptoms.  So I think we can rule this out.  You said, \"I burp all the time. I also have a hard time sleeping on my sides (worse on right side) I wake up a lot with chest pain and burp most of the time.\"  This sounds like GERD (Gastrointestinal Esophogeal Reflux Disease).  You may also have peptic ulcer disease.  I would persue this with a gastroenterologist.  You are on target with the upper GI study.  Karen Marshall RN\n\n",

    "content": "So, today I had pretty significant chest presure.  It moved around, but quite a bit behind the sternum.  I do have some anxiety, but it's strange to me that I keep getting shooting pains with this chest pain in my jaw, and both arms.  The pain eventually went away, but I get some shooting stuff still.  However, I never, ever have had a hard time breating, even with the pain and pressure right behind my sternum.  It scares the hell out of me, and my BP shoots way up, but again, no breathing problems, and if I sweat at all, I believe it's anxiety related since I can usually stop the sweating with breathing exercises.  I'm just in hell right now though. Not sure if I should push for a cath, or echo.  But, last night I did spin class for over an hour with just one quick shooting pain that lasted less than 10 seconds.  Felt great for a good 2 hours afterwords.  Anxiety and GERD?  Possible, probable?. I burped all the htime agian today.  ARGH.\n\n",

    "content": "First time so I'm not sure if I'm doing this right., about 3 wks. ago I started feeling tired, very tired then a low grade fever and congestion. I went to the doctor and she gave me a shot of antibiotic with B-12 and cortizone combined together. Then gave me a prescription of[ levaquin, antibiotic :prednisone; and humibid. I took this for two days but felt I was feeling worse with the med. so I stopped taking it. After this I started with an rapid heart rate that would come and go, so about a week ago I started taking my blood pressure and heart rate. normal for me is 120/60 to 70 with a heart rate of 60 to 70, now it is 120/80 to 82 with a heart rate of 90 to 95, the stange thing is it is not consant, but it will stay this way for several hours. Then go to normal again. I hope you can help , Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Larry, I can\u2019t really say why she put you on the meds that she did (though I don\u2019t think that is really your concern), I can however comment on your blood pressure and heart rate.  No ones vital signs (which includes BP and HR) are ever constant, they vary depending on the position your in, activity level (day to day as well as immediately before), how much coffee, cigarettes or even chocolate, you\u2019ve had that day, stress level, and so on.  So although sources you may be looking at may say that a normal BP is 120/80 and a normal HR is 72 beats per minute, this is meant a guideline only and is not to be taken as gospel.  The BP and HR\u2019s that you mentioned sound normal, with the possible exception of a HR of 90 \u2013 95, which is a bit quick (a bit!), I would wonder if there was some anxiety involved there (which is common).  The thing to remember, is if you have any questions at all ask your Dr(s). if you don\u2019t understand, ask again, and again until you do.  I would recommend though against stopping prescription medications without consulting a Dr. first. Take care\n\n",

    "content": "Larry, I definately agree with emskie.  The fluctuating vital signs you're showing are quite normal with the exception of the elevated heart rate of 90 -95; although as emskie already said, that can result from anxiety.  But I can't stress enough that you should ask your doctor as many questions as it takes for you to understand why he/she is prescribing you what she is.  Without knowing your age and previous medical history its hard to assess why you are getting B-12 shots but I hope you are feeling better and your follow up yields some answers.

An elevated body tempreature can be a normal yet nonspecific response to a myraid of conditions, in your condition, a fever maybe able to clue physicians in on what maybe causing the temperature elevation.   A condition known as Dressler's Syndrome maybe the culprit to the fever you are experiencing.  Of course this is not conclusive but your physican will be able to auscultate the pericardial friction rub (a type of murmur specific to patients with pericarditis - inflammation of the pericardium).  This condition is relatively common 2-10 weeks after an MI episode and based on your history, I would be concerned if I were your physician.    Sincerely,  Student Doc\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Needinghelp,  Given the risk factors that you have or the lack thereof and the characteristics of your chest pain, the probability that your chest pain is related to coronary disease (the number one feared cause of chest pain) is very low. Your chest pain, given its characteristics can be caused by: - Neck problems. - Acid reflux disease (heart burn). - Anxiety.  This being said, however, there is a cause of chest pain that one should always think of when it comes to chest pain in the younger age patient population and that is a heart condition called mitral valve prolapse and it causes atypical chest pain and palpitations amongst other symptoms. It just needs to be followed up.  Please, ask your doctor about having a neck spine x-ray or even a ct scan if he/she thinks it is reasonable and to have a trial of antacids in addition to the usual measures to prevent or lower the incidence of heart burn such as not eating before going to bed, a minimal intake of caffeine (including chocolate and pop) and avoiding any food that would cause you to heart burn.  When it comes to mitral valve prolapse, an echocardiography (an ultrasound of the heart) can be diagnostic, again if your doctor thinks it is reasonable to have it done.   Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Oldnavy,  If the right sided chest pain that you feel has the same characterisitics as the chest pain that you used to have before you had the 2 stents put in, i would recommend that you see your cardiologist about this chest pain, because this could be a new coronary problem that needs to be taken care of.  If this a different chest pain, then from the characteristics of your chest pain, it could be related to: - Acid reflux disease. - Gall bladder problem. - Lung problem (given your history of smoking). - Neck spine problem.  You are already taking prevacid, i am not sure what is the dose that you are taking and whether it can be increased or not. But there are a few measures that are usually helpful like not eating or drinking immediately before bed time, less fatty foods, less caffeinated products such as coffee, chocolate, tea and pop.  You can go to your regular doctor first and ask him about an ultrasound of the abdomen to detect gall bladder problems. A chest x-ray is in order to detect any chest/lung abnormality. A neck spine x-ray might be helpful in detecting neck spine arthritis.  Also, if you can find a correlation between any particular type of food or beverage and your symptoms and try to avoid this particular type of food or beverage.

    "content": "Dear actn,  You have some risk factors for coronary disease, namely being a male, a smoker, you drink and are overweight. But you are young, not diabetic, not hypertensive and you exercise regularly. It does not look that you have a family history for coronary disease and your cholesterol profile is unknown.  Your chest pain is very atypical when it is compared to the pain caused by coronary disease.  The probability that your pain be caused by coronary disease is very low.  i can not tell you for sure what is causing your pain, but i strongly advise you to stop smoking and drinking (especially that you have an enlarged liver) and continue your exercise program.  At your age, atypical chest pain can be caused by a condition called mitral valve prolapse, which is an abnormality of the mitral valve of the heart, can be easily diagnosed or ruled out by an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and just needs to be watched.  When it comes to being tired, i suggest you have your blood count, liver functions (because of your history of having an enlarged liver) and a thyroid profile.  Because you are overweight, if you have symptoms suggestive of a condition called sleep apnea such as snoring, restless legs while asleep, someone thought that you might stop breathing while asleep, feeling not refreshed when you wake in the morning, feeling sleepy all day long and might dose off when you are doing something important like driving or talking to someone or eating, then i would strongly suggest that you talk to your doctor about it and if he/she thinks that it is indicated, for you to have a sleep study.

Stress can be hard on the heart, though and many abnormalities can happen.  In young people, mainly PVCs (palpitations), SVT (sudden very  heart rate, even at rest) and tachycardia (heart rate over 100 bpm at rest).  If one's life is very stressful, it can attribute to coronary disease, however.   This will usually show up in middle age or older.   Of course, there are exceptions to every rule in medicine.

    "content": "I would like to add to what Shannon has told you already. Having worked step-down unit on a cardiac floor for over ten years, I will tell you that heart disease can happen at any age. The American heast Association has a good discussion on statistics at their website. SVT, Supravetricular Tachycardia has many causes and some can be dangerous.  Supraventricular tachycardia (SVT) is a general term describing any rapid heart rate originating above the ventricles, or lower chambers of the heart. SVT is an arrhythmia, or abnormal heart rhythm. Specific types of SVT include atrial fibrillation, AV nodal re-entrant tachycardia, and Wolff-Parkinson-White syndrome.  SVT generally begins and ends quickly. Many people experience short periods of SVT and have no symptoms. However, SVT becomes a problem when it occurs frequently or lasts for long periods of time and produces symptoms. Common symptoms associated with SVT include palpitations, light headedness, and chest pain. SVT may also cause confusion or loss of consciousness.   Treatment of SVT is aimed at correcting the cause of the arrhythmia or controlling the rapid heart rates. SVT can occur because of poor oxygen flow to the heart muscle, lung disease, electrolyte imbalances, high levels of certain medications in your body, abnormalities of the heart's electrical conduction system, or structural abnormalities of the heart. Your doctor will try to correct the cause of the SVT. However, if there is no apparent cause for the SVT, methods of controlling the periods of rapid heart rates are tried. Medications are generally helpful in maintaining a normal heart rhythm. Interventions such as cardioversion or electrophysiology study/catheter ablation may be required to control the SVT.   If you are having symptoms you think may be heart related, the FIRST thing to do is call your doctor.\n\n",

Rest Echo Analysis: Technically difficult study. Endocardium poorly seen. Tape alse reviewed. Normal resting left ventricular size and function. No regional wall motion abnormalities. (I assume he couldn't see much, but what he did looks normal)  Stress Echo Analysis: Limited views, only one 4 chamber image available. Equivocal small area of lateral apical ischemia. Consider stress nuclear images to better assess this area. (Dr. simply said he saw some changes at the bottom of my heart...which means?)  I have been set up for a Cardiac Perfusion Stress Test with Adenosine for Aug. 31. With instructions that if I felt any pain or heart like related symptoms to get to the hospital right away. And then she said, it is possible it's nothing to worry about.  Couldn't be more of a mixed message.   Also, ECG starts out with 'Normal Sinus rhythm'  4 minutes after start 'Sinus tachycardia' (what does this mean?) and Otherwise normal ECG At 6 minutes still has 'Sinus tachycardia' 'Low voltage QRS' and 'Abnormal ECG' At 9 minutes still has 'Sinus tachycardia' 'Low voltage QRS' and 'Borderline ECG' At 12 minutes same as 9 minutes At 15 minutes 'Sinus tachycardia' 'Low voltage QRS' and 'Abnormal ECG' also says 'Poor data quality, interpretation may be adversely affected.' At 18 minutes 'Sinus tachycardia' and 'Otherwise normal ECG' Back at baseline of 100 bpm 'Normal sinus rhythm' 'Low voltage QRS' 'Borderline ECG'  They never went through the ECG results with me, the report said see seperate ECG report'.  Sorry to be so full of questions, would just like to understand.  Thanks for any help you can give. Pam\n\n",

    "content": "The problem viewing the heart on echocardiogram is due to body habitus (obesity).  The low voltage QRS is also mostly due to obesity and edema, or in cases of kidney problems, which a basic chemistry would rule out - but usually it's obesity.  Obesity also affects treadmill tests, as the leads have too much fat to read the electrical impulses correctly.  The adenosine will definitely be accurate.  The ischemic findings on echo are probably also equivocal.   If there is any ischemia present, you will need to undergo an angiogram to actually visualize any possible narrowing of the artery  Sinus tachycardia just means rapid heart rate (over 100 bpm) which is expected when exercising, so not to worry about that.  When your doctor advised the ER if you experience and chest pain, it just means \"better safe than sorry\" due to the unclear results of your tests thus far.   I hope this helps you relax; if there was anything definitively worrisome, you would have been sent straight to the cath lab for an angiogram.\n\n",

Also, insurance companies will not pay for the Adenosine/thallium stress tests until the less expensive ones have been done, because obesity does not guarantee an equivocal result.  Also, the treadmill and echo tests are noninvasive, so no chance of a reaction to the isotopes.    It is very necessary to do the adenosine, since there is even a chance there is something abnormal.  If they didn't and you had a heart attack, you would have wanted them to have done it, right?    They are following the proper sequence of diagnostics.\n\n",

I have never heard this before but am worried as i have suffered chest pain for years and more recently had these symptoms of a a blocked head and dizzines which i had just started to attribute towards an ear problem but now i am worried they mean something more sinister. Please could you advise?\n\n",

    "content": "The longevity of bypass grafts can vary significantly from patient to patient. In general, approximately 1/3 of bypass grafts done with veins are expected to be closed at approximately 10 years, 1/3 will have significant disease within them by 10 years and 1/3 will remain widely open at 10 years. Bypass grafts utilizing arteries such as the internal mammary artery have a 95% chance of remaining open at 10 years. Factors that improve the longevity of bypass grafts are not fully understood, but aggressive management of all risk factors is strongly recommended. Most importantly, a healthy lifestyle which includes complete discontinuation of smoking is necessary. In addition, the patient\u2019s physician may prescribe medication including aspirin.  If necessary, an individual can undergo more than one coronary artery bypass surgery (as in your case), although the risks involved with repeat surgeries does increase.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - I'm a 35 year old female.  The last day or so I have had some weird things going on that I'm not sure what to think of --- My left arm has been going numb and really hurting.  It seems to radiate from my chest all the way down my arm.  This kept me up for almost one whole night and continued into the next day.  The heaviness in my chest is really disconcerting to me since it's almost hard to take a deep breath.  I have never thought I would be a canidate for heart problems since I have VERY low blood pressure - my last reading was 70/42. Although I have to admit for the last few days I have been feeling nausea and dizziness. The dizziness is fairly normal for me since I have such low blood pressure.  I looked up heart attack symptoms on the internet and it seemed like I had alot  of the symptoms (no sweating) but have not been to the dr. as of yet.  I don't want to make more of this than it is.  Also, it seems like if it were a heart attack it would have happened and been done already.  But, I don't know --- which is why I\"m asking.  Would having low blood pressure and being VERY anemic cause any of these symptoms?  Should I see a dr.?  I have never experienced any of these symptomes before and am curious if it is possible to have a heart attack and not have it be severe enough to seek medical attention as I haven't yet.  Thanks for any help you may be able to give me.\n\n",

    "content": "You need to see a doctor as soon as possible, without exerting yourself.   I doubt that a doctor will venure an opinion about what else it might be other than a heart attach or angina, because you have enough symptoms that is a dangerous possibility.  A heart attack is not likely to go away until you do something about the causes.  Your anemia makes you more susceptible to angina and heart attack because you have less red blood or less hemoglobin to carry oxygn to your heart.  Low blood pressure does not protect against heart attack, though statistically people with high blood pressure are more at risk of the vessel damage that leads to heart attack.  I'm surprised a woman would be reluctant to seek help, I see reluctance often in men.  Perhaps you can't afford help, but the emergncy room of your community hospital will treat you for your chest pain.\n\n",

    "content": "Obviously, I cannot rule out something as dangerous as a cardiac cause for your chest pain over the internet, but according to your description this chest pain is probably not secondary to coronary disease.  Since the pain is sharp and can increase with coughing (movement), it is probably not your heart; it is probably musculoskeletal.  Try taking ibuprofen unless you have a history of peptic ulcer disease, take it every 4-6 hours and see if you gets some relief.  You may have to take it for several days to get full effect; antiinflammatories are accumulative.  For the burning, try some Gaviscon it's the best OTC remedy for heartburn.  If you get absolutely no relief from either of these, see a doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have suffered for about four years with reoccuring left arm pain. The lower portion of my arm and my hand goes numb and this is accompanied my a pressing pain in my upper arm. Although this is not associated with any chest pain, it is  sometimes accompanied by an uneasy sensation in my chest and shortness of breath.. This does not seem to depend on any form of exersion but is sometimes triggered by very smokey conditions and i was a former smoker of 30 a day. I was able to ignore these symptoms until last year when i was shopping and felt a very sudden jumping heartbeat which lasted for about thirty seconds and then disappeared and since then i have had continuous missed beats and a flip flop feeling in my chest which is accompanied by a dizzy and disorientated feeling as if i have gona outside with flu.. My Doctor ordered a Holter monitoring test which showed only pvcs and pabs. On a cardiologists examination incomplete right bundle brach block was discovered but other than that all was well. My Cholesterol is normal, as is my blood pressure and i have had thorough blood tests all of which were normal. I have also had a stress test, echocardiogram and an ultrafast EBT test which showed a calcium score of 1. I have no exceptional family history of heart disease although my mother has angina at 53. I am only 24 but also have other circulation problems such as varicose veins and raynaud's. I was wondering if ALL of these tests could be missing something or whether it is possible that all of these symptoms are unconnected to eachother. Any feedback would be very useful. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear lis_babe,  If your mother has proven angina at 53 years of age then you have positive family history of coronary disease.  Otherwise, you don't have any major risk factor and since your symptoms are atypical as compared to those of coronary disease, the probabality that these symptoms be due to coronary disease is very low to begin with even before the tests. Since you had all these tests that came back negative, then these symptoms are definitely not due to coronary disease.  From your symptoms, i suggest that you have your neck spine evaluated.

Im 21 years old, 6'5 and weigh between 230-240 and I lift weights, my arm is pretty big, I measured it and its about 14 inces around ( the blood pressure machine says this cuff is designed for arms 9 to 13 inches). So I was wondering if this could give me higher readings then normal if the cuff is too small. I went home after that and my blood pressure was 139/90 on my home cuff ( but it says designed for arms up to 13 inches only also). I wanted to know if these small cuffs could be making my readings higher, anyone know? Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tonarimmer, I would like to first say I am sorry about your mom. Please be assured that you are not responsible for your mother's death. The SASH method, (saline, antibiotic, saline, heparin) is the standard protocol for PICC line care as with most of the special types of IV catheters. There are numerous reasons for the development of blood clots. Blood clots may develop in the legs of people whom are quite ill, bedridden for a period of time, (stagnates blood flow) and have recently undergone a major surgery etc. These clots break loose travel to the lung, and often cause respiratory failure. Although the chances are increased for a blood clot to form in the arms of people who have recently had special IV catheters placed because of the irritation to the veins wall, I would attribute her incidence to being ill, and recently undergoing a surgical procedure, not you using the SASH method protocol for the PICC line care.  It sounds as though your mom had been quite ill, again please be assured it's not your fault. May you have an abundance of blessings for taking the time in caring for your mom.

Thanks for listening and responding, I so appreciate!  Have a wonderful day.\n\n",

You can second guess matters until your \"blue in the face\", so to speak and it will not solve the questions nor will it change the outcome. I believe things happen for a reason and we may not understand them or agree with them especially when loved one's are involved. Our, albeit, selfishness, would keep loved ones here forever, and that's just impossible. You change the things you can, the rest you learn to not worry about, and placing blame when events occur that are out of your control does much more harm than good.Take care and good luck with your studies  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Chest pain every morning when I wake up, 21 years old",
    "content": "Hello,  For as long as I can remember I have chest pain just about every morning I wake up ( ever since I was under 10 I believe). The pain is dull feeling pain in my left side of chest and kinda goes back to my back, if I take a deep breath it hurts more. Its almost like a hollow feeling in my chest, its hard to describe. I just thought maybe it was my Mitral Valve Prolapse because it can cause chest pain. Anyways the Pain will go away after I get up within a few mintues always. I have noticed if I sleep on a hard floor it hurts more the next morning as if I sleep on a soft bed, but none the less im pretty sure its not my bones or muscles. I do not know what to think of this, I read up about Agnina and I heard the worst kind is to have when you wake up every morning and your chest hurts and is a sign of a heart attack coming soon. But this has been going on my whole life and hasnt changed in intensity or anything really. Im 6'5, 230 pounds ( muscle mainly). I workout, exercise and all.... but when I go to the doctors office I have high blood pressure. The thing is I get extremly nervous at docs office, m heartbeat goes up to like 120, when at home it runs as low as the 40s and usually is 70s-80s. The doctor said I have white coat syndrome, I get so nervous I start sweating, my face turns red, my eyes go bloodshot and I cant even breath good sometimes im so nervous,lol. Anyways im fine once I leave the docs office,lol. But does anyone know what this chest pain could be, im scared it could be im about to have heart attack, but at such a young age? Also if I have had this my whole life could it really be the worst type of Angina?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Heres a little info I left out,lol. I have a bone on my left side of chest ( near center) that sticks out slightly, you cannot see it any more because I have put on a little weight in the chest area, but when I was younger and skinner you could see it. I read up about it and found it could easily be cause by Mitral Valve Prolapse, but cound this have anything to do with my pains? As the way I sleep on my chest with the bone sticking out could be causing a pain because it is sore from me sleeping on it all night? Im just real concerned about this as of now, when I was younger I noticed the pain but never told anyone really,lol. Sometimes the pain will make me wake up, it seems to get worse the longer I lay there in the morning hours like if I sleep in late. I just hope one of my arteries are not clogged and not recieving enough oxygen, I do eat alot of food but thats because I exercise alot. When I exercise I never really get any chest pains or anything, could this just be related to MVP? Anyways thanks for your time, sorry to post so much,lol. See ya\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not an MD, but clinical medical assistant and worked in Internal Medicine/Cardiology for 11 years.  It is definitely not angina!  Angina comes on when there is a lack of oxygen to the heart muscle (ischemia) and is during periods of peak excercise, or even a little activity for someone with severe coronary artery disease and is characterized by heaviness on the chest and marked shortness of breath.  Angina can also be from spasms of the arteries of the heart, sometimes during cold weather.  I don't believe either of these apply to you.  If it was angina, you wouldn't be able to affect the pain by breathing deeply.  Do you lift weights?  This is one of the most common causes of musculoskeletal chest pain in young men who exercise.  As far as MVP, usually the most common symptom is frequent palpitations.  It is much more common in women.  Try taking 400-800 mg of ibuprofen (with doctor's permission, of course) for a week and see if it doesn't either get much better or resolve completely.  But, you must take any antinflammatory daily, it has to accumulate to work properly, and won't work right away in most cases.\n\n",

    "title": "Stress Test Results confusion",
    "content": "Hello, I had previously posted regarding chest pain and ischemia and have further information now that has only served to confuse me more.  I am hoping someone can give me some further information.  I am 29 years old, obese, and a smoker.  I do not have a family history of early heart disease; my grandfather died at the age of 85 of a heart attack and that is about it.  My total cholesterol is 182, LDLs are 108, triglycerides are 42.  Blood pressure runs around 116/62.  I have prediabetes.  Blood enzyme tests taken twice over a three day period after chest pains were \"totally normal\" according to the doctor.  I have been diagnosed with GERD in the past as a cause for some chest pains, but recent chest pains have been different in nature than the GERD chest pains I have had in the past.  Have been told I have \"esophageal sludge\" in my gallbladder.  Was told that my ECG had an inverted T wave in V1.  Took a thallium stress test.  Was told at that time that the ECG readings were normal, although when I went from a resting to a standing position my T waves inverted again, then flipped themselves upright.  The results of the stress test indicated \"suspected mild ischemia\", but then went on to say that it could be an \"artifact\" as a result of the position of my breast between the resting and stress testing.  Results noted that the computer analysis did not note any ischemia.  My doctor wants to treat me \"aggressively\" with Crestor, Aspirin, Glucophage.  However, I am very prone to side effects from medication and would like to avoid taking any if at all possible.  Based upon the information given above, I have no idea if I actually have ischemia because the information conflicts between the stress test pictures and computer analysis and what my doctor is telling me.  Should I pump a bunch of drugs in my system?  Given  the other information about my cholesterol, heart disease, blood pressure, etc, am I a \"walking heart attack at any moment\" the way my doctor is telling me or is she just trying to scare me?  I should note that my doctor is a BIG proponent of gastric bypass surgery and keeps telling me that I'm going to die within the next five years if I don't get it.  I am overweight, indeed, but would like to avoid that type of major surgery if at all possible and think that, with a few lifestyle changes  I'll be okay.  I am also planning to begin taking Zyban within the next week to quit smoking, as I know that is something I very much need to do.  However, if I do have heart disease and/or ischemia and am going to \"die soon\"  as I keep getting told then I'm willing to reconsider my position on that surgery as well.  Thank you very much for your time!  R\n\n",

If he had a thallium stress, then he already had a treadmill, unless he is too obese to walk fast enough to get an accurate result.  Thallium images show (not as well as angiograms) possible blockage in an artery.  If there was evidence of a blockage, they would have scheduled an angiogram.  T-waves can flip, V1 only is nothing to get to upset about, it was very likely artifact.  ECGs are not always as accurate on obese persons because there is too much density between the electrode and the electrical current it is measuring, allowing for more artifact.  Amazingly, your choleststerol/HDL levels are fine.  HDL under 135 is ideal.  You definitely are a ticking time bomb with the smoking, lack of excercise, obesity and now prediabetes.  Actually, you are either diabetic or you're not.  It would be a very good idea for you to take the Glucophage, it will keep your glucose levels around normal BUT you still have to follow a diabetic diet and EXCERCISE!  Lose the weight and quite smoking or you will die young, guaranteed.    Average age for developing Diabetes type II is mid 40's.  You are 29!!!!  Take this as a wake up call.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Any advice would be great",
    "content": "Dear Amma,  To decide whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, two things are assessed, major risk factors that the patient (suffering from chest pain) has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain (as compared to those caused by chest pain of coronary origin), the probability of this pain be due to coronary disease is then determined.  If the patient has had many risk factors and the pain is typical coronary pain, the probability is high, if the patient does not have any risk factors and the pain is atypical, the probability is very low. And there are other probablities in between.  This same probability is used to predict the results of stress tests as well. Meaning that if the probability that this pain be due to coronary disease is very low or low, then the probability that the stress test is going to be positive is also very low or low.   Stress tests are not perfect, otherwise, other procedures to diagnose coronary disease wouldn't have been developed.  About your question about fatigue, these symptoms can not just be taken out of the whole picture and the question answered, it has to be put into the clinical context and answered. Reason being, that fatigue is a very non-specific symptom of heart disease and many other diseases.  In your case, you did not mention any major coronary risk factors (besides drinking) and the characteristics of your chest pain sound atypical, so the probability (irrespective of you being a female of the child bearing age) of this pain be due to coronary disease is very low. On top, as i understand that you had a negative stress test.  There is one heart cause of chest pain called mitral valve prolapse which is diagnosed by echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) and just needs to be followed.   i recommend that you have an echocardiogram if you have not had one yet to exclude this condition which is a cause of chest pain and palpitations in otherwise healthy young individuals.  Other causes of chest pain include reflux disease, neck problems, local chest causes such as inflammation of the cartilages of the risbs of the chest and anxiety.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "This morning I woke up with my left arm asleep. I had been sleeping on it for at least four hours with my right hand curled up tightly against my chest in the fetal position. When I moved to my back the hand immediateely stopped tingling but I noticed a vague pain to the left of my breastbone towards the left nipple area. I got up and walked a little bit but the pain did not change.  Movement also did not change the pain.  There were no other symptoms.  I lay on my back and tried massaging the area but this did not change the symptom. The feeling went away after about 20 minutes, shortly after I started to lie on my right side.  I have not noticed this symptom before.  The feeling has not returned so far.   I walk about 2.25 miles per day in 30 minutes on a treadmill and have never noticed any chest pain doing this.  I had a recent CT chest scan for a lung infection which showed no abnormalities. Pulse 74 BP 131/78.   My total cholesterol is 247. LDL 140, HDL 89 and triglyceride 93.  Could this pain just have been from the way I was sleeping? The pain was not a pressure or squeezing type of pain.  It was more just like a sensation of feeling something in that area that is not usually there\n\n",

I have been working out on the treadmill and going for bike rides  and playing Basketball with the kids since then with no reocurrance. I would think if it was heart related the exercise would cause it to happen again. Perhaps it is related to starting to play Basketball again as I am Left Handed.

    "content": "I had triple by-pass surgery four months ago.  My symptoms were classic but all of my tests, stress tests, nuclear tests, ekgs, echocardiograms, were all normal.  Because of the  repeated symptoms of angina and chest pain I was given an angiogram that showed three arteries almost totally blocked.  The doctor told me that when all of the arteries are blocked the tests look normal. I feel very fortunate to have discovered the blockages and have the surgery.  My question is, can a person continue having angina after successful by-pass surgery? I have had severe pain in my right arm lately and am short of breath walking up stairs again.  This makes no sense to me because I just had the by-pass surgery.  I live 350 miles from a cardiologist and hospital.  Is it important to have these pains checked out?  A trip to Anchorage is expensive and a big deal, however I will make one if it is important.  Thank you for your interest and reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jackie,  If the chest pain that you have been having after the surgery is similar to the one that you were having before surgery, then it is a must that you see your cardiologist as soon as possible.  If the pain is not the same, i suggest that you call your cardiologist to report the pain and see what are his/her thoughts about this pain.  It is not unexpected to have some chest pain after a surgery that involves opening of the chest by cutting the breast bone and having chest tubes and wires amongst others. If the pain is getting worse or similar even the slightest similarity to the pain that you used to have before surgery, you need to see your cardiologist immediately.  As to your new shortness of breath, i am not sure whether you had your cardiac rehab course completed or not, but it is very helpful to have it completed.  Shortness of breath can be caused by many causes starting from being physically unfit and ending at heart failure. After a bypass, not being physically fit, diaphragmatic paralysis, pleural effusion (fluid around the lung) are potential causes. Recurrence of angina can be a cause as well. i suggest that you contact your doctor (does not have to be your cardiologist) to be seen and examined regarding this new onset shortness of breath.

    "content": "Hello,  For a while now, I had been having chest pains, that radiate to my arms and to the left center of my chest. I have been going to the hospital, which to say they keep me all the time. They always tell me nothing. The last event was in Novemebr of 2004. I was on my way to Iowa to visit a sick cousin in the hospital and the whole entiire time I had what felt like reflex. So, I try and doctor myself with gavsicon, to no avail. When I retunred home the next day, I went to the ER, my second home. They fussed as usual and put leads and did the whole cardiac blood work up. They were even giving me nitro. At some point the nurse asked how I was feeling, and I lied and told her that I was no longer in pain, but I was srill having them. Since that was the only way to get up into a room, instead of in the ER department all night.    I am too young for this heart stuff and maybe this chest pain is all in my head. Well, to make a long story short, I had to get a opertive report to send to my insurance company, and they gave me more info that I needed. So I read these papers, and started to worry. Now I'm here to see if this stuff is all in my head. The chest pain always happens when I either have a flutter, and or funny skipped beats to my hearts. Then all the pain seems to stay or linger for a few days coming off and on and on. Better if I take the nitro.  I am trying to ingore it, but it continues anyway.   Anyway, my test says: serial troponins .010 Elevated Ck1 Mild centric LVH and trace mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery pressure was at the upper limits of normal and equal to 29. Hyperglycemia at 117 PTT 25.6 PT 11.1 INR 1.0Platelets 267 total bili 0.1 alk phos 84 AST 19, Total Cholesterol 168, Triglycerides 134, HDL cholesterol 35, and LDL colesterol 106 CK# 1 was elevated at 420..  Now I know my doctor is not in the room, however, with what I have provided, should I take the chest pains more seriously. Or is it all in my head. I have been having chest pains and dizziness since friday night of this past week end, all since the flutters and skipped beats... After all I'm only fourty, so, I guess I can answer this myself.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Confused on this heart stuff???",
    "content": "Dear Vanessa,  You are fairly young (and females in the child bearing age are naturally protected against coronary disease), you have 2 major risk factors for coronary disease, hypertension and smoking. Your chest pain is not typical as compared to that of coronary disease. The probability that this chest pain be due to coronary disease is low. This means that if a stress test is done, most probably it is going to be normal.  Many patients can not describe the feeling of having extra-beats (flutter or skipped beats as you referred to them) so they refer to it as chest pain or discomfort. This could be the cause of chest pain in your case. i recommend that you have a 24 hour heart monitor if not already done to see how much of these skipped beats you have because if they are the cause of this chest discomfort, there are medications that you can take for both the hypertension and the palpitations at the same time. You are taking lasix which can make the potassium lower, and lisinopril which can make the potassium higher, i recommend that you have an electrolyte blood test including magnesium as well to make sure that abnormal potassium level is not behind the palpitations.  With your history of Nissen fundoplication, the pain that you have might be related to this problem as well, recurrence of the hiatal hernia or acid reflus disease. i recommend that you try an over the counter anti-acid to see whether it is going to help.

    "content": "I have seen my Internist 4 times this last year. I have told him about my extreme fatigue, inability hold onto objects and an inability to carry groceries into the house. I've had two \"industrial accidents\" involving my head and overhead metal objects because, in the first one, I just didn't  have a sense of what was around me and the second one, I couldn't get out of the way in time to avoid being hit. I have no stamina and very little strength. This has been going on for about a year. He has no ideas about what is causing these symptoms and ordered no tests. I am currently taking Avalide 300/12.5 for mild hypertension for the last year and one half.  Because recently I'm having difficulty breathing, tachycardia , chest pressure (no pain) and \"feeling of impending doom\" he has referred me to a cardiologist who has scheduled me for a nuclear stress test, and if that is inconclusive, a cardiac catheterization. Still, no blood work has been done. The lab said they would be doing a kidney function test to see that I can clear the \"dye\" OK, but no mention of anything else.  A year and a half ago I had a potassium level of 3.6  - the test was done then because of PVCs and  I had an echocardiiogram which showed mild LVH, but nothing else. This level was down from a 4.7 the previous year (this was before I started taking Avalide 300/12/5). Now, a year and a half later I feel so bad and so tired I can't continue to work.   I have been reading with interest your replies to posts about cardiac symptoms and you mention low potassium as a possible explanation for these symptoms. How low does potassium have to be until it produces cardiac symptoms? Wouldn't a potassium test be a standard, if not a required,  thing to have before I have  these tests?  My mother-in-law went to the ER last year with cardiac symptoms and that was one of the first things they did. Would the fact  this is a clinic rather than an ER make a difference? Thanks for your reply.   SallyL\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sally,  You said that you are taking avapro in your profile and in the post you said that you are taking avalide which is a combination of a diuretic (hydrocholorothiazide) plus the same active ingredient that is present in avapro (irbesartan).  It you are taking avalide, i think you should have your blood pressure checked when you are lying down and you are standing up and if it is lower when you are standing up, then you might be dehydrated because the medication that you take contains a diuretic.   Avalide is known to cause low potassium, sodium and magnesium and increase in the blood sugar. On the clinical level it can cause fatigue, headaches and dizziness.  i would recommend a blood test for electrolytes including the potassium, sodium and magnesium levels, a blood sugar level, a liver enzyme blood test a thyroid blood test and as well.

    "content": "I am a relatively healthy 27 year old male with no history of health problems. In the last five or six days i have had some pain on the left side of my chest. Actually, more slight discomfort than pain. I have had some actual pain on the inside of my left collar bone and at times on my right collar bone. this pain also appears occassionally on the front of my right underarm/chest. For the last two weeks i have been at a new job where, for now, I am working at a conference table which gives me horrible posture. Today I have been focusing on better posture to see if that is it and some of the pain has disapeared. However, the inside of my left pectoral is sore and I do get some feeling of discomfort \"inside\" my chest, more on the left side. I think the pectoral soreness appears to be the muscle as when I press on it i feel the soreness above the ribs. None of this \"pain\" or discomfor gets worse when I am active and certainly hasn't inhibited anything i have been doing.  I'm just wondering if anyone has felt this or knows what might be going on. Of course I always think the worst.  Thanks\n\n",

Your risk factors include you being a male. Your chest pain characteristics sound atypical, so the probabililty of this chest pain being due to coronary disease is very low.

    "content": "I am a 51 year old female. Diagnosed 2 years ago with SLE, but relatively symptom free except for mild joint pain and sun sensitivity.  I have had slight discomfort in my left chest for the past year. A recent EKG noted \"Inferior Myocardial Infarction\" . The test result showed:  Q Waves inferiorly  II-III aVF Poor R-wave progression V1-V3  A Holter monitor noted Palpitations of up to 2.5 minutes to 130bpm. Typical heart beat is 67bpm.  2-D Echo showed --Left ventricle small. Est. ejection fraction 65-70% No regional wall abnormalities     --Trace Tricuspid regurgitation  On a recent visit to a cardiologist he dismissed the chest discomfort, ordered Atenolol 50mg, if I wanted. Told me to not worry and that I was very healthy.  The Atenolol has helped the discomfort and tachycardia.  I feel as though I was dismissed without the answers I was hoping for regarding the abnormal EKG, which still reads the same.  Can you explain the results of the EKG?  Why are they of no concern to this cardiologist?   What do these results mean?  Why were no further test done?  I will have this discussion with my Rheumotologist, who the Cardiologist was to confer with. But am wondering your opinion.  I should note that I have been drug and alcohol free for 25 years, but was an alcoholic and cocaine abuser for years prior to that. Could this have an affect on the situation?  Is this something I should mention to the Rheumie?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abnormal ekg",
    "content": "Dear rpelley133,  It is important to elaborate on the chest pain a little bit more to know its characteristics in order to know whether or not it resembles the pain of coronary disease.  For one to decide whether or not chest pain is due to coronary disease, major risk factors for coronary disease and characteristics of pain are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined. You don't have any major risk factors for coronary disease but i am not sure about the characteristics of the pain.  If your pain is atypical, then most probably, this pain is not due to coronary disease. If your pain is typical, this pain could or could not be due to coronary disease.  So, i think that your cardiologist believes that your pain is atypical. i think if your cardiologist thought that your pain is typical, most probably he would have ordered a stress test.  Any myocardial infarction pattern on an ekg could be a false positive, ekgs are not the best tool to diagnose or confirm the diagnosis of coronary disease.   q waves in leads ii, iii and av-f can mean for instance that you are short and stout or that when the ekg was done, you were in expiration rather than in insipiration.  q waves usually mean that the patient had a previous heart attack, this heart attack should appear on the echocardiogram as well which is way far better than the ekg to find abnormal contracting walls in the heart (sign of previous heart attacks). You don't have a history of heart attacks and your echo did not show that you have an abnormally contracting inferior wall, so i think that you don't have to worry about that.  The tachycardia on the holter should be correlated to your diary of activity and if you were doing any activity at that time that would explain the tachycardia and i think the atenolol would not be needed.  Chest pain in an sle patient could be due other reasons such as inflammation of the membranes surrounding the lungs amongst others. i would definitely recommend that you mention this pain to your rheumatologist.

    "content": "Thank you for your fast reply!  Well, could be the Cardiologist is correct. I just felt left with no good explanations other then his \"every heart is unique and EKG's can be quirky\". He elaborated that I'm the healthiest person he's seen all day     I'm 5'6\" and 145 pounds. I excercise routinely, lift weights and power walk. I never have discomfort when excercising.  The discomfort typically happens at night, laying in bed, or late in the afternoon, at rest.  It can be a pounding in my chest with rapid heartbeat. The pounding moves up into my throat, with skipped or early beats.  The discomfort can also be a twinge or fleeting stabbing feeling that is in the left chest. Sometimes it moves into my left back, between the shoulder blades. It can also radiate down my arm and give me a tightness in the chest. This past summer this was happening one night...I could not lay on my left side because the pain in my chest hurt more when I rolled over.  My left arm became numb.  I got up, took an aspirin and went back to bed. The pain did pass. That was probably the worst night. My husband's comment was that I probably pulled a muscle excercising. Could be...............    I did note my activity on the Holter dairy and I was at rest when the episodes happened.  I  mentioned this pain to my Rheumatologist, she suggested the EKG, Holter and Echo. As well as Pulmonary function tests which came back fine.    I did intitally blame this discomfort and palpitations on menopause, which I have plowed through this year.  That could be the cause.  The Atenolol does help with the sensations, but if I find it leaves me too tired, perhaps I will \"tough it out\" as the Cardiologist suggests.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear rpelley133,  Thank you very much for the update.  What you describe sounds actually more of a palpitation description to me than chest pain. And it is not typical, so there is no fear here.  However, with the back and arm pain, i would also suggest that you have a neck x-ray/ct scan to exclude cervical spine problems.  Your symptoms can definitely be due to menopause.   Atenolol and all of the beta blockers group actually are notorious for this side effect of leaving people very tired and fatigued and some people actually decide to stop them.  If atenolol is giving you relief, i would recommend trying the least dose possible that would give you relief of symptoms without the side effect if possible.  Please, don't stop the atenolol suddenly on your own, this has to be done under medical supervision, because sudden cessation can lead to rebound high blood pressure and angina.

    "content": "Dear Annaliza,  There are ekg machines that interpret ekgs automatically. These interpretations need to validated and confirmed by doctors. Anterior infarct pattern can appear on ekg (falsely) especially if the ekg leads are not positioned properly on the chest of the patient.  If your blood pressure medications do not control your blood pressure, then higher doses of the same medications or other medications have to be tried, it is a matter of trial and error, every patient is different.  Flow across a patent foramen ovale is not usually very high and does not affect the size of the left atrium much, an uncontrolled blood pressure can cause an increase in the size of the left atrium.  The question about how many heart attacks and strokes is many times a routine part of the history taking and it does not mean that you ever had any. i think that most doctors will tell their patients the most important and relevant information needed, however, there might be some minor details that they think are not going to add much to the info already available to the patient, but i think that they are ready to ask any question that any of their patients asks.

    "content": "My boyfriend is from Africa and has been in the US for 5 years. He is 32 years old. He has had a history of chest pain since the age of 10. Being from an area that's very behind with technologic advances, his condition has never been treated properly. He does not take his condition seriously. He refuses to see a doctor. It is frustrating me because I am a nurse and know he is ill. How common is it for someone so young to have severe chest pain and it not be lethal. He is dyspeic at time, his hands/upper extremities are always clammy and diaphoretic, and experiences right arm numbness about once a month. The extreme chest pain happens several times a year. I know this case obviously seems like ischemic heart disease, but are there other rare conditions out there that may be the cause? This is hurting me terribly because I care about him a lot and I don't want to lose him.\n\n",

The symptoms you mention could easily be panic disorder also, OR many other conditions (hypoglycemia, for another). There's no way to tell without a workup. As a former ER nurse I can tell you I saw many, many patients with apparent cardiac symptoms that turned out to be panic attacks (either stress, hormone, or psychologically induced), or something else.   Has he ever had any significant disease, for example, that may have long-term residual effects? The fact that your friend has had these symptoms for some 22 years and apparently they have not worsened, and are intermittent, I would be more hopeful that it is not cardiac in origin, but again a complete physical examination and medical evaluation is needed.   You might try, and perhaps have, exploring with him any fears or concerns about seeking medical help. Get him to talk about these, and gently educate him with references on his symptoms, to help dispel his fears, if any.  You're a good, caring nurse, but as you know \"You can lead a horse to water . . .\" People's beliefs, as you know, have much to do with how they fare.  Good luck.   Holly\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Too young for chest pain",
    "content": "Dear tjackson,  Chest pain has many causes besides coronary disease.  To decide whether or not chest pain is related to coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease in the patient suffering from chest pain and the characterisitics of the pain are looked at and the probability of this pain being related to coronary disease is then determined. If the patient has many major risk factors for coronary disease (these are hypertension, diabetes, smoking, drinking, family history, advanced age, male and hypercholesterolemia) and the characteristics of the pain are typical as compared to characteristics of the pain caused by coronary disease, the probability of the pain being caused by coronary disease is very high. If the patient does not have any risk factors and the pain is atypical, the probability is low.   Taking into consideration the age at which your boyfriend started to have the pain and assuming that he was otherwise healthy then (as you did not mention him having any other disease), the probability that the pain that he had then was not due to coronary disease.  If the pain that he has now is the same as the one that he was having back then, most probably, he does not have coronary disease now as well.  As Holly said, your boyfriend needs to be evaluated by a health care professional to decide what is going on with him and whether or not it is serious.  Having said that, however, this is not most probably related to heart disease as it sounds that your boyfriend has led an active life despite these chest pains.  Chest pain in the young age can be caused by a condition called mitral valve prolapse that needs an echocardiogram to be diagnosed. Being of african origin means that he might also have suffered from rheumatic fever when he was a child.  One's beliefs, past experience and culture can sometimes be a barrier in changing people's behavior and reaction to every day's events.

    "content": "Dear Niceone,  There are ekg machines that interpret ecgs automatically according to an algorithm. This report though has to be confirmed by a doctor because in many instances the interpretation is not correct.  Your second report says unconfirmed, so it has to be condfirmed by a doctor first to be sure that you really have st & t abnormality and exactly is this abnormality.   The first time around, it looks that your doctor wanted to rule out structural heart abnormality with the echo. Echo is more reliable than the ecg as the heart is visualized in real time.   Has your doctor seen the second ecg? If yes, what is the next step of action that he/she suggested? If no, he has to see it.  If the st-t abnormality has a cause behind it like ischemia, then treating the ischemia would take care of the ecg findings but if this was just something non-specific, i don't think that there are any medications to correct this.

He was rather causal when mentioning this (flippant, even) saying it was nothing to worry given the normal echocardiogram.

    "content": "Hi cb, The T wave on an EKG represents the repolarization or resetting of the electrical cells in the bottom chambers of the heart. Reasons for inverted T waves are numerous and may include ischemia, heart attack, hyperventilation, anxiety, certain medications, infections around the heart, pulmonary embolus (blood clot in the lung), electrolyte disturbance (abnormalities in sodium, potassium levels) etc. When an EKG is viewed, all of the waves are evaluated, not just one in particular. With this in mind and considering that the rest of the waves on the EKG appeared to him/her without any sort of defect, is probably why he/she  stated it was an essentially normal EKG. It was quite wise of you to have this checked out considering your family history and you should continue to have physical exams regularly. I hope this was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear cb,  What kind of a stress echo was it? Was it an exercise echo or a dobutamine echo or other chemical stress? And if it was an exercise echo, how long did you go on the treadmill and did you reach your predicted maximum heart rate for your age? If it was a dobutamine stress, did you reach your heart rate as well? Did you have any chest pain during the stress test whether exercise or otherwise? Did you have high blood pressure during the stress test?  Inverted t-waves are not specific for diagnosis of ischemia like Theresa mentioned and they can be caused by a slue of other things. A more specific thing would be st segment changes during exercise. The ekg stress test even is not that good alone (especially in women) but when an echo or a nuclear study is added to the ekg results, either increase the sensitivity and the specificity of the ekg. With the echo, it is even better, because if there is ischemia, it causes changes in the way the heart contracts that are seen in real time with the naked eye on the spot but the problem is that the patient is usually hyperventilating and it is not easy sometimes to get good views on a patient who was running but with the dobutamine echo, this problem is not there.  If this was an exercise stress test and you reached an advanced stage on the treadmill like state 3 or so and you did not have chest pain, there is no need to worry whatsoever, because this is a normal stress test which has been confirmed with the normal echo.  There is nothing 100% perfect except to see the coronaries and this is done via coronary angiography but in your case this is not needed.

    "content": "Dear cb,  Thank you very much for the update.  Going on the treadmill for 11 minutes means that you have a very good aerobic capacity. Your heart rate falling fast means that you are physically fit. No having chest pain and reaching your maximum predicted heart rate for your age means that your heart was maximally stressed and at maximal stress, your coronary flow is excellent as you did not have any chest pain.  There is nothing to worry about regarding this t-wave inversion. One more thing, iIf you had a hyperventillation phase before the test and this was when t-wave inversions were seen, this is a normal finding and you don't have to worry about that.  Don't assume that it is due to stress or due to anything else, you have a normal heart and ekgs are not the best evaluators of one's heart otherwise, there would not be all those other sophisticated ways of assessing the heart such as echo and coronary angiograms amongst many others.

    "content": "My sister had to have a PICC line inserted into her right arm due to being pregnant and having rather extreme Hyperemesis. While the nurse was inserting the line my sister heard \"popping\" noises and felt a little discomfort. After a few days of increasingly horrendous pain the PICC was removed and 2 DVT's were found; one in her internal jugular and another in her subclavian vein.      They put her on 105mg of Lovenox per day right away. The Hyperemisis was still bad so they inserted a mid-line in her left arm. Well, she formed a small superficial clot (about 1\" along the vein wall) in the left cephalic vein where the mid-line had been placed, so they doubled her Lovenox to 2 doses of 75mg each per day and removed the mid-line. Four days after starting the extra amounts of Lovenox, the clot in the cephalic is shown by ultrasound to be about 6-7\" long.      She has been tested for all of the major clotting factors and has come back negative on each of them. The doctors say the jugular and subclavian clots are now occlusive and \"should not\" break free and cause a pulmonary embolism. Unfortunately, after 5 days in the hospital they have decided to send her home and put her on bedrest with bathroom privileges only for the next 10 days. Even though her oxygen levels have dipped to 89% after being at 96-98% for all the other days she was in the hospital they still decided to send her home. I guess my questions are: 1. How worried need we be? 2. Seeing how the jugular and subclavian clots are occlusive, what are the chances of them breaking free? 3. After my sister has her baby will she be able to go on Urokinase or streptokinase to help dissolve the clots, or will it be too late to really make a difference and her body will have to naturally break them down over time? 4. What if the clots don't dissolve over time, will my sister have to \"take it easy\" for the rest of her life?   I am sorry for so many questions, I don't need a long answer. My family and I have been on quite the emotional rollercoaster over the last week or so and a few extra answers would really be helpful and comforting. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Branson, I can certainly understand your concern and emotional roller coaster. Generally speaking as far as a time frame these drugs streptokinase and urokinase are used within a few hours of a heart attack or stroke. They are used without any particular time frame for dissolving blood clots. They may be used during pregnancy but not generally during  the first 5 months due to the increased risk of miscarriage. Now my concerns and questions are, did they put her on any sort of blood thinner upon discharge? How did they rule out a pulmonary embolism? Oxygen saturation of 89% compared to the upper 90's concerns me as well. Is she short of breath, having any sort of chest pain? My other concern is when you stated occlusive, did they tell you that the blood clots were blocking blood flow in these areas? Please keep in mind that yes, blood clots can be dissolved and no it is unlikely that she would be on bed rest or have to \"take it easy\" for the rest of her life. You didn't state how far along in her pregnancy she was and has she ever been  given any vitamin b12 shots to help reduce the hyperemesis because in some women this has been effective. I am also forwarding this to the doctors on the forum for a more extensive opinion. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 3 Blood Clots in Upper Extremeties...worried!",
    "content": "Dear Branson,  As a measure to protect the mother against bleeding during pregnancy and labor, the blood becomes more coagulable. However, this does not mean that pregnant females should get dvts as part of a normal pregnancy or even post-partum. At this age, dvts usually ignite a battery of blood work to make sure that the patient does not have an hypercoagulable condition that requires treatment for life.  With hyperemesis and the resulting dehydration that ensues, the blood becomes even more prone to clotting.  Once in place, and this is easy to imagine, the picc line made the lumen of the vein smaller and the blood flow through it slower.  And in addition to the trauma of inserting an iv, the three major risk factors (increase in coagulability of the blood, trauma to the vessel wall and stasis of the blood) come playing together to cause thrombosis of the blood in the vein.  Pulmonary thrombosis can happen even without a dvt complicated by a part of the clot separated and going to the lungs.  There is an increased risk of pulmonary embolism from upper extremity dvt but much less than lower extremity dvt.  After ten days, the patient can resume his/her normal life because the clot becomes firmly adherent to the wall and the chances of separation become less (but are still there).  Pulmonary embolism is not easy to diagnose during pregnancy because of the high radiation exposure associated with various diagnostic procedures and the risk of miscarriage and/or fetal abnormalities. But most probably it is not really important to confirm the diagnosis of pulmonary embolism because the treatment is going to be the same as dvt which is anticoagulation.  In cases of pregnant females, saturations have to be kept a little bit higher than high 80's, they have to be in the mid 90's, as pregnant females have less reserve than the non-pregnant women.  Thrombolytic therapy (stroptokinase, urokinase) have certain indications in cases of venous thrombosis. They can be used in cases of upper extremity dvt as well.  Treatment of dvt has to be at least 3 months in patients with low risk for recurrence of dvt, 6 months for patients with intermediate risk and indefintely in cases of patients with high risk.  In cases of pregnancy, the patient is treated till the end of pregnancy with heparin and then patient is switched to warfarin.  Heparin (lovenox is a low molecular weight heparin) has a major side effects in cases it is given long term which is osteoporosis, so your sister has to take a satsifactory amount of calcium and vitamin d.

    "content": "Dear Sampson,  To decide whether or not chest pain is of coronary origin, risk factors for coronary disease (of the person complaining of chest pain) and the characteristics of pain are looked at.  You are a male, you have not reached the age where coronary disease is considered, you smoke, you might have hypertension, you don't have diabetes and there is no mention of cholesterol and your family history sound negative for coronary disease.  There are some characterstics of the chest pain that are missing in your description. How long does the chest pain last? How frequent do you get it a day? Does it go anywhere besides your chest? Any associated symptoms with the pain?  In your case, even though there still are some pieces of information that are missing about the characteristics of the pain, yet i think that the pain sounds atypical (as compared to that of coronary disease).  This, in addition to your history of having 2 compressed vertebae in your neck and the history of continuous numbness and tingling, i would say that most probably this is not pressure caused by coronary disease but by your neck problem.  This being said, however, i would like you to see your doctor for this pain, the sooner the better.

    "content": "I am a 31 yr old male. My father died of a heart attack at the age of 53. He had hypertension since mid 20's, diabetes, smoked from age 13, did not eat right, was overweight.   I do not smoke, no diabetes, I run 3-4 miles 6 days per week. I weigh 222 lbs and am 6'2.  I know that I need to lose weight. My blood pressure is normally 124/80 or so. Total cholesterol is less than 120 with hdl at 38.  My question is, I have been having some chest discomfort for about 6 wks. I would not describe it as pain, more like an anxious feeling in my chest that is uncomfortable. It will last for 5-10 minutes and go away. Is more acute for 3 hrs or so after I eat.  It seems to be worse at night.  I went to the hospital last week as got that same kind of discomfort about 30 minutes after a 40 minute run.  At the ER they took chest xray and ran resting ekg, all were normal. I followed up the my PCP the next day, He says that my C Reactive Protein is elevated but did not tell me exactly what number was.  He is sending me to a cardiologist for possible stress echo.  I also have had a panic attack 6 wks ago, these chest pains started after that experience when I thought that I was going to die.  My chest felt tight although I had no radiating pain or shortness of breath.  I had another panic attack last night that was similiar in nature.  My chest was sore for a couple of hours after that. Is all of this likely cardiac related or could it be related to panic disorder? Also, if my dad had a heart attack prior to age 55 am I incredibly more likely to have one?  How can you tell the difference between chest pain associated with a panic attack and chest pain associated with a heart attack?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Lance,  A family history of coronary disease is something that can not be changed and it is a risk factor for coronary disease and this means you have a higher chance of having coronary disease more than the poplulation with no family history of coronary disease everything else equal.  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease for the person having chest pain and the characteristics of chest pain (as compared to the typical characteristics of chest pain orginitating from coronary disease) are evaluated and then it is determined whether this chest pain is or is not of coronary origin.  You are a male with a family history of coronary disease, these are your risk factors. No smoking, hypertension, diabetes or high cholesterol. You are a bit overweight but you exercise quite a lot which is a good thing.  Regarding your chest pain, it sounds kind of atypical.   Putting also in mind the normal ekg when you had chest discomfort after the run, i think that this is not related to coronary disease, but because you are a young and active peron and you get panic attacks (just to make things more confusing) and to put your mind to ease, i think that it is best to be seen by a cardiologist for an evaluation as your doctor suggested.  Usually, the chest discomfort associated with panic attacks is not the worst symptom that the person has during the episode and it is associated with a feeling of difficulty breathing and this is the feeling that gives the chest discomfort, sometimes these feelings are associated with apprehension or fear, Sometimes, this discomfort sensation could be associated with numbness sensation in the hands. Usually the patients affected by panic attacks are younger females.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "Acute MI -- having trouble w/prognosis",
    "content": "Hi:   On November 8, my wife (age 43) was rushed to hospital, where she was treated for an acute MI resulting from a 100% occlusion of the left anterior descending artery (at the top of the artery). She underwent an emergency cardioplasty and a stent was placed. She had no significant occlusion of any other arteries. She had a follow-up angiogram 15 days after her MI, and it showed no improvement in ejection fraction, which remained at 25%. After the attack, she quit smoking and made several other lifestyle changes, including a move to a reduced-fat diet; she has no family history of heart disease and has never suffered from hypertension.   She was put on Atenolol and Lisinopril, as well as Plavix and Zocor. She could not tolerate the Atenolol or Lisinopril, which reduced her blood pressure to the point where she worried about fainting whenever she was on her feet. After a week off of both ACE inhibitors and beta blockers, she was put on Coureg, which has so far not had the same negative effect on her blood pressure. She is also on Coumadin, because doctors feared she was at elevated risk for clot-related problems. She is participating in cardiac rehab, and walks (with some breathlessness) for 30 mins with me most days.   Recently, because of the low ejection fraction and its lack of improvement, my wife's cardiologist suggested that my wife would likely be a good candidate for an ICD (internal defibrillator). She will soon meet with an electrocardiologist.   We have been doing as much Web-based research as we can about her longer-term prognosis, and have been finding the messages mixed and confusing. Some sites suggest her low EF means she already must have heart failure (even though breathlessness is her only real symptom to date), while other sites suggest she is at higher risk for eventual heart failure (as soon as scarring sets in). Some sites say that 44% of women die within one year of an MI, while others say that if you survive the first week or so your longer-term prognosis is encouraging. Other sites suggest her future may be dire because of her intolerance of the ACE inhibitors and beta blockers. What we seem to find most often are messages that suggest the low ejection fraction (still at 25% at 30 days after the MI) means it is very likely she will be permanently disabled to some extent.   My wife's doctors say that although she had a massive heart attack and her EF is very low, she \"should be okay.\" We're worried that they are painting a more encouraging picture so as not to cause us to worry excessively -- however, we're not the type of people who want anything sugar-coated. Does anyone have any clear statistics or experience to suggest what my wife's odds are, over the long run? Is the fact that she generally feels well, one month after her MI, encouraging, or is this usually just the calm before the storm (i.e., cardiac remodeling)? Any insights (or directions to other resources) would be greatly appreciated. We know that it's impossible to call anything with precision...we'd just like a more clear picture of what we're likely up against.   Thanks...Brian   p.s. This is my first-ever posting to this site, so please forgive me if I did anything wrong.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Acute mi. Having trouble with prognosis",
    "content": "Dear Brian,  The question that you are posing is not the easiest to answer.  One of the most important factors (if not the single most important) for risk stratification after an acute myocardial is how much left ventricular function is negatively affected after the event. Other factors include age, having other diseases such as diabetes and hypertension and whether there is any residual coronary ischemia.  Different studies give nearly similar percentages for annual mortality which for ef% of 21-30% was 7.7%.   In a recent study, if the ef% was < 30%, the mortality risk is decreased by one third if the patient had an aicd implanted and the benefit was greater when the ef% was < 25%.  The reason being that hald of the mortalilites is caused by deadly arrhythmias that are taken care of by the aicd.  Implanting an aicd in your wife's case is a very positive and important step in the right direction.  At the same time, your wife has to be continued on all the medications that have been found to decrease mortality as well such as the ace inhibitors and the Coreg or any of the beta blockers group and the lipid lowering agents. If your wife did not tolerate the atenolol and the lisinopril together, may be this was not a good combination for her or may be the doses were too high, i think she should be tried on lower doses of lisinopril or other medication of the ace inhibitor group, in addition she should be started on another medication that is being used widely nowadays which is aldactone if her cardiologist thinks that this is in her best interest.  At this point, i would not worry about her long term prognosis if i were you. i would make all the possibe efforts to do what her cardiologist recommend to the best of your abilities and may be add the suggestions of retrying the ace inhibitors once more as these interventions are very well proven to decrease mortality and improve the ef% and the quality of life as well.  Also, there is a fairly recent intervention called resynchronization therapy, that i am sure the electrophysiologist will talk to you about, and if he/she does not, you can mention it and see what is his/her thoughts about it.  Heart failure is a clinical syndrome, at this point your wife with just the breathlessness that she is experiencing is in a very mild degree of heart failure in my personal opinion, caused by left ventricular dysfunction with this low ef% .  The treatment of heart failure is progressing as we speak, and the future is still holding a lot of hopefully positive interventions for heart failure patients.  This is a one of the very good reviews about the predictors of mortality in patients after mi that i have bumped into recently, if you find the time, read it all, if not, you can just look through and read whatever you think is necessary. It is a little bit technical but i think that you are aware of most of the terms in it.  This is the link  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and if you still have any clarifications don't hesitate to post them.

    "content": "Dear Bobby,  Palpitations (one feeling his own heart beating) have several causes.  The most simple ones are the ones that you mentioned in your post starting with smoking, alcohol, recreational drug use, lack of sleep, too much caffeinated beverages (including pop) and anxiety.  Other causes include heart disease (valve disease, coronary disease, hypertension), electrolyte imbalance and hyperactive thyroid gland.  i would recommend that you stop smoking, stop drinking alcohol, stop using marijuana, stop all caffeinated beverages and try to get enough sleep and if the palpitations are still persistent, then i would recommend you be seen by your doctor to have some blood tests to check for electroytes in the blood and thyroid functions. If normal and the palpitations still persist, the next step is usually a Holter monitor which is a machine that you wear for 24 hours or more and it records your heart rhythm for 24 hours continuously to know what kind of rhythm disturbance you have, how long it lasts and whether it is coupled with any activity that you do.  An echocardiography (ultrasound of the heart) could be done as well to check for your heart valve condition. i can't tell what a vapsed valve is.

About poor circulation from smoking, it usually takes a lot more than 3 years on and off for the circulation to be affected by smokin unless you have certain disease that affects the circulation and if you smoke it becomes much worse.

    "content": "My brother is a 44-year old, active and athletic person with no previous medical problems.  He was doing his usual 2-mile jog one day in early October last month when he suddenly felt pain in his chest followed by extreme fatigue.  He said his chest felt \"tender,\" and he had trouble breathing, like oxygen was stuck in his chest, not the normal easy flow of in and out.  When he stopped running, he felt a little better; however, these conditions still persist, and it's been over a month.  He's also been feeling fatiqued, weak and dizzy.  His heart rate races especially after a meal.  He has trouble sleeping.  He has not been able to return to work since that day.  He checked with his doctor who ran an EKG that was normal.  His cholesterol and heart pressure were also normal.  The doctor was perplexed and suggested he may have a viral infection in his heart and that he should take Advil.  My brother says the tenderness in his heart is slightly better with Advil, but it's still there.  His fatique and weakness have not improved.  I'm not a doctor, but I think his symptoms are serious and the doctor should be doing more for him than just have him take Advil.  What else should my brother do:  -  See another cardiologist for a second opinion?   -  What other tests can he take to try to locate the specific heart problem? -  Are the above symptoms related to the heart?  Could it be something else totally unrelated?   - What else should he be doing to find out what's wrong and have it treated immediately?  I am terribly worried.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Norlan,  Determining the origin of chest pain and whether or not it is of coronary origin (the most feared and one of the most serious causes of chest pain) depends on the risk factors the person experiencing chest pain has for coronary disease and the characteristics of the chest pain that the person has.  i need to know more about your brother's risk factors. i know that he does not have high blood pressure and diabetes, you said that his cholesterol was normal. i need to know what was the hdl (known as good cholesterol) and what was the ldl (known as bad cholesterol). Is there a family history of coronary disease at an early age in first degree relatives? Does he smoke?   The characterisitics of your brother's chest pain have some typical (little relief when he stopped jogging) and some atypical characterisitics (lingering on for so long and feeling of tenderness) of chest pain caused by coronary disease.  i think from the story that you provided that the chest pain that your brother is having is most probably not coronary origin. Chest pains have lots of other causes. The list is long. i think that your brother has to be seen by his doctor once more to be re-evaluated.  If you are still worried about whether or not this is coronary related, a stress test could be done.

Our father died suddenly in bed at age 72.  After an autopsy, they think it's anteriosclerosis.  He had high blood pressure.  My brother lives in the Boston area where there are excellent medical facilities.  Is there a place he can go where they can keep him for a few days and run a battery of tests on him to find out what he has or doesn't have?    I've just read on the Internet about a condition called Adrenaline Fatigue.  (He experiences extreme fatigue where it's an effort for him just to talk.  Even reading is too exhausting and wears him out).  Should he be tested for this condition?  Thank you for your help. Sincerely, Norlan\n\n",

From what you said, i think that the chest pain that your brother has is not secondary to coronary disease.  i can not say what is the reason behind his extreme fatigue, but i think a few simple tests should be done first before he goes to the big shots in Boston, like thyroid funtions, electrolytes, kidney functions, liver functions, blood sugar level and complete blood count for starters.  Living in Massachusetts could expose him to contracting an infectious disease known as lyme disease which is known to have chronic fatigue as one of its side effects. So, he has to be checked for it as well.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Aimerica,  Erythromycin is one of the medications that are known to interact with lots of medications because of its characteristics.  Heart attack does not ensue, the combination leads to sudden death which means basically means that the person develops fatal arrhythmias.  It is known to increase the level of certain drugs and its level increased by several drugs.  The blood pressure medications that are known to interact with erythromycin and erythromycin can cause their level to increase and vice versa include diltiazem and verapamil.  Regarding other blood pressure medications that can cause arrhythmias because of electrolyte disturbance (like low potassium), these include combinations of medications of the family of the ace-inhibitors (like lisinopril) and diuretics (like hydrochlorothiazide). Another combination that may lead to the same results is angiotensin 2 receptor blockers (like losartan) and diuretics (like hydrochlorothiazide). This leads to low potassium which leads to this arrhythmias and sudden death.  To avoid such interactions, whenever you are prescribed any medication for any reason or you are going to take an otc medication for any reason, you have to always remind your doctor of the medications that you are taking.

    "content": "I am aged 46 when I was diagnosed having cardiac problems. I had no prior symptoms except that I was  getting some pain when I walk up hill for 5-6 minutes. I had hypertension 150-100 Hg rates for about 7-8 years  As per the Doctors advise after getting an attack, I was hospitalised, had an angio done and since I had triple vessel blocks I had to undergo CABG- BYPASS Surgery an year  back. I had developed some post operative problems due to water retention  in lungs post surgery but was cured in time. I incidentally became diabetic too during that time of hospitalisation.  Thanks to good treatment I got , I could somehow recover well. Now my sugar levels both under fasting and post prandial are between 90-110[normal].I had high tryglisaride levels and high Cholesterol at the time of hospitalisation but now the lipid profile tests have indicated that the cholesterol levels are  normal and under control [HDL 56, LDL 90. CHOLESTROL 150]. I have lost 12 KG weight, which I have picked up 7 KG wt post operation.  My major problem is the feeling of inconvenience and the tightness in the chest cranium area even after 15 months of operation.  Till how much time this will be remaining/  I am taking daily an ACE Inhibitor [lasotec 50], A dieuretic[ fruselac 20], a beta blocker[ carvedilol 6.25]], a statin[ arpitor], DAILY TWO TABS OF OMEGA 3 FISH OIL TABS+loprin DS -an aspirin.  Though there appears some improvement in the tightness, it appears to me that this should have been much better in others and  I have some fear . I had MR+, Cardiomegaly and the EF has slightly improved from 42 to 47 % post operation after 12 months. It went down to 35% after 3 months of operation. My sexual arousal power also has come down post operation as  I could not hold erection for long time and I have a fear of collapse during sex also. I don't know the ideal sex positions for Cardiac patients. You may kindly advice me on this also .  Can you tell the status and my prospects of full recovery to normalcy.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Raveendra,  Complete recuperation and rehabilitation after cabg is different from patient to patient.  It sometimes takes up to 1.5 to 3 years for this chest tightness to go away.  Some people continue to have this discomfort for indefinite times.   The most important thing is for you to be sure that this discomfort that you are experiencing is not ischemic in nature as ischemia was dealt with since you had the bypass.  Regarding your sexual problem, i don't think that you should be having any problems unless this problem is caused by one of the new medications that you started taking. i don't think that there are any special positions for heart patients.  If this problem continues, i don't think that there will be any problem for you taking viagra or the like medications as you don't have active ischemia anymore, so i recommend that you talk to your doctor about it.

    "content": "I am a 5' 2\", 120 pound, 52 year old female with mild hypertension of one year's duration that is well controlled by Norvasc.  I had a normal ECG on January 19, 2004 as a part of a routine physical check up.  While out of town on April 26, 2004, I went to an emergency room with bronchitis, asthma, and fever.  While there I was accidentally given Motrin.  I am allergic to aspirin and NSAIDs and previously I had an anaphylactic reaction to an NSAID.  The Motrin caused a bright red rash, low blood pressure, tachycardia, chest discomfort, and shortness of breath.  The first of several abnormal ECGs was then done, and the results stated: \"Sinus tachycardia, Incomplete LBBB, Anterior infarct, possibly acute, Acute MI, Inferior MI age ?, Abnormal ECG.\"  However, I was admitted and several repeat enzyme and troponin tests were all normal.  The results of the last ECG done 24 hours after the first one were: \"Sinus tachycardia, Anteroseptal infarct age undetermined, Abnormal ECG, Ventricular rate 119 bpm, PR interval 144ms, QRS duration 120 ms, QT/QTc 346/487, and P-R-T axes 72 18 67.  I was released two days later with no recommendation to see a cardiologist.  Do you think my abnormal ECGs were the result of my allergic reaction with tachycardia, or have I probably suffered a silent heart attack some time between my January check up and April hospitalization?   I can email or fax a copy of the ECG tracings if that will help answer the question. Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Myocardial infarction or allergic reaction?",
    "content": "Dear Mery,  Thank you very much for using our website.  It is obvious from the clinical setting that what you had was an allergic reaction.  You are hypertensive, not diabetic, family history is negative for coronary disease unless you have not mentioned it, don't know about smoking and lipid profile (but i assume that your lipid profile was checked at least once since you have hypertension and are followed by a doctor).  i don't know what does your base line ecg look like to be able to judge the changes that happened since.  The presence of a left bundle branch block on the ecg precludes looking for coronary disease on the ecg especially acute events.   In females also, it is sometimes hard to put the leads in the appropriate places on the chest.  Left bundle branch block occurs secondary to a heart disease, its presence is abnormal. In your case, most probably it is secondary to hypertension.   There is another entity called rate related bundle branch block which means that when the heart rate exceeds a certain limit, the left bundle branch does not conduct anymore and the ecg shows left bundle branch block.  i think you already know that you did not have a heart attack this time but i can not really tell whether you had a heart attack between january and the er visit or not.   Is it possible that you had a heart attack without having chest pain? Yes, it is possible especially in diabetics and hypertensives. But you have to have symptoms to say that you had a myocardial infarction and the symptom(s) that could have been a myocardial infarction are shortness of breath, heart palpitation, fatigue and feeling of being tired. If you have not had any of these symptoms (even though they are very non-speicific as you can see), i would strongly suspect that you had a recent myocardial infarction.  As for emailing the ecgs, it would be best that you email me both your ecgs from the er visit in addition to your last normal one so that i can compare them all to see the changes that occured in your ecg.  Finally, i would recommend that you have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to check the function of the heart and to see whether there are the changes that occur if a patient had a heart attack.  At this point, i don't think you need to see a cardiologist but you have to see your doctor and if he thinks that this is an appropriate step, then that's ok.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your ecg pictures if you think that is necessary now and waiting for any comments.

    "content": "Dear Lindsey,  Elderly people who have coronary disease usually have other risk factors that affect the heart muscle itself independent of the coronary disease such as diabetes and hypertension. Usually, the heart muscle is affected by those chronic changes and there is an additive effect on the heart muscle especially that those patients usually have multivessel disease.  Even though your husband is young and has no other risk factors, yet the extent of his infarct was big as evidenced by his ejection fraction.  Prognosis should be good for, as i previously mentioned, your husband is healthy. Your husband should continue on medical treatment and have regular follow ups of course and hopefully 6 months from now his ejection fraction should start to improve with the medications that he getting now.

    "content": "Hello, I have a father 65, who has a very difficult heart problem.  He had diabetes for a long time. He is slightly overweight now. Occasionally, he has difficulty breathing especially when tilting his head. We always rush him to the hospital when that happen.  Right now, he has difficulty sleeping due to how hard it is to breath when he lays his head. His appetite for food is very downed.  He takes medicine for his heart condition, diabetes, and for his main gland (I'm not sure what it is called). The gland isn't doing its job therefore he feels very lasy and spent if he doesn't take the medicine.  One of the medicines he takes make him want to urinate a lot. He feels embarrassed and so he stops the medicine sometimes. That's when his body fells with liquids and he severly coughs and has phelm, he feels better when the phelm is sucked through a machine.  The doctors said he has a weakness in his heart muscle, all other organs are efficient, but the heart efficiency is at 20% one doctor said. He says the reason for his condition is that the heart has these cells on its surface that detect the blood entering the heart. However, my father has many of these cells gone. The doctor suggested a new medicine that would make the cells inside the heart surface come closer to the surface to improve the heart condition.  His heart can't pump enough blood to the lungs, that's why the doctor says, my father has the difficulty to breathe.  I have two requests: 1) Recommendations suggestions and opinions about this condition And would surgery be helpful? Do you suggest looking for heart donations? Please give answers, and does father need a heart pacer? I don't know what's their use. 2) I want to know what is the best credited hospital around the world to cure this condition.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hamidious,  Thank you very much for using our website.  It sounds that your father has heart failure according to what you are saying. It sounds alos that he is not compliant with his medications. The reason why he can not breath when he lies down is fluid accumulating in his lungs because his heart can not pump the blood well. So, the best thing to do is to make sure that he gets all his medications on time especially the one that makes him want to urinate a lot as this is the medication that takes the fluid off his body and makes him breath easier.  Your father has to have a heart specialist follow him on regular basis to adjust the doses of his medications. There are new medications that your father is supposed to take to make his heart better. i am not sure about the medications that he takes.  So, if you can get me a list of all the medications that he takes and please if you can get me the scientific names of these medications so that i can tell which medications are missing from his regimen if any.  About heart pacers, patients with a condition called heart block (many degrees and types) need to have a pacer if they fullfil certain conditions. i don't know about your father and whether he has a heart block or not for him to need a pacer.  i am not sure what you mean about heart donation, but my guess is that you are talking about heart transplantation. i am not sure whether there is heart transplantation in Saudi Arabia or not. There is heart transplantation in europe and north america but the waiting lists are so long and many times patients who get heart transplantation don't do well after surgeries because of meany reasons.  And there are lots of good hospitals and centers in the united states that can deal with his condition. Many of these hospitals have an agreement with the Saudi government to treat Saudi citizens so i think you can ask about this in the Saudi health ministry.  My suggestion is that you make sure that your father is on the most recent regimen proven to be effective in heart failure and make sure that he sticks to this regimen and follow up with a good heart specialist.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Anjali,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Was your father-in-law complaining of any chest pain or shortness of breath on exertion when he walks before getting the angiogram? Or if he had these symptoms before, are they getting any worse now?  i could recognize most of the medications that you mentionned as most of the names are trade names and since the trade names are different from country to country sometimes it is hard to recognize but the trade names somtimes are very similar or even the same.  So, the medications that your father-in-law is taking now are the ones that he should be taking in his condition.  i think a thallium test at this point is not a bad idea because it will tell us whether or not it will be useful to have bypass surgery. If the thallium study shows that during exercise, there is no blood going to his heart muscle and that during rest the blood runs normally once more, then a bypass would not be a bad choice.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and please keep me posted about the results of the thallium test.

She never had any heart problems, but showed left + right bundle branch blocked suddenly on 24th night. Doctor's are saying this was because of drastic decrease of electrolytes (Na - 115, K < 2 ). Her weight has gone down to 37 kgs too. God saved her that night. She was dischared on 4th April. At that point her Na ( 135) and K(4.7) were normal. She was Ok for some days, but again on 17th April, she had a lot of sweating and had to be rushed to hospital. ECG showed no blocks. She has been kept under observation for 48 hours.     Doctor's are not sure what is causing the problems and what was the initial cause.We are confused too. We love our mom a lot and cant see her suffering.

    "content": "Dear Sourav,  Thank you very much for using our website.  What caused the cardiac arrest is most probably the very low potassium that your mom had. Although some believe that even such a low potassium does not cause any problems unless there was an underlying heart disease.  Doctors have to find out what caused the potassium to be so low and what caused the heart to stop. i assume since she was in the hospital and was treated successfully and discahrged that the doctors did lots of tests in an attempt to figure out what went wrong.  You only said that your mother did not have heart problems before so what are the problems that she had? Is she taking any medications? Why is she loosing weight like this?  She has to be admitted to the hospital and evaluated thouroughly for the reason behind all this.

    "title": "Re: To angio or not to angio? That is the question!",
    "content": "Dear Dr. Amit,  Thank you very much for using our website and for the vote of confidence.  First of all i would like to to say that the person who should take the decision is the patient herself and not anybody else and if the decision that she takes is not in agreement to what we think should or should not be done, we should not try to force or pressure her to changing her decision. Putting in mind, of course, that she has the right to change her decision at any time.  i guess the first  question   that comes to mind is whether the angiogram is really indicated or not in this case? In  my opinion, if the patient had a big myocardial infarction and developed or expected to develop heart failure, then i think (unless the patient is against surgery in the form of bypass) angiogram is the best way to go. If she is also having recurrent chest pains with maximum medical management then of course angiography is the way to go.  The second  question  is does she have any contraindications to do the angiogram like chronic renal insufficiency and giving dye could throw her into renal failure with subsequent need for dialysis and she does not want to have dialysis. Or, severe peripheral vascular disease with the risk of developing gangrene of the limb and subsequent amputation for example.  At such an age, i wonder if the cause of her symptoms could be due to aortic stenosis. This possibility should always be considered, do you know if she had an echocardiogram or not.   Regarding doing the angiography/plasty, as you might know it is not without risks including death, heart attacks, need for emergency bypasses, allergy to the dye, amputation of the limb secnodary to gangrene (although very rare) and renal failure secondary to the dye if patient is diabetic or with border line renal functions or has chronic renal insufficiency.   On the other hand, the benefits of doing an angiography is to know the anatomy of the coronary arteries, the function of the left ventricle, the valves' condition, if there is one lesion that could be plastied, it will be done.  Age should not be the only factor that directs the decision making process because there are healthy, active 85 years old and older out there and enjoying their life. What is her state of health in general? Does she have chronic diseases? Do you think that if a bypass is warranted, could she go through it?  i think the best way to go is to talk to the patient herself, explain in details: 1. Why the angiogram is needed. 2. What are the benefits. 3. What are the risks. 4. Her inclinations towars management options (i think before going for the angiogram you have to know, if she does go with the angiogram and then the angiogram shows that she needs surgery, is she willing to have surgery if she needs it. If she can consider surgery if needed, then i guess an angiogram is not an unreasonable choice but if not, then the angiogram although it will provide lots of useful information then doing it will not change the management then there is no need to do it).  And then:  5. Let her decide herself whether she wants to have the angiogram or not.  By doing this, i think that you will be fulfilling your duty as a doctor and a friend of the family.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information will help you and the friend of your family to take the right decision. Please, keep me posted.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear John,  i think that ischemic heart disease (ihd) and coronary artery disease (cad) are the most used. When i see these 2 abbreviations, i know what they mean immediately but as regards to coronary heart disease (chd), sometimes i say to myself what to they mean with this abbreviation till it hits me, it takes a while but i get it at the end.   Some people sometimes make the distinction between coronary artery disease and coronary (and ischemic) heart disease as these 2 terms  mean 2 different things. Coronary artery disease means that the disease has affected the coronary arteries only and that though the arteries are diseased the heart has not suffered the consequences yet. And coronary (and ischemic) heart disease means that the heart has already suffered the consequences in the form of complications like heart failure for example.

    "title": "Re: Heart lung questions",
    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for choosing our website.   What do you mean by hemorrhaging in her lungs? Do you mean that she started to cough up large volumes of blood so that this lead to anemia? One of the complications of myocardial infarction is to have pulmonary edema where the lungs fill with fluid and some times with pulmonary edema, you could have mild coughing up of blood.   t-PA in cases of myocardial infarction is given once in the begining (when indicated) and after that if the patient is deemed to receive another dose then it is up to the cardiologist but i think most of the cardiologists will go with what is known as rescue PTCA (where they do an angiogram and try to open up the blocked artery through passing a wire in the blocked artery and dilating it with a baloon and then putting a stent.   Heparin is given in cases of myocardial infarctions as well, some consider it a standard medication and some prefer to use other \"heparin like medications\".   Plavix is to be given for a patient who had a myocardial infarction when the patient had a PTCA to prevent plugging up of the stent (and this is for a month only) or if the patient has a known true allergy to aspirin.   Aspirin is the medications thought by most of the cardiologist to be one of the most important medications to give in cases of myocardial infarction and it is considered malpractice by some if a patient who had a myocardial infarction if not given aspirin.   Now coming to your question about what was supposed to be done in the case that you presented.   If the patient is loosing blood and this is going to jeopardize her life, i think at this point it does not really matter where the patient is loosing blood, first give her the blood she needs and then try to find out. After having t-PA, the usual site where patient loose blood is their gut (from an already present but unrecognized ulcer of the stomach or from what is knwon as congenital vascular malformations of the colon or intestine), if the patient has had a coronary cath, another complication can sometimes happen and this is what is known as retroperitoneal hematoma.   Is it appropriate to use these medications after the patient had lung hemorrhage. i can not answer that question because i was not there to judge what the physician thought at that time. And as i said if the patient had this complication of myocardial infarction knownn as pulmonary edema where some bloody sputum comes out of the lungs and they think that this is may be another acute myocardial infarction that necessitated giving those drugs then this is very appropriate but if this was not the case so this would be inappropriate and once more i can not judge from what you are telling what is the sequence of events.   Now blood coming out of the lung may be caused by a lung blood clot which might be very bad to the extent that the patient will need something to dissolve the clot like t-PA and heparin and although the patient will have blood coming out of the lung, he will receive blood thinners.   Blood thinners can cause bleeding and this is a very well known complication and the doctors should have talked to you about this.   i hope that i have answered most of the questions that you asked, still if there is something that is not clear in my answer or you think needs more elaboration please feel free to post other inquiries and once more thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband had a triple by pass 2-11-02 (had only one heart attack which was in 1992 and angioplasty). He suffered malignant hyperthermia in recovery. He is still in ICU and has run fever but not had an elevated white blood cell count ever since. He is 51 and an insulin depnt diabetic (well-controlled). Back on vent for 3rd time, he had 16 ounces of fluid drained from around his heart on 2-26 (put drain tube back in, but removed on 3-1-02) and 9 ounces drained 2-27-also took lung tissue biopsy. Still waiting for results from cultures but preliminary results indicate no infection. Doctors feel it might be Dressler's syndrome and started him on anti-inflam 2 days ago. Fever jumped to 103.4 this morning.  Could use guidance and a lot of prayer.  Thanks,  Terri Ferguson  800-388-5468 or terri.ferguson@agedwards.com\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mrs. Ferguson,   Thank you very much for using our website.   It looks like your husband, you and your family have been going through a lot.   Dressler syndrome is a syndrome that occurs following either heart attacks or bypasses. This is a syndrome of chest pain, fever, inflammation of the sacs surrounding the lungs and the heart, evidence of pleural effusion (fluid around the lung) or pericardial effusion (fluid around the heart which your husband had, although this could be due to the surgery your husband had), elevated white count and an elevation in a blood test called sedimentation rate.   Mangement of this syndrome is mostly conservative by giving aspirin or NSAIDs, this must be continued for ten days. Prednisone may given to patients whom their symptoms do not respond to treatment.   In addition to this, large amount of fluid around the heart or lungs should be drained like what happened to your husband.   i am sure that your husband is receiving excellent care where he is right now. The causes of fever after surgery may be caused by lots of causes and i am sure that these causes will be looked into carefully. Malignant hypoerhtermia associated with anesthesia is not an uncommon side effect and i am sure in an institution where open heart surgery is performed, anesthesiologists are full aware of how to deal with such a problem.   I hope your husband very good luck and rapid recovery and please inform me of the current situation of your husband.   Once more thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and if you still want more clarification, i will be more than happy to answer.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am writing to request some more information (if possible) re Dressler's syndrome. My father has just been diagnosed. He is aware of the symptoms (obviously) but would like to know more about his prognosis and best ways of treatment. He is taking medication but wants to know if there is much risk of him going back to work etc. or should he be resting?  I can't seem to find too much information about it.  It would be great if you could help.  Kind Regards,  Karen Marshman\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dressler's syndrome",
    "content": "Dear Karen,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Dressler syndrome is known as postmyocardial infarction syndrome, it might occur as early as one week following a myocardial infarction (heart attack) up to even eight weeks. It causes inflammation of (1) the sac surrounding the heart (pericardium), (2) sac surrounding the lung (pleura) and (3) some lung tissue (pneumonitis).   Its cause is presumed to be autoimmune (where the body can not differentiate between self and foreign and starts to form antibodies against its own tissues).   It causes (as i am sure your dad experienced): 1) Fever, 2) malaise, 3) Chest pain, and 4) may be some cough.   i presume that he had of course some tests by the doctors to make sure that this chest pain is not caused by another heart attack. The single most important thing in my point of view since inflammation of the sac surrounding the heart might cause accumulation of fluid around the heart which is something very serious, i think that doing an echocardiogram (ultrasound X-ray of the heart) is crucial to make sure that there is no fluid surrounding the heart specially if your dad is taking blood thinners.   Otherwise i think this is a benign condition, it might recur in the future after it is treated. Treatment consists of anti-inflammatory such as ibuprofen, naprosyn, indomethacin, etc... If these don't work (which is extremely rare), cortisone may be used which is usually very effective but must be tapered off because of its known side effects.   Regarding your dad going back to work, this depends on how long ago he had his heart attack now and does he have any symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, leg swelling and of course it depends on what kind of work he does, how old is he, how big was his heart attack. The best person to judge this at this point is his personal physician. Regarding Dressler syndrome, once cured, he can go back to work without any problems if evry thing else is ok and his doctor allows him to.   I hope i have given you the information that you wanted to find out about Dressler's syndrome and once more thank you very much for using our website and if you still have any questions do not hesitate to answer them at any time.

    "title": "Re: Coronary Artery Ischemia",
    "content": "Dear Gary,   Thank you very much for using our website.   It is up to you whether you want to have the cath and angioplasty in the same time or not.   Some people would like second opinions before they go ahead and do the angioplasty. But, if you do not want any second opininons, then, you can go ahead and let your cardiologist perfrom the angioplasty in the same time.   What to go with? Balloon only or balloon and stent.   Angioplasty means that your narrow coronaries will be dilated with a balloon. If a stent is thought to be needed, then it could be placed after the balloon dilatation.   It has been proven in some clinical trials that some of the patients that have angioplasty without stents (in comparison to patients who had angioplasty with stents have more stenosis (narrowing) of their coronaries once more in the same site where the angioplasty was done in addition to some other things like increase in the rate of heart attacks among others.   There are other factors that govern the choice of angioplasty alone versus angioplasty with stents. i think the best one to decide will be your cardiologist at the time of coronary angiogram.   You have an opinion too, regarding whether you want angioplasty with stenting or not. You have to fully understand what kind of procedure is this? What are the drawbacks and advantages of such procedure? And then you can make your decision.   Once more thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and good luck with your coronary catheterization.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
