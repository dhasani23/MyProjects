    "content": "Hi, You have not mentioned what your original symptoms were and what has been the response as far as the UTI symptoms are concerned, following initiation of ciprofloxacin therapy.  If you have responded symptomatically, but you are experiencing these 'new' symptoms, then they could be adverse effects of the ciprofloxacin therapy. On the other hand, if they had been present even prior to the start of the therapy and have gotten worse, continuing or worsening  UTI needs consideration. Your doctor will be the best person to decide about this. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You have not indicated the nature of the vaginal discharge(color, smell etc). A profuse vaginal discharge may be indicative of problems which include several types of vaginitis and a foul smelling profuse discharge may suggest a pelvic inflammatory disease (PID). Your symptoms are not very suggestive of a kidney infection.   PID is due to an infection of the upper female reproductive tract. By far, most cases are sexually transmitted but, very rarely, are known to occur in the absence of STDs.   The risk factors are, - sexually transmitted infections (notably, gonococcal or chlamydial), - age < 25 years and sexually active, - multiple sex partners, - Douching, - little or no use of barrier protection, - intrauterine device (IUD),and - smoking/alcohol.  It usually occurs in two stages. First stage is often monomicrobial due to a gonococcal or chlamydial infection(which may even be sub-clinical), followed by ascending infections by  non-STD organisms (Bacteroides, E. Coli, or other organisms from the vagina).in about 30-40% of cases, the infection is polymicrobial.  Symptoms of PID vary from minimal pelvic discomfort and vaginal discharge to severe abdominal pain associated with nausea and vomiting. Leukocytosis and fever may or may not always be present or may occur late in the course of the disease.Vaginal discharge (frequently foul smelling) is very common (occurs in about 75% of cases). Pain during coitus (dyspareunia), lower abdominal pain, low back pain, dysuria, post-coital bleeding also may be seen in some of the cases. HIV associated PIDs, tend to progress rapidly and may lead to tuboovarian abscess formation.  Investigations may include testing for STDs, UTIs, some form of imaging [(ultrasonography (transvaginal and pelvic), CT scanning], endometrial biopsy, and laparoscopy.   Early antibiotic therapy is indicated effective against the common pathogens. If clinical suspicion is high, even empirical antibiotic therapy is recommended.  You should have yourself tested as soon as possible to determine the cause of the profuse vaginal discharge. PID needs to be excluded. PID needs energetic management to prevent late sequelae. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "UTI symptoms after intercourse but no bacteria present",
    "content": "Hello  I have been getting recurring UTIs for the past six months since meeting a new partner. Approx one every month with the usual symptoms of pain during urination, frequent urination, lower abdomen pain that makes it painful to walk. We have both been cleared for STDs. The first three times urine tests did show bacteria, but the last two times there was no bacteria present, suggesting this was not a UTI. However my GP prescribes me trimethophrim 200mg for 3 days and that always clears it. What can I do about this as it seems to be related to having sex - I eat cranberry capsules, drink water, go to the toilet before and after sex, we are both very clean.  Nor do we have sex for a long time, and having 'honeymoon cystitis' for 6 months seems like a very long time.   This time with the UTI, having finished my course yesterday, and although the pain in the lower abdomen is gone, I still urinate a lot (could be caused by all the water I am drinking I guess) and I feel like I can feel my urinary tract, a tingling sensation. If this is not a UTI, what is it? And is there anything I can do in regards to sex to make it stop? Could my new partner have a UTI?  I never had this problem with my old partner. I did ask my GP if I could be referred to a gynocologist or urologist but they did not think this would be necessary at this stage.  I really appreciate any help you can offer! many thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Yoy seem to be referring to recurrent lower urinary tract symptoms rather than UTIs.  If gonococcal and non-gonococcal urethritis have been ruled out by reliable, comprehensive STD testing, then the next suspect would be a prostatitis.  STDs increase the risk of bacterial prostatic infection. Non-bacterial prostatitis can also occur(granulomatous, viral). Association of non-bacterial prostatitis with HIV infection is well known and causes a culture-negative prostatitis. Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) are exampls of such pathogens.Fungi, such as Candida albicans, have also been reported to be associated with culture-negative disease in individuals at risk for HIV infection. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Medical history: I'm male, mid-30's, normal weight, with no urological problems in the past, but I do have chronic digestive problems (something like IBS: probably not relevant, but if it helps the Dr diagnose, great). My wife and I have been faithfully married for many years. I do not self-pleasure nor have any need to do so.  I started having symptoms of urethral irritation the morning after having sex with my wife. It was her fertile time, so we used a condom. I accidentally left the condom on myself all night. When I urinated in the morning, there was a mild burning sensation at the meatus/urethra typical of exposure to soap or chemicals. I figured it would go away, but the burning during urination got more severe, to the point of intolerable, over the next few days.  At one week, I woke up with swelling and redness in the groin. The right side lymph nodes seemed swollen and there was some edema on the penile skin tissue. I went to a private urologist and paid out-of-pocket since I have no insurance. The guy was a fool. Not only was he physically rough with me, but he was stubbornly convinced I had a strangulated inguinal hernia and needed emergency surgery. When asked about the urethral inflammation, he said that was of secondary importance. I paid for an ultrasound with another clinic and they confirmed that it was swollen lymph nodes (1.5-2.6 cm superficial nodes) and it was NOT hernia.  At this point I was disillusioned with doctors and decided to self-prescribe. The symptoms were clearly those of an advanced UTI, probably induced by native bacteria entering the urethra through the fluid in the condom.  I have access to antibiotics, so I put myself on a course of amoxicillin/clavulinate 875 mg 2x per day, cipro 500 mg 2x per day, and ibuprofen as needed for the pain (usually 800 mg 2x per day). I'm also drinking more water than normal, probably about 3L per day.  I'm now on day 5 of this treatment (day 12 of the illness). Lymph node swelling, redness, and edema were gone within two days. Urethral inflammation is still severe, and seems to have spread to the bladder or prostate, where it is mild but definitely there. Further, it feels as if my hip joints and rectum are mildly inflamed.   Do you have any recommendations for further tests or treatment? Are systemic antibiotics effective against the urethral infection? It seems so exterior that they would have no effect there. Is there an antibiotic administered by drops or some other mode that would be more effective? Or should I ride out the current treatment, and for how long? Are the new symptoms possibly side effects of the cipro? If so, would that indicate that I should stop taking the cipro?   Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The inguinal lymphadenitis must have been quite severe indeed for the urologist to even think in terms of a strangulated inguinal hernia. Strangulated inguinal hernia(which is far more dangerous) is sometimes missed and the condition attributed to inguinal lymphadenitis, which is a far more serious error. Such a severe acute inguinal lymphadenitis associated with edema of the penile skin is not a usual feature of UTIs or urethritis. UTIs in men < 50years old is rare(unless associated with structural or functional abnormalities of the urinary tract).  In cases such as yours, a clinical examination is of immense help in arriving at a diagnosis. In the obvious absence of that, i will confine myself to a brief consideration of some diseases whose manifestations include inguinal lymph node enlargement.  Chancroid is caused by the organism, Haemophilus ducreyi. It is a sexually transmitted infectious disease. Symptoms usually occur within 4-10 days following sexual exposure. They rarely develop earlier than three days or later than 10 days. Painful papules or pustules develop on the external genitals, which eventually ulcerate to form a painful ulcer. The ulcer is soft to the touch (unlike a syphilis chancre that is hard or rubbery). That is why these lesions are often referred to as 'soft chancre' or 'soft sore'. The ulcers can be very painful in men but women are often asymptomatic. Painful lymph glands ('bubo')  occur in one groin , but they can occur on both sides. Lymphadenopathy is seen in roughly 50% of affected individuals.  Chancroid has been well established as a cofactor for HIV transmission. Persons with HIV may experience slower healing of chancroid, even with treatment, and may need to take medications for a longer period of time.  Lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV) is caused by serovars L1, L2, and L3 of the organism Chlamydia trachomatis. It gains entrance through breaks in the skin and abrasions, or it can also cross the epithelial cells of mucous membranes. The organism travels via the lymphatics to settle and multiply within mononuclear phagocytes in regional lymph nodes.  LGV is considered endemic in West and East Africa, parts of southeast Asia, South America, India, and the Caribbean.  The primary stage is marked by the formation of a painless herpetiform ulceration at the site of inoculation.occurs at the contact site 3\u201312 days after infection.   The secondary stage (most often occurs from 10\u201330 days later) is classically described as the inguinal syndrome in men, characterized by painful and tender inguinal lymphadenitis that is often associated with constitutional symptoms.  As your history, symptoms and signs are not typical for a simple urethritis or UTI, although there is no history of exposure to STDs, it is highly likely that you will be tested comprehensively for the same. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Asperger syndrome is one of the Autism Spectrum Disorders (ASD)(Pervasive Developmental Disorders [PDD]).  Although described first by Austrian pediatrician Hans Asperger in 1944, this condition started to be recognized as a separate entity came to be regarded as a distinct disease and diagnosis only in 1992. Therefore, there is a paucity of information regarding Asperger's syndrome and any particular association with recurrent UTIs.  There is some evidence that children with attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may have an higher prevalence of certain urinary problems. One study from UC Irvine College of Medicine, reportedly found that children with APHD had higher rates of bedwetting and other bowel and urinary tract problems.  The researchers also introduced a biofeedback technique that appeared to be successful at reversing some of these problems in children(about 3 - 5% of all children in the United States have some degree of ADHD.  Some studies have suggested that about 30% of these children suffer from bedwetting).  In recurrent UTIs in children, structural anomalies of the urinary tract must be excluded. It is also important to differentiate lower UTI from upper UTI(that is, acute pyelonephritis). This differentiation is important because both entities need specific treatment. The 1999 American Academy of Pediatrics practice guideline for management of children after first UTI recommends an imaging study to evaluate for the presence and degree of vesicoureteral reflux (VUR). VUR may be present in approximately 30 - 40% of children with UTI. Poor voiding habits are one of the risk factors for UTi in children and therefore must be addressed. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Insignificant Urinalysis, but Symptomatic. What to do?",
    "content": "I think that I may have a Urinary Tract Infection.  I am a 20 year old male.  The tip (urethral opening) of my penis is sore (somewhat of a dull burn) at times and I feel like the inside of penis is sore as well.  Sometimes, I have a clear discharge (though it's infrequent).  The pain isn't terrible, but I am definitely uncomfortable at times.  I thought I may have contracted this after having a sexual encounter two weeks ago (only received head) and went in to get tested.  So to break it down it would be sexual encounter on Sunday (06/20), symptoms on Thursday, and STD screen and Urinalysis that upcoming Sunday (06/27).  Despite my symptoms, however, nothing was found.  There were no GNIDS (cells found where there's gonorrhea) or white blood cells found in a gram stain.  Two catches of urine were done (UA1 and UA2).  The White blood cell count in UA2 was reported as 1 (greater than 10 being significant) and the rest (number of white blood cells/red blood cells  in the other catches were 0.  I was told I had dysuria (urethral discomfort) with  negative urinalysis, unknown cause.  These tests were done at a free clinic with trained volunteers rather than medical professionals (if that means anything).  I was told to take vitamin c and drink cranberry juice in order to acidify my urine thus killing any unknown microbe that might be there.  Here are my questions:  1.)  Is that sufficient treatment, vitamin C and Cranberry juice? 2.)  Is waiting a week after my sexual encounter too soon to get tested and should I go back and get it done again? 3.)  I was feeling a little better (after starting the cranberry juice/vitamin C regimen) and masturbated a few times.  My symptoms became worse afterward (no pain with ejaculation).  Does masturbation worse healing time? 4.)  I know some other causes of UTI's are: Chlamydia trachomatis (most common), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis (rare), Herpes simplex virus (rare), Adenovirus, Haemophilus vaginalis, Mycoplasm genitalium.  Is it possible that the tests I had done were not capable of detecting one of those possibilities? 5.)  What kind of follow up should I look into?  Any help would be greatly appreciated  Brandon\n\n",

Incubation period for NGUs would be from 4 days to 2 weeks after exposure. Gram stain would identify gonococci.NAAT test is done for Chlamydia.Other STD testing is also done to make sure.Rare cases for which aetiology can not be determined may need a cystoscopy to rule out and to remove a stone if it is the cause.Sometimes empirical antibiotic therapy is given to cover all the pathogens, in some settings.

I've attempted to go several days without sexual intercourse or masturbation, and the cuts heal but reappear when I engage in sex or masturbation. I usually dab some A&D ointment on the cuts before bed, and they are healed by the morning, but the healed skin looks to be paper thin, and the cuts re open again after engagement. This cycle has been reoccurring for the past month. What do you suggest I do, and is Circumcision my only option?\n\n",

I am truly sorry for not responding earlier (i somehow missed reading your post).You may try (under medical supervision) topical steroid cremes- if there is no underlying infection.They have been reported to be successful in the treatment of phimosis.  If that(minimal phimosis) is really the underlying problem, and if it does not respond to a trial of the conservative measures over a reasonable period, i see no alternative other than a circumcision.That will solve this problem hopefully, permanently.

    "title": "Re: Left Over Urine",
    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms are suggestive of what one may broadly call as 'Impaired Bladder Emptying'. You have not indicated if the urinary stream is good and whether you need to strain. Firstly, a urinary bladder outlet obstruction needs to be excluded. This is commonly caused by benign prostatic hyperplasia(BPH).  This can cause a variety of obstructive voiding symptoms such as: - straining ,  - decreased urine stream caliber and velocity,  - an interrupted stream,  - urinary hesitancy, and  - a feeling of incomplete voiding.  There may be other symptoms such as nocturia, increased frequency, urgency and urge incontinence.   Bladder outlet obstruction leads to back pressure changes and also increases the chances of a urinary tract infection developing due to the presence of \"residual urine\"(post void residual urine).Both these factors can cause renal damage.   You need to consult a urologist for a thorough clinical assessment, followed by investigations that will usually include an ultrasonography.Delays in treatment have the potential to cause renal damage. Therefore, an early consultation is recommended. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Urge to Urinate, UTI test came back Negative",
    "content": "My first problem started about a week ago.  I went to use the bathroom like any other day to urinate, however my urine felt warm and not in great amount.  Even though this was strange, there was no pain while urinating.  For the next couple of days I found myself having this urge to urinate 24/7.  The urge was most extreme right after I had just used the bathroom.  I thought this could have possibly been a UTI or an STD so I went to see my doctor to get my urine tested.  The test came back negative for UTI and STD which was a relief, however I still have this urge to urinate, which like I said isn't painful but is starting to become annoying and messing up my sleep patterns.  The urge is not as extreme as a week ago and only occurs off and on (mostly at night time while I am sitting in bed).    On another note, about a couple of days after my first problem (urge to urinate) started, I began to feel bloated and my abdomen started to tingle all over.  Sometimes the light throbbing/tingling would be on my left abdomen, then move over to my right.  Now only after I eat do I have a heavy feeling, and only on my right side of the abdomen (parallel to the belly button).  I also asked my doctor if this had any influence on my urge to urinate, maybe something was pressing my bladder or something was inflammed, however he didn't believe this problem had anything to do with my urge to urinate and kind of brushed the question off.  I believe he said it could just be constipation. (I don't believe it's constipation since I have defecated and my stool is brownish or normal color)  I do not know if both of these problems relate to one another and maybe they don't, maybe it's all in my head, however my main goal is to really try to fix my urge to urinate. Like I said this all started with my urge to urinate.  There is no blood, pain, cloudiness in my urine and the urge isn't as extreme as a week ago but still persistent.  My question is can any of these symptoms point to a certain/specific disease or problem?   I am an active 19 year old male with no major problems prior to this and my immediate family has not suffered from diseases that involve kidneys or prostate. 5'7\" 130 lbs  I appreciate all the advice and help. Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Urge to Urinate, UTI test came back Negative",
    "content": "Hi,  UTIs are more frequent in females. UTI is unusual in males 3 -  50 years of age, and symptoms of dysuria and frequency are usually due to STD-related urethral or prostatic infections rather than UTIs. Also, if UTI is proven in young males, one must look out for urinary tract malformations.In older men, however, the incidence of UTI begins to rise because of increasing prevalence of bladder outflow obstruction(benign prostatic hyperplasia-BPH).   There is single best way of performing urine cultures.   Urinary cultures can be negative due to a number of factors such as, - fastidious or slow-growing uropathogens(Haemophilus influenzae and H. parainfluenzae and others), - anerobic bacteria(if anerobic cultures are not specifically performed), - unknown/uncommon bacteria,  - false negative cultures(type of culture medium used), - interpretation by strict application of the Kass's cutoff value(>100,000 cfu/ml)for culture positivity, - prior antibiotic therapy, - obstruction to the flow of grossly infected urine,and - at times, the intermittent discharge of bacteria from the upper UTIs.  At this point, i would prefer that you visit the following links for additional information on what is a \"comprehensive\" STD testing and sites to be tested. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... ensive+UTI http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 61&t=46560  I hope in your case, the STDs were ruled out comprehensively.  Although more than 90% of UTIs in the general population are caused by a single bacterial species, true polymicrobial infections are very likely in patients with underlying structural abnormalities, chronic indwelling catheters, immunocompromised individuals or prolonged immunosuppressive therapy.  I feel that under these circumstances,it will be better to repeat the urinary culture and to undergo a repeat STD screen if you think that the first one was not comprehensive enough. It is important to have a urological opinion as well. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I just went to the doctors today with severe pain and burning during and after urination . Also have pain all day for last couple days and slight back ache. They did a urine test and said i indeed had a uti and prescribed cipro and a water pill for the swelling . lso I told the doctor how I have gained 60 pounds in 6 months , basically since I started methadone. Now my normal weight drug free fluctuates between 125 -140 . But i am now 175 and i have headaches frequently and like i said now this and pain . I also have constant joint pain and stiffness but i had that before i started the methadone . I gave the doctor all this info and she told me kind of rudely that my weight gain was probably due to me being sedated because of the methadone and that  the swelling was due to me being over weight . Now I was shocked and am not used to being treated like this . I am not lazy or sedated . I go to group therapy every day and also have 2 kids i take care of that are 9 and 7.  I am on the go with them taking them to football practice and cheerleading and doing activities with them . Also i am searching for a job and go to college . I don't have time to be sedated even if it did make me like that . But i started at 40mg daily and then i slowly went up to a stable dose that i have been at for 4 months . I am taking 150 mg a day.  so my question is do you think the swelling is uti or kidney related and that i should seek other treatment . I was also not able to start the meds tonight cause by the time i got to the pharmacy it was closed and i cant go to any other cause the one i was using has the antibiotic for free and i cant afford to go to a different pharmacy and pay for my meds . Also is there something she could have given me for pain . I was almost in tears and it seemed like she was not giving me something just because i am on methadone and like she wanted to make me suffer or i deserve to suffer .  From the research i have done there are meds that can be given for pain and they can be given in small daily doses by the pharmacy  and so there is no threat or worry of abuse .  Please respond asap and thank you in advance . I will probably end up going to the hospital though not only for the pain which just keeps getting worse but because of the swelling which concerns me . By the way this is the first day that I have had the swelling in my legs and feet . Usally i just have some in my fingers and hands . Thanks again and have a great evening everyone .\n\n",

I go in today to get the results of my blood work from the other day when i was diagnosed with the uti and given antibiotics . I do have another question though . I was taking my antibiotic and noticed that I only had a two day supply left and that i had only had a three day supply prescribed . Is this normal to only prescribe antibiotics for three days  and how do they know that it will take care of the infection .  Please give me some type of answer .

I understand that typically with these places the doctors and nurses are over worked and under paid and treat everyone the same basically . I just want to make sure I am informed so that I can advicate for myself when i go there and so I can be informed enopugh to know when they might be giving me less then adequate care .

You are also experiencing a feeling of incomplete evacuation of the urinary bladder.  There are two possibilities(among several others) that need to excluded first. - a urinary tract infection(UTI) and - a urinary bladder outlet obstruction.  In this situation, a visit to a doctor becomes very essential because untreated urinary tract infections(especially those combined with urinary tract obstruction) have a potential for causing damage to the kidneys.  Rather than consuming cranberry juice (please visit page-2 of the following link for more on cranberry juice),you should make arrangements to consult at the least your regular doctor , sooner rather than later. http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... \\&start=15 Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I think that I may have a Urinary Tract Infection.  I am a 20 year old male.  The tip (urethral opening) of my penis is sore (somewhat of a dull burn) at times and I feel like the inside of penis is sore as well.  Sometimes, I have a clear discharge (though it's infrequent).  The pain isn't terrible, but I am definitely uncomfortable at times.  I thought I may have contracted this after having a sexual encounter two weeks ago (only received head) and went in to get tested.  So to break it down it would be sexual encounter on Sunday (06/20), symptoms on Thursday, and STD screen and Urinalysis that upcoming Sunday (06/27).  Despite my symptoms, however, nothing was found.  There were no GNIDS (cells found where there's gonorrhea) or white blood cells found in a gram stain.  Two catches of urine were done (UA1 and UA2).  The White blood cell count in UA2 was reported as 1 (greater than 10 being significant) and the rest (number of white blood cells/red blood cells  in the other catches were 0.  I was told I had dysuria (urethral discomfort) with  negative urinalysis, unknown cause.  These tests were done at a free clinic with trained volunteers rather than medical professionals (if that means anything).  I was told to take vitamin c and drink cranberry juice in order to acidify my urine thus killing any unknown microbe that might be there.  Here are my questions:  1.)  Is that sufficient treatment, vitamin C and Cranberry juice? 2.)  Is waiting a week after my sexual encounter too soon to get tested and should I go back and get it done again? 3.)  I was feeling a little better (after starting the cranberry juice/vitamin C regimen) and masturbated a few times.  My symptoms became worse afterward (no pain with ejaculation).  Does masturbation worse healing time? 4.)  I know some other causes of UTI's are: Chlamydia trachomatis (most common), Ureaplasma urealyticum, Trichomonas vaginalis (rare), Herpes simplex virus (rare), Adenovirus, Haemophilus vaginalis, Mycoplasm genitalium.  Is it possible that the tests I had done were not capable of detecting one of those possibilities? 5.)  What kind of follow up should I look into?  Any help would be greatly appreciated  Brandon\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Insignificant Urinalysis, but Symptomatic. What to do?",
    "content": "Hi,  You said, \"These tests were done at a free clinic with trained volunteers rather than medical professionals \".Therefore the question in your mind obviously is, whether the STD testing was  \"comprehensive\" or not.   A \"comprehensive\" STD testing generally begins with a thorough history taking including a thorough sexual history. This guides the clinician as to which tests and which sites should be tested. This will undoubtedly determine the \"yield\" from the tests.  Following details regarding the Sexual activity are generally sought: - regular/casual sexual partner(s), - gender of partner(s), any history of male to male sex?, - most recent sexual exposure and other exposures in the recent past, - number of exposures since last tested, - any known symptoms among recent partner(s), - any known risk factor(s) in partners, - use of protection(ex;condoms) \u2013 sometimes, always or never?, - specific exposure sites:  vaginal, oral,or anal?, - history of IV drug abuse, - where the sexual activity took place? Travel history, - history of use of blood or blood products, - any occupational exposure or needlestick injury?  - tattoos, - body piercing - done non-professionally.  Kindly refer to the following link for additional information on sites to be tested and ideal specimens for testing.  (http://www.doctorslounge.com/forums/vie ... 61&t=46560).  About testing for chlamydia: Urine samples for PCR chlamydia testing should be a first pass specimen, ideally collected at least 3 hours after voiding.  A urine test as evidence of cure for chlamydial infection is not routinely performed, as the PCR test may remain positive for several weeks after successful eradication of the live organism. This is because the test detects DNA fragments from dead  chlamydiae.  About cranberry juice:  - Cranberry juice mainly prevents adhesion of certain microbes to the inner lining of the urinary tract (urothelium) - notably E.Coli. - It 'prevents' to an extent UTI developing, but does not actually 'Treat' it.  Therefore, if one has already developed an established UTI, no amount of cranberry juice is going to help.The bacteria firmly attached to the urothelium will presumably watch the cranberry juice harmlessly pass by!!  Having gone through the aforesaid details, hopefully, you may be able to decide if the STD testing you underwent was \"comprehensive\" and if the history you provided was \"comprehensive\" or otherwise. If you feel that it was not, then you should perhaps get tested again where it is done professionally. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Passing blood after sneezing coughing while urinating",
    "content": "Hi  A few months back approx 3, i was in the toilet urinating & while in full flow i sneezed straight after this i had a sharp pain at the end of my penis then started to pass blood, not a lot just a few drops mixed with the urine it seemed more at the time but was it was very painful to pass urine. I phoned my GP straight away; they asked for a urine sample what i give to them within 1 hour of asking. They tested my urine at the medical centre & said that i had a trace of protein through my urine, so they then treated me for a urinary tract infection. Just tonight while i was out socialising i was in the toilet urinating full flow coughed & the same thing has happened again but this time when I urinated after the incident the urine was not coming out full flow only in small steams squirting everywhere in all directions, thankfully i have passed urine since then & it has rectified itself full flow but still uncomfortable to pass urine. I am not a doctor but I do not think that this is a urinary tract infection as the pain I have is at the tip of my penis, to me it seems that I have ruptured something within my penis at the tip just about a few mm down as the tip of my penis \u201cas I would call the eye of the penis\u201d seems to have swollen and has rising a bit, like turning inside out if that makes sense? But as the last time the swelling has subsided. Could this be a blood vessel or some type of rupture?   Thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,The commonest type of bleeding in a young male is frenular tear.This bleeding is from tearing the connection from the glans penis to the prepuce and related to sex or masturbation. Your history does not suggest it and may be related to bleeding from the urethra.This type of bleeding is generally at the beginning of passing urine and is frank blood.If it occours at the end it would be possibly from the prostate. All these type of bleeding are classified under gross hematuria.The bleeding could occur from the kidneys down to urethra,ureters,bladder etc. A n urologic consultation would be essential.Stones,injury,infection,polypoid tumours could be behind this. Urine analysis,cystoscopy, ultrasound,MRI scans are the tests generally done. Do get examined to rule out the conditions that could cause frank bleeding. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "UTI for vast majority of my life",
    "content": "Hi. I'm female, 20 years of age and I've had a uti for about 16 years. I deal with incontinence on a daily basis along with sharp stabbing pains in one or both sides of my ribs (made worse by breathing). These pains I've also had for years, recently however they've been more like constant tenderness and occasional pains. All of my symptoms fluctuate greatly week to week or month to month. I haven't really noticed a pattern. I've always had very strange menstrual cycles as well, I was on my period for five months straight once, and I could go through a pad or tampon in 15 minutes. Or I might not even have one for a few months. I finally found a birth control that helps,I still get extra periods from time to time. But it's nothing compared to what it used to be.  Some extra symptoms, I'm not sure if they're related... Headaches almost daily, and joint pains usually only lasting a day or so. The joint pains usually occur in my hip, knee, wrist or shoulder. And are completely random.  I've been hospitalized a couple of times for possible kidney infections. They usually give me a cat scan (which always comes back normal) and test me for pancreatitis (which also comes back negative) and then they just tell me I have a UTI and send me home. I've been to lots of doctors and everything's always \"almost\" normal. I was diagnosed with vasovagal syncope and anemia. I had a cystoscopy and I passed out in the bed, she said she didn't find anything too alarming and perscribed me another antibiotic.  On a daily basis I use/b-line to the bathroom at least 10 times. And I always go. There's usually a long after contraction, and frequently small unidentifiable bits floating. Or a larger unidentifiable chunk of something on the bottom of the toilet. And still every doctor tells me I have a UTI like I've never heard it before. ANTIBIOTICS DON'T WORK, I've been on them all. I'm at a loss, I'm frustrated and everything only seems to get worse. A customer of mine noticed a reaction I had to one of those pains in my side and were very worried. That's when I realized how not normal and problematic this is. I really wish someone would take me seriously. Please help..... :(\n\n",

I'll explain to you what I mean, I got with my partner just over 2 years ago and after we have sex I get this symptom of needed to go to the toilet but most of the time there's very little urine if any. sometimes it burns like cystitis but often its just the urgency of needing the toilet. The first time I got it there was an infection so got antibiotics which I thought cleared it up until I had sex with my partner again, so I got given more antibiotics which as I thought again cleared it up but it hadn't I told the doctor the tablets aren't working, so I had more urine tests, blood samples, cervical screening, sti checks, urethra swob all came back clear. The doctors just told me to keep taking those cystitis relief sachets (which taste disgusting) because there is no problem as they can see and do the usual list of drink plenty water, no perfumed products for washing, going to toilet before and after sex, i have tried them all practically. I don't know what to do. I don't want to be having to take those sachets for the rest of my life as I am only 21. are there any other tests i could have done? my friend suggested that maybe my boyfriends and mine ph levels are causing this reaction?? is that possible? i was in a 3 year relationship before this one and i had no problems like this what so ever. also my boyfriend has been checked for sti's and came back clear. please help.\n\n",

    "title": "UTI physical condition, benefits of surgery?",
    "content": "I have been averaging about 4 UTI's a year (one of which developed into a kidney infection in 2007) since I turned 15, I am now 22.  I had problems with them as a child as well according to my mother but I have no memory of this.  Despite my best efforts at maintaining hygiene, following all of the instructions, urinating whenever I feel the slightest need to, no tight fitting clothing, front-to-back, urinating after intercourse, drinking plenty of water, etc etc etc, I always inevitably get another one.  Each UTI I get develops faster and becomes more painful than the last in a shorter amount of time.  My last UTI developed in less than 6 hours, involved a LOT of blood in the urine and was extremely painful.  I've started to get quite concerned about the scarring that my bladder is no doubt enduring, and the potential cancer risk from the build up of scar tissue there.   At one point in time I had xrays taken, and was told that I had a \"physical condition\" which made me prone to UTI's.  I was about 16 at the time and the laymen description I got was that I had an extra \"pocket\" in my urinary tract before my bladder which made it easier for bacteria to get a foothold.  I was told that surgical correction was possible, but it was highly advised against at that point as they did not believe it would be \"worth it\" so to say. Each UTI I've gotten since then has made the option of surgery more appealing, especially the kidney infection, and this past UTI.  I was curious if you were familiar with this particular physical condition, and what your opinion would be on the surgery option.  Cipro has (thankfully) never failed to clear up my UTI's as of yet, but it really seems to be playing with fire so to say.    Any input you have on this matter would be greatly appreciated,   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your description strongly suggests the presence of what is known as a ureterocele. It is a saccular(sac-like) out-pouching of the ureter where it joins the urinary bladder.There are different types of this entity. Pediatric and adult types are known.  The pediatric ones usually cause symptoms such as;   - recurrent UTIs and - hematuria. Back-pressure changes resulting in hydronephrosis may also occur. I suggest that you must consult a urologist soon and get yourself investigated.If ureterocele is indeed the problem, then surgery is the likely option.  This will prevent the recurring UTIs and the  possible effects on renal function in the long run. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ouch,  From your post I am assuming you went to your physician and did not have an infection? If that is the case you may not be emptying your bladder each time you void. Taking 5 minutes to start to urinate is not usual. Make sure your physician knows this trouble you are having. About your frequent UTI's prevention is your best bet. Make sure you drink lots of water and avoid caffiene and carbonated drinks. When wiping wipe from front to back. Urinate before and after sex and use cotton underwear. Sometimes even perfumed soaps can be irritating.  Follow up with your physicain about your complaints and I wish you luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ouch66, My suggestions hereunder are directed towards yourself and other guests of this forum who have responded to your post. One must take UTI's seriously.Each time one gets a UTI, potential for the loss of nephrons (the functioning units of the kidneys) exists. Any suspicion warrents a prompt urine culture (before antibiotics are administered) and antibiotic therapy begun as per medical advice. Recurrent UTI's need further work up - to exclude resistent strains of microbes and anatomical abnormalities in the urinary tract. Getting the sexual partner also checked up and treated often helps. Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "For about a month or so I have been experiencing this egg smell almost every time I urinate. It doesnt happen all the time. But its been more often than not lately. It doesn't burn or hurt when I go, like with most. I don't feel ill or anything like that either. I used to be able to go and it not smell at all. It's making me really self conscious.   I tried drinking more than my usual amount of water for a couple of days and it did seem to make it go away but I was drinking so much I felt like a water balloon. I drink what i thought to be enough water anyways (about 3 to 4 liters a day). I stopped drinking sodas and coffee's about 3 months ago and started drinking strictly water. I did try drinking that drink called 'vitamin water' but it really didnt agree with my stomach at all so I stay now on water only.  I eat well (fruits and veggies), I exercise half an hour everyday and like I said I drink lots of water. No alcohol or caffeine and i try and stay away from fast/junk food. I've been tested for diabetes and it's came back negative luckily.  I didnt have this issue till about a month ago and I cant really think of anything that changed from then to now. I havent been on any sort of medications either. It's a mystery to me I am hoping someone here knows something about.  Thanks!  M.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, and thank you in advance for your help. I'm afraid the title doesn't even remotely encompass the extent of my problem- please, read on.  I'm 19 years old and I am enrolled in a university. Final examinations were today, and because I wasn't prepared for them, I decided that I needed to stay up all night studying. A friend of mine informed me that Adderall not only helps you focus, but also keeps you awake. I haven't taken Adderall since roughly the 6th grade and my dosage at the time was relatively low, but because I'm a stupid college kid who didn't leave himself enough time to go through legal channels of acquiring said medication, I foolishly purchased some from my friend. He gave me 4 30mg Adderall XRs, and without even considering consulting some sort of dosage table, I took three of them over the course of a 12 hour period. I took my first at 8:45pm, and then the next two at four hour intervals. As a result: >I haven't been asleep in roughly 30 hours, and I feel incredibly fatigued. >I feel incredibly dehydrated, despite the fact that I've been chugging water bottles all morning. >My urine is dark, and smells worse than it should. I'm constantly feeling like I need to pee, and I'm having problems with leaking. >I discovered roughly 2 hours after taking the third pill that I was *completely* incapable of becoming erect.  There are a couple other factors that, after some research, I suspect may have caused this affliction. Yesterday, from 1:00pm until 5:00pm, I smoked about 8 menthol cigarettes- which is more than my typical daily intake crammed into 5 hours. Last night, I ate no food and drank no water from around 5:00pm to roughly 7:30 this morning- instead I drank 2 710ml cans of Lo-Carb Monster Energy drink (which, in total, contained 6,000mg of Taurine, 1,200mg of Panax Ginseng, and a whopping 15,000mg of their 'energy blend' of L-Carnitine, Glucose, Caffeine, Guarana, Inositol, Glucuronolactone, and Maltodextrin. Lastly, I also partake in the relatively frequent recreational use of marijuana.  Please, I very badly want to know what's wrong with me so I can seek treatment as soon as possible. I just need to know if I've done any permanent damage to my body, and if so, what course(s) of treatment would you recommend? If not, how long will these symptoms persist? Are there any remedies I can find in the comfort of my home? Is this impotence going to go away over time? And yes, I can absolutely assure you- this is the last time I will partake in prescription medication that isn't prescribed to me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lowilker,  There are a few possibilities here.  First, you may have a bacteria that is resistant to the antibiotics you are on.  This is relatively unlikely given that both bactrim and cipro are broad spectrum and tend to cover the UTI bacteria well.  Still, occasionally, resistance can occur.  This can be determined by doing a urine culture to grow the bacteria and test its antibiotic sensitivities.  Another possibility is that your infection is not actually from a bacteria.  Viruses can cause urinary tract infections as well.  These do not respond to antibiotics and will clear on their own after around a week or so.  Kidney stones certainly are a possibility.  They are well known to cause tremendous pain and can cause UTI-like symptoms as well.  If there is suspicion of this (particularly if there is blood in the urine) a CT scan can be done.  Another thought is that if UTI/kidney infection symptoms continue despite appropriate antibiotic therapy occasionally it is because there is an abscess around the kidney or bladder that the antibiotics can't get into to help clear the infection.  Follow up with your doctor is important to help determine which, if any, of these is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 16-year-old female. A while ago, I started getting cloudy urine. It stayed that way for about two weeks. Then, I started getting pain in my left side, under my ribs, and I got a fever. I went to the doctor, and my urinalysis did indicate that I had a UTI. I was given medication, it cleared up within a few days, and then I was fine for several weeks, maybe a month. Now, the cloudy urine has come back. This time, the pain is in my right side, and I woke up this morning with a fever. I have been taking 100mg of Doxycycline daily for the last two days. Why are these UTIs recurring, and should I be concerned that the pain is now on the right side (kidney infection, possibly?)?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recurring UTIs w/ cloudy urine, pain, fever",
    "content": "Hi, From your description,it is possible that you have been experiencing episodes of upper urinary tract symptoms + systemic symptoms (possibly due to pyelonephritis).  Pyelonephritis is usually caused by uropathogenic E coli (UPEC), also known as extraintestinal pathogenic E coli (ExPEC).  Structural abnormalities, functional abnormalities or metabolic abnormalities of the urinary tract,  recent antibiotic usage,unusual pathogens & recent urinary tract instrumentations, not only predispose to pyelonephritis but also contribute to recurrences.  In your case, first your urine needs to be cultured to confirm if you indeed have a UTI and if so, you have to be ideally investigated in detail to identify any abnormality that may be responsible for recurrences. Best wishes!\n\n",

Certain foods can make your urine smell strong like asparagus and such. If the smell is there just when you urinate try drinking more water daily and see what happens. Symptoms of a UTI are burning, urgency and frequency.  Do you retract your foreskin when you clean your penis. This is important because you can get an infection under the skin. When you retract is the skin red or irritated in any way or is there any whitish material.\n\n",

All you have to do is go to your local pharmacist and ask for anti fungal cream, and that should remove the smell. It\u2019s pretty common so don\u2019t worry.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, treating for such symptoms is not only safe but important for your baby's safety.  Keep in mind that the warnings on labels about pregnancy are because the usual testing of drugs is not done on pregnant women so the manufacturer cannot claim safety.  This does not mean they are not safe; just that they have not been proven so by usual testing methods.  However, after many women have needed particular drugs in pregnancy, we learn that many are very safe.  It never hurts to be sure and your prescribing physician should always be made aware of your pregnancy. There is also an organization, otispregnancy.org that monitors drugs in pregnancy and breastfeeding and they can be a good resource for information.  \"When it doubt, check it out\" is a good mantra for pregnancy.  But, infection and urinary retention can definitely do harm in pregnancy so symptoms should not be ignored.  Good luck in your pregnancy,\n\n",

    "title": "UTI: antibiotics didn't work, night sweats, shakes? Help?",
    "content": "Hey, I'm really worried and upset at what I think is a urinary tract infection in advanced stages in some way or another. I'm 18, a girl, and not sexually active.   About four months ago, I had a couple of days where I needed to urinate constantly, I was in real discomfort, hot and cold etc. I thought it was just a little cystitis or something and that it would go away. I drank lots of water and took painkillers, and the more painful symptoms were eradicated.   Since then, I've often experienced random 'twinges' of pain after urination, then throughout the dat. However, I didn't really think much of it. I've also found since then that sitting in the same position (e.g. the cinema/movie theater) for a long time has caused discomfort and slight numbness around my genitals, I guess.   However, about a week ago, the symptoms have worsened again. I've found that after urination, I'm in much discomfort, cannot sit still, can't concentrate, slight burning sensations and feeling pretty bad. These symptoms last for around two hours after my morning wee, and for around four hours after an afternoon wee. When I urinate before attempting to get to sleep, it is impossible to lie still and takes me a long time to get to sleep due to the burning, numbness and general pain.   At this point, five days ago I visited my GP. I only explained my most recent feelings, not the ones from few months back, which I should have thought of. I was prescribed a three day course of antibiotics, which I have taken. The situation has not improved. Last night, the discomfort when trying to sleep was awful, and after taking paracetamol I managed about two hours sleep and woke up around 3am, unable to sit or stand still. I was sweaty, felt really hot and I was shaking really quite badly for around an hour in which I drank three large glasses of cold water, to cool myself down and take my mind off the pain.   I saw a second GP this morning, and I brought in a specimen this time. However, it was from my first wee of the morning, and due to large amount of water, it was very weak indeed, and didn't smell like my other 'wees' have recently smelt like. The GP did a dipstick test and said there was nothing abnormal, but said he'd send it off to a lab. Would the fact that it was very weak hide anything, and would I need to get a better sample? He couldn't offer me any other advice, only to take lots of painkillers, which I'm already doing.   I can't take this anymore, and I'm worried that what I originally just left to 'clear up by itself' has developed into something worse that can't be just treated with antibiotics. What are your thoughts?  Thanks you so, so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your symptoms could be due to a UTI. UTIs can be suspected by your symptoms, but can be diagnosed only by a culture test. UTIs are fairly common in women, mostly caused by E.coli in the community setting.  Staphylococcus saprophyticus is also a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young and middle-aged women(next only to E.Coli).  In passing (although not relevant in your case), one should mention the role of vaginal spermicides, which have been suspected to  increases the risk of UTI's. Sexual activity and spermicide exposure are important risk factors for UTI caused by both S saprophyticus and E coli.  Some studies have shown that in young women exposed to spermicide-coated condoms, about 74% of UTIs were caused by S. saprophyticus.  You have to wait for the result of the urinary culture and your doctor no doubt, would start you on the appropriate medication if culture is positive. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, On \"Doctors Lounge', i have probably underlined many times,the importance of having one's sexual partner examined for UTI's and treated (if indicated).  First and foremost,one needs to be sure that one is indeed dealing with a UTI. This can be confirmed be a urine culture which will also help to identify the culprit pathogen.  As you are a young woman, it may be worth remembering that Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young and middle-aged women(next only to E.Coli).Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus associated primarily with community-acquired lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in this age group.  One may also need to keep in mind the possibility of the so-called 'Honeymoon cystitis\" or Traumatic cystitis(due to sexual intercourse). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: UTI Not going away with different antibiotics",
    "content": "Hi, I wonder whether you are confusing Staphylococci and streptococci. Streptococci have been classified by Lancefield into groups A and B etc based on the carbohydrates on their surface.  If you are referring to staphylococci,it was probably due to Staphylococcus saprophyticus infection.  Staphylococcus Saprophyticus has been classified into two groups depending on their property of adherence to the urothelium. Those whose adherence is weak (Group B) and those whose adherence is strong positive (Group A).Those whose adherence is strong(akin to E.Coli), are perhaps more pathogenic.  Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a common cause of urinary tract infections (UTIs) in young and middle-aged women(next only to E.Coli).Staphylococcus saprophyticus is a coagulase-negative staphylococcus associated primarily with community-acquired lower urinary tract infection (UTI) in this group.    Compared with other uropathogens, S. saprophyticus differs from E.Coli infections in that there is marked seasonal variation and geographic distribution. UTI has been documented mostly in women residing in the northern hemisphere, where the prevalence of colonization and infection is more frequent during late summer and autumn.  Infection with Staphylococcus saprophyticus can cause upper urinary tract disease, and the infection is more likely to be 'persistent or recurrent'.  Generally, as some studies have shown,the strongest risk factor for recurrence of cystitis  was the frequency of sexual intercourse. Other risk factors included new sex partner during the past year,spermicide use in the past year, having a first UTI at or before 15 years of age, and having a mother with history of UTI.  Vaginal spermicides, have been suspected to  increases the risk of UTI's.Sexual activity and spermicide exposure are important risk factors for UTI caused by both S saprophyticus and E coli.  Some studies have shown that in young women exposed to spermicide-coated condoms, about 74% of UTIs were caused by S. saprophyticus.  You say that you are not sexually active.However, infections due to S saprophyticus presumably, can still occur.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there i am a 38yr old woman who was diagnosed with fowlers syndrome in Dec 2008. I have been in complete urinary retention since Jan 2008 after suffering an assult! After suffering numerous uti's and struggling to self catheterise due to pain and difficulty inserting the catheter ( apparently this is normal in fowlers syndrome), i had a suprapubic catheter inserted surgically in feb 2009.  In April 2009 i had the first stage of an operation to insert a sacral nerve neuromodulator , hopefully to restore voiding, this was the test phase and seemed to work so my consultant proceeded to the second stage of the op in May 2009 and inserted the sns implant permanently! Unfortunately due to constant urine infections and a perforation of my bladder after having to have my suprapubic catheter reinserted, i have not had any luck with the implant working and so had further surgery in oct to revise the operation, as the electrodes had slipped!!  I am now 4 wks post op and have had constant urine infections the last one was sent for mc&s and showed e-coli!! Many times tho i have the symptoms of a uti and when dipsticked it shows leucocytes, blood , nitrates etc, but when the sample is sent off it comes back as normal, just mixed organisms!! If my implant doesnt work by Jan 2010 the plan is to remove it and i am so frightened of this happening and wondered if anyone knew of any other interventions available? My pain is terrible i have constant pain in my urethra and bladder and although i take gabapentin 600mg tds and buscopan 10mg qds , i am still struggling to get it under control!! My gp is fantastic but is reluctant to change my medication at present due to my implant not working as he doesnt want to exacerbate this!! My consultant is also wonderful in London but they only tend to deal with the sns implant and not the utis etc so i feel i am just been left to deal with this. I work as a district nurse and have had alot of time off due to surgery and pain over the last year, it is having a huge affect on my quality of life and being a nurse makes it worse i am unfortunately not a very good patient and am not coping at all!!! Please help ?!!! Kind Regards Della\n\n",

    "title": "Re: re:fowlers syndrome",
    "content": "Hi, I empathize with you for the predicament you are in. I understand you are a nurse and are well informed about \"Fowler's syndrome\". But, for the use of other readers who may not be that well informed, let me begin by giving a short account of what this all means.  Otherwise unexplained urinary retention in women,occurring as an isolated phenomenon has been shown to be a dysfunction of the abnormal internal urethral sphincter (which normally control the exit of the urine from the urinary bladder), as assessed by transvaginal ultrasonographic volume, electromyography, and pressure profile.  A typical patient with this disorder is likely to be between 20 and 35 years old and may have polycystic ovaries(nearly 50% have them). Frequently,the first retention episode follows a triggering event such as a surgical procedure or childbirth. The retention is unlikely to resolve but is not connected associated with other disorders.  Neuromodulation of the sacral nerves is the only intervention that has been demonstrated to restore voiding.There is, however, a high re-operation rate.  This (Neuromodulation) is an expensive and resource intensive surgical intervention not widely available.  You are lucky in that you had access to this procedure but, unlucky - as your implant failed.  To the best of my knowledge, there is no other tried and tested alternative at present.  The best for you would be to follow up with your urologist who no doubt, has more experience with this. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Maybe someone can help...?  My situation began two years ago.  i was dating a girl that I thoguht was the \"one\"...after several months of dating we had unprotected sex after the old \"STD\" talk.  I was always pretty careful and had been tested for STD's several motnhs earlier...all clear and no problems.  9 days after sex i began to have a tingling sensation rush through my Urethra.  I went to get tested at the local health clinic.  Within about 3 days i had bad Urethrits.  My glans became red and irritated and developed a bump and a rash.    All STD tests came back negative.  The urethrits continued as did the Glans irritation.  At times my glans was \"on fire\"  A small bump insiude the opening began to burn and come and go...almost every few days.    I went to a Urologist who initially thought Herpes.  Although there was no blister he felt it was a atypical presentation.  He sent me to a Infectious disease doctor who ran blood work for chlamydia, herpes, syphilis, gono, HIV and HEP...all were negative...Except  Herpes which came back IGG positive only.  So i had 2 Herpes Type II specific Test done (Pockit test and standarg IGG.IGM test) both negative.  so he said it wasnt herpes.  The infectious disease doctor then did a bacteria l swab of the bump, negaitve except normal skin flora.  After several motnhs the symptoms persisted.  the rash reccurred at the same exact place each time, about 3/4 \" diganol fro mthe opening of meatuus somewhat lateral.  Very irregular.  The rash appears like raised skin cells...and can burn...and when it goes away is followed by red skin for a day and then has developed into a darkened pigmentation.  It always comes and goes in the same exact shape and spot.  my dermatologist said it was nothing and reccomded mental health counseling ((ERRRRR))  the urethrits is constant...especially in the morning, ater sitting and defecation likely from the prostatitis. The symptoms have never changed. Only now I can surely pinpoint my pain coming from my prostate and uethra.  It seems to be very slowly getting worse.    I am getting very frustrated with doctors as the urologists i have been to have not even done a prosate fluid culture or 7 day urine test.  Everyone refers me to the next.    I am surely not imagining this as it is creating symptoms externally and internally and is probably a 4 out of 10 pain daily...everyday.    During a prostate exam. my uro surely create a buring sensation upon pressing the prostate, a burning feelign that lasted the rest of the day.  My worries include prostate concer and urethral cancer, plus i am still not sure if i have a contageous STD????? i am curious about ureaplasmas, HPV, mycoplasmas, \"hidden\" chlamydia in my prostate, fungal, or what?? Any suggestions from out there??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi PTbrigade, Non-gonococcal urethritis (also called Non-specific urethritis) is not only due to Chlamydia, but also can be caused by other agents such as other bacteria (hemophilus spp, ureaplasma spp,etc), viral (adenoviruses, herpes simplex) and also due to some chemical agents(ex: spermicides).  Therefore, testing negative for some of them does not really exclude this diagnosis.  To site an hypothetical example, if a female partner used spermicidal creme of which the male partner was unaware, and if the male partner were to be unluckily allergic/sensitive to this creme, non-specific urethritis could result!That \"one\" may  be unlucky after all!  You said \"followed by red skin for a day and then has developed into a darkened pigmentation. It always comes and goes in the same exact shape and spot\". This leads me to suspect that it could be a 'fixed drug eruption'-a type of reaction to certain drugs and tends to recur at the same spot every time the drug is consumed.I do not know if you were on medications during that phase of your illness. I trust you may be benefited by this information.Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "UTI in men?",
    "content": "Hi,  Pardon the long post, but I want to give a complete picture of my symptoms to hopefully avoid a simple \"men never get UTIs\" response and try to actually start at getting a differential.  As pertinent background: I am a disease ecologist who frequently travels to very remote corners of the world---the places with emerging infectious diseases, malaria, etc. I also have been a habitual/compulsive masturbator---from age 12 to 23, normally 3-8 times per day, as many as 25 or so. Now I'm down to usually 2-4 times a day, rarely more than 8. I'm also married and enjoy a great sex life with my wife.  Since about the age of 15 (two years before I'd ever had sex), I've occasionally come down with symptoms that now seem to be exactly like UTIs (I figured this out after having a wife with UTIs). Basically the symptoms are a need to urinate, cloudy urine and pain (often intense pain) when *not* urinating (and no pain when actually urinating)---this has kept me up all night some nights and caused me to miss school/work on occasion. From age 15-21 I would have these about 3-5 times per year and I wouldn't treat it. It'd usually last 3 or so day and resolve on its own, though a couple times over the next few days the sides of my lower abdomen would start to hurt pretty bad and I'd run a fever of around 102F. I didn't talk to a doctor about this at the time as I was embarrassed. Usually (always?) this happened after masturbating several times in a row and often after I had to close off the tip of my penis with my hand to prevent semen from being excreted when I had to be in public shortly thereafter.  At age 21 I started my career in field biology/disease ecology and worked in a very remote jungle outpost for 5 months; there was no running water, I lived in a small tent and conditions were dirty and primitive. During this time I had probably 10 or so incidents like this (in addition to several other infections of various sorts). I was completely sexually abstinent at the time, thought I frequently masturbated.  Shortly after returning home I realized it might be UTIs and I started taking Cipro (prescribed for traveler's diarrhea) when it happened---and that always cleared it up within a day.  In subsequent trips to the field I've noticed an uptick in events as well, though to a somewhat lesser extent. When at home in America this usually only happens once or twice a year now.  Recently (over the past 6 months) I've had a resurgence in these events. Also, they now seem mostly decoupled from masturbation. They tend to happen more often after sex with my wife than after masturbating. I talked to my doctor about it and he did a rectal exam and said my prostate seemed normal and that UTIs were unlikely. He also ordered tests for several STDs and all of them came out negative. As I wasn't symptomatic at the time, he couldn't order a culture. These incidents seem to usually happen on the weekends when the doctor is out so I tend to take Cipro to ease the often unbearable pain and I've yet to be able to have a culture taken.  My questions are A: do you think these are UTIs? B: If they aren't, any clue what they could be? C: If they probably are, what should I do? Should I worry about them or just keep doing what I'm doing---taking Cipro when they occur and not really worrying about it?\n\n",

Now I'm down to usually 2-4 times a day, rarely more than 8\".Also you say 'I had to close off the tip of my penis with my hand to prevent semen from being excreted when I had to be in public shortly thereafter'. It is obvious that your genito-urinary system had been quite severely tested to its limits for quite a while. I will also hopefully avoid a simple \"men never get UTIs\"- but also add that if men get UTI's and especially 'recurrent' UTI's, they must be fully investigated. It is possible that you may still have a UTI. I suggest that you should - stop using 'Cipro' - reduce masturbation to a \"minimum\" - repeat the urine cultures after a few weeks (sometimes repeated cultures may be needed to culture an offending pathogen) - Keep in touch with your urologist often and  - have your wife also tested - as this almost always helps in preventing recurrences. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "constantly feeling as though I have to urinate",
    "content": "Very recently, yesterday in fact, I started noticing that I constantly FEEL like I have to urinate.  Most of the time barely anything comes out but regardless of a little or a lot right afterwards I get this sensation that can only be mildly compared to what it feels like for a female to orgasm.  It doesn't burn when I urinate, nor is there any blood or foul odor.  It simply feels like there is a ton of pressure on my bladder at random times of the day and I find myself having to rush to the bathroom.  This morning I woke up having to hold it with all of my might and after I went to the bathroom I found that I still felt like I had to go a good 4 or 5 more times, but every time I went just a little came out and the sharp sensation proceeded.  I wasn't sure if this was connected to UTI's or if it could possibly be some other infection or related to something entirely else with the female body.  Please let me know\n\n",

The Dr. told me that it dosen't have to burn or hurt while you are urinating, that just the frequency is enough of a clue to point to a UTI. I wish I would have been diagnosed back then to avoid the pain of a full blown UTI. Go have your urine tested, better now than later.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Urge to void needs  acertain amount of urine in the urinary bladder (how much it is - is mentioned variously in the medical literature - you can take it roughly as 300-500mls. Symptoms such as yours indicates that either your urinary bladder is hyper-sensitive (for example in the various types of cystitis) or that the capacity of the urinary bladder has become smaller due to some pathology (for example as in tuberculosis). The onset of the symptoms had been acute in your case. Therefore, the first thing that comes to one's mind is a UTI. I take it that a culture was done - if not, it should be done. It will confirm a UTI (if any) and also guide the clinician regarding the treatment. Good luck!\n\n",

Balanitis refers to inflammation of the glans penis and posthitis refers to inflammation of the prepuce. this is common in  - Diabetics - inadequate local hygine - at times with STD's It is better for you to consult your GP who, after examining you will be able to decide if you need any referral or not.

    "content": "Hi hippoman, Thank you.Revolix laser procedure is used not only in prostatic surgery, but for other conditions as well (ex.tumors of urinary bladder).Therefore, naturally i wanted to be very sure about what we are dealing with. 'Trial removal' of the Foley's catheter (or 'voiding trial') following TURP (Trans urethral resection of prostate) is a well known procedure - by which, the surgeon decides about catheter removal. When, and for how long?.... the protocols vary from hospital to hospital and perhaps from surgeon to surgeon or even on a case to case basis.Your surgeon is probably going by the protocol he/she is experienced with. If you feel that 4 hours is too short, you can certainly discuss with your surgeon and i believe, he/she will be open to discussion. Thank you for your post.\n\n",

So for the last 4 days I have drank anywhere from 5 to 6 20oz bottles of purified water a day...something my body wasnt very used to before.  Out of no where I started having that squeezing feeling in my bladder just as I finish urinating.  Im not having any other symptom than this but it is highly irritating and I havent had any kind of UTI, bladder, kidney infection in years.

Increased water intake during a UTI....... leading to increased urinary frequency.....therefore increased numbers of painful urination(times you had to visit the toilet)......increased awareness of the  painful experiences........leading you to attribute water intake to UTI.

I have not gone to the doctor yet, and with my work schedule being as hectic and sporadic as it is, it could be some time unless I absolutely need to go. I have had plenty of UTI's before. 2 years ago I had 3 in a row because the meds obviously didn't work. So in other words, I don't need a doctor to diagnose my UTI as I know full well that is what I have. My question is....I have been drinking an ungodly amount of cranberry juice in hopes that this will just flush it out...Will drinking cranberry juice for let's say 7 days straight get rid of my UTI? If it won't cure it..I will definitely see the doctor to get those pills I got last time that I only had to take for 3 days...but I was just wondering if this will work instead? Anyone know? Anyone know what sort of doses I should be taking of cranberry juice? Seems like I have been drinking atleast 4l of it per day. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Natural Remedy?",
    "content": "Dear wallbreaker, Thanks for your question. Generally, drinking cranberry juice for 7 days straight WOULD NOT ERADICATE YOUR UTI PROBLEM. A UTI occurs when bacteria enter the urinary tract & reproduce. It is claimed that over 8 million Americans have had to seek medical attention for UTI's annually. Women are especially susceptible: one in five women will have at least 1 UTI DURING HER LIFETIME. Traditionally, cranberry has been used for the treatment and prophylaxis of UTI's. Research suggests that its mechanism of action is preventing bacterial adherence to host cell surface membranes. Recent controlled trials demonstrate evidence of its utility in UTI prophylaxis. However, cranberry is a safe, well- tolerated herbal supplement that does not have clinically significant drug interactions. I would now briefly outline some key points about cranberry:   1) EFFICACY:  UTI prophylaxis: good effect                          UTI treatment:     evidence lacking at present.  2) SIDE-EFFECTS:  MIGHT INCREASE URINARY OXALATE LEVELS.  3) DRUG INTERACTIONS: NO SIGNIFICANT INTERACTIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTED.  4) COST IN U.S.A. :  TABLETS: 10-20 dollars for a 30-day supply.                                   UNSWEETENED JUICE: VARIES, DEPENDING ON BRAND.  5) DOSAGE: This varies depending on preparation.                         TABLETS: 1 TABLET (300-400mg) TWICE DAILY FOR ONE MONTH.                        JUICE: MAX DOSE: 8 OUNCES (1GLASSFULL) THREE TIMES DAILY.  6) BOTTOM LINE: SAFE HERBAL SUPPLEMENT/ MEDICINE; VERY EFFECTIVE IN UTI PROPHYLAXIS.  7) CAUTION: REGULAR USE/ OVERDOSE OF CRANBERRY JUICE MAY INCREASE THE RISK OF KIDNEY STONE FORMATION (RENAL CALCULI). N.B. DRINKING 4L OF IT A DAY IS HAZARDOUS TO YOUR REPRODUCTIVE & SEXUAL HEALTH i.e. pain during sexual intercourse or spasmodic contraction of the vaginal walls, making it very difficult for easy penetration of the penis during sex. Also, from a british perspective, it could cause repeated/ recurrent UTI's if u continue to drink this overdose. USE DOSAGE SUGGESTED ABOVE FOR AT LEAST 1 MONTH. You may also have to visit your doctor in order to obtain those antibiotics if signs & symptoms persist for over 3-4 weeks. Whether drinking the juice/ tablets would lead to a cure; this ques. is still open for debate--- your guess is as good as mine. Once a patient of mine asked me,''Why do women have UTI's more often than men?''  My answer was simple: 1) bacteria can reach the bladder more easily in women   2) The urethra is shorter in women than in men, so bacteria have a shorter distance to travel.  3) The urethra is located near to the rectum in women: bacteria from the rectal region could travel up the urethra and so cause UTI's.  I WOULD NOW GIVE YOU SOME PRACTICAL TIPS AS TO HOW TO PREVENT RECURRENT UTI's: ( your Dr. should have told u this)----  a) Drink plenty of water to flush out the bacteria.  b) Do not hold in your urine: urinate when u feel like u need to. When bladder is full, let it out A.S.A.P. BECAUSE THE MORE U HOLD IN YOUR URINARY FLOW, THE GREATER THE NOS. OF BACTERIA IN YOUR URINARY TRACT AND NOT ALL WOULD PASS OUT.  c) After each bowel movement, wipe from front to back and never the other way around.  d) Urinate right after having sex to help wash away bacteria.  e) Practice good personal hygiene as well as good menstrual hygiene: i.e. use sanitary pads instead of tampons.  f) Always use enough lubrication during sex. Women could try using a small amount of K-Y JELLY before sex if they are a little dry.  g) Women with repeated UTI's may want to avoid using a diaphragm. Ask your doctor about other alternative birth control choices.  kindly let me know whether this info was of any use to you and whether you have any more questions relating to herbal supplements.   yours truly, D. SAWH                                                                               M.Sc., Pharm.D., M.D., F.R.C.P. (UK).[/quote]\n\n",

The main reason why u cannot stomach the juice is because u used too much of it already and so the juice would react with your stomach acid, thereby creating an acid-on acid situation.

    "content": "Thanks for the great advice and knowledge. I called my doctor and apparently they want me to drop off a urine sample and wait for the test results which could take a full day. I think I will end up just going to the hospital because its easier and more convenient for me. I have stopped drinking cranberry juice and am currently still taking the pills. I woke up for the first time without feeling the UTI so these pills really do work much better. On a side note, anyone reading this and wondering about the cranberry juice, do yourself a favor and skip it and go for the capsules. As a result of drinking so much cranberry juice my throat is raw and luckily my wicked heart burn is going away.It helped my UTI feel better but not nearly as much as the capsules. So in the end, the results weren't the best for the juice as it just caused more problems for the little comfort I got from it.  Save yourself the hassle LOL\n\n",

    "content": "Hello wallbreaker, In the case of Apo-Sulfatrim, usually between 10-14 days. It is usually advisable to complete the prescribed course of treatment given to you. Along with the treatment, don't forget the practical tips that I had listed before and also whilst on the medication, DO NOT USE ANY CRANBERRY JUICE OR TABLETS. UTI's can be a damn nuisance to most women like yourself but try as much as possible to hang in there. If the UTI persists even when the treatment has been completed, kindly contact me at this very forum and let me know of the situation. YOU MUST COMPLETE THE COURSE OF TREATMENT BEFORE GETTING IN CONTACT WITH ME AND YES IT IS NORMAL: REMEMBER THAT UTI's CANNOT BE CURED COMPLETELY USING JUST SOME OF THE MEDICATION AND EXPECTING TO SEE RESULTS OVERNIGHT. It takes some time in the majority of women depending on several factors, e.g. the nature of infection( whether bacterial, viral or fungal), how long you initially had the infection, when did you first notice the symptoms, the extent of infection as well as the severity of the infection, etc. UTI's ALWAYS HAVE A TENDENCY TO RETURN AFTER THE FIRST INFECTION; COULD BE 2-4 WEEKS TIME, 1-6 MONTHS AFTER, ETC. IT ALL DEPENDS ON YOUR PERSONAL HYGIENE AND SANITARY HABITS AND WHETHER YOU HAVE ANY LESIONS, LACERATIONS, ETC. ANYWHERE ON YOUR GENITALIA OR ANYWHERE ON YOUR SKIN.  SOME QUESTIONS FOR YOU TO ANSWER :   1) WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATION?   2) HAVE U AT ANY TIME USE YOUR WORKPLACE'S WASHROOM? HOW OFTEN DO YOU HAVE THE URGE TO GO?   3) WHEN WAS YOUR LAST MENSTRUAL PERIOD? IS YOUR MENSTRUATION REGULAR OR VERY IRREGULAR? PLEASE EXPLAIN !   4) WHEN LAST DID YOU HAVE SEX? WAS IT PROTECTED OR UNPROTECTED SEX? HOW MANY TIMES PER WEEK DO U HAVE SEX? DO YOU HAVE ONE FAITHFUL PARTNER OR MULTIPLE SEX PARTNERS? AT ANY TIME DURING SEX, DID A COMDOM BURST INSIDE OF YOU ? IF YES, WHAT DID YOU DO AFTERWARDS ! WHAT TYPE OF SEXUAL ACTIVITY DO YOU NORMALLY ENGAGE IN : VAGINAL, ANAL AND ORAL SEX OR A COMBINATION OF THEM. IF YES, TELL ME IN WHAT ORDER---- PLEASE BE AS TRUTHFUL AS POSSIBLE WITH YOURSELF---- NOTHING TO BE ASHAMED OF.   5) THE DOCTOR THAT GAVE YOU THE 3-DAY COURSE OF TABLETS, IS HE/SHE THE SAME DOCTOR THAT PRESCRIBED  THE APO- SULFATRIM TABS. ? IF NO, GO BACK TO THE DOCTOR THAT HAD PRESCRIBED THE 3-DAY COURSE AND EXPLAIN YOUR SITUATION TO HIM / HER. I HAVE AN IDEA AS TO WHAT THEY WERE BUT ENQUIRE ITS NAME AND WRITE IT DOWN AND LET ME KNOW AS SOON AS POSSIBLE--- OK !   6) IF YOU CANNOT GET IN TOUCH WITH THE DOCTOR, THEN CONTACT ME IMMEDIATELY INFORMING ME OF THE SITUATION ---- AND I WOULD THEN TELL YOU WHAT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR APPROX. 97% OF MY FEMALE PATIENTS WITH UTI'S WHICH I PRESCRIBE TO THEM.   7) ARE YOU EXPERIENCING ANY SIDE - EFFECTS FROM THE APO -SULFATRIM? IF SO, WHAT ARE THEY?  DID YOUR DOCTOR GIVE YOU ANY ADVICE ON HOW TO PREVENT A UTI FROM RECURRING AND DID HE COUNSEL YOU ON THE PRECAUTIONS TO TAKE WHEN USING APO- SULFATRIM? IF SO WHAT WERE THEY?  LOOKING FORWARD TO A SWIFT AND TIMELY RESPONSE. PLEASE REMEMBER BE AS HONEST AS POSSIBLE WITH YOUR RESPONSES TO ALL OF THE ABOVE QUESTIONS---- IT IS YOU THAT NEED URGENT HELP !   YOURS TRULY,  D. A. SAWH  M.Sc., Pharm.D., M.D., F.R.C.P. (U.K.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I was just reading the distress you have been going through with your UTI\u2019s. I\u2019ve glad that DHARAM  is following through this with you. He is very knowledgeable in the field.   I have a thought that might help, I would like to suggest something we use over here in the United States for UTI  and it works very well in 3 days the UTI is gone and the other pill numbs your bladder so that it doesn\u2019t hurt to urinate, it turns your urine orange but only for a few day. They work really quickly.  Antibiotic \u2013 nitrofurantoin-macroa 100mg  (Macrobid) = take 1 tblt  2 x a day  for 3 \u2013 5 days Pain relief\u2014phemazopyridine 200 mg (Pyridium) = take 1 tblt 3 x a day as needed for pain = this medicine stops bladder spasms and numbs your urethra so you can urinate without pain. It caused your urine to turn orange temporary.  I think you can get these medications in New Brunswick. Don\u2019t mix your medications and don\u2019t abruptly stop other medications. Make sure you understand what you\u2019re on and what it\u2019s for, how long have you been on it, can you just drop it?    Urinary Tract Infections can be caused from virus and a type of bacteria called Escherichia coli (E.coli) which normally live in the colon. This is from wiping in the wrong direction usually. Other causes of chronic UTI is CHLAMYDIA and MYCOPLASMA. Have you had a culture done on your urine to see what you have, maybe you\u2019re treating the wrong thing?\n\n",

I am currently on my period 4. I can't remember the last time I had sex since this UTI has been with me for over 2 weeks and I haven't had sex since it. Normal Vaginal, unprotected with my husband 5. This isn't the doctor that prescribed those 3 day pills, that was in another city. I went the the emergency room and they took a urine sample and told me there was bacteria in my urine and simply handed me over the prescription, no questions, no answers really as they were busy. 7. The Apo actually kept me tired but awak, if that makes sense, for the first few days.  Other than that, nothing really noticeable.  Thanks for the quick response. I only have 6 pills left to take (3 day course at 2 pills per day) and I do not feel better  During the day I am fine because I am drinking lots of water...but when I wake up and before I go to bed is the burning part.  I intend on finishing the pills but I am so angry at the doctor who prescribed them because I told him about the situation 2 years ago and about those miracle 3 day pills and yet he still give me something that isn't working.\n\n",

I did have a strong feeling that the medication would work but it would take some time because it is not a miracle cure--- the entire dose must be completed before we could proceed further. I was fully aware of this particular medication because I am also a registered pharmaceutical importer with the company in Canada that manufactures your medication, viz., APOTEX PHARMACEUTICALS WHICH MAKES EXCELLENT GENERIC DRUGS FOR GUYANA AS WELL.   However, I would strongly advise you to abstain from sex for at least 5-7 days---  this is to avoid any dormant germs from raising their ugly heads, thereby, preventing the spread to your husband and so preventing the vicious cycle from occurring again.  I WOULD LIKE TO SINCERELY HOPE & PRAY THAT YOU WOULD NOT HAVE TO GO THROUGH THIS AGAIN IN THE NOT TOO DISTANT FUTURE.

I thought of adding some info which may be useful to you to uderstand UTI's better.  - You say 'i know i have UTI'... the only way to confirm that you have UTI and to know which microorganism is causing it is by a urine culture. - Urinary symptoms suggestive of UTI don't always mean one has a UTI. - Cranberry juice mainly prevents adhesion of certain microbes to the inner lining of the urinary tract (urothelium) - notably E.Coli. - It 'prevents' to an extent UTI developing,but does not 'Treat' it.  Therefore, if one has already developed an established UTI, no amount of cranberry juice is going to help.The bacteria firmly attached to the urothelium will presumably watch the cranberry juice harmlessly pass by!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Just wondering if anyone could help me here. I have had bladder infections my whole life. Its been about 1 years since the last one. About 2 months ago I was helping my boyfriend lift heavy things. My lower \"flank\" area of my back started to hurt. The pain seem to get worse and worse, only to eventually make me trow up a few times. I went to the doc and he did a urine test, which he said showed no kidney infection (a precaution due to symptoms) but there was red cells in it. So he perscribed an antibiotic. So the pain remainded the following 2 months till about 3 days ago. I woke up and used the washroom. It was find until teh last few drops and it stareted to hurt!! Bladder infection. The next 3 days till I could get into the docs office was the usual pain after pee, frequent need to pee and not peeing when feeling like I have to. I went to the doc and he tested the pee again and said no infection but there were red and white cells this time and again antibiotics. The pain in my back is not getting any better and is starting to be a very big annoyance. I should also mention that he sent my urine for a kidney culture and it came back find, the \"correct\" level of bacteria was presnet. Could someone help me???\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Angel29, Having gone through your history,firstly let me offer a few general comments... - Not all pains in the loins mean UTI. - Not all urinary symptoms mean UTI - a 'suspected' UTI only becomes UTI if a urinary culture is positive. - 'cystitis' and UTI are not one and the same. - red blood cells in the urine sometimes are contaminants from the vagina(ex. menstrual blood) - all urinary complaints should be taken seriously and investigated.  Having said that ,your loin pain which started while lifting a heavy object tends to suggest a pain due to a muscle strain/sprain or of spinal origin.This possibility should be kept in mind.Good luck!\n\n",

I also am eating cranraisins and drinking cranstrawberry juice.I personally don't think i have kidneystones and i have no problems urinating,no burning, no smell just looks a little cloudy.Do you think it is something else or should i get a second opinion? I also have a 7 yr old daughter who started seeing blood when she wipes her after peeing.I took her to peds and did the 24 hr urine analisys and she has blood and protein in urine.Her appt to see a specialist isn't til Dec 08.She has no other problems,no pain,just at least twice a month and its a good amount of blood since june 08. I was told it could be her kidneys.Could we both have kidney problems?She drinks ALOT of water but don't use restroom alot.I drink alot of tea and i go 3-4 times a day.Is that normal for both of us?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi blackulous, Your loin pain could have been due to UTI or crystalluria (sometimes crystals in the urine may block the ureters temporarily causing a colic - as well as a cloudy urine).Drinking lots of tea is in a way, benificial with regard to urinary stones, as it delays calcium absorbtion (i am in no way advising you or others to drink more tea!).I do not know if your urine was cultured and if it showed any UTI.  As far as your daughter is concerned, she definitely needs a urological work up.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "My wife is a 36 years old healthy woman.  She started to feel there was some thing in her throat near the base of the neck about 2 weeks ago.  She eventually felt unconfortable enough to see her doctor a week ago (last Friday).  The doctor couldn't really check any thing deep inside the throat. She suspected acid reflex, and prescibed  Ranitidine.  My wife started to take Ranitidine last Friday.  The next day (Saturday) she woke up in the morning and felt very dizzy.  She also felt weak and shaky, lying on bed most of the time.  She stopped taking Ranitidine since then.  Since it's Christmas, she waited till Monday to see ergent care.  The doctor couldn't find anything wrong except very slight indication of urinay tract infection, and prescribed Cipro.  She started to take Cipro twice on Monday and once on Tuesday morning, but she felt much worse on Tuesday.  Since she never had those typical symptoms of urinary tract infect like frequent urinations or burning feeling, we suspected Cipro did more harm than good.  So she stopped taking Cipro that night and went to see her regular doctor on Wednesday morning.  The doctor tested urine and believed she did have urinary tract infection and suggested continueing with Cipro.  She has been taking Cipro since then.  Now it's Thursday night.  My wife still feels very weak, and has been lying on bed most of the time.    Do all these sound like urinary tract infectin to you?  Could barely detectable infection on Monday cause that bad whole body weakness 2 days ago (Saturday)?  If it's urinayr tract infection, should it be much better by now with Cipro?\n\n",

With the UTI I have not had any of the symptoms you described.  I don't know what Cipro is but to give you an idea how long it could take I'm on my 3rd lot of a different type of antibiotics which now seems to be helping, I was on one sort for 1 week it didn't do much on a different one for 2 weeks didn't help much at all now on a different one and it seems to be working.  In all the information I have read about UTI's I didn't read anything like what your wife has.  I think you should take your wife back to the doctor ASAP, if you don't seem to be getting anywhere with the current doctor with the next visit maybe try a different doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi goodwordtoday, Read through your post.Intravesical instillation of silver nitrate solution had been tried in several conditions - notably interstitial cystitis (where the etiology is not thought to be UTI). I am not aware of it being used for UTI for the sole reason that the patient is sensitive to commonly used antibiotics. Silver nitrate acts by destroying (cauterising)the bladder mucosa (perhaps the most toxic among intravesically instilled drugs). Silver nitrate instillation is contraindicated in patients with vesico-ureteric reflux - as it will inevitably cause destruction in the ureters and kidneys). I hope this will help to clarify your doubts. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry if this is long. I'll do my best to keep it short.  Around Mid april I'd occasioanlly feel a burning sensation in my penis. Soon this was accompanied by an odd feeling in my bladder. Not really a pain, perhaps a pressure. Around the 20th i'd have these feelings and feel as if i needed to urinate. I would only go in small amounts, so feel the need to urinate frequently. Perhaps a few hours later i would be able to urinate in healthy amounts again. The next couple days there was no problems. Then on a sunday night they came back with a force. The burning, the bladder feeling which turned into pain. I was unable to urinate and would only manage barely a dribble, which also felt like razor blades to pass. The dribble i could manage then turned pink, then from that time on every dribble i passed was accompanied by one or two blood clots.  I went to the hospital. Was put into a room, they checked my vitals. After talking with me took blood, gave me a few pills and took the dribble of urine i could manage to pass. Eventually from the pressure i was cathatorized. After being cathatorized nothing came out. She sought the DR and he did something manually and i guess it dislodged blood clots which were blocking me up. I had a bag or two of water hooked up and they flushed me out. I was sent home in the morning with a 7 day prescription of Biaxcin, bioxin... something like that, 4 pills a day, at 500mg. Days after i would still have the issue of only managing to pass small amounts of urine frequently. I need to note that at no time except the one night with the blood clots did i feel any pain while urinating.  I saw a urologist and he came to the conclusion i probably gave myself a serious UTI by having unprotected se and not urinating afterwards.  About mid last week symptioms came back. Felt like i needed to urinate, could only pass small amounts which i passed frequently. Later on i'd be able to pass normal amounts. I'd get sudden little pains in my penis and bladder, not a burning this time but little pains. So i got to the hospital thinking i'm getting another UTI. My urine came back clean. He gave me an ultrasound and my bladder had almost nothing in it yet i felt a pressure. He told me to make an appointment with the urologist and put my on a 14 day trial of ciprofloxacin, 2 pills a day at 500mg. He also checked my prostate.  Juring this last episode, and days prior to the urine problems coming back i'd started getting a little pain on my left side, not in the back but right in the love handle. Later the night of its first appearance i felt it in my right side. And have periodically over the past week. Not often. Not sevear.  I need to note i've been checked for STD's, blood and the penis swab. I also need to note that i'd been drinking alcohol over the weekend, everyday. But that then, and juring the last spell when i drank alcohol i didnt feel any pains and i never had any issues urinating, I'd also urinate to what i'd think would be a bladder full at those times. I started the antibiotic last last week and drank alcohol on friday night and saturday night, quite a bit. And yesturday (monday) i had the worst pain as of yet, and the most retention. Yet today the pain feels better.   I'm 24, male, had my gallbladder taken out about a year ago. Have Diverticulosis and a fatty liver. There is a history or kidney and bladder problems on My mothers side.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Eric:  Reading your description, it seems like someone would have thought to check for a kidney stone.  Since it seems so obvious to me, I'm thinking that part of what you wrote didn't get through to the doctors you saw.  Could it be that they checked for kidney stone but you didn't know they did?  Did anyone do something called an ultrasound?  This is when they spread gel on your skin, then press on your skin where the gel is, and a picture (sort of looks like a weather map) shows up on a monitor.  The things you mentioned that make me think of a kidney stone include:  symptoms associated with alcohol intake, pain that comes and goes and its location, stinging sensation in the urethra, the urinary frequency you've had off and on, and family history of kidney problems.  The frequency could be a due to ureteral spasm (ureters connect kidneys with bladder), which happens because the stone is irritating to the ureter tissue.  Alcohol intake is a clue to the type of kidney stone, which determines the symptoms.  There are calcium, struvite, and uric acid stones.  I'm thinking that you may be most likely to form uric acid stones, which tend to present like gravel rather than discrete, single stones.  If anyone in your family history has had kidney stones or gout, then I would say uric acid stones are your problem.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Inokc,  There are a few other tests that may be helpful.  A VCUG (voiding cystourethrogram) can help to look for any reflux of urine back up into the ureters.  It can also help to look for incomplete voiding where the bladder is not fully emptied during voiding.  Both these conditions can result in an increased risk of infection.    It may also be helpful to have some pressure studies to see if there are any issues with abnormal pressures in the bladder that may be causing some increased risks of infection.  Follow up with your urologist will be important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  inokc, I sicerely hope that the recureent UTI's that you metion are 'culture- proven'  UTI's and not mere suspicions. The reason why i am saying this is that using Macrodantin daily based on mere suspicion may not be a wise thing to do.This may mask your symptoms and ofcourse, may lead to resistance of the microorganisms.  In the modern era, microbes have become resistant to most newer broad spectrum antibiotics but often remain sensitive to narrower spectrum drugs such as Nitrofurantoin (Macrodantin).  Therefore it may not be wise to use these drugs without definite proof of UTI. Because you seem to have suffered a straddle injury in the past, sequelae of perineal truma should be investigated for (although urthral injuries due this mode of trauma are more probable in males). Thank you for your post.\n\n",

Then I started having pains in my lower left stomach (below navel, right above pubic bone) and now I am having pains in my left back/side, in the \"kidney\" area. They are not sharp pains, just dull ones that last for a few seconds and go away. ALL of my pain seems to be on my left side - my right side feels fine. I am not having any burning during urination or urinating too frequently. Thank you for your time, any suggestions are appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I need some advice for a medical advice. Here is my situation\u2026 The first week of July 2008 I started getting an irritation in my urethra (just inside the pee hole). It is now the end of September and it is no worse or better (about the same). Details: 1.\tThere was no discharge  2.\tNo pain while peeing 3.\tMild pain during sex 4.\tUrine culture neg. 5.\tUA neg. 6.\tHSV neg. 7.\tHIV neg. 8.\tRPR neg. 9.\tGC neg. 10.\tChlamydia neg. 11.\tTreated for flag. (just in case) 12.\tSpot test for HPV (vinegar soaked bandage) did not show any white (Doctor said this was not a perfect test, but did not show anything nonetheless) My regular doctor said he cannot do anything for me as he has no clue to what it is. He ruled out obvious stuff. Part two\u2026thins get complicated. I just had lithotripsy (shockwave). The Urologist tested my prostrate and said it was of normal size (no issues). My PSA was fine last February. The urologist seems to think that this irritation was caused by the stone (upstream) in my Kidney. He also said that stress can cause this in men too. He did not want to examine me for this and just wanted to focus on the stone. So, most of the stones are now gone. I have no answers and I still have this irritation just inside my urethra. No one seems concerned (except me). Can you give me advice on what this is? If not, can you suggest an approach to help diagnose what I have (or am experiencing)?  This is driving me crazy! Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your symptoms can be shared by many conditions including genitourinary tract infection (like urinary tract infection, prostatitis or urethritis) and stones.   Urine analysis and urine culture are usually enough to exclude infection and it is good that your doctor excluded serious infections.   Having a history of stones makes recurrent stone or even increase in the concentration of urine solutes (like urates and oxalates) a likely cause. This can be also checked by simple urine analysis. Try to observe if these symptoms increase when you do not drink enough (concentrated urine) and vice versa.  Inflammationof the epithelium lining external opening of the penis due to a contact with an irritant or after sexual activity may give similar clinical picture. Direct clinical examination is essential to rule out the case.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him repeating the urine analysis and culture as well as radiological investigations to exclude recurrent stones.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Having gone through your very detailed account & your social history, i wish to make the following comments. a) one of the causes of referred pain in the tip of the penis is seminal vesiculitis - a condition at times overlooked. b) Intestinal protozoal infections occassionally can cause UTI's- again, at times overrlooked. c) The need to investigate and treat (if needed) one's sexual partner/spouse - again, at times overlooked. As Dr. Safaa Mahmoud has rightly suggested, please keep in touch with your doctor and keep on the look out for recurrent urinary stones periodically. Avoid using vaseline. Multipurpose lubricating gels are perhaps safer. I hope you are free from the problem by now. Good luck!\n\n",

After one month of my marital life, my wife got painful urination, burning sensation, pain  and itching in the genital area and pain during the sex. Soon I got swelling in epididymo. I did not have any other symptoms except once I had pain while discharging and pain in the groin. She was treated but I did not take any treatment. She soon got well but I still had problem so I also visited doctor and he put me on Levofloxacin 250mg before meal twice a day, Nuberol Fort 3 times a day, \"SERRATIOPEPTIDASE DS\" 3 times a day and \"Diclofenac Potassium  50mg\" 2 times a day. I took this medicine for 7 days. During all this period I did not have sex. I again went to the doctor and he further put me on Trinidazole BP and SERRATIOPEPTIDASE DS for 3 days. All of my symptoms were gone except the swelling in epididymo. After abstaining from sex for 13 days, I started sex again and the pain hit back in the groin. I then changed my doctor. The new doctor is Urologist and Transplant Surgeon. He advised me renal tract and scrotum ultrasound and urine R/E test. Ultrasound report said \" Mild Cystitis\" and urine report said \" Ph = acidic\". The doctor advised me Levofloxacine 500mg twice a day and Vibormycine twice a day. Both medicines were for 10 days. He also prescribed me Voren tablets for pain. During all this medication I had regular sex but all the time, I've been using condoms. I've been taking lots of fluids and urinate frequently. One thing more I must tell you is that my wife is in 14th week pregnancy.  Even taking all this medicine, I still have slight pain which increases and decreases.  The last time I visit doctor, he said Im perfectly alright now but the pain is still there in the groin and epididymo and the swelling in the epididymo also exists. He thinks it may because of muscular pain. He prescribed me pain killer only.   I'm so much worried now. Please tell me what more I'm supposed to do. Should I stop sex? etc etc...

I have been on a constant course of antibiotics (cephalexin) for approaching 6 months. As soon as I stop taking the antibiotics the infection reoccurs. I have also taken numerous other antibiotics but with no positive results.  I have also been prescribed Azithromycin to take in addition to the cephalexin. This still does not resolve the issue.   I am in extreme pain and the infection never really clears up. Mid stream urine samples taken whilst on antibiotics have actually shown no growth cultures, but symptoms persist.   My urologist can not see me until August and I am at my wits end as to what to do now. I am trying to find another urologist.   I would greatly appreciate any suggestions you might have as to what other reasons (other than uncomplicated UTI) could be causing me this much discomfort and no relief in sight.   The pain is not limited to burning in the sphincters of the urethra, it very much feels higher and more intense in the general area of the bladder itself.   Please help. Many thanks,   Bree.\n\n",

    "content": "The symptoms that you report suggest a mixed infection. Severe itchiness in the vagina and around the vulva is usually associated with trichomoniasis or candidiasis. Malodorous vaginal discharge is suggestive of trichomoniasis or bacterial vaginosis. If associated with relatively little itching, it is suggestive of bacterial vaginosis, but this is not your case, because you complain of bad itching. In candidiasis, there is no malodor, but itching can be severe and cause marked genital skin discomfort.   The symptoms of lower abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, and a burning sensation on urination are suggestive of a urinary tract infection, possibly cystitis or urethritis. Lower abdominal pain may also represent coincident salpingitis. Douching is not recommended, because the action transmits bacteria and other organisms in the vagina higher up in the genital canal. This may cause salpingitis with consequent lower abdominal pain.  Without an examination, I cannot tell you what those bumps are, but get examined to exclude vulvar warts. If vulvar warts are confirmed, you and your husband must have a full screen for STDs.      There is one important thing you must now do \u2013 get checked by a genitourinary physician to establish a diagnosis so that effective treatment can be administered.

About 45 minutes after taking bthe tablet I vomited but I don't know whether this could of been caused by the fact I had not eaten all morning.

I feel the urge to urinate and nothing comes out. This lasts for about 2 hours. It does not go away after I finally urinate, it just fades away. When I do urinate it does not burn, and it does not give relief. Also, my rear end becomes very sweaty when this happens. Odd, but consistent, symptom. This happens at least every other day, and currently daily, sometimes twice a day. I take cranberry pills and drink cranberry juice, but i'm not sure of its effectiveness.

    "content": "Hello --  There is a medical condition, a frequency-urgency syndrome that usually occurs in females, and is not necessarily \"overactive bladder\" (although that also can happen and the two are sometimes lumped together).  Interstitial cystitis is the most common cause of your symptoms, although it is often accompanied by pain as well. There are a number of medical (medicinal) therapies for this condition if this is found to be the problem. If it is, instead,  simple \"overactive bladder\",  there are also a couple of medications for this, once UTIs have been ruled out, which seems to be the case with you. For that reason you probably need to be seen by a urologist in order to diagnose accurately so as to medicate properly and get you some relief from this terribly annoying problem.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

He has complained of the side pain before now but no cloudy urine until recently. He is so afraid of getting another kidney stone he only drinks bottled water now and has lost weigh due to this fear.

    "content": "Hi there -  It does sounds as though your son may have an infection, based on the signs and symptoms reported. The weight loss due to avoiding things he fears may cause another stone could become a serious concern if it continues. So  far it's had a positive effect, but for the wrong reasons. While those  predisposed to kidney stones can be affected to some degree by certain dietary items, this is not the way to go about avoiding one, especially with a possible infection aboard as well.   Having had a kidney stone once places a person at a slight additonal risk of developing an infection later, or this could actually be another stone manifesting in a more gentle way than usual. In either case your son needs to be evaluated promptly by a doctor, preferably a urologist, to rule out both a kidney infection and a stone. Please try and impress this upon him. He's not doing himself any good by simply changing his diet (although that may have had an unintentional good side effect).   Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you and to your son.\n\n",

I am not really comfortable with that so I am in the process of getting him in to the urology dept at UVA. He does not have health insurance currently and they have programs there with a referral that he qualifies for. I am glad that he is not showing any infection but the pressure and pain in his side comes and goes. The doc explained that with him drinking so much water and only drinking juice occasionally that the acid in juice could be reason for cloudy urine. (shoulders raised) Not sure if that is correct but both of us will be more comfortable with a urologist checking him out. He has had so many issues with his kidney on the right side. He was power slammed when he was 12 on a concrete slab and had alot of contusions and bleeding in urine then. The weigh loss is a concern also. His appetite has drastically changed since the first kidney stone. He lost from 235lbs to 185lbs since May of this year. Height is 5ft.10inches.  So again thank you and have a blessed day.

    "content": "Hello again -  The muscle spasm theory is not unreasonable, but it is only a theory. Same thing goes for the juice/cloudy urine idea. Could be.  Good to know there's nothing clearly going on, but your concern would seem warranted anyway, so if you can get him in to be seen at urology at UVA, that should be a huge help one way or the other.    The weight loss is remarkable,  although it's certainly positive.  Fifty pounds in five months would at least average 10 per month, and that's about as much as one would reasonably want to lose in that span of time. He could safely lose more, but only assuming proper nutrition along with it. His current weight is certainly healthier than the original, so even if this turns up nothing ultimately,  at least that will have been a positive side  effect -- again, proper nutrition considered.  Best of luck to you and to him. Please let us know if you do get him in to be seen at UVA and how that goes. Do stay in touch.\n\n",

This is possible, although rare. At least, for now, it seems you know what's going on, so if you can avoid a long and expensive trip, it's all to the good. Bactrim is the \"go to\" drug for UTIs, so hopefully it will knock this out in short order.   We'll be looking forward to your update.\n\n",

I am also hoping to find out just what type of stones they are so he can possibly stay away from foods that are making them develop. They also spoke of calcification (if spelled correctly) in his right kidney.The fever was coming from a virus which reeked havoc on our family for over a week. Nasty stomach virus this year. Oh and he also had bilirubins in his urine. They are saying he has some form of anemia that is hereditary. Anyway I am know we are well on the way to getting him back to great health. Just wanted to update. Thank you for your advice and help. Adiggs\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, and thanks for the update! This is relatively good news (it would be better if nothing had happend to start with, but at least now you know what's going on and it is definitely fixable). Lithotripsy should disintigrate the stones that are there now, and if some underlying dietary cause can be found to help avoid future repeats that would be great. (Sometimes living in a hard water area can contribute in susceptible individuals). Please let us know how things go. Best of luck to you all.\n\n",

    "content": "For danielsmommy:  Without the radiologist's report for reference purposes, and understanding that the doctor said it was \"normal\" what you should assume is just that. I don't know why doctors and radiologists both frequently make these offhand remarks and leave the patient sitting up at night, later, wondering what it means. Usually it doesn't mean anything. Often, in fact, spots such as were mentioned can be due to gas trapped in the colon, which actually could  be the cause of your discomfort. It's hard to say, but usually these spots are superficial and really don't mean much. If it concerns you, though, I would strongly suggest asking the doctor directly. It's not right to have this sort of half-information tossed off like that, even  though it does sound quite innocent.   I hope this helps.  Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to  you.\n\n",

I am having to take more and more tramadol to keep from being in agony.  If I get the spinal block, where could I go after that to find the cause of this pain?  My grandfather died of kidney cancer...that really worries me.  I don't know if it could be cancer or if it could be adhesions from my c section but no one seems to want to find out.  They did do a ct scan but won't really discuss it with me except to say there were no kidney stones.  Can another doctor look at the ct scan?  It is on file at the hospital.

Since that seems to have been ruled out, You may want to have a urological consult to rule out any sort of anatomical, non-pathological abnormality of the prostate, since the substance you descrine sounds most like clear semen which may be escaping via some abnormal route. Not serious in itself, it could become a problem somewhere down the road. If this exam were to show up nothing, I can't  think of anything else that could be causing this really peculiar symptom, but it certainly does seem benign.  Please follow up with us here as needed, or at least give us an update on the problem. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

There are other conditions  which also could cause this, of course, so everything should be ruled out (or in) and the underlying cause, whatever it is, should be treated as necessary. Most likely is a simple cystitis (bladder infection), but whatever it is, blood cells are not supposed to be in the urine and the white ones almost always signify infection somewhere along the tract.

    "content": "Hi SadEmptyWoman1986,  If you have had multiple urine infections it may be a good idea to have a renal ultrasound and a voiding cystourethrogram to see if you have any structural abnormalities or vesicoureteroreflux (when the urine goes backwards up the ureters to the kidney).  If there are any of these present it may be recommended to take a daily antibiotic to prevent urine infections.  UTI's are very, very common in young women, particularly those that are sexually active.  The reason is that the urethra in women is short making it easier for bacteria to enter the bladder.  It may be that you are one of the unfortunate women that will get many urine infections without any \"set up\" for getting them.  In this case, drinking plenty of water can help keep the bladder flushed to wash out any bacteria present.  Some people believe drinking cranberry juice can help prevent UTI's.  Some studies support this and others show it not to be true.  Overall, it is a safe thing to do so it may be worth a try.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello YoungWorried,  You did not mention if you are sexually active or not.  If so, there is always the possibility you could have a very early miscarriage - before knowledge of pregnancy.  There are other hormonal irregularities that can cause such symptoms on occasion.  If it does not continue it is probably nothing to worry about.  Bleeding that soaks a pad every hour for several hours should be reported to your doctor.  Clots are not considered a problem for the most part. When blood pools for a while, the natural response is for it to clot, then when you expel it, this is what you see - scary as it is, it is not harmful.    As for the UTIs.  As Dr. Lowe mentioned above, these are very common in young women and measures can be taken to help, including wearing cotton underwear, pants that are not too tight-fitting, keeping the area clean, wiping front to back, drinking lots of fluids and emptying your bladder frequently, especially after sex.  It takes a lot of cranberry juice to change the pH but some people even get cranberry pills for this purpose.  As he said, it can't hurt and some people have found it to be helpful.  You may want to discuss with your doctor the possibility that you may need a low maintenance dose antibiotic to keep this under control.  Some women benefit from this treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Ignore,  Your mother may wish to discuss the benefits of beginning a prophylaxis regimen to help prevent urine infections if she is having a lot of them.  This basically is taking a low dose antibiotic every day to help prevent the infection from starting.  This strategy can be very effective in the right situations.  There is a small risk of developing a resistant bacterial infection; however, with the antibiotic present in the urine it will serve to keep bacteria from establishing a presence and subsequently being able to become resistant.    You are correct that repeated antibiotics can lead to resistance.  Resistance develops the most quickly when antibiotics are used inappropriately, such as not finishing a prescribed course.  This gives the bacteria a chance to recover after they have been exposed to the antibiotic but not yet killed by it.  The idea behind prophylactic antibiotics is to keep the bacteria from getting into the urine and having a chance to become resistant.  While this works well, there are occasional breakthrough infections in some people and this may subsequently be a reason to change or stop prophylaxis.  A urologist or her nephrologist would be the best doctors to talk with about this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have also noticed that my urine is dark in colour and cloudy, after about a week of these symptoms I have started getting stomach cramps although they are more to the left and low down.

    "content": "Greetings Laur36,  From the symptoms you are describing it sounds like you may have a urinary tract infection.  If not treated you can get very sick.  The infection can turn into Pyelonephritis which means the infection has spread to your kidneys.  The pain you feel at the end of urination is likely a bladder spasm and the feeling like you have not emptied your bladder completely aka: keep having to go frequently and feeling like your bladder is heavy and full is another classic sign of urinary tract infection.  This infection has many causes and sex is one of them.  In short, urinary tract infection is caused by a bacteria.  Wiping the \"wrong way\", (back to front instead of front to back) can be another culprit.  It is important to get up and pee shortly after having sex which can sometimes help.    THIS PART IS IMPORTANT!!!  Go to your doctor.  If you don't have one go to your nearest Urgent Care Clinic.  If you get a fever or your symptoms worsen go to the Emergency Room!!!!  This is something not to be messed with Laur36.   Shelly\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Brown discharge can be due to many causes but are commonly seen in cases of infections and erosions in the cervix.  Being diagnosed with UTI makes vaginal infection the most likely cause for this brown vaginal discharge but exclusion of other causes is essential. Infection usually occurs as the organisms ascend into the vagina and is usally in the form of vulvovaginitis, so patients complain of itching in the vulva and dischrge.  Local measure and proper hygien is essential to avoid and to improve the condition.  Some females have this discharge during ovulation. This is physiological and of no concern.  Other causes like irregular vaginal bleeding due to hormonal imbalance or local problems like cervical erosion should be excluded.  I would advise you to be examined by a gynaecologist. Treatment depends on the cause and the causative organism in case of infection (bacterial, fungal, or less likely viral)  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Since women have a urethra that is shorter and closer to the anus than in males, they are more prone to urinary tract infection.   Sexual activity, stress and some medications are risk factors for developing UTI. Women who have repeated urinary tract infection should be investigated properly by urine analysis, complete blood picture, and blood sugar to exclude diabetes mellitus.   Urine analysis and culture are done to find out the causative organism and to give specific antibiotic.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to regularly administer the prescribed medicine.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a UTI that I just started feeling symptoms on this morning.  I don't have health insurance right now, and really cannot afford to go to the clinic.  I have a prescription for amoxicillin that my dentist gave me.  (I told her I had had an abnormal EKG, so she gave me them as a precaution.  However I've been to the doctor since then and my heart is fine.)  I've been doing some reading and I know that amoxicillin can be used to treat a UTI, though it's not preferable.  I'm wondering if it would be less effective for me since I've taken it in a 2 gram dose maybe twice over the past year before my dentist appointments.  I read a study that said a 3gram dose cured about 80% of participants with UTI.    Can I use this amoxicillin to get rid of my UTI?  I'd hate to take it and have it not work, and end up having to go to the clinic anyway.  If so, should I take one big dose of it or spread it out over a few days?  I have 500mg pills.  I'd be so grateful for any help.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Overuse of antibiotics can make you resistant to them but having taken this only a few times would not likely cause a problem of this nature.  The trouble with self-treatment is that you don't know if you have the right antibiotic for the specific organism that is present.  This is why they do culture and sensitivity testing along with urinalysis.  But often it is treated without the complete workup since there are some common UTI causing bacteria and the doctors can usually treat it with one of the medications that commonly work. As you said, amoxicillin isn't one of these that would be chosen first.  For this reason you could take it only to find it did not do the trick so there is a risk involved.    If you decide to take it the dosage of 500 mg. three times a day would be appropriate according to the labeling for this drug but you should complete a course to be sure you have killed the bacteria; not merely weakened it.  Typically that means about 10 days.  Do you have that many pills?  If not, you definitely would be best to see a doctor for this.    And it's usually a good idea for a follow up test to be sure the bacteria is gone a week or so after you complete treatment.  Meanwhile be sure to drink lots of water to help flush this out of your system.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Given all the information you've provided is correct then what I strongly suspect is that this isn't repeated infections, but one that's never quite resolved, and which is stirred up by the friction of penetration and meanwhile lies dormant. There's no apparent reason why your partner should otherwise continue to \"catch\" one UTI after another, either from you nor from thin air. The remaining most likely explanation is that this is one which never quite resolves, and which sex provides just enough prodding of the condition that it becomes symptomatic again. I would strongly suggest she see a urologist and be worked up for this, as she may be suffering from some sort of exotic situation where something has walled itself off in the urinary tract and is being \"knocked loose\" during intercourse. If so, you may also have picked it up without any symptoms and may eventually even be returning it, so that it might never go away without specifically targeted treatment.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you, and please follow up with us here, especially if there is any other pertinent information you may have.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amyfoot,  Some women experience these symptoms just as you're describing.  There are a few things you can consider.  First, have your infections been verified as bacterial infections?  Occasionally, the urethra can become irritated from intercourse and cause symptoms mimicking a urinary tract infection without actually having a bacterial cause (symptoms including pain and burning).  Women who do get bacterial infections following intercourse and have not found relief with the treatments you have tried can sometimes find relief by taking a dose of an antibiotic following intercourse or taking a daily low dose antibiotic as a preventative treatment to keep bacteria from growing.  If you are having bacterial UTI's you may want to talk with your doctor about trying something like this.  I am not aware of whether or not planned parenthood can provide these services.  Your gynecologist (or primary care doctor) can help you determine if this type of treatment will help you.  Often, if you need, there are clinics that can see patients on a free or reduced fee basis.  Your local health department can help with this.    Also, if there is any possibility of an STD I would recommend you be tested for these.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I had a kidney infection 5 weeks ago which was treated with ciprofloxacin at first and Levofloxacin second. I had to stop the medication due to sever joint pain throughout my body after 7 days of taking it.  Starting last week I felt pain in my lower back and the left side of my belly, afraid of another kidney infection I went in to the Student Health center and got a Urine culture which results came positive for Klebsiella. The doctor left me a prescription on the front desk for Bactrim DS, twice a day for 14 days. That all it said.  At the pharmacy they gave me 56 pills and told me to take 2 pills 2 times a day making a total of 4. This concerns me because I've read that Bactrim DS should be taken one pill twice a day while Bactrim tablets should be taken four pills a day. I think it was a mistake so I'm only taking 2 pills a day since the pain is intense. There has been no burning sensation, only today did I see some drops of blood in urine (I've taken 4 pills so far) the pain in my side is constant too. I called the doctor and doublechecked on the prescription and she said \"yes, 56 pills for 14 days is correct\" however, in an email she send me she stated the treatment was ten days long. I'm confused, I don't know what to believe and also I feel itchy and my hands hurt. I'm a violinist and my hands are the most important body part I have, my playing has already suffered from taking levaquin, why did I get a second infection? what is this antibiotic going to do to me? is four pills a day too much?

So, the confusion of what you have heard may be related to the the strength of the tablet as opposed to the number of tablets.  I don't know if your hand pain is related to the medication but it should not have anything to do with the UTI.  If it continues you might want to see a rheumatologist.  As for why you got another UTI - who knows?  Women are quite susceptible to them due to the proximity of the urethra to the other genital organs and rectum where bacteria can be prolific.  Sometimes it is aggravated by sexual activity as well.  If you get them frequently your doctor may choose to give you a low maintenance dose to prevent them from happening.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It seems like I'm only UTI-free for a couple weeks after taking antibiotics and it comes back. I wipe front to back and all. Since I don't have insurance, every time I felt a UTI getting worse, I'd take a Cephalexin pill. It seemed like it kept the UTI at bay for a while. Then I ran out of Cephalexin. Last Friday the UTI spread into my kidneys. I had a high fever, lower back pain, chills, the whole nine. I couldn't find a CHEAP place to get it taken care of, so I did what every young person does when they're sick - I called my mom. She actually had almost an entire bottle of Cephalexin from an infection she had last spring (the infection turned out to be a staph infection so the doctor switched her antibiotic). She gave me the bottle of Cephalexin and I took it Friday night. By Saturday morning, the fever was gone and I was feeling better. I have been taking Cephalexin about every 10 hours since Friday night. My urine no longer has the characteristic UTI look and smell. I have no fever. I have no chills. I still have lower back pain. Is this normal? I know I should've just gone to a doctor, but without insurance it's very difficult. Also, should I demand to be put on a low-dose antibiotic treatment all the time?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KelCee1987,  This is a little bit of a tricky answer.  Since you know what is coming, I'll say first that I must strongly advise against taking medications without being under the supervision of a physician and against taking medicines prescribed to others.  Ok, enough on that.  When you mention that you are often only UTI free for a couple of weeks, I am wondering if you are ever fully treating the infection.  There are a few possibilities.  It may be that you are, indeed, fully treating the infection and subsequently getting a new infection.  This is relatively common in sexually active women because of the short urethra and the mild trauma to the urethra from intercourse (hence the name honeymooner's urethritis).  However, in your case with the infections being so frequent, I wonder if you are partially treating the infection and it is subsequently reemerging after the antibiotics are stopped.  By taking only a pill when symptoms flare you are very likely undertreating the UTI and encouraging resistant bacteria to develop.  I would recommend you have a urine culture performed to determine the bacteria causing the infection and the antibiotic sensitivities of the bacteria.  At that point, I would recommend a solid ten day course of antibiotics to ensure that the infection is properly and fully treated.    If, after you have been sure the current infection has been fully treated, you continue to get frequent UTI's, some doctors will recommend starting a daily low dose antibiotic course to help prevent recurrent infections.  Also, if sexually transmitted infections are possible, I would recommend being tested for these since they can also present with UTI-like symptoms.  Regarding the insurance issue, there are often clinics in town that can treat patients on a free or reduced fee basis when there is no insurance.  Your local health department can help you locate these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "I am writing this for my brother.  He has been having recurrent problems, and none of the doctors he has been too have been able to help him.  It started with pain in his right inguinal area that caused difficulties walking.  He was originally diagnosed with a hernia, that later at another doctor it was discovered that he did not have one.  However, it was discovered that he did have an inflammed prostate and epididimis.  He was put on all sorts of antibiotics that did nothing for him.  The pain slowly subsided after a while for a few months.  Now however, the symptoms have come back and worse.  This time he gets a recurring fever, and the pain now radiates from his lower right abdomen to his knee and into his right testicle.  He said his right testicle has also been retracting quite a lot as well.  Any insight on what this might be, or where to start looking would be helpful.  Thank-you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First place your brother should look is in the office of a new doctor. If this doesn't seem important to the current one then he needs to find someone who takes pain and serious symptoms seriously.  Long-term irritation or inflammation in this area can cause lasting damage. Probably the epidiimitis has returned, possibly in conjunction with prostatitis (this based not only on  the pain pattern  but the fever). While  epididimitis is painful, prostatitis can make a person feel really horrible and fever is usually present. Both need attention as this has been  going on way too long. It probably was just never treated properly or long enough the first times.   I wish I could be of more help, but this should be a fairly simple  diagnosis for a medical doctor to make and your brother needs someone to  make it and lay out a plan of treatment. Good luck to you and your brother and please do follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

First, inserting objects into the urethra can cause trauma that can lead to swelling and scarring, which in turn can lead to occlusion of the urethra.  Icy Hot should not be used on mucous membranes including the urethra.  There is potential for a chemical burn or irritation that also could lead to inflammation and scarring.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have been sexually active (nearly daily) with my boyfriend (whom I'm living with) for the last eight months. In those eight months, I've had two UTIs, both painful and with a small amount of blood. Antibiotics seemed to clear them up, though I am wondering if I'm getting another now, despite doing all the good things one should do to prevent them.   I have only the symptom of cloudy urine, sometimes there is some light debris; there is no pain, no frequent urination, etc. If this is another UTI--so my third one--is it reasonable to ask my doctor to put me on a prophylactic antibiotic regimen? What are the risks/problems I might have if I do that?  Along the line of preventing UTIs, is it better to have acidic urine or alkaline urine? Some things I have read say one thing, and others say something entirely different. I know cranberry juice is very acidic, but it's a certain type of acid from what I understand. Considering I seem prone to UTIs, I would rather eat foods of a more acidic or alkaline nature to promote a healthy bladder.  Thanks in advance for any help or advice. I really don't want anymore problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you have frequent UTIs it is reasonable for your doctor to prescribe a maintenance low-dose antibiotic.  As for problems, no medication is without side effects and they usually prescribe those that are safest and with the least risk of causing bacteria resistance.  They are usually more specific to the bacteria most commonly associated with urinary tract infections.  However, only your doctor can know if you are a candidate for this type of preventive therapy.  Other measures can be taken as well to help reduce your risk.  1 - Empty your bladder before and immediately after sex to help wash away bacteria naturally. 2 -  An acidic environment is generally recommended to make the pH less hospitable to the bacteria.  Some people take cranberry pills.  Drinking cranberry juice is debatable since it would take quite a lot to actually change the urine pH, but it can't hurt.  Drinking lots of fluids generally also helps so at least increase your intake of water. 3 - Don't ever wipe from back to front - introducing fecal bacteria to the urethra. 4 - Never try to hold your urine - empty every time you feel the urge. 5 - Avoid feminine hygiene products - sprays, perfumes, douches.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am usually very careful and expel urine after sex; however, my husband and I are trying to conceive, so I have not expelled urine after sex.  I believe I have another bladder infection.  I went to the doctor last night.  My urine did not indicate high levels of of bacteria, but it did indicate some yeast.  The doctor gave me two presciptions: one for yeast infection (fluconazole 150 mg) and one for bladder infection (nitrofurantoin).  The doctor advised me to take the fluconazole first and wait 2-3 days to see if the infection cleared.  I am sensitive in understanding my symptoms as they relate to bladder infections, and this morning the symptoms are starting to increase.  I feel dull ache and the urge to urinate.  I know that this is a bladder infection.  Here is the concern.  I took the fluconazole last night (around 11:00 pm).  I desire to start the nitrofurantoin, but I am unsure about the reaction of the fluconazole if I do start.  I am not sure who to ask this question, because I saw an urgent care doctor.  Any advise?  Should I contact my regular doctor?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Karebear71,  It is safe to take fluconazole and nitrofurantoin together.  There is no significant interaction.  A single dose of fluconazole should be sufficient to treat a yeast infection.  Nitrofurantoin is a good medicine for simple urine infections but is often not sufficient for more significant infections, such as a kidney infection, so if your urinary symptoms worsen you should see your doctor again to see if you need a different antibiotic.

    "content": "I am a 30 year old female.(married) I was diagnosed with microscopic blood in Urine (with little pain on my upper left hip) about 18 months ago. I have a over active bladder. I also get frequent Urinary tract infection. My PCP sent me to the Urologist 2 years back when the first dose of antibiotic did not clear the red blood cell. Then the Urologist did a Cystoscopy in July 2006. It came out normal. After the Cystoscopy I gave the Urine and everything came out normal meaning there was no microscopic red blood cell in my Urine. But then after 2 months later it came back again. The Urologist put me on Nitrofur for 3 months this summer of 2007. But this time the red blood cell did not go away. The Urologist told me it is normal to have microscopic red blood cell in urine for 10% of people. I understand that part but ever since I am passing microscopic blood i am getting frequent UTI.  I used to take Prilosec OTC for my acid reflux. Recently I read on the internet that the \"Rare side effect\"of the medication is Blood  in Urine & Urinary Tract infection. After reading this i have stopped taking Prilosec for 1 month now.  I have made an appointment with my Gynocologist to do a ultra sound of my Ovary.  My life has changed completely last 2 years. I am so depressed because i can't live my normal life. Please help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It looks like you may have a urinary tract infection (UTI). Frequency is defined as more than 5 or 6 times during the day. Both frequency and hematuria can result from this condition. Classically it would present with difficulty during urination (dysuria) especially if the bladder is infected (cystitis) but there are always exceptions to this. Cystitis may also present with suprapubic pain and tenderness.   Both dysuria and frequency together with urgency and nocturia (waking up at night to pee) are known together as irritative symptoms and strongly suggest a UTI. The presence of fever could indicate an infection in the kidney (pyelonephritis). The presence of clumps in urine could be dead tissue (necrosis) as a result of the inflammation.  In any case I would strongly recommend that you visit your doctor as your condition needs to be properly assessed.  Please update this thread after you have visited your physician.  Good luck.\n\n",

You may need to have some kind of long-term antibiotics once they rule out any structural concerns.  I don't actually have answers as to what the bacterial counts are or interpreting them but Cipro is a good antibiotic which will, hopefully, clear up the present bacteria.    Good luck with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lolachola,  I agree with Debbie that seeing a urologist will be helpful.  UTI's following intercourse are relatively common.  There are also other things that can occur such as a urethritis from irritation rather than overt infection (termed honeymoon urethritis).  The urologist can also look to see if there are any structural abnormalities that may be predisposing you to UTI's.  Regarding the bacterial count, generally >100,000 colonies is considered positive from a clean catch sample.  80,000 is often considered positive if symptoms are present.    The tricky part of interpreting culture results when the specimen is from a clean catch (as opposed to a catheterization) is that the bacteria may be from the surrounding skin rather than the bladder.  So, if the cutlure grows many different bacteria (mixed flora) it is often considered contamination.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It seems that my UTI has not gone away completely even after finishing the 14 day course of Cipro. I'm really getting frustrated because I can't seem to rid myself of this infection. I'm wondering whether I should stop having sexual intercourse until I meet with the urologist on November 21? I'm not sure if by having intercourse I am continuing to introduce bacteria which my system just doesn't seem to be able to rid itself of. I also wondered if lower abdominal bloating is a sign of a UTI? Will this ever go away or will I be doomed to have these for the rest of my life? I've never had them recurrently like this before and I'm beginning to consider celibacy because it is such an uncomfortable feeling!  Any advice on what I should be doing before my appointment with the urologist would be much appreciated. I am taking cranberry pills, drinking lots of water, emptying my bladder after intercourse, emptying it regularly the rest of the time, taking acidophillus pills, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lolachola,  If your UTI's clearly are related to intercourse it may be advisable to abstain until you see the urologist.  Have all or most of your UTI's been confirmed by culture or only diagnosed by white blood cells in the urine?  If no culture has been done it may be that you actually have urethral irritation and not true UTI's as I mentioned before.  This is very common in cases such as yours.  Other things you can do to help prevent UTI's is drink plenty of fluid.  Urinating after intercourse may help flush bacteria out of the bladder/urethra to prevent infection.  The jury is still out on cranberry supplements.  They may or may not actually help.  Basically, they are safe so there really isn't a downside to trying it.  Basically, keep doing everything your already doing.  Seeing the urologist will be helpful.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your advice again Dr. Lowe. The majority of my UTIs have been confirmed by urine cultures and not just the white blood cell counts. A few of the UTIs I was having almost a year ago I didn't go for the urine cultures because I was ignorant of the fact that it is important to know the strain of bacteria in order to know which antibiotic is sensitive/resistant. Once I understood the importance I started going for the urine cultures everytime. One of the times they isolated Klebsiella Pneumonia and another time they found mixed bacteria/no dominant species. I just went to the walk-in clinic yesterday and they did another urine culture, the results of which I should be receiving in a few days.   I have definitely decided with my partner to abstain from intercourse since I have been sick more than healthy in the past few months.   I thank you very much for your advice. Hopefully once I meet with the urologist we can get this thing under control.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have one more question. I now have what I am almost 100% certain is strep throat. The reason I am confident is that I had a positive culture for strep throat back in the beginning of August around the same time I tested positive for a UTI. I have the exact same symptoms of strep that I had then -- feeling that I am swallowing golf balls, swollen lymph nodes, no nasal congestion or any other typical \"cold\" symptom. I will go to get a throat culture to confirm this but I am wondering is there is an association between my UTIs and strep infections? I understand that my immune system could be weak and this is why I seem to be susceptible to infections rather than fighting them off. I'm not sure if the doctor's need to investigate this connection or not.   Also, if I am feeling like my immune system is weakened, is there anything you can recommend to boost it?   Thanks very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi everyone.  I'm a 22 year old female. For the past three days now, I've been having severe pains in my kidney area. The right side is worse, but my left kidney has a weaker, dull pain as well. I've been sleeping constantly. I wake up in the mornings and after eating a little breakfast, I'm so tired I have to go back to sleep. I can't even hold my head up for over 2 hours at a time.  I wake up through the night in so much pain and feel very nauseated. So far, no vomiting -- but I feel like I'm on the verge of vomiting. I haven't been able to eat much either because of this.  I'm urinating somewhat normally. The same frequency and flow, but a slight burning when I go.  I was also diagnosed with Iron Deficient Anemia a few years ago.  Now, I recently (about 2 weeks ago) added Zinc supplement to my daily intake.. and I was also warned of the possible side effects that Zinc would have if taken more than the recommended dose. However, I was told that 15mg - 50mg per day would be fine. I've been taking 50mg per day with food.  Does anyone have any clue what this may be? Does it sound like a typical kidney infection, or something more serious? Being anemic, I'm aware that Zinc overdose can make anemia worse.. but I don't think I've overdosed with only 50mgs?  Also, one last thing... I'm not sure if this is tied in or not, but I've notice my circulation is poor lately. My legs, arms and face become pale if I hold a position for over 5-10 minutes (even just sitting down normally).  Could someone please help me understand what's happening with me? If you need more information, I'll gladly give it!  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "If you haven't done this already, I would recommend a full physical exam.  The anemia could be the cause of your extreme fatigue.  I doubt the zinc is contributing to the problem.  Whenever you have chronic pain you should try to find the problem and when you add circulatory concerns, there are definitely reasons to get an exam.  Sometimes when one has a known condition, they tend to assume all other symptoms are related.  In fact, there could be multiples problems at once, all of which should be addressed.  So, please schedule an appointment.  Good luck.\n\n",

After coming home and searching around I learned about UTI, and I'm just wondering if that test would detect UTI because the doctor never mentioned it - she only mentioned the possibility of diabetes so I don't know if that test is just for diabetes or also for other urinary conditions.  If it's not UTI then could it be something else?  I'm 25, male, no medical conditions.  thx!\n\n",

I've had a CAT scan done recently and also blood work and a cystoscopy done and everything came out fine.  The cysto showed influmation of the bladder in the cat scan and in the cysto that is all it showed.  I cath as well.  I'm now going to another urologist and he wants to redo the test himself and biopsy.  I'm eating well and I think what makes me sick is worrying about the test being redone and having to have a biopsy.  With all the tests and blood work that has been done should I worry about a biopsy?  Wednesday I will have a neorogenic bladder ultrasound.  I have taken cipro and bactrum and at first those always worked till july they have not.  I have had a jenamysan shot and that did nothign as well until i went into ER the day after i had the first cysto done.  I went in due to having real bad back and chest preasure as if someone was standing on me.  They did a chest xray and blood work and  and EKG and it all came out fine.  They gave me a IV and let a strong drug run that lasted 24 hours.  I saw my MD and he gave me a shot of jenamysan two days in a row and that is when i went back on cipro this time it looked like it had worked.  Few days ago recently is when I had blood and why i am now seeing this urologist which is a second urologist.  The first one who I had seen was not who i was going to see but due to it being so bad I had ot get in with someone quick and I feel like this one took forever to do anything.  this one I'm seeing now is the one who I was orginally going to see but at the time this all started he was booked.\n\n",

I would suggest you see your doctor again to be tested for another UTI.  The itching sounds like it may actually be a fungal/yeast infection of the skin.  You may want to try an anti-fungal cream for this to see if it helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 20 yr old female who has had 2 bladder infections in the past year. My mother also had urinary problems at this age, but nothing that couldn't be treated easily or just went away on its own.  My problem now is, I've had moderate flank pain on my left side below my ribs for exactly one week. This pain moved to my abdomen a few days later, and has become menstrual-like cramps in my groin area. I am not on a period and am not due to start another for almost 2 weeks. This pain is most severe at night and when I wake up in the morning. It hasn't prevented me from doing daily activities, but it's not easy to go about my day, either. My urine is basically normal. I went to the doctor and told him about my symptoms. I had a urine dip-stick test done and it was perfectly normal. The only urinary symptoms I have is increased frequency and I can feel the pelvic/groin pain more as I'm urinating. The doctor said it's probably muscle cramps. Muscle cramps!!! My kidneys hurt!!  I've been told that I may have kidney stones, but I wouldn't say the pain is that severe, although it is worsening.  I'm thinking of going to a gynecologist to rule out any ovarian problems, but if I did have such issues, why would the pain be in my kidneys!!  Thanks for any help![/i]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Screaming_daisies87,  There are a few possibilities for your pain.  Even with a \"normal\" urine dip an infection may still be present.  This is uncommon in an adult but can happen.  It may be worth sending a urine culture just to be sure.   Your pain, and the way it is traveling makes me think that it may actually be a kidney stone.  Often, red blood cells are seen in the urine on dipstick but this is not a requirement.  A CT scan can help make this diagnosis.  Seeing your gynecologist is also reasonable.  Sometimes ovarian cysts can cause a similar pain.  I think this is a little less likely but still worth evaluating for.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm still in pain, and it's gotten a bit worse but there are longer gaps between the pain. I also thought a kidney stone was the most likely culprit, as I had more symptoms matching that condition than any other, except the blood in urine, of course, which is a pretty vital symptom. I guess it is possible though. In the meantime, I've been drinking at least 32 oz of water a day and taking a cranberry supplement and cranberry juice. I have a gynecologist appt. for the 31st of this month; maybe they'll catch the stone(s) on an ultrasound, or I could ask them to do a urine culture for me. In any case, I\"ll be sure to explain my symptoms. Thanks again!\n\n",

I have no pain in urinating but just a sharp pain every once in awhile in that area. I've also noticed that on the shaft and what I believe is the ejaculatory duct it is a bit swollen that leads to a point lower on my shaft that is bright red and you can see the outline of a vein there.

His regular doctor said there was blood in his urine sample and would grow a culture. She perscribed Bactrim. The next day, Fever was 102-103, continued low Back pain, burning with urination, chills, shivering, vommiting. Also color of urine was orange. Regular doctor sent us to ER. The ER did a CT scan that ruled out kidney stones. Said that young healthy males his age do not usually get urinary tract infections, but that must be what he had according to his urine sample, although blood count was normal. ER told us to stop Bactrim and put him on Keflex instead. Also gave him Nausea medicine and also phenazophyridin to help him urinate easier.  Yesterday he was even worse, so we saw a urologist. The urologist could not get a copy of his culture report, but said to continue on as we were doing and push fluids and he would improve soon. However, when I called the regular doctor back to find out about culture that was done 3 days ago, they said the culture was negative. How can the culture and bloodwork be normal? He still has high Fever, chills, low Back pain, blood in urine and burning when he urinates.\n\n",

There are examples (mostly female) where there was no evidence of the bacteria in the urine but who responded to antibiotic treatment anyway.  Perhaps in those cases, the problem would have resolved on its own without medication but with symptoms it is typical to treat for UTI anyway to prevent more serious complications if bacteria are present.  Lab work is not always perfect so perhaps therein lies the problem.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 34yr old female and by assumption, my Dr diagnosed me with a UTI.  For a month, I consistently had to pee and it was mostly clear liquid. I finally went to the Dr about this because I felt horrible. He ran a CMP and my liver and kidneys check out fine and I had a urinalysis done.  The problem with the urinalysis is that the lab didn't ask me (or give me the items needed) to do a clean-catch. I was given instructions to pee in a cup and put it in the test tube (great lab, huh?) Because of this, the test came back inconclusive. Bacteria was found, but since it wasn't a clean-catch, nothing could be determined.  My Dr put me on Cipro, 500mg twice a day for 10 days.  The day after the first dose I had horrible pain around my bladder and it felt swollen. The peeing is worse and now hurts!! I contacted the Dr and I was told to go to a Urologist.  Before jumping the gun, is it possible that the Cipro is finally cleaning out whatever it is and is just trying to work the infection out of my body?  I thought maybe that could be the reason for the pain and that maybe it would pass after further treatment.  Thoughts?\n\n",

You didn't mention how long you have been on the antibiotics.  Of course it is ideal to get a culture to be sure the drug used will be effective but most UTIs are caused by a few typical strains so the usual drugs can do the trick even in the absence of the culture and sensitivity testing.  Cipro is a good choice for treatment and likely will take care of it.  The suggestion to see a urologist may be to see if there is anything else going on to cause the increase of pain and swelling.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a female, 46, with alot of lower abdominal/back pain. I have had several bladder infections recently, and have taken Keflex and Cipro for them. They keep coming back and I am really tired of the pain. Any advice? Also, could it be something other than a UTI/bladder infection? The pain is really the only symptom that I have. No fever, no burning sensation when I urinate (only pain, and it is the same when I have a bowel movement, with the pain mostly in the lower left abdomen.), no itching, some odor with a small amount of discharge. Hope someone can advise. Oh, I also have stress incontinence...when I laugh too hard or sneeze. Also when I cough or have to do some heavy lifting. I do not take any meds other that Nexium for acid reflux, and Toprol for high blood pressure. Thanks for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Perhaps you could benefit from a more thorough consultation with you gynecologist.  Explain all your symptoms in detail.  There may be something going on aside from the UTIs and you may be able to get some help with the \"bothersome\" problems as well as the painful ones.  Of course there are other organs in the abdomen as well, so a complete workup would be good.  A colonoscopy may also be in order if you haven't already done that.  More urological studies may also be helpful.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. For the past few months, I've been having pains in my abdomin. They have been painful but not so much that I couldn't go on with normal activities. The past week though, the pain has become so severe that I can only walk a few feet without feeling as if I'm about to pass out and I can barely move.  I'm 22, female and the most 'tummy troubles' that I've had are bad cramps at period time and an appendectomy when I was 19. I'm not on any medications other than cranberry herbal pills to help prevent a UTI and as far as I know, there isn't any family history of what is happening to me other than my mother having C-Diff over a year ago after an operation gone bad.  The one thing that I have found is that my body can't handle anything that is made with or cooked in grease or I have diarrea for a few days.  I'm not sure if what I have is a UTI. It's not anymore painful when I urinate than it is when I'm just sitting down.  I am going on a 4 day vacation this weekend and hopefully will see a doctor when I get back but is there something I could do while on vacation to relieve the pain so I can have a good time?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kissb4me3:  This is a potentially serious condition.  Is there any chance that you are pregnant?  If so, your condition is emergent, and you must attend to it immediately to avoid very serious complications.  What I'm getting at is ectopic pregnancy, which has a similar presentation.  Your symptoms could be a chronic kidney stone, but the location of your pain is not quite specific to that.  Whatever the cause of your pain is, I do believe that it is serious enough to warrant an evaluation before you go on vacation.  Perhaps there is an urgent care clinic nearby?  Please let us know what happens.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Regardless which started first, I advise you to investigate the two possible problems.   The first one is the urinary symptoms that suggest UTI. A simple urine analysis and urine culture will give us clue about whether there is infection or not. In some cases with urinary discharge the skin of the penis gets inflamed and dermatitis results.  Second you should consult a dermatologist about these skin lesions that are recurrent for two years. It might be a form of chronic skin disease that needs special investigations and treatment. Skin inflammation in this part may predispose to infection and urethritis which gives similar clinical picture to UTI and in severe untreated cases results in ascending UTI. This is a more possible scenario according to your description.  Some males who do masturbation especially without using enough lubricants have simialr problem with dermatitis and urethritis.  In any case proper treatment for both conditions is essential for complete recovery.  I hope you find this answer useful. Please let me know if you have further questions.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doc,   I'm an 20 year old female, history of diabeties, heart disease & cancer in the family, recently recovered from Phnemonia.   A few weeks ago I started needing to urinate VERY frequently yet there was never much there, there was no burning sensation but was diagnosed with Cystitis and put on a 5-day-course of antibiotics.   I thought I was better by the end of the course (I completed it however) but a few days later I noticed the problem coming back when I was nervous / excited / stressed etc... wondering if there's something similar that can be brought on by anxiety?   I am currently finishing my second lot of the antibiotics (had a second script made up) but the problem is still there, needing to urinate frequently yet having nothing to really get rid off, and even when I get off the toilet I feel like I need to go again. It tends to \"strike\" when I'm nervous, esp. when I'm driving etc. not near a toilet... is this anxiety or something? I'm finding it very hard to cope... Is there anything you can suggest?\n\n",

It doesn't really sound like you have a bladder infection, though.  You may have a condition known as hyperactive bladder (also known as overactive bladder).  Other possible conditions that could cause increased frequency would be issues like constipation or gynecological issues such as an ovarian cyst compressing the bladder.

You may also have some inflammation of your urethra.  Urethritis can be caused by an infection as well as irritation that can be caused by friction of intercourse (known as honeymoon cystitis).  I would suggest that you see a doctor to be tested for a urine infection as well as STD's that can also cause similar pain.  A physical examination will help reveal any signs of skin irritation or possibly a yeast infection of the skin near the urethra.  Of course, if your urine is consistent with a UTI a physical exam probably isn't necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi   Thanks for replying. I had  got my blood work and urine analysis  Urine analysis were  PH ; 7.0 Glucose:Negative Billirubin : Negative Ketones: Negative Occult Blood: Negative Protien: Negative Nitrate: Negative Leukocye esterase: Negative WBC : None Seen RBC: None Seen Squamous EPITHELIAL CELLS : None seen Bacteria : None seen Hyline cast: None seen  any idea what could be possible cause ? Why dry mouth  feeling when I have just gulped in 20 oz of water ?  Do protien always show in urine ? or is that we have to do the test 2-3 times to see if there are traces of it in urine?  I have taken the appointment with Urologist next week , but i want to do some research so that I have some peace before I visit the doc  thanks once again\n\n",

    "content": "Generally, if the protein is the cause of the foamy urine it would show up on the urinalysis.  However, if the urine is very dilute it may be diluted out too much to show up.  (This goes for all the urine components.)  One assesses urine concentration by looking at the specific gravity.  1.000 is essentially pure water.   The higher the number (usually up to 1.030) the more concentrated the urine, and generally the more dehydrated a person is.  Seeing the urologist is a good idea.  Hopefully you'll be able to get some answers.  Based on this urinalysis, though, it does not look as if your kidneys are the issue.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Is it possible that Protien can come out of Urine occasionally? Because I find the Foam  sometime while urinating , not all the time.   You felt it might be something other than kidney issue , any idea what other things can cause urine to foam?  thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am having a problem and i am at the point that I am very depressed. It all first started about 4 months ago, I had a hard time urinating and had lower back pains. Went to the doctor and he told me i need to go to the hospital. They were very sharp pain and i felt nausea's. I was then admitted to the hospital in where they did a cat scan(i believeor mri) , blood test, culture, and a urine test. The culture test showed that i had chlamydia all other tests shoud up negative. The doctor then gave me a manual rectel test with his fingures and told me i had a enlarged prostate. He gave me some kind of antibiotic through the iv and i was perscribed doxycycline. I was later releasted that day and rested. The next day the doctor told me to stop the doxycycline and start taking ofloxacin. I later started my dosage of ofloxacin for 3 weeks and went to see a urologist. My symtoms seemed to of gotten worse. My symtoms ans sex drive was not getting better at all i think they got worse. I was later told to take the antibiotics for another 3 weeks, I then went back and the symtoms vagily went away(lower back pains, no sex drive, Pelvis pain, dificulty to start urinating, burning sensation, and testicular pains). He then perscribed me levaquin and it seems like now my urine stream is alot better. A week after the last treatment i went back because my lower back pains and testicle pains. He told me that he need perform not a ultra sound to see whats wrong because he siad it is imposible that the prostate is still bad with all the antibiotics i am taking. My questions is what should i do? Should i see a diff doctor after the ultra sound? is my sex drive ever going to come back? I really need some kind of help here. Being 24 with no sex drive and being depressed the way i am is  really driving me crazy. please give me some kind of answers because it seems that no knows what if wrong with me and i can not live depressed in pain and no sex drive. feels like  i am worthless which i never felt this was before. thank in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "There are many causes of prostate enlargement.  Infection is one of these and chlamydia can certainly cause the symptoms you describe.  The Ofloxacin should have taken care of the chlamydia well.  If you continue to have dysuria (pain with urination), difficulty urinating, etc. I would recommend that you essentially be retested.  I would test for a urinary tract infection, STD's, etc. especially if there is a possibility of reinfection with an STD.  Also, if your difficulty urinating doesn't improve you may want to have your prostate reexamined to be sure that the swelling has gone down and that it is not enlarged due to a different cause.  If you continue to have back pain it is important to be sure the MRI or CT of your back did not show spinal cord compression.  I would recommend that you start by following up with your primary doctor.  If needed, specialists can be seen at that point.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities.  One is that you may actually have a urinary tract infection from a virus.  Typically we think of UTI's as being caused by a bacteria; however, there are many viruses that can cause such infections.  These will typically resolve on their own in a few days.  If the burning is a problem, a medication such as phenazopyridine can help.  It is also possible that you have some local skin irritation of the area near the opening of the urethra that the urine is irritating causing some pain.  These areas may or may not need medication to treat them.  Generally, direct physical examination will reveal the irritated skin.  If the culture was negative it is unlikely that you have a bacterial infection.  If you are not getting better in the next few days I would suggest following up with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 yr old female. I have a 3 yr old daughter and am in a stable long term relationship. I have Situs Inversus, born with a cleft palate and have had no past experiences with a UTI. I have taken a lot of baths recently since we moved into this new house on the 1st of March, 2007.   My problem is that for the past 3-4 days I have noticed that the right side of my abdomen (not my appendix...my appendix isn't on that side bc I have Situs Inversus Totalis) I believe its my right ovary, I have had a cyst before, but anyways, its very sore and painful to the touch. I noticed a little bloating but shrugged it off bc I thought it may have been a cyst and they usually go away on their own. Last night after I got home from work I had a sharp pain in the vaginal area that made me double over in tears. I went to the bathroom and it didn't burn or anything. My back was hurting, my vaginal area felt like someone stabbed me in it, and my lower abdomen up to my belly button felt the same way. It hurt to touch or to stand upright. It lasted approx. an hr and I drank half a glass of water and finally had to use the bathroom again and it went away. This morning I am still crampy but no where near the pain of last night. Could this be a UTI or something else? Thank you so much ahead of time.  ~Beckie~\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Beckie, What you are describing could be PID (Pelvic Inflammatory disease). You are potentially at risk due to your age and you mentioned taking frequent baths as well. The cervix of young women is not fully matured, which increases risk for STI's linked to PID.  It would be wise for you to seek immediate attention from your PMD,  or in the absence of one, to go to the local health clinic.  With the severiity of the pain that you are experiencing, you may wish to consider presenting to your local hospital Emergency Room for evaluation. If it is PID you run the risk of long tem complications, such as infertility.  In any event, pain and tenderness such as you describe, whether a UTI or PID, needs professional intervention, and the proper course of treatment/antibiotics.  Only your doctor can make that determination based on a physical assessment and lab tests.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jimmycox: You need to be seen by a Urologist for the chronic UTI's. Sometimes when a person has used certain antibiotics over a period of time they do not work as well for them as their body becomes resistant to them.  Another possibility is  that your bladder is not completely emptying even with a catheter in, and the stagnant urine is contributing to the infections.  Not drinking enough fluids also increases the risk of infection as you need fluids to wash the bacteria out of the bladder and urethra.  With bladder problems, the key word is Dilute.  The more fluids you drink the less concentrated your urine is and the more dilute the bacteria in the bladder becomes.  By flushing out the bladder you keep the levels of bacteria down.  Not using sterile technique when changing catheters or when emptying them increases the risk of infection as well.  Many persons who have trouble with UTI's drink cranberry juice to help acidify the urine and make it less prone to growing bacteria and developing infection.  I am not sure what you meant about why you cannot use a condom catheter as they come in many different sizes, even for pediatric patients.  You may need a referral from your urologist to a specialty shop that can order the correct size for you.  There are also types that are like a bag attached to  an adhesive cup that goes over the penis.  There are several options you can use but you need to consult with your doctor about what is best for you.  I wish you well. Carolyn LPN\n\n",

This could be due to infection in the genitourinary tract like cystitis , prostatitis and or epidyimitis. It may occur also in cases of prostate enlargement which causes urine outflow disturbance which in turn  results in cystitis.  Urine analysis and urine culture are essential for the diagnosis.  Direct clinical examination is essential  for proper management.  Your doctor may advise Transrectal US or Pelvic US.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Recently I had a very mysterious, disturbing illness which was determined to be a mystery virus (no cough or congestion but I had severe body aches and headaches, sore throat,  intermittent fever, swollen lymph nodes, extreme fatigue, weight gain, chest pain --which was determined to be costrochondritis) after many, many tests because nothing else was found.  All of these tests came back low-normal and included multiple bloodwork tests, xrays, ekg and echo-cardigram with stress test.  (The virus symptoms hung around while subsiding for several months and are almost gone now except some chest wall tenderness..)  Anyhow, the only test that showed something was the urine test. It showed I had a killer UTI but was having no symptoms. The UTI resolved itself after 2 rounds of antibotics but should I be concerned that I had no symptoms at all of a UTI? (no urgency, pain, burning - nothing) Also could the UTI have been caused by or not shown symptoms because of my virus? One more question, is it possible that a back injury where I fractured two lower vertebrae several years ago would have damaged nerves I did just didnt know about it?  (it took months for me to walk right again and I never fully returned to competetive sports but am fully functional, just a little more fragile now)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The symptoms you have described can be  shared by different types of viruses like EBV, CMV, rarely adenovirus.  I do not know what kind of tests have been done to find out the specific case.  It is rare for urinary tract infection to be causes by a virus but it occurs. Your doctor have treated you with antibiotics which means you have been diagnosed by either the urine analysis and or culture to have bacterial form of infection.  Asymptomatic bladder bacterial infection is known as asymptomatic pyuria and may occur in diabetic patients, children, and neurological diseases including spinal cord injury.  If you mean the lower sacral vertebral were injured. The clinical picture would include  perineal sensory loss  due to to the S2\u2013S4 roots damage as well as loss of voluntary control of both anal and urethral sphincter, and sexual responsiveness.   Thus a neurological cause is very remote. Some patients with urinary tract infection has symptoms only for the 24 hours and are mild due to either urine dilution or frequent voiding.  Hope this information is useful.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 28 years old and had the same sexual partner for 10 years.  This past year I have a new boyfriend/sexual partner.  Due to military I see him 2-3x a month.  Everytime we have sex I get a UTI.  I have never had these problems with my past sexual partners, just him.  Is this a case of \"honeymoon\" UTI or could there be a problem with him?  I take all necessary measures to protect myself from UTIs such as, urination before and after sex, wash before and after sex, 3000mg of cranberry extract, and  1 1/2 to 2 gallons of water intake a day.  Could he have an STD that is giving me UTIs?  Or perhaps excreting a bacteria causing my UTIs?  This is getting to the point that I don't even want to have sex and haven't for almost 2 months.  He did inform me that he doesn't always wash after sex just wipes off.  Could this cause a build up of bacteria on his part that is transmitted to me?  Also, he said he uses a powered on his genital area to keep dry (he lives in a very hot climate), could I be having an irritation or allergic reaction?  Any information or preventative help is greatly appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better.  Neurogenic bladder is a bladder dysfunction that is due to a neurologic cause which results in the inability to regulate voiding.   There are two main types of neurogenic bladder.   Flaccid neurogenic bladder is the result of a lower motor neurone lesion and results in a bladder with a large volume and low pressure, where bladder contractions are absent. Lower motor neurone lesions that can cause this condition are peripheral nerve lesions or spinal cord damage at the S2 to S4 level. The primary symptom is overflow incontinence.  Spastic neurogenic bladder results from an upper motor neurone lesion such as brain damage or spinal cord damage above T12. The volume of the bladder is either normal or decreased and bladder contractions are frequent. The main symptoms include urgency, frequency and nocturia.  Mixed patterns exist and can result from conditions such as syphilis and diabetes mellitus or demylenating conditions such as multiple sclerosis.  Recurrent urinary tract infections are a common complication of this condition and a cause for significant morbidity. If left untreated it may result in nephropathy and ultimately renal failure.  Cipro is a great drug for UTIs, should the frequency of your UTIs become excessive your urologist may consider other options in the treatment of your condition.   These vary according to the type and severity of the condition and range from various catheterization procedures to drugs such as anticholinergics to surgery as a last resort.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, this could be easy to answer -, I mean let's just get it to basics and go from there.  Presuming that bladder gets waste out of kidneys and presuming only kidneys, who is the initiator of the actions?  In other words do kidneys keep \"sending\" the liquid to bladder no matter what, or does bladder keep asking for it?  Why I am asking this question;  Because at certain times of day, I feel as if too much water is being dumped to my bladder, so yes I have to pee quite often but eventually it will stop (interestingly when I eat something; so my doctor thinks that I have Interstitial Cystits).  I mean it's just not logical to me that bladder will get to the burst feel like levels within 1 hour, and I may not have drank that much liquid.  I can hold it but it hurts like hell.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Yes you are right the kidneys send the urine to the bladder. From the point of view of the kidneys the bladder is a passive container of urine. The bladder simply keeps filling up with urine until it reaches a certain capacity when receptors in the bladder start sending signals to initiate voiding.  However when the bladder is inflammed it becomes somewhat sensitive' and the receptors fire off signals at very low thresholds of urine.  Hope that answers your question.\n\n",

    "content": "I originally posted this in the pediatric section a few weeks ago with no reply, thought it might do better here.  my 14 yr old daughter has had 4 UTI`S in the last year, she has a history of kidney reflux (which after her last VCUG) I was told had resolved on its own. Needless to say, the reflux is supposedly gone and although she has not had any kidney infections like she did when she had the reflux, she is still getting the UTI`S quite frequently. My question is, can reflux go away and then come back, It was about 3-4 years ago when I was told it was gone and she has been getting more frequent uti`s as she gets older, her dr. says one more and we will need to investigate but if the reflux is gone then what can cause such frequent infections ? Any info as to what to look for would be really appreciated....\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tdeolim, Can you tell me if a culture and sensitivity was done as an evaluation on her urine test to identify the causative organism? If not, this needs to be evaluated. For example, E Coli bacteria (present on the skin near the rectum) is one of the bacteria responsible for a UTI. For instance, after using the bathroom wiping back to front verses front to back may cause an infection by this organism. Tub baths, in some females, seem to exacerbate these infections. Holding urine too long past the urge to urinate, causes overstretching of the bladder, prevents complete emptying because the muscle is weakened. Sexual activity is another factor. Again, if a cuture has not been done on her urine, I would certainly inquire about this diagnostic. A referral to a Urologist would be recommended to identify the causative factor, ie, congenital abnormality (abnormally short urethra) etc. is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female with a history of PCOS, secondary diabetes and hypothyroidism.  I am accustomed to getting large painful cysts on my ovaries, but two years ago I got a very large cyst (5 cm) on my right ovary and had such severe pain I had to go to the ER.  While there they did some urine tests and discovered I had a very bad infection, blood in the urine, high white bc, etc.  and diagnosed me with a UTI.  They said they weren't sure whether the pain was from the cyst or the UTI.  This year (this past 3 weeks) I had it happen again.  Once again with severe pain, I ended up at the ER.  They did the typical ultrasounds and urine tests.  They said there was evidence of a burst cyst (fluid in the ovary area) but they found another severe UTI and so began antibiotics.  Well, 3 weeks and 3 series of antibiotics later (Cipro, Bactrim) it is still causing me pain and problems.  The doc said the cysts and UTI's could be related (bacteria from cysts, etc.).  I'm desperate for help because I've tried everything (6,000mg cranberry tablets a day, tons of water, antibiotics, heavy narcotic painkillers...).  They said my kidneys are fine, but I don't know how long that will last with my current regimine...  Thank you for your reply, Amber\n\n",

He has had chlamydia and been treated for it about 2 months ago, but the water or urine infections are still there, and they are getting worse.  The symptoms he gets are: Discharge (Only recently) Unable to fully empty his bladder when peeing - the feeling he needs to go again straight afterwards Not a constant flow  His penis is getting a bit dry as well, but he is washing it and drying it a lot, and too many antibiotics may be causing thursh, is that correct?  I have got canesten for him and that seems to be helping the dryness.  The Dr keeps fobbing him off with antibiotics, he really needs a refferal to see a specialist, there is an 8 month waiting list.  Does this sound like a UTI? And are there any ways to relieve the symptoms whilst waiting?  It is really getting him down.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I've been experiencing these sharp pains on my right side for over a year now.  I have them for a week or so, then not, but they are becoming more regular.  I have them at night only, when lying on my side.  When I am up for the day, they go away completely, or lessen considerably.  My right side pelvic area, between my pelvic bone and belly button, is the highest concentration of pain.  It is not a constant pain, just a very sharp pain when I move.      As I said, this has been going on for 1-2 years now, but much more consistently the last month.     As for my history, I do have trouble urinating.  I was diagnosed with an enlarged prostate about 2 or 3 years ago, took Flomax for awhile, and couldn'tt afford the prescription any longer.  It didn't seem to be helping anyway.        About 6 months ago I saw another urologist, he said that the enlarged prostate was not really the problem making me urinate so often.  He said I had a blockage in my penis, so he did some sort of laser scope surgery inside my penis.  He said he found a blockage and removed it.  That also did me no good.  I still urinate very small amounts, frequently.  I get up about 3 times a night to urinate, usually small amounts.  When I can't get to a bathroom , I do urinate with normal pressure...so I don't think there ever was a blockage to start with.      My current medications are Keppra (2250 mg daily), 800 mg daily of Carbemazepine, both for seizures.  I am also taking Lamictal for depression/seizures, but am weening myself off from 225 mg daily a month ago, and now I am at 75 mg daily.  I don't drink at all but smoke excessively.      This pain has really worsened this past week.  I'm not sure where to go because there are only a couple urologists around here and I don't drive.      Any advice would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I guess I am frustrated. I have had 4 UTI's since last May 05 and the most recent one is right now. I was put on Antibiotics for them (Bactrim, Cipro, Levaquin). They go away and then come back. I was thinking that maybe I need my PCM to send me to a Urologist. All she keeps doing is testing the urine and giving me antibiotics. I think something else might be going on. My mom had bladder cancer 10 years ago and my sister has a history of kidney stones. I also have right flank pain and low back pain. Need help.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LouAnn  4 UTIs within 8 months seems to be too frequent from a medical point. you should ask your PCP to refer you to a urologist just to rule out any anatomical problems or the presence of kidney stones.  if everything turns out to be normal, and you continue to have them that frequent, you might be a candidate for a prophylactic antibiotic therapy, to prevent those infections.  meanwhile keep your body  hydrated, by increasing your fluid intake, and cranberry juice has been shown to be helpful. thank you very much\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply. Since I posted I have been back to my PCP and she did a blood test to rule out other things. Everything was normal, including the kidney function. I thought if you had stones it would show up on the blood test. I just finished ABX (Bactrim DS) and I have to take her another urine sample to see if the bacteria is still present. I still \"feel\" as if it's still there and I have that nagging pain on my right side (flank area), been there for a couple of weeks. I feel as if I need to see a urologist but she has to refer me to one and she keeps having me come back for more treatment. Seems to me that she is treating the SX and not the problem. I will take another sample in this week and we'll see what happens from there.\n\n",

    "title": "UTI or Bladder Infections from Intercourse",
    "content": "Hello I am writing because My fiancee and I are having problems: Since we have been together for the past year we have discovered that for some reason she gets a UTI after sex. She is 31, I am 33. We have conventional sex, nothing anal. She has had ecoli 3 times this year. Each time Macrobid cured her.       In the past she hasn't had this problem with other sex partners. I always use a condom with spermicidal. Others in her past have too?? I am one of the bigger ones but she has had bigger guys.       We are working with a urologist but still can't figure out what is the cause. Her doctor has suggested taking one dose antibiotic after intercourse to stop the UTIs. She doesn't want to be on antibiotics forever and we both want to have a lot of sex and can't.       She has fear that it might be bladder cancer but we don't know?? She had papilary thyroid Cancer at 19 (now gone) and is on levoxl due to having both thyroids removed.        All we want to know is WHAT IS THE TRUE CAUSE? and HOW CAN WE CURE HER PERMANENTLY?       Doctor please help us, give us more to go on... are we the only ones with this problem? Is it just the two of us not being compatible? We both love each other and do not want to loose that because of this problem.      Thank You,      Kingnomad33\n\n",

    "title": "Re: UTI or Bladder Infections from Intercourse",
    "content": "You are not alone. I am a female age 59 and have suffered from frequent UTI's in the past, especially during my 30's after intercourse. I married at age 22, was married for 10 years, had frequent sex with my husband, and never got a UTI. We divorced. I got 3 UTI's in the first year of my relationship with my 2nd husband.  My doctor put me on Macrodantin with instructions to take one dose after intercourse. This knocks out a UTI before it can get started. The only thing was that he told me not to take it more than 3 times a week. I took it for a number of years and it worked. I seldom got a UTI after that. In my experience, a UTI after intercourse is caused by bacteria, from the surface of the skin of either partner, being driven into the woman's ureter during intercourse. My suggestions: take a shower together before intercourse, ASAP after intercourse your fiancee should pee, ask your fiancee to drink 8 oz of cranberry juice EVERY day from now and forever (light version - less calories works fine), take the Macrodantin up to 3 times a week, be creative and do other intimate things the other 4 days of the week (besides intercourse). Also, my 1st husband's technique was different. He was always on top of me on his hands and knees during intercourse. My 2nd husband, who was smaller, not bigger, by the way, was on top of me and put all of his weight on me, (not on hands and knees) which made more of his skin rub and come in contact with me. I hope this information helps you. I'm not a doctor, but it's NOT cancer.\n\n",

At first It started itching, then I noticed that the inside of the foreskin looked dry and flaky. After, the foreskin started to get swollen. Now its hard for me to expose my penis from my foreskin due to it being swollen and I keep on feeling something coming out rather than urine. I have checked it out and its clear and sticky. Recently I started to drink alot of water and since then I have been using the restroom more than usual. Also, this really started when my girlfriend and I last had intercourse. We were on the road and I did not get a chance to wash after intercourse until the next day and a half. She has been my only partner since a year weve been together and I am sure I have been hers and we do not have any STD's. What could it be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Balanitis is inflammation of the glans penis commonly seen in uncircumscribed men. It usually causes redness and/or a blotchy rash on the glans, sometimes with a discharge. Balanitis involving the foreskin or prepuce is termed balanoposthitis. The most common complication of balanitis is phimosis, or inability to retract the foreskin from the glans penis.  Balanoposthitis may have any of multiple bacterial and fungal origins. Complex infections also have been well documented. These often are due to a poorly retractile foreskin and poor hygiene that leads to colonization and overgrowth.   Anaerobic organisms have been associated with the diagnosis, although in most cases, the patient is treated empirically and a specific organismal etiology is not obtained. Candidal infection appears to be the most common cause of disease. The condition in older adult men often has other etiologies, including intertrigo; irritant dermatitides; and candidal, viral, or fungal infections.   Treatment centers on antibiotics / antifungal treatment, improved hygiene and treatment of eczema if present.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, you are advised to seek a direct clinical examination to reach the proper diagnosis.\n\n",

I was having problems in my lower back for 3 months and it hurt so bad, I can hardly stand sometimes gettin up from the chair.  They found some blood in my urine last night.  I did have my menstral cycle last week.  Could you tell me if you think it could be high blood pressure or something else?  I don't want to take pills for the rest of my life if I don't have to.

    "content": "Hi CindyC, An inner ear infection certainly causes dizziness and with that it may also cause nausea. As for a blood pressure reading of 160/110, yes that is definitely high blood pressure. A persistently elevated blood pressure, requires medication etc. to control it because it affects your other organs. It may also cause dizziness and nausea as well as a headache. If your menstrual cycle was completed so there wasn't any confusion from the mixing of blood in your urine from that, it certainly requires an urine test. My major concern for you is the elevated blood pressure. If you have not yet made an appointment with your doctor, I urge you to do so. An elevated blood pressure has many significant consequences.   Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I have been having the urge to urinate more frequently but this has been awhile now(a year or more) but hasn't always been like this. The feeling is irregular and comes and goes daily or weekly. There is usually no pain or anything I felt was threatening so I never thought it was worth worrying about. I don't have any leakage as I've read others may do. The problem is after urinating maybe an hour or less later I'll feel the need to urinate again and feel the normal pressure feeling of having a full bladder but usually when I go a second time there isn't much urine as i would expect. However sometimes I can urinate and shortly after urinate just as much in a short amount of time. But of course this only happens sometimes and other days I can have a full healthy bladder. I've never found myself unable to control it or wetting myself or running to the bathroom though.   But recently I am expericning a soft numbing nagging pain towards the right side of my groin/upper thigh/pelvic area. It comes and goes and is hard to say where exactly it is coming from as it isn't a sharp pain. I've always had the urinary issue but this is the first time I've felt pain around that area. Are they related? Should I be worried?  Also I have come down with a mild case of coughing... I don't know if this is related to it as well...\n\n",

You have not stated if you are sexually active and if there is a history of sexually transmitted diseases, which would have been helpful in evaluating your case.  It is important to establish if you have urinary tract infection (UTI) and if so, whether it is complicated or uncomplicated.  In uncomplicated UTI, the urinary tract has no structural abnormality, the renal function is normal and you have no associated disease which impairs defence mechanisms.  In complicated UTI, the urinary tract is abnormal due to obstruction or kidney disorders, or there is an associated disease that predisposes to it, such as diabetes mellitus.  The basic screening test for urinary tract infection is a microscopy, culture, and sensitivity of a fresh, middle stream specimen of urine. Because your complaints are at least one year in duration, it is mandatory to undergo further investigations to establish if you have a complicated or an uncomplicated UTI. These tests will include urinary tract ultrasound (for imaging of the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder) and renal function tests, in addition to the basic test. You should consult a urologist who may also want to establish if there is any associated disease predisposing to your urinary symptoms.  Thank you for contacting this website.

    "content": "I have been having the same problem as Becky, but there's a little more to it.  A few weeks ago, I had noticed something really weird about my urine - it smelled really different and bizarre.  The urinary pain started right on my menstural cycle.  I had this huge stomachache as well, and I thought maybe I was under stress and that the seriously bad cramps were causing it (because the pain was so bad it wouldn't go away after 4 pills within 3-4 hours).  Then I had overdosed on pills within 6 hours and my stomach was really feeling it later that afternoon and night.  Once it was over, the next day I had started to catch a fever.  It was really high and it would not go away no matter what I did to get rid of it.  Normally fevers only last 1/2 a day with me, but this one was 2.  I thought the fever was due to the flu because my throat was feeling slight dryness like it might start a cold.  During this time I thought the pain sensation I was feeling was a part of my period and I thought it was the vaginal area.  It would always hurt right when I was done, but I could never completely finish, because if I did the pain would linger longer.  I also had frequent urgences to pee even though I may not have had much.  But once I was off my cycle, the pain continued and I realize it wasn't my vagina, but it was my lower urinary area next to my vagina area and the irritation lasted about 1/2 hour after I was done.  Granted, I had drank a little wine the night before, which could have caused that, but I had also had a little on Thanksgiving, too, and never felt that after drinking it before.  There's no bleeding or anything, but I'm wondering if the case is getting worse, or going to be worse and it's sort of scaring me.  Could I possibly have something to worry about?  What should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "I too have the same symptoms as Becky and I been having this for 10 years. Though the local doctor had prescribe ditropan & erispan(antidepression) for my condition, but see no improvement for my for condition(urge of urine).   Recently I had done an biopsy on my bladder and the doctor had found that there are eosinophilic cystitis in my bladder, right after i have done a stool and urine test to determine the parasite that could bring about eosinophilic cystitis but found to be negative.  I have done some research on eosinophilia in the internet had found that such disease is cause by allergence. Most would use prednisolone (steroid) to bring about the condition better, but such treatment would come along with some form of side effect.  Since eosinophilia is usually found in our body, would  eosinophilic cystitis result in sinus, as I have such condition since Oct '04?  Are there any ways to decrease the eosiniophilic cystitis apart from using steroid?  Is it true that anything that is acidic could aggrevate the condition on my urge to urine?  although I didn't pay much attention to it.  Is ditropan the right medication to use for controlling  the urge of urine?  Appreciate any doctor could advise on the matter above.\n\n",

I still eat the same amount as I always have though.   Last year I was doing work that was physicaly demanding at times I now don't do that work anymore.  It seemed not to be good for my health.

Had that checked out by a Doctor and my hearts ok never did find out what caused the shortness of breath though tried a puffer for asthma didn\u2019t help at all when I was having shortness of breath.

    "title": "Rule out HSV as the cause of UTI",
    "content": "Hi,  I haven't had a UTI in nearly 8 years. 2 weeks ago I began experiencing pain with urination and a constant need to urinate with little urine actually being passed. I bagan drinking cranberry juice, beer, and water immediately. This eased the symptoms for a day or so until I could get to the doctor. He prescribed a 7 day course of Cipro, which I completed last Wednesday..7 days ago. 4 days ago, I awoke with symptoms once again...the uncomfy pressure, dark urine, and small amount even when I felt like I would burst if I didn't use the restroom immediately. This improved once again after drinking 2 or 3 beers. I have experienced the symptoms again this morning. I have called my dr and told the nurse that I need a stronger antibiotic. It will be ready later this afternoon. My question is: How can I rule out HSV2 as a cause of this UTI? 4 months ago, I had the first symptoms of HSV2 since testing positive for antibodies in 1999. I have had problems off and on since then and am currently taking 250mg of Famvir twice daily. Because of all the issues I've had, I am very worried that HSV could also be the cause of this. In order to put these worries to rest...or confirm them - Is there any true way to know that this is not HSV related infection? Are there specific bacteria that will show positive? The doctor said I had a few white blood cells in the urine sample 2 weeks ago. He made a comment that there were \"a few\", which makes me think it's not the normal load you would suspect for a UTI. Could that have been due to the large amount of fluids I was consuming?  Thank you for any input!\n\n",

    "title": "continually getting urinary track infections / frequency",
    "content": "dear doc, i started getting urinary track infections two years ago, and now i get them frequently (i have had about six and it drives me nuts). drinking water after sex helps minimise me getting them but not all together. just recently i have started getting the need to go to the toilet alot too. when i go to the toilet i am able to go, i just get the urge to go alot. it doesn't hurt to pee, it is just annoying as i go to the bathroom, go to class, then go to the toilet again....or the cinema, or wherever it maybe. the frequent urinnary track infections affect my sex life as i deterred from having sex with my boyfriend. at my last pap smear the nurse said i had tight muscles. i am 22, a non smoker but my grandparents both have diebetes, along with an uncle and a cousin (who is 10), all on the one side of the family but my parents don't to my knowledge. i am reading a lot of scary stuff on the net (like bladder cancer, or probes up to the bladder).....so what is this kind of problem? please help, teash\n\n",

    "content": "Hi teash, Recurrent urinary tract infections may be quite frustrating. Antibiotics are typically used to treat active infections and are prescribed for approximately ten days.. A woman's urethra is much shorter than a man's and therefore makes them more susceptible. Some measures that you may take to reduce the frequency are drink plenty of water, cranberry juice, vitamin C supplements, avoid tub baths, after using the bathroom wipe front to back, and urinating directly after sexual intercourse. If you continue to have recurrent episodes an evaluation by a Urologist is warranted to identify if an underlying disorder is present.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I drink tons of water, empty my bladder after intercourse, and go to the bathroom every time I have the urge - which is often.  I rarely have been able to sleep through the night without going to the restroom (this has been the case since I can remember).  I have been told multiple things by multiple doctors.  I was told that the UTIs were caused by sex.  Then, another doctor told me that was only the case if I didn't have sex on a regular basis - which I do.  I was also told that some women just get them and to take one macrodantin each time I have sex.  Another doctor told me that it could just mask the real problem to do this.  I am getting confused and would like to know what I can do to end the misery.\n\n",

There are three things I can suggest to you for her:  1.Kegel exercises so the pelvic muscles are more controllable during intercourse and can be relaxed so the vagina doesn't grip the penis quite so hard during insertion (which commonly causes irritation.) 2. Have her drink cranberry juice prior to and after your visit. 3. Foreplay, as well as using a water based lubricant such as K -Y Jelly. I hope this is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

So I went in for testing and they said that I was fine and put me back on the same medication again for the same time. Once again it didnt work so I went back in for more testing to see if I had kidney stones but they didnt find anything.

    "content": "Hello,    I'm new here ..i was hoping someone could help me on this about 3 or 4 months ago i was sleeping and felt a pop between my legs between my legs left (the pubic bone) then the next week or so i had left testicle pain (minor fever feeling nasuia) so i went to the doctor and he felt for a hernia but found nothing he asked me to get a cbc blood test ..but everything came back fine indicating no infection (at least as far as cbc can show) ..anyways about 1 or 2 weeks the testicle pain went away (its still alittle sore on the cable that connects to it i think this may be where the pain really started)  but i started getting muscle twitches and pain in my left leg after a few days of this the pain went away and i was sitting at my computer and felt another \"pop\" but it seemed alittle higher around my belly button and ever since then i have had \"Abdominal\" pains from the pubic bone to the in between the ribcage where it bends like a \\/ right in the middle  it seems to only be on the left sides so it would be like a triangle <| ribcage side , middle (bellow and above belly button). (this is the first month or so) then i was feeling my neck and felt i had a swollen lymph node on my neck its on the left side by the shoulder blade but higher up and directly below my left ear) its about 1/2 inch wide oval shaped   this time i went to the hospitle and told him everything i could remember about the lymph node and pains i had also noticed it looked like i was urinating out puss or white it would cloud the toilet water when i first urinated. so i told him all this but he said this was normal? he also checked for a hernia but found nothing ..then diagnosed me with gastritis.............  so i got fed up i had some amoxicillin full prescription laying around 500 mg tablets it was not expired..i took this for a few weeks then i started noticing lower back pain (also on the left) kinda in the buttox area right where you feel the hip bone.. so i stopped taking the prescription thinking that what was doing it..   i have just recently been noticing small red dots on my chest ..not real big about pin size or the size of a period..only about 10 or so of these that i could find and i have a weird rash on my right finger its almost like a burn or welts and is red .im not sure if this is related but it also hasn't gone away   its been about 3 or 4 months now and it hasn't gone away and the doctors up here either cant understand or I'm not explaining it right.. its so hard to remember everything and then they probly think your nuts when your done saying it all.  i am 22 and not sexualy active i have been very healthy and rarely ever sick ... i did have a urinary track infection when i was 15 or 16 but was treated with cipro (ever since then it still did burn a little when i urinated but doctor didnt find anymore bactera in urin so said it was my imagination) so im wondering if it wasnt cleared up right and was in my system could it cause problems like this?  please help ..the doctors are useless where i live maybe if i give them a idea of what it could be i could get treatment.  i wasnt sure what fourm to post this in but i think its related to blatter area\n\n",

    "title": "UTI",
    "content": "I am a 29 year old female. I am a single mother of two but have been in a commited relationship for almost two years. I noticed the week of July 4th when I would urinate as my urine was coming out it didn't feel normal.  My partner and I had more intercourse than usual that weekend so I had chalked it up to that. At first I thought I might be on the verge of a yeast infection. There was no pain or discomfort but it still didn't feel right. The feeling went away towards the end of the week. During the week and every other weekend all I drink is water.  On the weekends my kids aren't with me,  my fiancee and I have a few beers through out the weekend.  I usually consume at least 6-8 glasses of water a day except for the weekends I don't have the kids. Just this past Thursday 7/14 there was a definite difference that night. I met a friend for happy hour and I had two beers. I also had a diet coke that evening. Later that night I noticed an uncomforable ache in my lower abdoman which radiated to my lower back as well. I also had the feeling of needing to urinate frequently. I took ibuprofin and then went to bed. Friday morning I woke up with the same achy feeling in my lower abdoman and back as well. I also felt as if I needed to urinate frequently. I did some research on UTI's that morning and followed the advice of drinking plenty of water. I did this and I also took some ibuprofin for the pain. I noticed by evening time all my symptoms were gone. That night I had a few beers and I noticed the pain in my lower abdomen came back along with the same pain in my back only this time it was worse. I also noticed that night if I pressed down on the right side of my abdoment it hurt. I researched further into UTI's and figured the reason I was suffering so badly was due to the alcohol. I stopped drinking the beer and went back to the water. The pain however was intense, especially in my back. I noticed the pain in my back at first seemed to be on both sides but then it seemed to settle on the lower left hand side. I did take some ibuprofin and went to bed. Of course I woke up more than 5 times in the middle of the night to urinate and each time I was up I drank water. The next morning I felt better but the need to urinate frequently was still there. I also have noticed I am extremely tired. I noticed when I slacked up on the water the ache would come back. Today is now Sunday. I took a UTI test this morning and it came back positive on the nitrate and protien level. I haven't noticed anymore of the pain today except for this afternoon and it seemed to be concentrated on the right side of my lower back. I thought perhaps it was because of the way I was laying so I changed postions several times which did help to alleviate the pain. I feel fine now other than the fact that I have felt exhausted all day and I know that I shouldn't since I slept in very late this morning and did nothing but lay on the couch and watch movies. I'm not sure if I should go see my Dr now that the symptoms seem to have resided. Any suggestions?\n\n",

I did another at home test this morning and the result this time was a negative nitrate and a positive protien reading. I'm still very tired also. I've noticed this morning also my lower abdomen is aching again. What I'm not sure of who to see is my family practitioner or my obgyn.\n\n",

    "content": "The combination of frequency of urination, lower abdominal pain, and bacteria in the urine confirmed by a positive nitrite test, are all suggestive of cystitis which is a  lower urinary tract infection. Get a urine culture done under any of your two doctors who can see you sooner and ensure that you collect a clean catch, mid-stream specimen of early morning urine to prevent false positive results. Obtain instructions from the doctor or nurse on how to collect a good sample.  Your doctor may want to place you on a course of antibiotics for relief of symptoms pending culture results.  Another condition to consider in a sexually active young female with lower abdominal pain and no urinary symptoms is pelvic inflammatory disease (PID).

    "content": "Hi! In mid May 2005, I started having pain in my back - right side.  I also hurt in my abdomen.  I would feel pain on the right side of my abdomen when I would walk and sit down.  About two days after my back started hurting, I awoke feeling very shakey and woozy.  Like I might pass out.  I than got quite nauseated, but never got sick.  I went to the doctor and my UA showed a trace of protein, no blood.  They did a blood test and my white count was ok.  She thought I had a UTI and the urethers were infected.  She gave me an antibiodic and within a couple of days I felt better.  About 4 weeks later the same thing happened.  I went back to the doctor ( I had to see a different one as mine was out of the office).  My UA showed a trace of protein and a slide showed some bacteria.  He sent in for a culture, but my test got lost.  He felt around and said that my right kidney was definitely tender.  He gave me an antibiodic and again I started feeling better.  Last Sunday it started all over again.  I was feeling really shakey, nauseated and the pain.  I took 5 days worth of Cipro and again feel better.  I have an appointment with a Urologist Thursday, but this is really scaring me.  Oh, this past week she did think that she felt a mass so I had a pelvic CAT but it was ok.  What do you think?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "I hope you have given the correct information. Was it a pelvic CT scan that was done or an abdominal CT scan? If the kidneys were being investigated, a pelvic CT scan would not show the kidneys because they are not located in the pelvis. The kidneys are situated higher up, at the back of the abdomen, below the diaphragm, one on each side of the spine.  If your symptoms are located on the right side of the upper abdomen, a more appropriate first line investigation would be an abdominal ultrasound, which would include a renal ultrasound and an ultrasound of the liver and gallbladder. The renal ultrasound is an imaging procedure for investigating the kidneys, ureters and urinary bladder.  Get to see the urologist as planned  and do not be scared.

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  About a month ago I obtained a UTI.  I tried to take care of it on my own by drinking lots of liquids and taking OTC AZO.  Eventually it became more painful and I went to a nearby clinic.  I was prescribed macrobid for Seven days.  It seemed to clear it up.  I had never had a UTI before so I assumed it was probably from having sex.  I was a virgin and my partner had slept with two other females.  The reason I am writing to you is that I feel another UTI coming on and I really don't want to have to take more antiobiotics and I would also like to know how it can be prevented.  I ahve been drinking lots of liquids.  It is not as bad as the other one.  Do you have any more suggestions on what I can do to nip this in the bud and could it be STD related even though my partner has been tested for STD's?        It is just frustrating me becuase it is uncomfortable and I am normally a very healthy person.  Thankyou so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.   Andrea\n\n",

    "content": "You will need to get antibiotic treatment for this UTI as well; there is nothing over the counter or natural that will kill the bacteria, so don't wait.  In the future, to avoid UTIs altogether, make sure you wash the vagina and anal area well with an antibacterial soap after sex and urinate if possible; just urinating usually isn't enough.  Treat this one completely (take all the antibiotics or it will come back), and this should prevent more.\n\n",

    "content": "I had unprotected sex late april and developed a stinging penis tip which was also irritated (meatitis?) burning pee and the need to urinate frequently. Anyway I went to a GUM clinic and they gave me anti biotics (doxycycline)  and i thought everything was fine, my results of the urine sample (may 19th) were all negative, but there was an infection detected initially so they said I had NSU and to finish my course.  I did this and all seemed well until about two weeks ago, I started having sleepless nights because I'd get up to urinate a bit would come out, the moment I got back into bed I'd feel a strong desire to go again, that cycle would continue all night.  I went back for a chat (not a retest) they quickly examined me again as I also had mild thrush symptoms (possibly caused by anti biotics?) which seem to have gone using canesten - and they said to give it a couple of weeks.  Here I am again, I'm in work in literally 4 hours and I'm sitting here awake because of this crap the only thing that would ease it last week was extreme tiredness or cranberry liquid mixed with water (but this is only advised to take for 2 days, so i stopped today and look what happens)  So basically I've been to the clinic twice and I still have this annoying issue, would my GP be able to take a urine sample or give me some more anti biotics to finish it off? Going to the clinic a third time is not my idea of fun.  btw I'm 21, male and haven't had sex since.  please help!\n\n",

They should collect more urine for another culture; you may have a resistant bug. I want to ask, did they do cultures for STDs?? If not, I'd request that as well.  Meanwhile, drink lots of fluids and take a pain reliever/anti-infammatory such as Advil.  Good luck and I hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

I would think that your GP could absolutely help you. Make that appointment!! Keep going back until you feel better.

    "content": "HI, I am a 34 year old male normally good health.  Recently I noticed a slight burning after urination in the tip of the penis.  The next day I noticed some slight yellow stains in underpants. It seems like a clear discharge, but dries slightly yellow. No rash or bumps or soreness anywhere.  No sudden urgency or frequency in urinating.  No painful erection or ejaculation either.  I did some internet searches on symptoms and everything I have read says it is an STD. I would think an STD would be out of the question because I have been in a monogamous relationship with my wife for 10 years now. (yes we both have been completely faithful, not even an issue) and neither have ever had any type of STD's in the past.  My wife is just getting over being sick and taking antibiotics.  If she possibly had a yeast infection or bacterial vaginosis, would it be possible my symptoms arouse from intercourse?  I know we should both go to the doctor, but our health insurance doesn't start for another month.  We are both a little worried and looking for advice. Sorry for this trainwreck of a post, just nervous.  I hope I placed this in the right forum and gave enough info.     Thanks    Edit: allergic to penicillin.\n\n",

As for the roughness and red spots to the roof of your mouth, again - this is something that needs to be actually \"seen\" by a doctor, to know what it is.  I doubt there's a connection between this and your testicle situation, it might just be a coincidence - nevertheless, see your doctor for follow-up.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 36 yr old male.  last 2 weeks, I have noticed that the opening of my penis gets stuck together often throughout the day.  when i open it up, i notice 'slight' stickiness and it gets stuck again and again throughout the day.  I don't feel any pain when I urinate, other than missing my target a lot due to the meatus being stuck together and taking a second or two to be lubricated as urine exits the opening. I haven't seen any discharge other than the faint sticky substance that seems to make the opening stuck.  It doesn't seem like there is any other rash or redness at or around the penis opening.     I have had one partner for some time now and she doesn't have any symptoms or pain. Only thing unusual in the past 2-3 weeks have been that both my partner and I had a bad cold/flu and have given each other oral sex during this time.   P.S.  I know I am told that I don't drink a lot of water.. something I have never done much.. and I have had a nasty cold for 2-3 weeks.    Can this be STD? or any other harmless explanation?    thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Pudgey,  It sounds like he should get his prostate checked out.   The prostate gland is located just below the bottom of the bladder and above the rectum. It encircles the urethra (urine tube) at the point where the urethra connects to the bladder and would be the most common cause of difficulty in urination. The prostate gland secretes 30-40 % of the fluid volume in semen, it contains nutrients in it that help keep the sperm healthy, gives the sperm something to be ejaculated out with and it helps them swim away.   Benign Prostate Hyperplasia causes difficulty starting urination, uncontrolled urinary dribbling, urinary hesitation, urinary blockage, urinary frequency but in small amounts, urinary urgency, etc.\n\n",

Currently I am suffering from phimosis, I cannot even retract at all during erection or non erection state. Is there any health problems which will arise from phimosis?   If I want to treat my current condition, will circumcision or a dorsal slit be appropriate or any other methods?  What is the difference between these 2 operation? Which is better for me? I just want it to be retractable thats all. How long will I take to heal from either operation?\n\n",

    "title": "adult circumcision",
    "content": "Hello Agent7,  I apologize for the delay in response, you may have dealt with this and moved on with your life but in the case that you haven\u2019t or for others, I will attempt to answer.  The adult phimosis is a thin contour of skin tissue located towards the front of the inner foreskin and it narrows the opening of the foreskin. Imagine a ring which is too small to fit the finger, if it does pass the knuckle, it hurts, or it gets stuck. A phimotic ring can make retraction of the foreskin over and behind the glans impossible, painful, or difficult, the foreskin may even get stuck behind the glans.   Partial and full circumcision in adults can be very painful and the glans can be extremely sensitive afterwards, especially when all the foreskin is removed. Surgical circumcision techniques that may be used are ventral slit circumcision, dorsal slit circumcision and sleeve technique (full) circumcision. Talk to your Physician prior to having any procedure done to see which is best for you. Ask about potential risks, bleeding, infections, sutures, injury possibilities and removal or to much or too little skin\n\n",

    "title": "UTI or Interstitial Cystitis?",
    "content": "Hi all, I\u2019m a 17yr old virgin Male who has in the past suffered from recurring UTI's but recently I have noticed some of the symptoms of UTI becoming more similar to Interstitial Cystitis. The symptoms of UTI for me was constant urinating after masturbation and discomfort around my bladder area, which my doctor treated with Trimethoprim Tablets for 14 days after a urine test showed my urine had bacteria in it (the tablets was for the UTI not the discomfort), which was effective in stopping it at the time. But now I have completely stopped the masturbation because the UTI just came back after, but I still get the same problems with constant urination along with extra problems of my waist feeling 'congested' when my bladder fills up during the night when sleeping which hurts when I take a deep breath, but once I've emptied my bladder the pain goes away. Could you please help me, because I don't understand how masturbation managed to cause me a UTI as this problem is usually associated with sexual intercourse with a partner, and why does the problem seem to be worsening to the point symptoms are resembling Interstitial Cystitis, what is going on in my body please explain?\n\n",

They decided they needed meat in their diet and so they hiked 5 days deeper into the jungle, went hunting, and got a large boar.  Instead of cooking and preparing the meat right then, they took 5 days and carried it back to camp through the heat of the forest.  By the time they got back it smelled so bad that the film crew could only film for a few minutes at a time.  But the natives butchered the boar, boiled and ate the meat anyway.  How is this possible without their getting sick?\n\n",

The adult worms bore through the intestinal wall, enter the blood and lymphatic system and are carried to the muscle tissue where they become enclosed in a capsule waiting to be eaten by humans or other animals. Inside the new host body, they will do the same thing while causing fever, pain and even death. Trichinosis can be killed by thorough cooking or deep freezing for long periods of time. Rotting meat \u2026 yuck, I don\u2019t know what to say about that. They either have some pretty tolerant digestive systems and good immune systems or they have a really small tribe.\n\n",

    "title": "SEVERE UTI & kidney infection or STD",
    "content": "I am a 23 year old female, a mother of two, and has suffered from UTI's since the first year of my marriage.  It got worse after I had my first born, and I was left untreated by my doctor's who would tell me to drink plenty of water, and that the infection should go away. I was in a lot of pain. I had pain on my right side which lead me to believe the infection had reached my kidneys. After a move from the state, I went to go see another doctor at the state I was in, which she prescribed me a medicine that started with micro-for urinary tract infections for individuals that were allergic to penicillin. I happen to be allergic to penicillin. So, doctors will not prescribe me medications that contain penicillin because I will break out into a rash. I was on this micro-drug my whole pregnancy with my second child and two weeks after my pregnancy. The UTI did not go away, and neither did the nuisant pain on my right side (my kidney). Again, I went to see another doctor, and she prescribed me Cipro for a whole month after my results came in severe for UTI. Perhaps, the treatment wasn't long enough because I ended up feeling pain when I urinated and the strong pain on my right side. Again, I moved to another state, and decided to visit a doctor from a different country. She also did an analysis and the results came back positive for severe UTI. She told me that the medications that the doctor's had prescribed me in the USA were not strong enough to fight the bacterias found in my urine so not only did she give me an antibiotic shot on my buttock, but she prescribed me very good pain killers that made the pain go away on my right side (my kidney) and Noroxin 400mg. I've had this problem for 3 years now. The pain on my right side is sometimes very unbareable, and the UTI, I think is still very present. I have been on Noroxin for 2 months now. My doctor told me not to eat anything spicy and to drink ONLY water (a gallon and a half a day) and natural juices. She told me to stay away from anything caffeine, tea, coffee, chocolate, coke, koolaids and tang. I had felt better when I stayed away from these colored drinks and spice foods, but it is very hard at times. I have noticed the pain come back on my kidney when I break the rules. I cannot do anything physical like sexual intercourse nor exercising. The pain will come back, and I will break out into a fever. Is there another way to cure this \"severe UTI and kidney infection\"? Or do I have some type of STD?\n\n",

    "title": "RECURRENT URINARY TRACT INFECTIONS",
    "content": "Urinary tract infections (UTI) are common in women, but you should establish if you have an uncomplicated or a complicated UTI.  In uncomplicated UTI, the urinary tract has no structural abnormality, the renal function is normal and you have no associated disease which impairs defence mechanisms. In complicated UTI, the urinary tract is abnormal due to obstruction or kidney disorders, or there is an associated disease that predisposes to it, such as diabetes mellitus.  I am surprised that with this long history of UTI, you have not been subjected to imaging techniques for investigation of your urinary tract. It is of great importance to undergo a renal ultrasound as well as renal function tests as the next steps of investigation. Please see a urologist to conduct  further investigations along these lines.   Meanwhile, there are preventive measures to be adopted for women with recurrent UTI,  but these must be started after investigations and completion of a curative course of treatment and continued for several months.   *Fluid intake of at least 2 litres per day *Regular emptying of bladder \u2013 3 hourly intervals by day and before sleep *Complete emptying of the bladder *Double micturition: before retiring for the night: empty the bladder and then attempt to empty the bladder a second time 15 minutes later. *Empty bladder before and after intercourse.  I hope this information is helpful.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "title": "Is this a urinary tract infection or something else???",
    "content": "Dear shawnybravo20, The small amount of liquid forming at the end of your penis is a discharge from the prostatic urethra & is called a urethral discharge. It is the commonest presenting symptom of a sexually transmitted disease(STD) IN MEN. You didn't mention how long you've noticed this discharge nor any medication use. Are u circumcised or not? What is the colour, amount, and quantity of the dicharge---e.g. is it yellow, clear, profuse, scanty,etc. or a combination of these? You could have acquired it from anywhere between 1-4 months ago and only now it decided to raise its ugly head. Acquired via sexual intercourse (in which case it could be of bacterial, fungal or mechanical abrasions,etc.) Are u sure that your partner is TRULY FAITHFUL to you? Your condition could be easily cured but you need to visit your doctor or urologist in order to ascertain its origin and subsequently he would devise a treatment plan for you.It is vital that u should have this done as early as possible in order to eliminate sexual factors; a thorough penile examination is warranted as well as a specimen of the urethral discharge collected for GRAM STAINING(ASK YOUR Dr. TO EXPLAIN THIS TO YOU). Have u enquired from your partner whether she ever had a STD before: what was the diagnosis & how long ago this happened & and very important at what age did it occur together with what treatment was administered. However, your partner could be completely innocent & thereby u would have acquired it via wearing tight underwear or close- fitting jeans, not thoroughly washing your briefs with sufficient detergent, use of a strange toilete.g. at a friend's house or at a party,etc. There is a plethora of possible causes for this to occur.  Don't worry about penis size or decreased sex drive because they would return to normalcy once treatment has been started: normally, from my own personal experience, in treating patients everyday with same condition at my clinic, normalcy would not return immediately( about 2-4 weeks) depending on how your body would handle & react to drug treatment,etc.   KINDLY LET ME KNOW A.S.A.P. THE RESPONSES TO THE ABOVE QUESTIONS WHICH I HAD JUST OUTLINED TO YOU. I WOULD THEN ADVISE YOU ON HOW TO PROCEED WITH TREATMENT. DON'T WORRY UNNECESSARILY ABOUT YOUR SEX DRIVE,ETC. BECAUSE I AM WILLING TO ASSIST U AS MUCH AS I CAN FROM THIS END.   BEST REGARDS, D.SAWH Pharm.D., M.D., F.R.C.P.(UK).\n\n",

Is this possible that it just went away temporarily and may come back eventually, I did have about 3 days worth of antibiotics \"Bactrim\" that my sister had left over from a UTI that she had, so i decided to take those and see if they helped, but i doubt that would be enough antibiotics to cure something like this, and i know i shouldnt take other peoples' medicine but i was pretty desperate considering i currently don't have health insurance\n\n",

    "content": "Dear shawnybravo20, Thanks for the reply. It is a urethral discharge as I had explained to u before. Circumcision predisposes males to infections such as these. Is this circumcision due to your religion, etc? You've said that for a month you were symptom -free, nevertheless, the infection would tend to behave in this manner,i.e. it would remain dormant for about 3-8 weeks and then it would decide to raise its ugly head: once this occurs sometimes the second assault would be far more severe because as we say in medicine the infection would remain SUBCLINICAL UNTIL IT WAKES UP TO DO MORE DAMAGE THAN NORMAL. Having about 3 days supply of ''BACTRIM'' DOES NOT PUT YOU OUT OF DANGER AS YET. Never ever take another person's prescription medication without talking to a health professional first. O.K.!  SOME QUESTIONS: WHEN EXACTLY DID YOU TAKE YOUR SISTER'S MEDICATION? HOW MANY DAYS/ WEEKS AFTER THE INFECTION HAD STARTED? HAVE YOU GAINED ANY RELIEF FROM THIS MEDICATION?  ARE U ALLERGIC TO ANY ANTIBIOTICS THAT U ARE AWARE OF?  ARE U PRESENTLY EXPERIENCING ANY PAIN OR BURNING DURING OR AFTER URINATION?  WHEN LAST AFTER STARTING THIS BACTRIM, DID U HAVE SEX?  WHAT DOSAGE OF BACTRIM DID U USE: e.g. one tablet twice daily after meals, etc.?  ARE U EXPERIENCING ANY SIDE -EFFECTS OF BACTRIM SUCH AS NAUSEA, VOMITING,HEADACHES, SKIN RASHES, PHOTOSENSITIVITY, JOINT PAINS, MUSCLE PAINS, VERTIGO, SHORTNESS OF BREATH, ETC.?  WAS YOUR SISTER'S MEDICATION ''BACTRIM'' OR ''BACTRIM DS?'' PLEASE FIND OUT THIS FOR ME. LOOKING FORWARD TO A SWIFT RESPONSE FROM YOU AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE SO THAT WE COULD GET STARTED WITH TREATMENT.

    "content": "Dear shawnybravo20, Thanks for the swift response. Have u had the chance to talk to your partner whether she ever did have an STD as was outlined in my first correspondence to you with the questions to ask? As I had said before circumcision predisposes males to infections of this sort. If you are going to have sex with her , ALWAYS USE A CONDOM. Have u told her about your condition? If not, you need to so that both of you could sit down and work this out.  BOTTOM LINE: SHE HAS TO KNOW SOONER OR LATER. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT SHE MIGHT CARRY THE GERMS BOTH IN HER VAGINA AND RECTUM. SHE WOULD EVENTUALLY DISCOVER A DICHARGE FORM HER ORIFICES. SO , NOW IS THE TIME TO TELL HER ABOUT IT. DO NOT EVER HAVE UNPROTECTED SEX. ALWAYS USE A CONDOM.  PRECAUTIONS: 1) AVOID SEXUAL INTERCOURSE COMPLETELY, ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU ARE ON THE BELOW MENTIONED MEDICATIONS THAT I'M GOING TO LIST IN A MOMENT.  2) IT IS WISE FOR BOTH YOU AND YOUR PARTNER TO HAVE THE SAME TREATMENT.  3) MUST HAVE A CULTURE & SENSITIVITY TEST DONE ON BOTH OF YOU: THIS IS TO ASCERTAIN WHICH TYPE OF GERM YOU ARE CARRYING--- TOGETHER WITH THE APPROPRIATE TREATMENT. CONSULT A PHYSICIAN AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE.  4) THE DOCTOR MIGHT REQUEST FOR BOTH OF YOU TO TAKE BLOOD SAMPLES FOR SYPHILIS AT EVERY 3 MONTHS.  5) ONCE U ARE CIRCUMCISED, YOU ARE LIKELY TO GET REPEATED / RECURRENT INFECTIONS.  6) ONCE TREATMENT HAS STARTED, YOU CANNOT HAVE SEXUAL INTERCOURSE FOR AT LEAST 1-3 MONTHS DEPENDING ON TYPE OF INFECTION, NATURE OF INFECTION , SEVERITY OF INFECTION, TREATMENT PLAN, ETC. TREATMENT: SINCE U ARE NOT ALLERGIC TO ANY ANTIBIOTICS, YOU COULD USE TETRACYCLINE CAPSULES : TAKE 2 CAPS.BY MOUTH EVERY SIX HOURS FOR 1 WEEK.                                                  OR  BACTRIM TABS: TAKE 4 TABLETS BY MOUTH TWICE DAILY FOR 5 DAYS.                                                              OR  DOXYCYCLINE 100mg TWICE DAILY FOR ONE WEEK.                                                              OR  PENICILLIN(AMOXYCILLIN) 500mg THREE TIMES DAILY FOR 7-10 DAYS. N.B. WITH ALL THESE MEDICATIONS, YOU HAVE TO DRINK OUT THE ENTIRE COURSE OF TREATMENT TOGETHER WITH LOTS OF WATER (NOT FRUIT JUICES).          ALSO, NO ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGES WITH ANY OF THESE MEDICATIONS.          ANY TYPE OF PENICILLIN IS TO BE TAKEN ALWAYS 1/2 HOUR BEFORE OR 1 HOUR LATER AFTER MEALS.

    "content": "I have been experiencing vertigo for the past four months.  It began the end of November after I had just run a marathon in Manila, The Philippines, where I am living and I figured that it was as a result of exhaustion from that experience.  After 3-4 weeks of constant dizziness, car sickness, motion sickness, and nausea, I accepted the fact that there was a problem and when I came down with a severe ear ache around Christmas I figured that I had an ear infection, so I went to see a family physician.  He could find no sign of an infection, ran blood work and tests to make sure that my cholestrol, heart, blood sugar, blood pressure, etc. were fine and everything came back normal.  He then suggested that I see an E N T, which I did.  That doctor said that I probably had an infection in the \"M-bone\" (sorry I can't remember the name or the spelling of it) in a small cavity of the bone, so he treated me with antibiotics.  Well, after 4 rounds of antibiotics and no relief, I then went to get a second opinion.  The doctor who I saw for the second opinion, said that I had a UTI that was causing me to experience the vertigo and prescribed another antibiotic for that.  He never did a urine sample to show that I had a UTI and while I may have some of the symptoms that go along with a UTI this all sounds a little weird to me.  I would like some suggestions as to what the problem could possibly be and ideas for possible tests that I could ask doctors about.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear LeiMcK, Thanks for your question. From your data given, I don't think that you have a UTI. However, it sounds more like vertigo. Firstly, I must inform you that there are several types of vertigo, several causes as well as treatment(s) are available FOR ALL TYPES OF VERTIGO. Some of the more common types of vertigo found among athletes like yourself include the following: BENIGN PAROXYSMAL POSITIONAL VERTIGO, VESTIBULAR LABYRINTHITIS, MENIERE'S DISEASE, MIGRAINE AND PHYSIOLOGIC VERTIGO. YOU NEED TO CONSULT AN ENT SURGEON/ OTOLARYNGOLOGIST AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. DON'T HESITATE ! You require a good initial assessment as well as a thorough physical examination. SOME QUESTIONS: ARE YOU AT PRESENT USING ANY MEDICATIONS? IF YES, WHAT ARE THEY--- THEIR DOSAGES--- FOR HOW LONG HAVE YOU BEEN USING IT / THEM?  HOW MANY ATTACKS OF VERTIGO DO U HAVE PER DAY?  WHEN ARE THE ATTACKS MADE WORSE, i.e. AFTER RUNNING, AFTER BENDING DOWN, AFTER A BATH, AFTER SEX, ETC.  WHAT DO YOU DO TO GAIN SOME RELIEF?  ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE? IF YES, HOW MANY TIMES PER WEEK DO YOU ENGAGE IN SEX ?  DO YOU EXPERIENCE ANY LIGHT- HEADEDNESS DURING AN ATTACK?  DO YOU EXPERIENCE NAUSEA ALONE OR BOTH NAUSEA & VOMITING TOGETHER?  DO YOU OR ANY FAMILY MEMBER HAVE ANY PSYCHIATRIC ILLNESS OR ANY FORM OF SEIZURES e.g. EPILEPSY,ETC.?  HAVE YOU HAD ANY MRI SCANS DONE?  HOW LONG DOES AN ATTACK LAST FOR? LOOKING FORWARD TO YOUR RESPONSES AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE. Please understand that your responses to the above questions are vital in order for me to make a presumptive diagnosis with subsequent advice on treatment plans. PLEASE TRY TO THE BEST OF YOUR ABILITY TO ANSWER THE QUESTIONS AS COMPLETELY AS POSSIBLE. I AM READY & WILLING TO ASSIST YOU AS MUCH AS I COULD FROM THIS END.   YOURS SINCERELY, D. A.

    "content": "Dear Mr. Healey, Thanks for your question. Blood in the urine is a medical condition called haematuria. After the procedure, a little clotting would always be normal. In some cases, the '' clotting'' could last anywhere from 12-24 months depending on several factors, e.g. YOUR AGE, YOUR OCCUPATION, ANY OTHER SURGICAL PROCEDURES THAT WERE PERFORMED PRIOR TO TUNA, ANY OTHER CONCURRENT ILLNESSES SUCH AS HIGH CHOLESTEROL, HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, RHEUMATOID ARTHRITIS, ANY HAEMORRHAGE, HIGH- GRADE FEVER, ETC.  IT WOULD/ SHOULD NOT PERSIST FOREVER. I need to ask u some questions: a) WHAT IS YOUR PRESENT OCCUPATION? HOW LONG AFTER TUNA DID YOUR UROLOGIST TOLD YOU TO RESUME WORK?  b) WERE ANY OTHER SURGICAL PROCEDURES PERFORMED PRIOR TO TUNA?  c) DO YOU HAVE ANY OTHER ILLNESS SUCH AS HYPERTENSION, DIABETES, HIGH CHOLESTEROL/ TRIGLYCERIDES, ANY TYPE OF ARTHRITIS, ETC.? IF YES, KINDLY STATE WHAT THEY ARE--- WHAT MEDICATIONS YOU ARE CURRENTLY USING (IF ANY)--- AND THEIR DOSAGES--- FOR HOW LONG HAVE U HAD THIS CONDITION(S)?  d) AFTER TUNA, WHAT ADVICE DID YOUR UROLOGIST GAVE YOU?  e) AFTER TUNA, DID YOUR UROLOGIST PRESCRIBE ANY MEDICATION? IF YES, WHAT WAS IT AND THE DOSAGE PLEASE?  f) ARE YOU SEXUALLY ACTIVE? IF YES, HOW MANY TIMES PER WEEK DO YOU ENGAGE IN SEX?  g) IS THE BLOOD AT THE START OF THE URINARY STREAM OR MIXED IN WITH THE WHOLE STREAM?  h) IS THE HAEMATURIA PAINFUL OR ENTIRELY PAINLESS?  i)  HAVE YOU HAD ANY PAST UROLOGICAL CONDITIONS BESIDES THIS ONE? I am anxiously awaiting your responses to the questions that I've asked above. Please understand that the responses to the above questions must be known first before I COULD FURTHER ADVISE YOU ON HOW TO PROCEED.  YOURS TRULY, D. A.

    "title": "Hubby has protein and ketones in urine??",
    "content": "My husband has been struggling with urination for the last couple of months.  He has to separate the urethra opening every time to urinate.  He had his urethra close as a young child, and we were thinking this may again be the problem.  He saw a specialist who disagreed, and diagnosed him with urethritis.  He was put on doxycycline as there were WBC in his urine.  We took the full course and unfortunately it did not get better.  Due to scheduling conflicts, we switched to a family practice doctor this week to continue treatment.  This doctor did many more tests, including some blood tests which we do not know the results of yet, a PSA level (came back at 0.75) and urinalysis.  He did the prostate exam due to strong family history of prostate cancer, and said it felt soft instead of hard.  Then the nurse calls and leaves a message that large amounts of protein and traces of ketones were found in the urine.  She said nothing of bacteria, blood, or WBC.  And now nothing for 48 hours!  I'm calling tomorrow morning to see if the doctor wants us to come back in (nothing scheduled as of yet) and to get these results further explained.    Any comments/suggestions??  I forgot to mention that I have access to a glucometer from work, so we have been taking his blood sugars.  A random blood surgar was 122 - a 10 hour fasting was 95.  I know these are not *high* but they are high normal.  Could the kidneys malfunctioning cause the ketones?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jessicamarquardt, The body normally uses glucose for energy. When the body uses fat instead of sugar for energy it produces the by-product ketones. Conditions that may cause ketones are diabetes, malnutrition, alcoholism, illness, etc. I would first attribute ketones to one of these conditions. Does he have a fruity odor to his breath? (sort of like the smell of nail polish remover). Does he have frequent thirst and urination? I would certainly hope that an evaluation for diabetes is completed because excess ketone production in people with diabetes may lead to diabetic ketoacidosis which can be very dangerous. The PSA level (although values may vary according to the lab used) sound within normal limits as is the prostate exam. As for the protein in the urine, a 24 hour urine collection would provide a more accurate assessment of protein levels and kidney function. What about labwork, were there any abnormalities noted with kidney function there (BUN, creatinine levels etc.)? I would certainly suggest you call the physician for an explaination, follow up evaluation, and further studies to identify the problem. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi shivraj, Recurrent UTI's can be very frustrating indeed. A couple of other oral antibiotics used in treatment of UTI's are Trimethoprim-Sulfamethazone, Bactrim, usually given for 10 days. Low doses of an antibiotic such as TMP/SMZ or nitrofurantoin can be taken daily for 6 months usually taken at bedtime. Some other things you can do are drink plenty of water, (cranberry juice if it's available). If not vitamin C supplements have the same effect. Take showers instead of tub baths. After using the bathroom wipe from front to back. Void, (go to the bathroom and urinate) after sexual intercourse. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Early last week I had cystitis - needed to urinate frequently but nothing happening; I get this occasionally, but usually get rid of it with plenty of water and some antacid, and a couple of panadol.  Have also gone for cranberry juice more recently, but not sure how effective that is.  Anyway, this time was a bit different in that there was a specific site of pain not just the general burning (a bit as if there was an ulcer or something).  Anyway, I had to travel to run a couple of days of workshops, and it continued through those two days - somewhat uncomfortable but managed through it.  Then the next day, before returning home, I felt achy all over, which I put down to high heeled shoes!  Friday I drove home (4 hour drive), and the next day found I had a temp going from 39-40 degrees (celsius), got the chills, couldn't do much except sleep, lost all appetite etc.  Saturday, still had a temp over 39, but not quite as high as the previous day.  Sunday, felt a bit better, temp still fluctuating, but gen between 38 and 39, still weak and sleepy.  Monday (today), temp almost normal in the morning, so back to work - drove to the next town and felt very weak and woozy (lack of food?) and figured it was too soon to get behind the wheel again.  Struggled a bit through the day.  Later my temp jumped again to 39.  Slept for 3 hours in the late afternoon.  (ATM my temp is back down again to 37.3)  Long story - but the question is, do I need to see a doctor or will this go away by itself?  How do I know if I need medical help?  As an aside, my urine is cloudy, and horribly smelly quite often, but a previous doc said nothing was wrong with it when it was like that - but that was a few years ago.  My lower back is tender and achy.  Appreciate any advice.\n\n",

He jabbed me with 160mg of Gentamycin and prescribed Augmentin Duo Forte twice a day (for five days unless side effects emerge).  I also left a urine sample for overnight analysis.  He's hopeful that the gentamycin will act quickly and I could be okay in 24 to 48 hours - I hope so too.

    "content": "I am married and have been sexually active with only my husband for the last 5 and a half years. But in the past year I have had the symptoms of UTIs sometimes as many as 3 times a month. I usually use over the counter meds because of the frequency. Usually Uristat or Cystex. Also try to drink alot of water and cranberry juice. The problem is when I do go to the doctor and am tested it says I do not have a UTI. I have been referred to a urologist to see if I have inflammatory bladder disease.  These symptoms happen almost every week for 1-3 days at a time and then after over the counter treatment they get a little better. Never completely better. I have had blood in my urine, I get horrible stomach cramps, frequency, urgency, burning, and aching in my vaginal area. I sit with a hot water bottle between my legs to help the aching.  I follow all of the preventative guidelines. Wiping front to back, wearing loose, cotton clothing, urinating before and after sex and keeping clean with a sensitive skin, no dyes or perfumes vaginal wash.   These are very much hindering my life. I miss work because of them. My husband is beginning to think I am allergic to him. Is there anything else this could be? I am told that this could have nothing to do with my lupus even though lupus is an inflammatory disease. My kidneys have been checked and though I have protein in my urine, my tests have shown no decrease in kidney function.  Any advice is appreciated. CKBruce\n\n",

    "content": "Hi CK, You may have something called interstitial cystitis. My sister had the same symptoms that you describe but even with antibiotics it kept coming back.  Interstitial cystitis (IC), one of the chronic pelvic pain disorders, is a condition resulting in recurring discomfort or pain in the bladder and the surrounding pelvic region. The symptoms of IC vary from case to case and even in the same individual. People may experience mild discomfort, pressure, tenderness, or intense pain in the bladder and pelvic area. Symptoms may include an urgent need to urinate (urgency), frequent need to urinate (frequency), or a combination of these symptoms. Pain may change in intensity as the bladder fills with urine or as it empties. Women's symptoms often get worse during menstruation.  In IC, the bladder wall may be irritated and become scarred or stiff. Glomerulations (pinpoint bleeding caused by recurrent irritation) may appear on the bladder wall. Some people with IC find that their bladders cannot hold much urine, which increases the frequency of urination. Frequency, however, is not always specifically related to bladder size; many people with severe frequency have normal bladder capacity. People with severe cases of IC may urinate as many as 60 times a day.  Also, people with IC often experience pain during sexual intercourse. IC is far more common in women than in men. Of the more than 700,000 Americans estimated to have IC, 90 percent are women  What causes IC? Some of the symptoms of IC resemble those of bacterial infection, but medical tests reveal no organisms in the urine of patients with IC. Furthermore, patients with IC do not respond to antibiotic therapy. Researchers are working to understand the causes of IC and to find effective treatments.  One theory being studied is that IC is an autoimmune response following a bladder infection. Another theory is that a bacterium may be present in bladder cells but not detectable through routine urine tests. Some scientists have suggested that certain substances in urine may be irritating to people with IC, but no substance unique to people with IC has as yet been isolated. Researchers are beginning to explore the possibility that heredity may play a part in some forms of IC. In a few cases, IC has affected a mother and a daughter or two sisters, but it does not commonly run in families. No gene has yet been implicated as a cause.  How is IC diagnosed? Because symptoms are similar to those of other disorders of the urinary system and because there is no definitive test to identify IC, doctors must rule out other conditions before considering a diagnosis of IC. Among these disorders are urinary tract or vaginal infections, bladder cancer, bladder inflammation or infection caused by radiation to the pelvic area, eosinophilic and tuberculous cystitis, kidney stones, endometriosis, neurological disorders, sexually transmitted diseases, low-count bacteria in the urine, and, in men, chronic bacterial and nonbacterial prostatitis.  The diagnosis of IC in the general population is based on   Pinpoint bleeding on the bladder wall  presence of urgency, frequency, or pelvic/bladder pain   cystoscopic evidence (under anesthesia) of bladder wall inflammation, including Hunner's ulcers or glomerulations (present in 90 percent of patients with IC)   absence of other diseases that could cause the symptoms   Diagnostic tests that help identify other conditions include urinalysis, urine culture, cystoscopy, biopsy of the bladder wall, distention of the bladder under anesthesia, urine cytology, and, in men, laboratory examination of prostate secretions.  Urinalysis and Urine Culture These tests can detect and identify the most common organisms that infect the urine and that may cause symptoms similar to IC. However, organisms such as Chlamydia cannot be detected with these tests, so a negative culture does not rule out all types of infection. A urine sample is obtained either by catheterization or by the \"clean catch\" method. For a clean catch, the patient washes the genital area before collecting urine \"midstream\" in a sterile container. White and red blood cells and bacteria in the urine may indicate an infection of the urinary tract, which can be treated with an antibiotic. If urine is sterile for weeks or months while symptoms persist, the doctor may consider a diagnosis of IC.  I hope this helps and I wish you luck......\n\n",

    "content": "Hey!  I'm a 20yr old female.  I'm on my last wits with the doctor's office.  I'm there so much they say I need a permanent room :/  For the last 6 mos or so I have had my period everyday, with about 2 days vacation every 3 weeks or so.  I have had blood work and ultrasounds which both of which show nothing wrong.  Since then I've also had UTI's nonstop.  At first I was being treated for back spasms beacsue my back pain was so excruciating, but that never helped.    I was put on Cipro, then Bactrim twice.  Neither of which worked.  I am in severe pain of my lower back, flank back pain, I presume.  I don;t know what to do anymore.  I know I must have a UTI still, obviously.  I have the sensation of needing to urinate frequently but never manage to do so.  I've been drinking about 2 liters of water a day and about 6 glasses of cranberry juice.  None of this is helping.  I detected a very SMALL amount of blood in my urine the past few days.  My lower abdominal area is in much pain as well, but I can't get over the pain in my back.  Its hard to breath and even stand up straight.  I take ibuprofin but that does not help either.  What can I do?  As I said before I'm at the doctor every week practically with another problem...there seems to ALWAYS be something wrong with me...Could these two problems be related in any way?    Thanks so much ,              L\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ItsmeL, Have you ever been evaluated for kidney stones? You stated that you have had an ultrasound but this particular test may not identify smaller stones. A test called an intravenous pyelogram (IVP), can identify this condition. This test involves taking a series of xrays after the injection of a contrast dye is injected into the vein. The dye improves the xray images of the kidneys and ureters and is more specific for identifying stones. Symptoms of kidney stones are, increased urinary frequency, tenderness or pain in the abdomen, flank pain (pain in the small of the back), blood in the urine etc. If this test has not been done I would suggest you discuss this with your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I will sit back down and try to go, but maybe a few drops will come out. I'll stand back up and still feel like I have to go. I repeat the same thing about 3 times almost every time I go to the bathroom. I feel like I always have to go. I am overweight, but have been for a few years now.

Of course I'm not saying that men never get them, they just have them less often because of the structure of their urethra. An UTI is easily diagnosed by an urinalysis and resolved with an antibiotic. Do you have any redness, discharge or pain with ejaculations? If you have any of the other symptoms I would be more inclined to consider a type of fungal infection or STD. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi marcus, Ketoconazole is used to treat fungal infections and that is why most of your symptoms have probably disappeared. There is a medication called pyridium that eases symtoms of burning etc. (also it turns your urine orange) If the infection was a very recent one then that would explain why the burning has not subsided. I would suggest to drink plenty of water to dilute your urine so it is not so acidic and will decrease the burning sensations. I would also suggest that you call your physician again, tell him/her that you are continuing to have this problem so that they can at least test your urine to make sure you don't have a urinary tract infection. If this is ruled out, still inquire about the above medication to see if this will alleviate your symptoms. I hope this was somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, what comes to mind here is bacteria in the urine. I know you said you do not have typical UTI symptoms, but from what I have researched the smell of ammonia in the urine comes from \"urea\". Bacteria that contaminate the urine will convert chemicals in the urine into smelling chemicals that are responsible for the distinctive smell, such as ammonia.   There are foods that can add to the excretion of nitrogen compounds (ammonia and urea). These foods would be red meats, or high protein foods.   So to sum it up, I would definitely see your doctor if this persists. While the odor could be from the urea/ammonia excretions I mentioned above, this is merely a possibility. Only your own doctor can confirm what in fact is contribtuing to the smell.  Thank you for using our forum. I hope I was of some help.\n\n",

I have been tested for alot of STD and the only information i got was the non specific infection, so i really don't know why this is?  i was reading around and some say it can be a fungus others say it can be just the reminants of the UTI and will go away in a while but its been about 2-3 weeks since i finished medication.   please let me know, these bumps are VERY tiny, and don't look to be any kinda of std ive seen , they do not puss or pop or anything.  i do have VERY dry skin around my body and over the shaft of my penis some times and was told they may just be sebum glands but im not sure.  please let me know what i can do, and is possible to Private messege me some good urologists in the Vancouver city area in Canada if you can.

    "title": "NSU",
    "content": "Dear Mike,  NSU is the abbreviation for non-specific urethritis, which is the most common sexually transmitted disease. It is also referred to as NGU, non-gonococcal urethritis.  NSU may be caused by a variety of agents, most commonly by Chlamydia trachomatis, Ureaplasma urealyticum and Mycoplasma genitalium. There are other aetiologic agents that are rare and will not be listed.  In NSU, you may experience urethral discharge or no discharge at all, burning on urination or urethral itching. If a urethral discharge is experienced, it may be detected only in the morning, after not voiding urine overnight, or it may be noted as crusts at the urinary outlet, or as staining of the underwear. The dark maroon-red colour you observed inside the tip of the urethra is known as meatitis, which is a common finding in NSU, signifying inflammation due to urethritis.  The drug prescribed for you is the first drug of choice for treatment of NSU, but did you go back for a test of cure after completing the course? Also, partner notification is very important in all sexually transmitted diseases, so it is important to refer your sexual partners for evaluation and treatment if you have had unprotected sex with any of them.  You require to consult a genitourinary physician or venereologist, not a urologist,  for your condition. Your primary care physician will refer you to one  in your locality.

Do you get a urine analysis and urine culture checked, or just based on your symptoms that you are diagnosed with a uti?  i am not a urologist.  Interstitial cystitis is a disease that affects the lower urinary tract tissues. There is no universally accepted method to diagnose interstitial cystitis. Diagnosis is primarily clinical and should be suspected in any patient who complains of urgency, frequency, pelvic pain, associated with sexual activity, but infection has to be excluded. A woman who complains of recurrent utis poorly responsive to antibiotics has to be evaluated for interstitial cystitis.  There are tests for diagnosis of interstitical cystitis that only urologists are familiar with.  In most cases, treatment is successful.  Please, ask your urologist to evaluate you for interstitial cystitis.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "It would have been helpful if you had provided the results of your tests. The basic  screening test for urinary tract infection (UTI) is a urinalysis, microscopy and culture of a fresh, middle stream specimen of urine. If you were placed on \u201cBactrim\u201d and later changed to \u201cCipro\u201d, it is likely that the culture, if done, showed bacterial sensitivity to the latter drug. The culture result would not have been available at your first visit when you were prescribed \u201cBactrim\u201d.  If symptoms are persisting, as your post suggests, you will require an ultrasound scan of the renal tract as well as renal function tests, especially because of poor urinary output and loin pain. Renal ultrasound is usually performed to detect kidney diseases such as cysts, stones, renal scarring, tumours or obstruction. Are you drinking enough fluids? A fluid intake of at least 2 litres per day is helpful in UTI. What is unhelpful is the daily consumption of 1-2 packets of cigarettes which you disclosed in your profile.  UTI may present as cystitis, urethritis and acute pyelonephritis. Acute pyelonephritis  presents with burning sensation, frequency, loin pain and fever. You have three of these symptoms. If further tests as advised show no abnormalities, you should be examined for urethritis and vaginitis.   In response to your question, yes, it is mandatory to go back to your doctor if your symptoms do not improve within 5 days of the medication and you should go earlier if urine output remains poor and loin pain increases.  I hope this information has been helpful. Thank you for contacting this website.  Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, sorry if my explanation is little hard to understand but I lack much of the terminology required to properly explain myself but i'll try as best as I can.  I am a 24 year old male and haven't been sexually active for about three months. Now, about a month and a half ago a swelling appeared just inside the praeputial sphincter of my penis. It appears to be just a little flap of skin and it causes me no pain. This is very embarassing but due to this flap of skin I find it difficult to urinate straight. The strange thing is it just appeared one day.  http://www.circumstitions.com/Anatomy.html According to the diagram found above, I think it is the 'meatus' that is swollen.  I was not sure which forum to post this in, so please excuse me if this is not the correct one. I would really appreciate any advice you could give me because I am very concerned.  Thank you .\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   You have assisted me by enclosing the diagram of the male genital anatomy though which you have identified the location of your complaint as the \u201cmeatus\u201d. If your lesion is not there,  then the rest of my response is not applicable.   The urethral meatus is the external opening of the urethra through which urine is voided.   You complain of a painless little flap of skin that is located just inside the urethra. It is most likely  that the lesion is visible or partially protruding through the meatus. The lesion is embarrassing  and prevents a straight urine stream. Naturally, any growth or swelling located at the meatus would partially obstruct the free flow of urine.  You have not stated if you had unprotected sex in the past although there has been sexual abstinence for about three months.  It is very difficult to attempt a diagnosis without visual examination, but the picture is very suggestive of a meatal wart which falls under the group of genital warts.  Individuals presenting with genital warts rarely report symptoms other than the appearance of bumps or growths on their genitalia. In men, most genital warts occur on the penile shaft, glans, urethral meatus, scrotum, perianal area, pubic skin, upper thighs or groin folds.   It is advisable to see a genitourinary physician or a dermatovenereologist for confirmation. Without treatment, genital warts may disappear, stay the same or grow larger in size or number. Most genital warts are treated because they are aesthetically  unpleasant.   Thank you for contacting our website.

However, more commonly bacterial infection usually causes alkilinity of urine. Did the other urine test results come out normal? Pus cells? A bacterial examination would be in order if a repeat test shows the same result. Please note that alkaline urine can lead to the development of calcium phosphate, calcium carbonate and magnesium phosphate stones. So if your tests continue to come back alkaline it is advisable to receive treatment.  Best regards,\n\n",

High pH of the urine has many causes. It is not my area of expertise however, I suspect renal tubular acidosis. If all the labs are normal I would leave the decision to the regular doctor to proceed with further lab work or consult a nephrologist.   If you have the full urine results and kidney functions as well as an other lab results I will be glad to review it as well.  M Yassin, MD Infectious Diseases\n\n",

    "title": "Possible UTI / Lasting Lymph Node Trouble",
    "content": "Hello - I am an eighteen year old college student.  Problem: Swollen lymph nodes on left side of crotch area, and almost a lingering uncomfortable feeling too.  Background info: About a month ago I went to the doctors because I had a burning pain during urination that had lasted a few days.  Accompanied with that, a few lymph nodes on the left side of my crotch became swollen and sore.  About a week beforehand, I had had sex numerous times on the weekend (with condoms) with my steady girlfriend, whom I've been dating for the past 2.5 years.   I am certain that neither of us were unfaithful, so I don't see how STDs could have been a factor.  But also, around a few days before the burning occurred, the tip of my penis brushed against the inside of the toilet that I share with my suitemates here at college (I don't know if that could have been a factor or not).  Anyway, I went to the doctors and they did tests for a urinary tract infection, gonorrhea, and chlamydia.  In the meantime, just in case, I was treated for both of the STDs with antibiotics.  Around a week later I got the tests back and all three were negative.  The burning sensation is long gone, but my lymph nodes are still swollen even after a month.  Sometimes it creates a slight, uncomfortable feeling as well.  Within the past month I've also taken Amoxyicillan for an ear infection - more antibiotics (in case you need to know that too). Do you know what could be causing this or have any insight? Do you think there are any serious/harmful consequences if I wait it out to see if they go back to normal?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Lymph nodes are the bodies filter system so when there is an infection they do sometimes enlarge, and by the way, often don't return to normal. If the nodes aren't increasing in size, it is likely due to the infection that you had. If they happen to start becoming larger or you have any other signs or symptoms of infection etc. I would suggest that you make a repeat appointment with your family doctor to rule out any other underlying cause. I hope this helps. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Medical Doctors, please forgive me if I'm giving you only my nickname.  I am too embarrassed to talk about my problem even on the internet and I don't feel comfortable.  Well, I guess I have no choice, but talk about it.  Here it is.  Last week (09/23/04) when I woke up that morning I went to the bathroom, and the first thing I did was peeing in the toilet.  I've noticed that I\u2019ve been peeing with red blood.  I mean blood for a couple of days!  I got scared!  I don't know why I am peeing with blood?  Since then, I have realized that I\u2019ve been peeing with blood for at least over month because my pee now has a little tinted of blood that I have noticed back in August.  I did not pay attention then.  I thought it was cause of the multivitamins I was taking everyday or the food I was eating.  I know now that is blood because usually when I was taking my multivitamins before my pee was bright yellow.  I\u2019ve been taking my multivitamins (Mega-Vites \u201c75\u201d) for at least 2 years and I don\u2019t have any problems with it.  I thought I was a healthy man because I go to the gym religiously 4 times a week at night and on the weekend I go for running and sometimes for a long walk.  The symptoms that I am feeling when I get up from sitting down I see stars.  When I get tired from lifting weight I see stars.  Also the front right side of my waist below the belt it hurts.  It even more pain when I am wearing jeans or dress pants with belt.  And I feel sleepy and tired in the middle of the day even if I\u2019m not doing anything.  I have lost 5-7 lbs, but I\u2019m still in a good shape and I don\u2019t eat as much as I used to.  I drink 1 big cup of coffee with 2 equal (sugar substitution) everyday and sometimes green tea.  I don\u2019t know if that would hurt me.  I just want to mention that too.  Please help me I need help.  I don\u2019t know what I have?  What cause of this?  I need to find out what should I do?  What would you recommend for me?  I don\u2019t have medical insurance now because I was cut (down sizing) from work and I\u2019ve been looking for work for the past 3 months.  I am so confused.  I don\u2019t know what to do?   Many thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Blood in the urine can be cause from a Urinary tract infection or from a kidney infection.  Both of which are treated with antibiotics. While vitamins can change the color of your urine, it usually changes to a yellow or orange or greenish color much different from the color of blood.  Pain from a urinary tract infection is usually felt in the pelvic area and is accompanied with a burning sensation when you urinate.  The blood is due to the fact that the infection has irritated the lining of the bladder and it bleeds into the urine.  Pain from a kidney infection is usually felt in the lower back on one or both sides of the spine below the ribcage.  Bladder infections left untreated can develop into Kidney infections.  Whatever is the case, you need to go to your doctor as this will not clear up on its own. Also drink plenty of fluids and juices such as cranberry juice are also good to drink. Left untreated things can only get worse from here. So, I encourage you to seek medical attention as soon as possible. Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Karladd,  With 7 urinary tract infections within a year, i would recommend that you be seen by a urologist or a nephrologist or at least if you have not had a urine culture and sensitivity to find out what is the bug that is causing this, at least, to have one so that you can find out whether or not this is an unusual bug resistant to antibiotics.  The abdominal pain that you are experiencing with the vomiting and nausea could be accompanying symptoms of a urinary tract infection.  i am not sure about whether or not you have a mild form of pelvic inflammatory disease, or just pelvic congestion from having a heavy period but the symptoms can also fit just severe pelvic congestion. A pelvic exam and ultrasound should with a good degree of confidence that you don't have pelvic inflammatory disease even though nothing is 100% perfect.   How long you should wait before going back to your doctor is a tough question to answer, if you think the symptoms are improving even though they are still there, this means that you can still wait a little bit, but if the symptoms are getting worse, i suggest you don't wait and call your doctor and be seen soon. Another test that could be done is a ct scan of the abdomen.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The problem is that since then i've had the weird feeling that i have to urinate non stop.  It feels like after you 'pee', and there's just a little bit left... but there never is.  it's a bit better today, but i'm wondering if this is normal, maybe just organs are sensitive due to a rock going thru...could there still be a problem? or is this normal? If it is normal, how long before it usually goes away?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Doctor(s) -   I have been having a few strange problems the last few days.  I did some research online and it seems like I probablly have an UTI but I wanted to run it by some professionals.  Recently I have been having some general discomfort in my penis.  It feels like something is brushing up against it, just causing an annoying sensation every so often.  Occasionally it feels almost like there is something inside it, toward the base of the head, but there is nothing in there that I can feel by gently squeezing.  I have been able to urinate and perform other penile functions without difficulty so I don't think there is anything actually blocking it.    Today I had a bit of discomfort in my testicles but I think it may've been due to more exhaustion and stress than anything.  From what I understand men are much more susceptible to UTIs when under stress, and I have been under a great deal lately.    Do these descriptions sound like a UTI or some other problem?  Would it be advisible to get a home UTI test kit from the local drug store, and then see a health care provider or would it be best to just go straight to the Doc?  Thanks in advance for all your help, this site seems like a great place!\n\n",

I have had a hysterectomy and my left ovary out.  Each time I am tested, it comes out negative.  I am having strong back/side/kidney area pains.  We are new in the Lewisville, TX area and have to be on yucky medicaid temporarily.  I can't find a doctor who will see me because of the medicaid.  I have FMS and I realize it could be muscle pain, but not likely if it feels like this.  I have dealt with my illnesses long enough to know the differences in pain.  I am at a loss for how to treat it or what to do.  If anyone can give me suggestions, suggest a doctor in my area, anything! I would love to hear it.  I really don't want to do the emergency room again because of the way I was treated with my shoulder a few weeks ago (bursitis).  I just need to get some relief.  Has anyone else had this?  Is there a doctor who could suggest a home rememdy or recommend a doctor in my area?\n\n",

    "content": "I think I can answer some of those questions.     I have pain 2 or 3 days a week.  It comes and goes and seems to respond to my pain meds.  The same with burning urination.  I don't get it as often as the pain, but I do get it.  There is no fever.  Sometimes pressing the area hurts, but that is normal since I have fibromyalgia.  The most relief I get is when I empty my bladder.  It is almost like the kidneys get backed up or something.  I am not sure what is going on at all.  I just need to get relief from the pain.     I can also tell you that my idea about the kidneys getting backed up could be possible.  I gave birth to my twin boys in June of 2002.  I noticed something was not right with my bladder shortly after that, but I blew it off thinking it was just left over from childbirth.  I had my hysterectomy in January of 2003.  I did not notice many symptoms for a while.  Then after 8 or 10 months I saw my OBGYN and asked him if maybe my bladder needs to be tied?  He asked me several of the \"usual\" questions.  After I answered them, he said I may have nerve damage or something similar and just do my keigels.  Well, my muscles are strong, but I still have this sudden urgency and frequency.  Now my kidneys, which is what I think the pain is, really hurt off and on.  I had the pain yesterday, and again some today, but I may not tomorrow.  Who knows?    Do you really think you can suggest anything?  Do you know a doctor in my area that would help me?\n\n",

To answer your question about the medication, the name of it was Nitrofurantoin, I was taking it four times a day for about a week and a half, but like I said it has no effect on me.   As far as my sexual history, I'm 21 now, I lost my virginity around the age of 15, right before my 16th birthday, I regularly saw a gyn, at the age of 19 I had an abortion, and I currently am not having sexual intercourse and have not for about 7 months now.  I did recently have a pelvic exam, the doctor said he could see nothing wrong, except for the fact that i'am extremely tender more so than someone my age who is healthy should be, he did a culture and said it takes about 2weeks for the reults to come back, i'm waiting for those, he also did another urinealysis and said it still had blood and protien in it.    He wants me to take a urine sample to the hospital to have what I assume will be a urine culture done on it.

The bugs causing urinary infections have gained new grounds by being resistant to once-effective antibiotics, which could be one reason for your recurrence.

If the doctor can feel nodularities inside the vagina (at cul-de-sac, uterosacral ligament), that would add up to the diagnosis of endometriosis.   Most patients with endometriosis suffer pain during menses and sometimes during intercourse.   Laparoscopy is the primary diagnostic modality for endometriosis.   Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

Was given two week dose of antibiotic, beat it down a bit but didnt quite do it so after a 4 day lay off, doctor put me on same med for another two weeks. I have also had low level pain in left testical during this time period (which doctor says can be associated with this infection) Now I am half way through a 4 week stint of levoquine? along with antiinflamatory. Current urine analysis shows urine is clear. This latest dose of meds was perscribed by a urologist who examined me and said the prostate showed no signs of being enlarged. He claims some times these infections can back up into the testical and can take time to get rid of. Having said this, I recall for the last two years in april I seemed to have had a prostate infection and epididimitis. My history also includes left side flank pain off and on for the last two years (all chest xrays, stomach barium w/ small bowel follow through tests come back clean, testical scan unremarkeble) Sorry for so much info, just wondering if you see any pattern here\n\n",

Swabs and urine tests had ruled out ghonorrea and clamydia and i have had a thorough testicular exam to rule out torsion or any other irregulaties. About 4 dyas into the course of 2x daily 100mg i developed pain in my left testicle, was diagnosed with epididymitis but advised to continue the course. About 4 days after finishing the testicular pain and discomfort returned this time in both testes and i was prescribed another 2 weeks of doxycycline along with 2 x daily ciprofloxacin. This seemed to work with the pain dissapearing entirely for the last 6 days of my treatment. However within 12 hours of stopping the discomfort was back and i am now finishing my 5th week of treatment,  my third week of uninterrupted treatment (other than a 24hr blip).  The pain, although very much better, is still there and I'm sure it will worsen once I finish this weeks course tommorrow. I am told by my doctor and the hospital that the combination of the 2 antibiotics i am on are the gold standard for treating epididymitis. Is this the case or are there some infections the antibiotics i am taking are not effective against. Is the solution to carry on with the same treatment for a longer uninterrupted time period?  Many thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Epro2,  Those 2 antibiotics in addition to a few others are the standard for treatment of epididymitis.  If you get worse after this course of antibiotics, and this is your 6th week of epididymitis, this turns it into chronic epididymitis. You have to have a urine and a semen culture and then treated according to the appropriate antibiotic.  If you have sexual partners, they have to be tested and treated if deemed indicated by your doctors as well.

    "content": "Dear Laura,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Going to the bathroom to urinate many times more than you are used to has many causes. At the top of the list:  1. Infections of the urinary tract. Especially if you have small amount of urine with burning and pain. 2. Diabetes mellitus. 3. Medications such as diuretics (Fluid pills).  You said you are not retaining any fluid so are you using a diuretic? 4. Drinking too much water (you said you were thirsty) or fluids so you go more often. This could go both ways, meaning that you feel thirsty you drink too much and then you go too much or you go too much you feel thirsty so you drink too much. 5. A condition called diabetes insipidus. 6. Kidney problems.  How is this related to your car crash?  1. i can not see any relation between your car crash and this condition unless you had a head trauma and from what you said this does not appear to be the case. Head trauma can lead to this condition called diabetes insipidus if it is really severe and it is rare. 2. Could be totally unrelated and you are taking more notice of yourself to detect what might go wrong because you had an accident and you just took notice of something that has been there for a while and you just started to notice it or you do not have any abnormality.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and please keep me posted and do not hesitate to ask any questions.

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for using our website and for the update.  In my personal opinion, i think that the urinary tract infection that you had has already resolved.  Urinary tract infections could sometimes be a sign of prostate infection. Symptoms are usually deep seated pelvic pain, symptoms of urinary tract infection in addition to fever and other general symptoms of infection. There are other types of prostate inflammation that could not be related to bacteria as well.  What you are describing does not strike me as symptoms of chronic prostatitis although it could because in medicine there is no black and white. If you continue to have these symptoms for longer periods of time and it is really causing you problems then i think it will be worth your while to go see a urologist. Prostate infections are a little hard to diagnose and need certain antibiotic to be treated.

Actually I should correct my statement, the area where I feel the discomfort is NOT the prostate but is the Epididymis just around my testicles.   Since you know all the historical events I had, do you think I have got Epididymitis? I have no swell or permanent pain around any area at all. It is just this discomfort that comes and go away.   Maybe it is just strain or fatigue I have? Would you suggest me to perform a intravenous urogram (IVU) ?  So far, there are no symptoms  I have for UTI at all.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor, I have Urinary Tract Infection which I suspect to be some sort of STD for more than 3 weeks now. Urine test confirmed that there were some infection as there was a high white blood cell count in my urine. Other tests like VDRL etc was negative. I was given Amoxycilin for 5 days but that didn't help at all with no improvement but it got worst each day with some sort of pus coming ou from my penist. Then, I changed doctor who then put me on a treatment of single dosage per day of Cephalexin 6 pills of 500mg each and Probencid 4 pills of 250mg and 1 injection of Kanamycin Sulphate. (not sure the amount). I was on that for 11 days and each day it was a lot more better with no signs of further cloudiness in my urine or burning sensation while urine after the very first day of treatment. The second doctor advised that normally it takes about 7 days maximum to cure this sort of bacterial infection. But I went on with the treatment up to 11 days and gave up as I still feel around 1% of uneasiness and when I pass urine, there was a small little sign of contamination in the urine. I confirm this contamination by visual inspection and normally I could find about 1mmx1mm of transparent coagulated liquid amidst my urine. I then changed to a another doctor who is a specialists and told him the whole story. He then provided me with rifampicin (600mg) per day, tarivid (200mg) for 3 times per day. I took that for 3 days but the moment I start to take his new treatment... I felt my condition immediately worsen rather than improved. So, I went back to the second doctor and told him I am still not cured completely. He advised that there's nothing better than what he has prescribed and recommended me to continue. I am concern now, is there any maximum period that I can take Cephalexin, Probencid and Kanamycin Sulfate as my treatment? I intend to carry on with this same treatment for another 7 days. It has definitely improved my condition instantaneously. I am worried of liver effects etc if I take too much of antibiotics. What is your recommendation ?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for using our website.  You have not mentionned how old are you and whether you have any chronic medical problems or not and why you think that this is an std?  About the std, you mentionned that the vdrl, etc... was negative. What were the other tests that were done? Did the doctor think that this was gonorrhea? Was a swab done to make sure that this was not gonorrhea before starting treatment?  Successful treatment of healthy men less than 50 years of age who have urinary tract infection is usually achieved by the simple administration of a sulfa based medication called bactrim (or septrin in other countries) or any other medication of the tarivid family for 7 days is usually more than enough.  It looks like most of your symptoms are gone. At this point, taking more medications will not add to the cure rate and will add to the risk of more side effects and cost.  My advice at this point is to do another urine analysis and see whether there is still a residual infection in the urine or not and do a urine culture and sensitivty to see if you still have a residual infection which antibiotic affects the bacteria that you have in your urine and take it.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar,  Thanks for your prompt reply. I am 28 years old male and do not have any medical problems or allergy to any known medicine. The reason I think this is STD is because I had a burning sensation when I urine and also I had intercourse with my girlfriend. She was also diagnosed to have UTI. But was cured by a week of treatment on Benoxylin. Then, I went for a urine and blood test to confirmed that there was bacterial infection in my urine. The test includes, HIV, VDRL, Chlamydia, Gonorrhea etc. There wasn't a swab test done at all. The country I am presently is probably not capable of doing a swab test, culture, sensitivity test.  I am concerned because I read on some websites that treatment may sometime exceeds more than 14 days. Presently I wouldn't say all the symptoms has gone because of the fact that I can still visually see very minor signs of contamination in my urine. So, I intend to carry on with this treatment of Cephalexin, Probencid and Kanamycin Sulfate for a period of 7 days. I have completed my 2nd day treatment. So another 5 days to go. I don't feel any uncomfort at all.  My question is. Would there be any long term effects since I had such a long treatment on these medication? Also, does it mean that these 3 medication I had is doing good and I should stick on this because it definitely has improved my condition instantaneously and the moment I changed medication my condition became worst. If Cephalexin and Kanamycin Sulfate is doing good to killing this bacteria then there isn't any point for me to change a 5th doctor who may give me something else right?. (I actually saw a 3rd doctor who prescribed me with some other sort of antibiotic which has no effect either). I really appreciate your views.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for using our website and thank you for the update.  What i think is, that unless you have some kind of a resistant unusual bug in the bladder causing this infection, you are taking way too many antibiotics. One antibiotic is enough more than enough in cases of simple non-complicated urinary tract infection, on a condition that it is the right antibiotic.  Injections are recommended in cases the patient is not compliant with treatment (in cases of std) and if the patient is very sick and in the hospital.  i think at this point cephalexin is more than enough as it has very good excretion in the urine with very high concentrations and is capable of killing most of the usual bacteria. Kanamycin is not a bad choice either as it has very good concentrations in the urine as well and has good coverage but since you are not really sick, why give you shots?  The usual dose of cephalexin is 250-500 mg orally every 6 hours.  i also recommend drinking a lot of fluids so as to wash out all the infectious agents outside the body.  i also recommend drinking something that will change the pH of urine, if your urine was acidic, then drink something that will render it more alkaline and if it was alkaline then drink something that will make it more acidic (to make it harder for the bacteria to live).  About side effects, too much of anything is not recommended.

Honestly, i really don't mind to spend money to get rid of this bacterial infection but am very upset as it has been weeks and there wasn't sign of a complete cure. This time, if I completely the last day, I will just wait for another few days and go do a urine test once more.   In your opinion, looking at the number of days I have had treatment and also various antiobiotics I have had. Do you think I should go as I intend even though if I feel I still have some slight discomfort of 1% and maybe I still see some contamination in my urine I should just ignore those and discontinue medication for a few days before going for a urine test ?   I understand that it is necessary to wait for a few days to a week in order to have a better urine examination for bacterial infection. This was what one of the doctors advised me.   I am really concerned and confused as to what I should be doing as I have seek so many so called \"dermatologist\" and \"urinologist\" that is suppose to be the specialist in the country where I am residing.

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for using our website and thank you for the update.  i never heard of the dose of cephalexin that you are using. This is not the way it is supposed to be used. The does is 250-500 mg orally four times a day.  About the pH, each bacteria has an optimum environment to live and multiply in and if you change this environment (temperature, pH, hydration and others) then the bacteria will not grow and may be even die. This is not a treatment in itself but it is a very helpful tool.  The urine is normally acidic. The pH of the urine should be on the urine analysis that you had at the begining. There are simple things that you can drink to make the urine more acidic like taking vitamin c (its other name is ascorbic acid), to make the urine more alkaline you can take something that contains citrate or bicarbonate like magnesium citrate that is present over the counter in many countries (i do not really know where you are now).  My advice to you is to stop probenecid and kanamycin and take cephalexin the way it is supposed to be taken (500 mg orally every six hours) for a week and by the end of the week go ahead and do a urine analysis without waiting. During this week, drink lots of fluids and if you wish (this is not a crucial step in treatment) take something that will change the pH of the urine.

I have also checked my original urine analysis and it was pH 8 which represents an alkaline urine. I will thus take some vitamin C as advised. I believe for all Bacterial infection, maintaining an acidic urine is a good choice? Also, should I start a complete 500mg 6 hours interval for 7 days?  Today, i received my blood test results for HSV Type 1 and 2 IgG reactivity which requires about 2 weeks for the lab to produced here. They have confirmed that I have HSV Virus Type 1 Titer 1:100 Week Positive Antibodies present. Type 2 was negative. The doctor there told me not to worry as long as there are no symptoms of herpes externally in my body. Which there isn't at all. I have not remember any incident of having lesions externally that looks like herpes infection in my past 28 years of life. I am very worried now because I do not involve in casual sex but only with my girlfriend. What can I do at the moment for this HSV test? The doctor say I don't have to do anything since the test only showed some week antibodies present in my blood. The scales provided in the results are (IgG Reactivity: No reaction at 1:100 refers to Negative. Titer 1:100 to 1:320 Refers to Positive Former or Recent Infection. Titer 1:1000 or higher Refers to Recent infection).  For your information, the last time I had intercourse was probably about a week before I did the blood test.   Anyway, this may be not relevant to the UTI at all? I have also managed to find a lab that can do Bacteria Culture and Sensitivity Test here. Though they said it may not have any results as I am still on antibiotics but I told them to give it a go.   I really want to get rid of all these things in my body as I consider myself a healthy person and it is really upset to know the fact that it is STD related.  Please advise what I can do with the HSV results. Thanks a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for your reply and for using our website.  Regarding the antibiotic, yes, i think you should start a full course of cephalexin 500 mg every 6 hours for 7 days.  Regarding herpes antibody results, hsv type 1 is the type that causes the cold sores on the mouth.   Hsv type 2 is the one that causes the genital infection in most of the cases. It is rare to have someone with genital lesions and has type 1 infection.   You have weakly positive type 1 and negative type 2 which means that you most probably had a cold sore sometime in the past but no genital herpes.  From now on, i think it is not unreasonable to practice safe sex.  About the urine culture and sensitivity, i think the lab is right about most probably not finding anything in the urine because of the antibiotics (unless this is the specimen that you gave before starting the antibiotics).  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your update.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr.,  Thanks for your information about my HSV results. Seemed like even the doctor here didn't even tell me it could probably just be a cold sore in my mouth !. But I am very reliefed now.   I will complete the 7 days of antibiotic as you advised. By the way, I found a website that seemed to recommend the same single dosage method as advised by this doctor I had here.  Click here!  But. I will let you know my progress at the end of the 7 days with 500mg in 6 hours interval. So far after 6 times of 500mg... I still see some transparent looking thing in my urine and still have a little bit of discomfort in my urethra. This thing in my urine looks like some sort of mucous but it is normally around 1mmx1mm but sometimes can be around 1mmx20mm.  I suppose these are the bacteria? I read that normal urine should be sterile and shouldn't have anything in it.   Thanks a lot.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cachaca,  Thank you very much for your reply and for using our website.  About cephalexin dose in the link that you sent me, it says that in cases of genitourinary infections the dose is 1-2 grams (1000-2000 mg)/day in divided doses given every 6-8 hours. This means a dose of 250-500 mg every 6 hours.  About the single dose, this means that you take this dose one time only and not once every day for 14 days and this regimen is only used in cases of gonorrhea and you said that you testes negative for gonorrhea.  The mucous that you are seeing in the urine could be protein in the urine from the infection or could be clumps of cells.  The best way to find out whether you have been cured regardless of the symptoms and what you see in the urine is a urine analysis.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and hoping that you will feel better soon.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr,  4 days has past since I started taking the Cephalexin at the recommended dosage. I have been getting a lot better or at least I felt that way. I am wondering, with the amount of antibiotics I have been taking for such a long time.. (26 days?), would you recommend me to eat some acidophulus supplement? I don't have any pain or whatsoever in my stomach and I go to the toilet regularly. But psychologically i am worried that I should be eating something useful to help my dietary system.  If you can recommend me something that would be really useful or food that I should avoid or eat more etc.  I know anything sweet is not good as it would encourage the growth of bacteria in the urinary tract.   Thanks a lot.\n\n",

There is no specific diet that you can follow while taking anntibiotics, all i can say is that you have to eat a healthy well balanced diet to keep your body as healthy as possible while fighting the infection.
