My doctor prescribed me IBrophen 600 three times a day initially. i tried it for 15 days but it had no effect. Then he prescribed me Diclofenic sodium 50 mg three times a day. i am taking it from last ten days and now i do not feel any pain while i am at rest. but i feel even more pain than before while i walk. i feel pain in my chest left side and in veins of my left arm near my hand. and also in the vein behind my left ankle. now my both hands have lines of blue color(especially at palm). this color becomes more prominent during walking. I feel pain when i walk and it settle down when i have rest. if i walk for few yard then this pain settle down with few minutes(15) of rest. but if i walk for more than 5 minutes i feel pain for whole day even at rest. please tell me what i do?? how long it will take to cure completely ?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: viral Pericarditis",
    "content": "Hi, From your history, it is evident that you were diagnosed with acute viral pericarditis fairly recently. By definition, an acute viral or idiopathic pericarditis  should last <6 weeks.  Pain is the predominant symptom of pericarditis and usually responds well to NSAIDs, especially, Ibuprofen.Intense pain, not responding to NSAIDs may need an opioid, such as morphine  or a corticosteroid, such as prednisone. Prednisone does not have an analgesic action per-se but, reduces pain by its anti-inflammatory action.  Failure to respond to NSAIDs within one week (as indicated by persistence of fever, worsening of the general condition, continuing chest pain,or new pericardial effusion) should alert to the possibility of a cause other than viral or idiopathic may be causing the pericarditis.  Pain persisting beyond one week(on NSAIDs) is considered to a risk factor for severe pericarditis.  The bluish discolorations that you allude to are suspicious of acute thrombophlebitis.This has to be urgently excluded as there have been case reports of severe purulent pericarditis occurring due to spread of organisms from these foci of acute thrombophlebitis(at times, even fatal). ( Coeur Med Interne. 1964 Jul;64:355-8 ).  Therefore, i urge you to consult your physician without delay and get yourself evaluated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My just turned 55 year old father presented with pericarditis at his family doctor last month. It was detected with an EKG. He was admitted to the hospital. They ran some additional heart tests, said he would be fine, it wasn't life threatening. The next afternoon he went downhill very quickly (urine was rusty with lower output, blood/oxygen levels begane to drop, blood pressure began to drop) and was admitted to the ICU, he died a few hours later of sepsis. He was only in the hospital about 36 hours total.   Can pericarditis get into your bloodstream and cause sepsis? I was told it was viral pericarditis but he died of bacteria in his blood. How did the bacteria get there? Everything I've read online says pericarditis tends to clear up in a few weeks. Are the two even related?   How did he catch the pericarditis? Is it a virus you catch just in the air, like a cold or flu virus?   Having trouble understanding what happened. The hospital/ICU doctors were of little help as they said they were still waiting for the blood cultures to get back so they knew what they fighting. He died before the cultures came back.  Any input would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The causes of acute pericarditis are many;  for example... - viral(cytomegalo virus,HIV,Herpes virus) etc, - bacterial (notably pneumococcal), - fungal (aspergillus, histaplasmosis,candida albicans etc, & - myocardial infarctions.  Risk factors for pneumoccocal pericardtis are advancing age (older than 55-65 years ), children younger than 6 months and immunocompromised states.  Primary (Invasive) Pneumoccocal pericardtis can be very fulminant and may result in death very rapidly.Certain communities (Apache & Navajo Indians, native Alaskans,and African Americans) have been found to be at a higher risk.  Usually there is a focus of infection which may remain occult.  From your description, one strong possibility is an invasive pneumococcal sepsis perhaps leading to pericarditis and acute cardiac tamponade leading to the tragic demise of your father.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  If you do actually have pericarditis it can range from mild to fairly complex but in almost all cases responds to fairly simple medication and usually doesn't last too long once it's been treated. Most cases of pericarditis would not interfere with a PFO repair except to the extent that it would probably need to be cured before the repair is done, which, again, shouldn't take very long in most cases to resolve. Pericarditis is a fairly common problem, is usually easily treated, rarely causes lasting problems unless it is related to an underlying condition. It would only interfere with your cath procedure/repair insofar as it would need to be declared cured beforehand, so if you're scheduled to have the procedure in the next week or so it might have to be postponed for a week or so, which really shouldn't be a big problem.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  FIrst, the early workup of your aunt should have at least been suggestive of pericardial tamponade. The liver enlargement with mild ascetes yet normal liver function tests should have caused suspicion of tamponade early on. Later elevated liver enzymes were to be expected. A good opportunity to discover the suspect tamponade would have been to perform an echocardiogram earlier in the process, but since the problem apparently wasn't suspected, this opportunity to avoid a critical situation was missed.   The most common causes of pericardial tamponade are kidney failure, cardiac trauma (via chest injury or medical catheter mishap, neither of which would appear to be a factor here), connective tissue disease and some cancers. There's no obvious link to any of these, but because of that the suspicion would fall  to the most insidious probable cause which, in your aunt's case would be an undiscovered malignancy or connective tissue/autoimmune disease (lupus, for example).   It's impossible to determine here what the underlying cause of the primary problem is, but one would hope all the requisite explorations are being pursued now by your aunt's doctors.  I hope your aunt receives appropriate care and begins to improve. Please keep us updated as to her progress. I hope this response is helpful to you.\n\n",

It would seem she has a clotting disorder, and while this may be secondary to an occult malignancy it is more likely, now that this has happened, that it is probably a heritable genetic defect.

There are some blood tests that can at least suggest the presence of tumors such as CA 19.9, a tumor marker test, which can at least, hopefully, disclose the presence of any tumors.   I hope this is helpful and also hope your sister will recover from the stray thrombi as quickly as she recovered from the pericardial effusion.

    "content": "Hello again -  Since all the heritable disorders and mutations seem to have been ruled out, which is a good thing actually, the burden of likelihood shifts to a reaction to the packed RBCs (not necessarily the albumin) due to some odd and unpredictable factor. This is fairly unusual, but it can and does happen. A viral cause is also possible, but less likely. \"Idiopathic\" simply means \"no known cause can be determined.\" This may wind up being the diagnosis of record, but hopefully someone will retrace the history of the packed cells if possible, just to be sure there wasn't some incompatability that wasn't caught on first screening.   If there should  be a relapse it won't have been the packed RBCs, so the detective work would have to start over, and let's hope that doesn't happen, but in the meantime the things to look for would be signs of anemia (weakness, fatigue, pallor) first and foremost, and if the source of bleeding inside the pericardium remains patent, then also of course signs of a return of pericardial tamponade should be noted and reported at once. That would include frank chest pain (usually of a sharp nature and often affected by position), difficulty breathing, and pleuritic pain upon breathing. If any of these things are noted someone should contact the doctor at once.   I hope this is helpful and that she continues to improve and experiences no further problem of this sort. Best of luck to all there, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

It seems likely she'll be making a full recovery if there are no further events.   The question regarding the infusions of plasma, platelets, vitamin K, etc., is a difficult one to answer without having been in attendance, but since she is doing well I would trust this was intended to offset effects of the prior bleeding and to help avoid any future bleeding events. We must assume this was the prudent approach.   Regarding the central line, depending upon the type and the insertion site, as well as the intended purpose, yes, sometimes a central line may reach into the right atrium of the heart. At other times it rests in the superior vena cava. In either case complications involving the heart are extremely rare. When the line is placed in the right atrium this is usually for purposes of measuring closely capillary wedge pressures with extreme accuracy. If there is a central line still in place, I doubt it would be left in that location, but probably would be backed out or changed to the vena cava. Of course it may have been removed prior to discharge.   I continue to hold good thoughts for her recovery and am sure she will be appreciative of having had such great support and advocacy from you and the rest during this ordeal. My best to you all.\n\n",

Your EKG and echocardiogram have been normal, but you are low on energy and have a non-specific discomfort in your left chest.  While none of this sounds like it is heart-related, it could be caused by a mood disorder (anxiety, depression) or it could be something physical but not related to the heart. I'm wondering why your doctor prescribed the beta blocker. I'm also wondering about the character of the chest discomfort. Perhaps you could describe this in a little more detail, as well as the rationale for the beta blocker,  and this might help me get an idea of what's going on so I could  help point you in the right direction.

    "content": "Hello,   My name is Michelle. I'm a healthy 26 year old female. I have never smoked and I occasionally I drink 1 or 2 glasses of red wine socially.   Earlier this year (January 2008) I was diagnosed with very mild pericarditis due to a viral infection.  Cardiologist put me on steroids. After course of treatment echo showed no more fluid. (he mentioned 2 murmurs and a leaky valve. I have no idea what it means)  It is now August 2008 and my symptoms, pain have not dissapeared. I have been in and out of the hospitals since then with horrible pains with no diagnosis:  1) I feel my heart beat on my left hand and my left foot. It is extremely uncomfortable as I'm feeling this constantly. the sensation is as if I had a bruise and it was beating very hard due to the pain.  2) I have a \"pressure\" on the left side of my chest. Right above my breast and under as well.   3) Pain comes and goes on my left side as well. Feels like a needle is being inserted in me and after about 15 mins it dissapears.  this happens various times during the day.  4) I have developed anxiety due to this ongoing condition. I have palpitations every single day and i'm often very light headed.   5) I have had ekg's, brain scans, x-rays done you name it. everything negative and apparently healthy. I'm very active. I work out every day. After all this started I have slowed down the intensity of my workouts but continue to do them.   I am terrified. Pain is everpresent. I can barely sleep. I feel as if i'm dying every single second. Pain on my left side leaves me so exhausted. I'm constantly tired. All I want to do is sleep. I saw a neurologist and I have a buldging on my neck and a herniated disk on my lower back. I do not know if this has anything to do with any of my symptoms.   Any help whatsoever will be extremely appreciated as dr's now think that i'm nuts.   Thank you and many blessings.   Michelle.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe (with the exception of the forceful pulsing in your left extremities) does sound very much like chronic pericarditis. If this has been ruled out -- if it is certain that there has not been a recurrence of the inflammation with fluid -- then you may have developed a pericardial friction  rub or even an adhesion, wherein a small part of the formerly inflamed pericardial sac becomes \"stuck\" to the heart muscle, causing symptoms without any fluid showing up on x-ray. The adhesion may not even be visible on echocardiogram, so is sometimes difficult to pinpoint. The symptoms would  suggest this,  however.   I have no idea why the pulsing in your left extremities in this case, but it is sometimes caused by a congenital narrowing of the aorta. This would almost certainly have been picked up during your prior care for pericarditis, however, so I'm at a loss to guess what may be causing that. If it's not coarctation of the aorta then it's probably not really significant, but the pain and palpitations suggest there is still  some problem with the pericardium. It is rarely truly dangerous, but can be very uncomfortable, and that at least should be treated.  It's encouraging that you're able (and want to) continue your exercise regimen, and this should also help ease your mind as to your ability to tolerate exercise, as it means your heart is functioning well.   Again, the symptoms suggest possibly a recurrence of pericarditis or perhaps a pericardial adhesion. It's unusual  but not impossible.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I went up a set of steps and my HR was in 160's, and I was SOB for about 30 mins, went to ED about 3 hrs later.       Initial EKG-sinus tach with diffuse ST elevation and PR depression, my sed rate was 85.  Isos, CBC, BMP, and CXR  negative. D Dimer elevated-  CT angio was negative-although much exacerbated my dyspnea- ED attg was worried he would have to intubate me.

Told I had myocarditis-stay in bed, no NSAIDS.  Now 5 weeks later-was still having DOE/CP/sinus tachy into 150's with minimal exertion, and my ESR was back up to 40 (negative autoimmune w/u and TSH ok)- so had a right and left heart cath last week which were negative, ef 65%, and actually was admitted overnight for anesthesia complications. started on Lopressor and Naprosyn.

(No previous problems with tachycardia. Working out a few days before this all happened)                     4) Is the Beta blocker a good choice with the fatigue, or should I simply let the tachycardia go for now as a physiologic problem?                      4) Is there anything else I could/should be doing to improve more rapidly?

    "content": "Dear Doclem, It is good you have the training to consider all kinds of contributive factors to your tachycardia.  I will always hesitate to second guess a first diagnosis - simply because of not being there and having the luxury of seeing the test results for myself, or have the privilege of discussing the clinical picture with your treating physicians. I understand you have already investigated thyroid values, have you also tested for pheochromocytoma? If all the other metabolic conditions that can mimic a cardiologic problem have been ruled out, it does seem possible that your cardiologist may be on track to suggest you may have IST (inappropirate sinus tachycardia).  You fit the profile for age and gender, and describe the symptoms to a T.      At the same time - you mention a family history of AF (atrial fibrillation), and it may be of value to consider a couple other possibilities. I would be interested in knowing if you have a sinus generated tachycardia or a PSVT/PAT. (Paroxysmal supraventricular tachycardia/ paroxysmal atrial tachycardia.)  Has your cardio suggested a Holter monitor?  This way you can record the time of day for different levels of activity, and match it with the corresponding heart rhythm and heart rate.   I do believe EPS studies would also be helpful in determining the true rhythm, since the treatment for similar dysrhythmias such as AVNRT (A-V nodal reentry tachycardia - also a possibility for your gender and age) or WPW (probably less likely for you) is dependent on the cause. If the problem turns out to be IST, then ablation may or may not be the best treatment - since documentation exists that there is the possibility of the IST returning later even if initially apparently resolved by ablation. Some of the other SVTs may be best treated by ablation.  I believe EPS studies would be an appropriate diagnostic tool to help distinguish the root of the tachycardia so that you and your cardiologist can plan a treatment plan.       Beta Blocker therapy is an acceptable drug for IST.  If we consider IST one of the dysautonomias, there are other medical treatment options that may help.  And some studies indicate that sometimes, the problem self resolves.     Unfortunately, since IST sufferers are uniquely sensitive to adrenaline, it would probably be in your best interest to curtail adrenaline producing activities, which in your case includes your work, at least until you have a better idea what is indeed the cause for your tachycardia.  You may wish to research also through your colleagues into the current treatment options in the top cardiac centers of the nation, prior to having any interventional/non reversable treatments done, unless it becomes emergent.\n\n",

At that time I was still having CP/SOB which are now gone after starting naprosyn.  From my research, I cannot find a connection between an apparent viral pericarditis/myocarditis and resultant long-term tachycardia.  It seems unusual to me to have this onset after an acute event.  Most of the IST literature seems to point to a chronic problem without an acute onset.  Would EPS still be appropriate in this setting? Obviously, I'm not interested in any ablation at this time.  I'm also getting off the metoprolol as it has been increasing my fatigue, and also caused hypotension.  Thanks so much and have a great day.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doclem, I agree that it is not typical for IST to be an acute onset. However, the literature identifies an \"average\" patient, aluding to the possiblity of a non-average onset, as well. Therefore, it is theoretically possible for an dysautonomia to fall outside an \"average\" profile.  I still think it best to identify the nature and source of the SVT, especially since you also mentioned P wave abnormalities.  EP studies without intervention planned may still be the best way to identify the \"mis-firing\" culprit, and determine the source of the dysrhythmia. Absolutely! on the Lopressor - if you are experiencing an untoward reaction to the meds, such as hypotension, then stopping it is in your better interest.  I also agree with your choice to weigh other especially non-invasive options before choosing ablation.  Again, you may wish to pick the brains of some of the leading cardiologists in the major teaching hospitals for the latest in diagnostics and treatments. I respect you and your efforts to provide quality medical care for our needful people. I wish you the best in your research,. and trust for an excellent outcome.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello doclem - While I think Marceline has covered most of your concerns remarkably thoroughly and well, I just wanted to append one little thought (coming from the critical care end of my experience), which is this: there is a phenomenon which sometimes occurs as a feature of recovery from AMI, myocarditis, etc., which could be considered \"temporary dysautonomia\": reflex tachycardia. This is compensatory action run amok, and while it usually resolves on its own over time it can be accompanied by (or perhaps even cause) significant fatiguability and an annoying awareness of one's heart beating. It also has, because of the triggering event, an acute onset, then simply doesn't correct as one would expect. This is especially notable in cases of myocarditis, which somewhat mimics the \"stunned myocardium\" phenomenon sometimes seen in AMI and cardiac trauma. Usually treated with beta blockers, although this seems to have worked against the cause in your case (by increasing your feelings of fatigue). I've also seen it treated with digitalis, although that seems to have fallen out of favor because of the potential for more serious side effects.   Hopefully you are soon feeling like yourself again. Do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 28 year old female. I haven't previously had any problems similar to this: On Wednesday evening I suddenly got a pretty sharp pain in my chest, around the heart area. It stays in the front mostly, though sometimes I can feel it a bit lower toward the bottom of the ribcage, and around the side as well.  I was outside at the time, and it was cold, it seemed to hurt more when I was breathing the cold air, and ease when I went inside. Also, it felt worse when I had to walk. The pain has gotten a lot less sharp since then ( it's also been warmer out) - but it is still definitely there. I seem to be able to feel my heart beating more too.  Don't know if this is relevant, but I recently had bronchitis.  Other than this, I don't have any other symptoms.   What are the possibilities and should I seek urgent med. help???  Thank you!\n\n",

A condition for example, pleurisy (inflammation of the tissue of the lungs) may cause varying degrees of chest pain which usually worsen during inspiration. NSAID's typically reduces pain. Providing there are no contraindications to taking this type of medication it should also only be taken with food. .A physician's evaluation would be recommended to identify the causative factor of your symptoms.

    "content": "I posted a question back in May 2004 regarding my 79 year old mother's sudden death from pericarditis.  I have since obtained some additional information that I would like to ask a question about.   The pericardial effusion detected in the autopsy was 100cc (which I thought was not enough to cause tamponade).  However, it has been pointed out to me that:   (1) since the autopsy was done 3 days after her death, all of the pericardial effusion that was there at the time of death may not have been visible by the time the autopsy was actually done, and (2) that since my mother had a markedly enlarged heart as evidenced on the chest x-ray she had taken the day before her death,  then a 100cc pericardial effusion could have caused tamponade in her case whereas in a person with a normal size heart,  100cc would not be enough to cause it.   Is it possible in her particular case that she did indeed develop pericardial tamponade?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Hackettsue,  I read your previous posts and agree with Dr. Fouad. All heart diseases can lead to sudden cardiac death. Basically, the heart abruptly stops beating due to arrhythmia. The most common causes are coronary heart disease (80-90%) and cardiomyopathies. Unfortunately, sudden death is often the first sign of cardiomyopathy. Current studies demonstrate that sudden cardiac death due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is more frequent in older patients than supposed. Such patients may have previously diagnosed heart conditions or not; a common associated disease is hypertension.  Concerning your doubts about the necropsy report, on your first question, the pericardium normally contains 15 to 50cc of fluid. Upon death, enzymes initiate cell decomposition, and 48 hrs later tissues begin to turn into liquids. Also, when the heart stops pumping, fluid builds up in other parts of the body. Although it might be possible that all the effusion may not have been visible (depends on preservation, death cause, etc.), it\u2019s more likely to find extra fluid inside body compartments than fewer with the course of time.  On your second question, the quantity of pericardial fluid needed to cause a   cardiac tamponade depends on how fast fluid builds up and on the pericardium compliancy. When accumulation is fast, 150cc could be enough, but it should raise pressure quickly. Non-traumatic situations in which fatal cardiac tamponed might occur by this means is uncommon, and usually are preceded by severe symptoms. Also, when ventricular hypertrophy is present, ventricle is harder to be shrunken by pericardial fluid. In sum, a cardiac tamponade is possible, but rare. Once more I have to agree with Dr. Fouad, I think that the effusion occurred after the heart stopped.  Hope you find this information useful.  Sincerely,  Dr. Alberto de la Guerra.\n\n",

    "content": "The term you're looking for is \"pericardiectomy.\" Basically, the sac that is around your father's heart has constricted for some reason, and this means that the heart has less room to beat in. This can cause blood to back up behind the heart, and thus can cause heart failure. The term refers to the partial, or full, removal of that sac.  The procedure is done in one of two ways. An opening will be made either through the sternum (breastbone), which is called a sternotomy, or made through the ribs on the left side, which is called a thoracotomy. The surgeon decides which appraoch is required based on anatomy and the area that he needs to access to operate. Sometimes a heart-lung bypass machine is needed during the open-sternum procedure. This is on a case by case basis, and is dependent on different factors.  After surgery, the surgeon will have a few minutes to speak to you about how things went, and this will be an opportunity to ask questions. Your father will more than likely be in an ICU immediately following surgery. The nurses will be a major source of information for you as well.  I want to mention that, while you won't be able to stop yourself from worrying, your father is going to need your assistance in the days and weeks following surgery, and it does no good if you're exhausted and run down from eating poorly and not resting. So take care of yourself!   Good luck, and if you have any further questions, please feel free to post again.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a very large effusion. I first had to have it drained, almost a liter of fluid removed.  It came back just as bad within a month, so next they put in a window.  They ran tests on the fluid and the piece they removed for the window, but could not determine a cause of the fluid except for inflamation.  The window closed in about six weeks, and the fluid built back up quickly.  I was weak and out of breath.  I had read about a small study done in Isr.  using colchicine and I begged my doctor to try it before he removed the bottom of the sack around my heart.  He did not want to \"bother\" with it, but the doctor that was to do the surgery agreed to try it and said he had read about it too.  Within a week I felt better.  I changed heart doctors and my new doctor agreed to keep me on colchicine even though he  had not treated any effusions with it.  I have not had any bad side effects and I feel like I've been given my life back!  Over the last 7 or 8 months the effusion has gone from large to med. to small!  I am a single parent with a child with health problems, and I was terrified of loosing more work, and even my job.  Colchicine has been a true blessing for me.  Even if I eventually have to have the major surgery, and have the bottom of the sack removed, this has given me time to start catching up on bills, and take care of my daughter.\n\n",

What investigations, if any, were done to search for the cause of the effusion? What initiated the work-up that lead to the diagnosis of the effusion?  Pericardiocentesis is a considered a minor procedure, you can be out of the hospital the same day or the next day at the most if every thing goes well.  The main serious complication of pericardial effusion is cardiac tamponade which is related to the rate of accumulation of the fluid rather that its amount. In cardiac tamponade, the heart is squeezed by the fluid and it can not function as a pump anymore. It can avoided and/or treated by a procedure called pericardial window where the pericardium (the sac surrounding the heart and that contains the fluid that can compress the heart is opened and connected to either the sac surrounding the lung or to the abdominal cavity.  The cause behind the effusion should be found if not already found.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear Dick,   The probability that this might happen again depends on its cause. Sending the fluid to be tested is a routine procedure. The results should not take that long.   i think that your doctor will do a follow up echocardiography in a period of time to make sure that there is no recurrence. On recurrence, i think that a pericaridial biopsy could be done.  If this happens once more, treatment then will be in the form of a procedure called a pericardial window where a connection between the pericardium and the sac surrounding the lung called pleura or somtimes with the abdominal cavity is created so that the fluid collects in the bigger sac whether around the lung or in the abdomen and does not compress the heart as previously discussed.

Again pleural effusions of more than 150-200 mL usually are apparent as blunting of the costophrenic angle on upright posteroanterior (PA) chest radiographs. So there is a chance that both the pericardial and pleural effusion get missed by the x-rays. Again the effusion may have happened only after the heart stopped due to congestive heart failure.  The main thing for you to do now, is to get back to your doctor and make sure you do not have hypertrophic cardiomyopathy yourself (If you read the article above you will find that 50% of cases are inherited via autosomal dominant trait).  This can easily be diagnosed in your case by echocardiogram.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Fouad, Thank-you very much for your reply and your concern.  I did get an echocardiogram recently and thankfully, it did not show any signs of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy.   Regarding my mother, it appears that you are saying that the arrhythmia she had which caused her death came more from her longstanding cardiomyopathy rather than the pericarditis.  From all that I have read, this is very likely the case.  I wonder though, why it happened exactly when she was sick with bronchitis/pericarditis?  Is there a connection there? Also, I'm still confused as to how the bronchitis became pericarditis?   Again, thanks much for any answers you may have.   Susan Hackett\n\n",

    "content": "Susan, The bronchitis probably has nothing to do with it. It was concidental. The main reason for her death was probably a fatal arrhythmia. Whether her fever, cough, or nutritional status during the bronchitis attack contributed to the arrhythmia would only be speculation. In theory they all could but alone none of them would lead to much without her cardiomyopathy. Her pericarditis was either present for a very long time and missed by the x-ray or it was the result of her sudden death. I don't think it was related to her bronchitis attack.\n\n",

At any rate, alcohol is very well known to cause heart muscle damage and heart failure, but, to my knowledge, i never heard of any relationship between alcohol and pericarditis.  It is a good thing of course to try and convince your husband to quit drinking because alcohol has its very well known health risks affecting the liver, stomach, nerves, brain, heart and many other organs.

    "content": "Dear Pam,  Pneumopericardium is a rare condition and it is usually caused by leakage of air from lung and this air collects around the heart. It could be caused by very high pressures in the lung caused by ventilator leading to rupture of some of his tiny air sacs in the lungs.  Since pneumopericardium occured in the context of such a clinical situation i would assume that this was the cause and since your son has never had any problems afterwards, recurrence sounds very rare to me.

    "content": "I am specialist for pulmonary diseases in Bosnia Herzegovina. Five weeks ago I have had heart operation with three bypass with no previous MI. I felt very well after the operation. Four days after I got high temperature (max.37.8) and felt bad in general. Doctors thought that I got postpericardiectomy syndrome and gave me indomethacine (3 times 25mg per day). X-ray showed smaller hydrothorax on my lungs and bigger cardiac shadow.  Ten days after hydropericardium 300 ccm was seen. The doctors increased indomethacin doses on 4 times 50 mg per day, but higher temperature (37.2) kept going.  One week after this I started to take prednisolone 40mg daily and stopped to take indomethacin. Concerning that the temperature did not decrease I took prednizolon 60mg for one week and felt much better. That doses changed to 55mg in the following seven days. On the fifth day of this therapy I got tachycardia 150 which is atrium tachicardia with block 2:1. Due to this problem I was given medicine amiodaron and beta-blocker. Cardiologist thought that tachicardia was caused by prednizolon and interrupted to give me prednizolon in two days. Instead indomethacin was given to me again (3 times 25mg). Three days after my temperature increased to 37.9.  Could you please suggest on what the best treatment for my disease would be?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pericardiectomy",
    "content": "Dear Dr. Agic,   Sorry for being late and thank you very much for choosing our web site.   What you are suffering from might be known as postpericardiotomy syndrome.   This is a syndrome of chest pain, fever, pleurisy, pericardial rub, evidence of pleural effusion or pericardial effusion, leukocytosis and high ESR.   It is thought to be auto-immune in nature as anti-heart antibodies are found in some patients.   Mangement of this syndrome is mostly conservative by giving aspirin or NSAIDs, this must be continued for ten days. Steroids are reserved to patients whom their symptoms do not respond to treatment. In addition to this, large pericardial or pleural effusions should be drained if not responsive to treatment with steroids. Unfortunately, this disease can recur. Complications of this disease include adhesions and may be constriction.   Regarding your case and the tachycardia that occured to you, I would favour that this caused by pericarditis itself and it is very common after surgery.  How to treat it ? The drug regimen that you received is reasonable. I do not know whether you have hypertension or not but a beta blocker or a calcium channel blocker in case of hypertension and arrhythmia are very good choices. Amiodarone is a broad spectrum antiarrhythmic that can be used in many types of arrhythmia. How long would you stay on the medications is a debatable issue between physicians and some favour for life and some favour temporarily.   I hope that i answered your questions and please feel free to post any further concerns.   Once more thank you very much for your vote of confidence and good luck.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
