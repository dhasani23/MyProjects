    "content": "Hi,  I take BP medication. I've checked and rechecked over the last four months, on different measurement devices, and there is a full 30 point difference between my right and left arms. It is the right side that is higher. Each night, my wife sleeps on my right shoulder, with the full right side of her body on top of the right side of my body, and her leg resting on my leg. Could this have something to do with the difference? Or is this a sign of some underlying cardio problem?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for this interesting post. The very 'intimate' sleeping posture that you have described in such detail is(to the best of my knowledge) not in any way 'intimately' related to differences in blood pressure (BP) between the arms- at worst, a sustained posture like that may put one(the supine one) at risk of a neuropraxia, an episode of rhabdomyolysis, a subclavian vein thrombosis or a deep vein thrombosis (DVT).  Minor differences of <10 mm of mercury(Hg) occurs quite frequently in the general population. Inconsistent elevations of > 10 mm of Hg are frequent in normotensive individuals and probably do not per se indicate any abnormality. Studies indicate that persons who have peripheral arterial occlusive disease are more likely to have sustained differences of >20 mm of Hg between the two arms. It has also been noted that the right arm is marginally more likely to have the higher pressure between the two.  References: Pesola GR, Pesola HR, Nelson MJ, Westfal RE. (2001 Jan), \"The normal difference in bilateral indirect blood pressure recordings in normotensive individuals\". Am J Emerg Med;19(1):43-5.  Rajiv Agarwal; Zerihun Bunaye; Dagim M. Bekele (2008). \"Prognostic Significance of Between-Arm Blood Pressure Differences\", Hypertension ;51:657-662   Atherosclerotic narrowing of the proximal left subclavian artery is a rare condition (atherosclerotic involvement of the upper limb arteries is much less compared to the lower limb vessels). This can result in a condition known as the \"subclavian steal syndrome\" - charecterized by neurological symptoms due to cerebral ischemia(of the posterior circulation)that are precipitated  by ipsilateral arm exercise.In this condition, significant BP differences between the arms occurs.  As the pressure difference according to you is consistently about 30 mm of Hg, you need to consult your regular doctor first and get investigated. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I'm 16 years old. I'm very athletic, i box, do physical fitness, cross country, and track. I went to the doctor's office Monday October 12, 2009. The doctor checked my blood pressure and it read 147/85. I was shocked and very fearful. My doctor was confused I'm a pretty healthy guy so she said maybe its just a bad day. I checked it again once i got home that night and it read 153/91. That night i couldn't sleep, i had a huge head ache. I went to school and played a little volley ball, but had to stop because my chest was pounding. I got home that day to check that it was 153/89. I took a nap hoping things will get better. My foster father gave me a tea made of ginger, nutmeg, natural cinnamon, lemon, and natural bee honey.  I ate very small and took my blood pressure again and it read 143/85. I started to worry. This morning i wake up, I make  2 boiled eggs no salt, bread without butter and a garlic clove. I drank some more of the tea and took my blood pressure once again. It read this morning 150/90. I came home and it read 147/90. My aunt tells me it maybe be stress. My foster parents say it could be hormones. I know i have a family history of Hypertension but I never guessed i could get it. Is there something you recommend? Do you know what it can be? Will it go down? Can i play any sports?\n\n",

    "content": "Assuming no recreational drugs, no high potency energy drinks, and having eliminated both caffeine and salt, you very likely have either essential hypertension (fairly unlikely at your age but not impossible) or pheochromocytoma, a relatively rare but very well-known adrenal tumor (usually benign and not always located on the adrenals but sometimes occurring in random parts of the viscera) that secretes its own adrenaline in concert with the native adrenal glands. This is often the missing puzzle piece in young, otherwise healthy, physically fit people with high blood pressure. It should be emphasized that while you do appear to have some form of hypertension, and this is not a desireble thing, your numbers are not horribly high yet, and this may not have been going on for too terribly long. For those reasons I suspect the symptoms you've been feeling may be more anxiety-related than a product of the elevated BP, and if this is so it will only keep the BP elevated or help it to increase.  Try to relax. It's not as bad as it could be. It does definitely need to be sorted out and treated, of course, but it's not in crisis mode quite yet. If you do feel pains or other odd symptoms (and some people do, headaches in particular) then take it easy at those times. See an MD ASAP, and one thing you'll need is a 24 hour urine test, which often will reveal excess adrenaline in the urine and point toward pheochromocytoma, which seems the most likely culprit, although it is sometimes difficult to diagnose right off. Keep at it, and meanwhile you may need to rely on medication to get the BP down to a tolerable level. That's actually the first oder of business, then getting to the bottom of this. Hopefully it won't be too difficult to figure out.   Good luck to you, and please do follow up with us here as needed. Keep us updated as to any changes, also.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Ash27,  Regular chest pain is not generally considered to be a normal occurrence.  If it continues, ask your doctor to evaluate it further, if testing has not been done, such as an electrocardiogram and echocardiogram.  You can also consider obtaining a second opinion.  Such pain can be aggravated by a hectic work schedule and/or by anxiety over both the symptoms and work performance.  If the cardiac evaluation is negative, consider seeing a therapist for psychological evaluation and assessment of your anxiety. It can be very helpful to you and to your doctor if you keep a detailed record of your symptoms, including what the symptom is, when it starts, how long it lasts, what you were doing when it started, what seems to help or make it worse, and any other data that you feel is significant.  Keep the record daily, and take it with you to all medical appointments.  If your blood pressure is elevated despite the propanolol, make sure that is included in your symptom record, and report it to your doctor.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 19 years old, had hypertension since age 14. Over this last few years, started feeling extremely hot in my face/chest/hands. My blood pressure is normally under control, but it still will randomly shoot up around 150/95. Still everything was tolerable till this last year, just started feeling like my blood in my face/chest/arms were on fire, like boiling. Happens almost everyday now, even when I'm doing nothing and calm. No one could tell me what was wrong, until my last few blood tests. Found out I have a low testosterone deficiency, doctor wanted me to go on treatment asap until he found out I didn't have insurance. Forgot what my levels were at. So now I'm going to this free health clinic tomorrow. I'm now at the point where it's almost impossible for me to go out and not feel the boiling sensation, also started to get these types of anxiety attacks, when I get nervous and jittery, hands start shaking a bit, and extreme migraines......I'm seriously getting tired of it and depressed.    Basically my mother is on disability and they took care of me insurance wise till the age of 18, then you get cut off. I'm currently taking 20mg of enalapril twice a day. Which were actually paying for at the moment, I'm gonna talk to the clinic about generic brands and such. Also before my insurance ran out, they checked to see if it was hyperthyroidism, which it was negative. Test was about a year and a half ago.   Health wise- grew up with a weak immune system, got sick a lot, was very active in sports till my body started overheating, now I rarely do much. I weigh 230 pounds currently.   Current Health status: Anyways I'm burning up everyday, have to stay in cool environment, or I'll start overheating instantly. Blood pressure is constantly going up and down, low testosterone deficiency,nervous/jittery/very stressed. Been very tired and lately my mind has been blank. Like when you randomly just start staring off into space. Picture that except it happens all the time now.....and the migraines. So I feel like I'm wearing down into a rock pretty much. Any info on my current situation would be great?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Classic triad of hypertension,headaches,and palpitations should make one think of pheochromocytomas.This looks a big name, but then most of these are benign.Quite rare in hypertensions but all the same need to be ruled out since these chemicals like adrenaline and noradrenaline  released from the adrenals may cause very unplesant burning sensation. Urinary estimation of catecholamines is necessary and if two times more than normal need an imaging study. Most cases may need hypertension control.Surgery is the treatment for pheochromocytoma. In your case it may just be anxiety which causes these symptoms.This condition is being mentioned just to make sure this is not missed out. Do check with your doctor.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  First of all, I would like to thank you for your medical opinion/advice.  I'm a 24 year old very active/healthy male with isolated systolic hypertension.  High blood pressure runs in my family.  I'm currently taking 7.5mg Enalapril in the morning and 25mg Atenolol in the evening.  My daily blood pressure averages 135/55.  My concern is sometimes my diastolic pressure can get as low as 40!  When it is this low my blood pressure is usually say 125/40.    Both my General Practitioner and Cardiologist seem to think this is not of any concern, as long as there are no precipitating symptoms.  I do not have any symptoms from the low diastolic pressure.  Obviously having my blood pressure under control is the objective here, however do you think my medication needs to be adjusted to increase my diastolic pressure?  Should I be concerned / is there any significance of me having low diastolic blood pressure?  FYI - I'm a very avid runner / weightlifter.  Thank you,  -Mike\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,You have posed a very interesting question.Your doctor and cardiologist were right in reassuring you since you are young and no medical conditions you need not worry. In the elderly therere is reason to keep the diastolic higher while controlling the systolic hypertension.Due to stiffening if the aorta and atherosclerosis,there risk perdictor, is the wide pulse pressure. ie increased systolic and lowered or normal diastolic.The diastolic mainly drives the coronary flow and the systolic,the predictive factor in stroke,congestive cardiac failure and increased left ventricular mass. Thus in coronary heart disease and in elderly with systolic hypertension there is reason to reduce the systolic BP without compromising the diastolic.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 45 yrs old, 5'4\", 155 lbs - my BP has always been normal until lately.  I've been keeping a log and my diastolic pressure ranges from 92-110 in the evening only, during the day it is generally 88-92.  My systolic varies from 118/148 so that doesn't seem to be an issue.  Today I had a stress test and echo - both seemed to have gone well.  My Bp while in the office was normal ranging from 118/78 to 135/88.  Normally a person would be stressed while at the dr's...not me for some reason my BP was great.    I shared my daily results with the cardio who pretty much brushed them off - said something must be wrong with them.  I have used 3 different monitors over the course of the last month, to be sure, and even had others take it for me.  I just took it now and it was 148/98.    It really seems that in the evening it is high - while I am resting, watching TV, hanging with my cats.  My cardio seems to think that I'm imagining it, or that my monitors aren't correct (not likely as I mentioned before I've used different ones to make sure).    Where should I look next for help?  Are there any known reasons for diastolic BP to spike in the evening or while at rest?  I appreciate your help - I'm frustrated by my doctors reaction (or non reaction) and his unwillingness to try any medications with me.  I can't imagine that a low level medication to start would do any harm.  Thank you in advance for your time -   Laurie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High Diastolic Pressure While Resting?",
    "content": "Hi Laurie -- That's certainly an unsual presentation you describe, mainly because it's in the evening that it seems to peak, while most people with elevated BP have it highest in the AM. Still, since you've checked it with multiple devices, it's probably pretty accurate. Some of those numbers are high enough to warrant a second look at least. However, there are some things that could contribute to this peculiar issue. For instance, caffeine in what you drink with dinner could be contributory; any sort of stimulant could cause this. Anxiety could also cause it and for some anxious people quiet time is actually when things start to get tense. I notice Lexapro among your routine meds, which of course could be intended for anxiety as well as depression and even other things. Then again, in a few people SSRI meds like Lexapro can result in a situation called seratonin syndrome, of which one feature can be elevated blood pressure. Usually there would be other noticeable changes as well, including agitation, nausea, quite a few potential symptoms. If this were the case (and given elevated evening BP being the only one mentioned it seems unlikely) this could be serious and would require stopping the medication. It doesn't seem to be the case.  While your BP elevation doesn't seem to be extreme, there is enough there to warrant at least a look at your log. If your doctor won't do this or feels it isn't relevant you may need to take this to someone else, a GP or internist for instance. It may not be indicative of a serious problem, but it certainly shouldn't be blown off. Even the fact that you keep company with cats (which is known to lower the blood pressure in many people for reasons not entirely clear) doesn't seem to offset this odd uptick.   Have you tried checking the BP just before going to bed? If it is a very transient thing it may be of no importance. We all do have fairly significant BP ups and downs during the course of a day, but you've found a distinct (and again, rather odd) period of the day when it gets up into the Pay Attention zone. The fact it's behaved well in the doctor's office doesn't help, and it can be difficult to get a doctor to listen to one's personal observations. He may be right about it, but he also may not. If a doctor would at least take a moment to look at your numbers and give you a rationale for why this happens,that would be progress. Otherwise, yes, some low-dose medication might be worthwhile. It's a difficult call when it's a part-time condition, but it's also interesting and if a medical person were to take your BP during the evening that person would likely suggest you follow up with your doctor.   While I'm not overly concerned for your welfare right now, I am concerned for your relationship with your cardiologist, since this is something which sits on that fine line between benign neglect and just plain neglect. Unfortunately you've already brought it up and haven't gotten a satisfactory response, so assertiveness may only cause strained relations. I'd consider just bringing this to the attention of a generalist. You may get more direct attention that way.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Some  people, statistically more women than men, have a problem  with facial (and  sometimes  upper chest) flushing for no apparent reason. The autonomic nervous system is the culprit in this, as it acts inappropriately for unknown  reasons. The good news (for you, anyway) is that  some people have a lot more funny business happen because of this same malfunction, if that's any comfort. Spontaneous flushing is difficult  to control, and it makes some people uncomfortable in social situations, but it has no other medical significance.    Hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "This is actually my field of expertise.......I am a male who developed Autonomic Dysfunction 9 years ago following a drug overdose, since that day due to rare neurological damage Ive been constantly overheating particularly on my face where its the worst......  Now I'm not syaing you have the same thing as I do but I do bow what it feels like to be overheated, flushed, feverish with a hot face, it is a very annoying, unsettling and uncomfortable symptom, feeling hot makes one very irratable as I can tell you from first hand experience.....  Out of curiosity how long have you had this for ? Is it maybe associated with a recent illness or fever, does your face actully look red or flushed when you overheat and when you take your temperature does it show an increase ? ......  I can't say why you have one of the same symtoms I've been living with everyday for so many years but I can tell you a wonderous remedy that I use.....I have put together a small plastic bottle with a pump spray nozzle filled with water which I always carry with me everywhere and whenever I get hot I give my face a nice spray and I can tell you there is nothing as refereshing and amazing as the cooling relief you get when your feeling hot in the face.\n\n",

Usually since last one year, it remains in the range of 80-100 bpm.   I have done ECG and Treadmill Stress Test. Every thing is normal. All Blood Tests are normal. No Cholestrol and Blood Sugar issues.  My doctor says I suffer from too much anxiety and this is causing the elavated levels of Blood Pressure and Heart Rates.  I am more worried on my Heart Rate front. As soon as I walk of do some physical activity, my hear rate shoots up too much.  Till last year, I was taking a beta blocker along with my BP medicine, however doctor discontinued that since my Blood Pressure and Pulse rate were coming low.  Please suggest if there is any need for worry doe to elavated levels of Heart Rate.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Your elevated heart rate isn't especially surprising given your obesity, and is still within normal limits, although higher than you're probably used to since you'd been on a beta blocker before. Your blood pressure is adequately controlled, it would seem, and heart rate is not a big consideration so long as it doesn't get into the significantly tachycardic range at rest. It's bound to get faster during exertion, especially with your BMI.   It sounds to me as though you're perhaps a little anxious, which is understandable, but with the BP under control the next clear step is to work on weight reduction, which may well resolve the BP problem as well as allow your heart to slow its resting rate.   I hope this helps. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- While most of your symptoms definitely sound gastrointestinal in nature -- and did respond to Zantac -- there seems to be something more going on here and of course there's no law that says you can't have two things going on at once. You may well have gastritis or some other hyperacidity problem or even a bacterially caused stomach ulcer. This still doesn't explain the delay of periods, which can of course be caused by many things. You should have a comprehensive workup by an internist, or perhaps separate exams by both a gastroenterologist (to hunt out stomach problems) and a visit to a gynecologist as well to rule out possible female issues which could be overlapping or even mimicking stomach-related problems. It's difficult to say at a distance, and especially when there may be more than one thing going on in the same general neighborhood (your abdomen).  Please arrange for the proper referrals to rule things in or out and follow up with us here. Good luck to you, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear medical crew,  I\u2019ve recently found that my systolic pressure runs out of the normal range. Despite the fact that sometimes I still can detect it in the mid to upper 120s (usually late evenings), most of the time it stays in the range 130-138. Surprisingly, the diastolic readings are quite normal in the range 70-78. I forgot to mention that I\u2019m only 30 and would not be pleased to consider starting the BP medicines. Another strange fact is that when I put the cuff on my arm my heart rate increases rapidly \u2013 sometimes reaching the values of 120-125 per minute, while it normally stays in the range 68-78. Would my condition be caused by the so called \u201cwhite coat syndrome\u201d, generally assuming some kind of anxiety, when I take the readings myself? Would this increased heart rate influence only my systolic pressure?  I would be very thankful to receive your competent medical opinion!  Thank you in advance!   P.S. I\u2019m slightly overweight with BMI of 25.5, but otherwise have a pretty healthy diet on low sodium and fats.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 25yr old female. (highlighted any info that may need to go back to)  I have been having fainting attacks since september 07.  I first had a faint at work in sep 07 where paramedics were called and I was took to hospital as I was unconcious for around 15mins and later discharged that day. I then a following 7 faints within 2 months I was given an appointment with a neurologist who did an EEG which came back normal and then referred me to a cardiologist at my local hospital who did an ECG and TILT TABLE TEST which both came back normal.   In March 08 I was admitted into hospital for a week where I had two attacks which were witnessed by nurses on the ward (ECG's were done but were normal) I also had an MRI which was apparently normal but has since gone missing from my file! In the following few months whilst waiting further appointments my fainting increased to around 5 a week. Every time I went to the local hospital and got sent home, the reason being that I was already seeing specialists so did not need anything further.  My Partner and Mum took me to my local A and E department in July 08 as on this particular day every time i tried to move I passed out. The doctor I seen in A and E admitted me into hospital where I was monitored and had a second tilt table test where I had tachycardia and an AV Block for 8.4secs. I was wired up to an EEG aswell and that was normal although the doctor said I had rolling of the eyes and twitching of the fingers! I was put on disopyramide which I tried for 3 months and it was making my condition worse. After this result I was referred to The national neurology and nuerosurgery hospital in london and was eventually admitted there in February 09 where they carried out a number of autonomic tests. I went on the tilt table 3 times there each time having a faint quite quickly. This included a meal test where I fainted both times.  I was put on fleudrocortisone 5mg x twice daily. (I had no AV Blocks throughout these tests)  The specialists there advised my cardiologist at a different hospital I had vasovagal syncope.   Since then the cardiologists have increased me medicine plus put me onto midodrine at the highest dose and I have been on this for the last 6months with no improvement. And all the time my fainting episodes have got more frequent.  I faint on average around 1 a day sometimes this can be 5 times a day and then I won't have one for 3/4 days but I never go more than a week without a faint.  Alongside this since August 08 I have been having seizure like symptons with my condition i.e; jerking of the limbs, biting of the tongue, incontinence and absenses. These were diagnosed in London hospital as non- epileptic seizures. And they are classing them as seperate to my vasovagal attacks. (i'm not sure if this is correct as I mentioned earlier The doctor witnessed seizure like symptons with my second tilt table test.  As my condition has gone on I also now get very confused, since august 09 I am in a what I would call a drunk state most days. I feel drunk I slur my words and feel very dizzy on and off through out the day most days.   My blood pressure is on average 100/60 and when I have an episode has been recorded as low as 40/20.  I have come to the doctors lounge as today as each time I go to the specialists each of them tell me we will wait to see what the other says and I am so frustrated and upset it is unbelieveable. They just keep telling me to stay on this medication and do the lifestyle things like drink more water get out of bed slowly which I have been doing and which don't work at all as I can have faints whilst sitting also.  I have had to stop working (I am at risk of loosing my job) I have to be with someone 24hrs a day( after faints I sometimes get confused and have worked out of my apartment in the middle of the night) I am constantly hurting myself(Have lots of scars on my face from bumps and scrapes) I now have to use a wheelchair regularly as I faint so often. As I am now loosing bladder control regularly I have lost alot of confidence.  This condition has completely turned my life upside down. I need to know if there are further tests that need to be carried out or if I can try new medicine other than the 3 mentioned that I have tried above.   I will list below my symptons in brief and please ask questions if you need further information.  FAINTING (sometimes a warning of blackness in front of my eyes and sometimes my sound goes muffled.sometimes I don't remember if there was a warning or not) DIZZINESS (room starts to spin and I need to lay down asap) INCONTINENCE (no warning but usually have an absence like attack where I just stop still in whatever I am doing and then wet myself)  Is there any thing else this could be which has not yet been tested?  Please help  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: vasovagal syncope attacks (fainting)",
    "content": "Hello -- First off, I don't think this is simple vasovagal syncope. It is happening far too often, apparently without any sort of trigger, and there are other, more remarkable features which appear to be getting overlooked. For instance, your lowest measured blood pressure (40/20) is virtually nil. Even if this was a false reading chances are that's because it was too low to support consciousness. EKGs have been done but apparently not studied closely, as I strongly suspect something more would show up. Even the fact there was some sort of block is significant, although these can be acquired and transient. Since your problem continues to get worse I don't think they actually are transient, but may be intermittent. This could be due to a neurological problem, and you could even be having seizures, but whether they are primary or secondary isn't at all clear (anoxic seizures -- due to lack of oxygen to the brain) often occur during very slowed heart rates or long pauses in beating due to blocks. On the other hand, some neurological disorders (certain sorts of dysautonomia such a neurocardiological syncope or disease of the sinus of Valsalva) can also cause this sort of thing. I wish I could see a copy of one of your \"normal\" EKGs, because there could be a clue hidden in there that's being missed.   I believe several things should be done. First, an event monitor should be carried for at least 30 days, during which these events can be caught and recorded so doctors know exactly what the heart's role is in this. Second, a thorough neurological workup is in order. You describe vertigo, which is not the same as the dizziness of presyncope, but is often symptomatic of some neurological problem.   It's impossible to say with any certainty at a distance, but I really don't think this is simply vasovagal syncope. That's too easy given the extent of your events. The possibility of a neurological basis needs to be ruled out, but so do other things like long QT syndrome (this needs a close look) and transient 3rd degree junctional block as well. Something here just does not add up.   I would aggressively pursue both an event recorder and a neurological consult. Sometimes one pushes the case one way or the other. I realize with the system you have to deal with it can be difficult to get quick and precise attention, but this is exactly what the practice of medicine is for: To make sick people well. I'd be adamant in my demands for an appropriate diagnosis and treatment. What you're having to endure is simply not acceptable, at least not with the overly simplified diagnosis you've been given.   Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated also as to your progress or anything new you may learn. Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so very much for your reply John and the information you have given me.  I real feel nobody is trying to help. Your the first person who seems concerned by my condition. Each appointment I have lasts around half an hour at the most and I can never express the extent of my condition and how it is stopping me living a normal life although I do tell them.  I want to bring to your attention that I have had an EEG on for about 6 days if I remember correctly and also an ECG for around 3days and I did have episodes whilst they were fitted. If I could get hold of my EEG and ECG results would you be happy to look at them for me if I could scan and email them to you?  I also forgot mention in my original post that with reference to the non epileptic seizures they advised my doctor to refer me for CBT Cognitive behavioral therapy, which I went to with an open mind but when I discussed my symptoms they were not sure as to how this was going to work for me . Also they said you can not control your feelings if you are unconcious and suggested that I should talk to doctors again to discuss this.  I had an outpatient appointment on the 17th of November in London neurology hospital where I seen the nurse from my doctors team who as I sat down I was asked how I am and then again when I said no better I was told about lifestyle changes again.  I then advised them that medication does not seem to be working and my faints are more frequent and I was told that I would need CBT she did not seem to realise that I had already been referred for this 6 months ago. I then advised her of the outcome of my CBT appointment and the nurse said that I would need to see there CBT team and go in as an outpatient. When I asked for them to explain more in detail why I would be having it she advised me that I have vasovagal Syncope but the CBT is for the seizure like symptons which they feel are psychological and although I don't make them happen my brain does in basic words. I was told by the nurse that out of the 4 tilt table tests I had done at London hospital only one was vasovagal and this is why they feel the rest is psychological. She said they know I faint and the nurses on the wards when I have been in hospital have witnessed this aswell as the tilt table test showing I did but lots of my faints are my brain without me trying to make it shutting off!!!  The next day on the 18th I seen the doctor who originally sent me for CBT she had spoke to the nurse before my appointment and was sorry that my CBT did not work out locally but advised me that the next way forward is to have it done there as an inpatient.  I then Questioned my tilt table test results as I was not aware than only one faint was vasovagal she printed my letters for me which shown a report to my doctor with regards to my tests and after reading them it says that out of four, three of them were vasovagal and the other one says neither or. I am so frustrated could this really be a psychological condition or do they seem to be fobbing me off ? I would really like your views onthis. The doctor I seen on this day said my case is very complex and then said it would be alot simpler if my tests did not show vasovagal syncope as we could then just concentrate on the CBT. But I don't understand why this would be simpler... for them? or me? I am in process of writing a complaint to the hospital I want to know why nobody is looking into this further.  I have an appointment with a new specialist on the 15th of December but I am worried that he will not look into my case himself with an open mind but will be influenced by my most recent letter from the doctor I seen on the 18th which says diagnosis  1. vasovagal syncope 2.non epileptic seizures 3. non vasovagal syncope. And throughout the letter I feel she is concentrating on the whole psychological thing which is confusing as When I was put on my tablets in Feb they were concentrating on the vasovagal syncope. It seems now they are not working they have only CBT as an answer.  I live for my appointments but they are so disheartening  Please come back to me with your views.  Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: vasovagal syncope attacks (fainting)",
    "content": "The plot thickens. First, the nurse who told you, verbally, only one of the four tilt table tests revealed a vasovagal response was very likely mistaken, since the written report is dictated by the doctor reviewing the results. Therefore it would seem you had 3 out of 4 tests positive for vasovagal syncope, a pretty convincing number.  The problem here really is complex, but only because it is difficult to sort out a differential diagnosis with 2 or 3 possible explanations competing (and possibly co-existing) in one patient. However, this much is clear: You do have vasovagal faints. This could be the cause of non-epileptic seizures in itself. You also could have psychogenic non-epileptic seizures (in which case CBT would be appropriate). In either case, what needs to be clarified is the mind-body connection and the fact that whether or not your brain initiates these seizures it is involved in their happening once they get started. While your brain may not have a lesion causing this, your brain is involved and psychogenic seizures are not imaginary nor are they caused solely by emotional disorder, because without the body being involved in a mind-body connection there could be no \"playing field.\" For instance, if a person deliberately (or even unknowingly) hyperventilates, he or she may actually wind up fainting or having a seizure. This is something some people (usually the young and bored) try for \"kicks.\" It doesn't matter the resulting faint of seizure is deliberately induced and there is no brain lesion involved; the resulting even is real, and the brain is involved during the event. No one should be telling you this is \"all in your head\" even if it's not being found literally in your head. Once it's a seizure it's a seizure. It may not be resolved by attacking it at the brain level because that's not where the trigger lies. Still, the brain becomes temporarily involved.   What your were told about not being able to control your thoughts while unconscious really made little sense and sounded like either a gross misunderstanding of the problem or perhaps a cop out. You don't need to control your thoughts while unconscious: The goal is to not become unconscious because of your thoughts. The person who said that doesn't have a fine enough grasp of the complexity and yet the simplicity of this phenomenon. Rather than write extensively here about it I will provide you with a link to a website that may help clarify some of these finer points for you. It also discusses EMDR (eye movement desensitization and reprocessing), a highly specialized therapy which includeds CBT as part of the discipline. Here is the link: http://www.epilepsy.com/articles/ar_1112967056   Hang in there. Hopefully the next appointment will bring you closer to a resolution. The vasovagal part of this still needs to be explored, but may well co-exist with psychogenic non-epileptic seizures. They both may be resolved via one path. I certainly hope this is soon clarified for you and this problem resolved or at least opened up for you a great deal. Please keep us updated as to your progress.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high blood pressure and anti-psychotic meds?",
    "content": "Metaprolol 10 mg is an extremely low dose, and while it's true the imipramine can interact with it, causing an effective increase in the available amount in your bloodstream, the only reason this would be problematic would be because your blood pressure could drop too low. This isn't happening, and it's hardly surprising since that's such a low dose of metaprolol. Your doctor might consider titrating (adjusting) the metaprolol dose upward to a level where it is doing the job it's intended to do, then monitoring your BP for a while to make sure it's okay. This relationship should remain fairly stable at any given dose. He might consider doubling the dose by having you take 10 mg. twice per day (every 12 hours), since plain metaprolol (and 10 mg would be the plain, not long-acting type), is generally a twice-per-day drug anyway, and 10 mg. once per day is hardly going to make a dent in the BP, especially since it's not doing much at all presently. It is safe to take these meds in combination, and the imipramine is probably the most problematic of all of them, not because of the beta blocker interaction, but because of potential side effects which you appear to not be having anyway. Again, the interaction with metaprolol should remain fairly static, so increasing the dose of metaprolol carefully (and at twice per day) should slowly bring the BP within a satisfactory range. Right now it's not even close.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Your blood pressure is being marginally managed, near acceptable levels, but at the price of annoying beta blocker side effects. While you cannot abruptly stop the Toprol you also are not married to it, and there is no special reason a beta blocker has to be the sole agent or even included -- although you cannot discontinue it abruptly. Your doctor could transition you over to a different class of BP med, such as an ACE inhibitor or calcium channel blocker -- or even create a combined regimen that includes a lower dose of Toprol (say 25 mg) with one of the other meds, which could help reduce or eliminate the annoying beta blocker side effects (lethargy, lightheadedness and cold extremities are the most common, and are secondary to the lowered heart rate which, in itself, is not usually a concern).   As for \"alarms\" to watch for, I'm assuming you check your BP routinely at home, so watching for spikes or sustained, progressive increase in BP is a big one. This also can sometimes be announced by unusual headache, but since your BP is being adequately controlled, if marginally, this should not be a problem. The other things elevated BP can help cause are vision problems, heart disease and kidney damage, but these are things generally following long-term, uncontrolled hypertension. You're in pretty good range right now, or close to it, and simply need to find something that agrees with you physically while doing a slightly better job of controlling the high BP.   Hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed and keep us updated as well.\n\n",

There are a number of possibilities which may cause the headache that you have; \"temporal arteritis\" may cause tenderness in the scalp.So also,tension headaches may cause tenderness bilaterally.   but... There is no known condition(to the best of my knowledge) wherin the tenderness moves around.  As your Blood pressure seemingly fluctuates 'for no reason', one may need to investigate for causes of secondary hypertension (pheochromocytoma in particular).It is also probable that an increased anxiety level may be contributing to the overall picture.

    "content": "Hi there -- You're in the right place if you were concerned this might have been heart-related. It's extremely unlikely to be, and here's why: First, heart pain is rarely highly localized. It can definitely appear in remote places such as where you mention, especially in women, but it doesn't localize so intently. Also, it is not aggravated by position changes, whereas neuromuscular pain usually is. If this soreness can be elicited by direct manual/digital pressure on the spot, it would be 100 per cent certainly not heart-related. As it stands we're already at about 99 per cent certain it's not. Your neck problem, however, could be related, and since you get localized throbbing pains in your arm in the affected area when typing, this begins to sound like a postural injury, muscle spasm in the neck (and perhaps thoracis outlet syndrome -- TOS -- even) due to faulty posture and/or repetitive motion at the keyboard. This is fairly classic for that, while not classic -- or even atypical -- for heart-related problems. Of course your relative youth and gender also are protective and so make heart disease far less likely right now anyway. I'd see a doctor with an eye toward a possible consult with either an orthopedist or neurologist if this continues to be a problem. Meanwhile, you might try an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agent such as naproxyn (brand name Aleve), taken as directed. Also some range-of-motion exercises for the neck -- neck rotations and rolls -- may help.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- It's not at all unusual to have one arm be more difficult to read than the other, just for odd anatomical reasons. However, for a medical assistant to take your blood pressure, having failed on one arm, then tell you your blood pressure is \"high\" and walk away, well, I wouldn't put too much stock in this, especially if the doctor didn't then say anything more about it. Sounds mostly  like a competence problem.   That being said, you have a right to know if your blood pressure is normal or not. Again, normal protocol calls for a second reading later in the visit if the initial one is \"high\", whatever that meant. Further, while I would not worry about this particular exchange (or lack of one) you do have a significant family history, which, unless it can be explained via some extraneous factor, is a risk factor on its own (your brother having died so young of a heart attack). For this reason (again, unless your brother's history includes some mitigating factor), you should have an annual cardio evaluation and be watchful about diet, exercise, etc.   I have serious doubts about your having high blood pressure. You could double check this by stopping by a local fire station or drug store (the fire station with a live EMT would be preferable to the automated BP machines in some drug stores, but may not feel as approachable) and have it checked. I'd be willing to bet the MA was simply incompetent in BP taking. If not for your family history I wouldn't even suggest the recheck, but you do deserve better service than that.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Can Alprazolam Cause Hypertension?",
    "content": "I am a 32 male caucasian.  I have had an interesting year and a half medically.  After taking Flomax for incorrectly diagnosed prostate infection, I had some sort of reaction to the drug.  Or at least the drug triggered something within my body that was previously dormant.  Last taken in July of 2008.  Since then I have had a strange series of ailments, including panic attacks which I never had prior to Flomax.  I also experienced a change in my vision which has improved somewhat but still persists today.  I experience limb weakness, and tingling in my scalp and temples.  I also have pain in my knees and burning in my ankles and feet.    I have seen several doctors, including two different neurologists.  One neuro prescribed me Alprazolam .5 mg 3 x daily as needed.  For a long time, after my panic attacks subsided I did not need to take the drug.  For whatever reason, the sensations in my limbs, and skull have worsened, and I am taking Alprazolam sometimes three times a day but almost never more than that.  I do not have anxiety anymore but my neuro told me it would help with the parasthesia, which it seems to do.    Now to my point, my blood pressure has always been fine.  I don't exercise too much but I am somewhat active, and I am not terribly overweight (5'6\", 160).  I drink moderately which I know is a no-no when it comes to BP.  Still, never an issue until about 5-6 months ago.  I went to the doctor and BP was 146/86.  I was a little surprised but not terribly worried.  Since then, I have had my BP tested by several different doctors offices, and the local pharmacy and have had ranges from 140/80 to 170/100.  The last reading of 170/100 was at my second neurologists office.  The nurse waited about 2 minutes and tested my BP again and it was 146/82.  Ironically, the one time I was at the doctors, about 3 weeks ago, specifically to talk to them about my BP I had not taken any Alprazolam that morning and my BP reading was 126/71.    Each time I have had a high reading I have taken Alprazolam.  I am curious if there could be some paradoxical causation where the drug is actually increasing my BP.  I have found very little information on the internet that suggests Alprazolam could cause such a thing except for on this website where it does say that Alprazolam can cause Hypertension.  When I don't take Alprazolam, though, the sensations and pain I experience are uncomfortable to say the least.  My neuro wants me to get on BP meds but I wonder if there is something more I can do to avoid that because I heard some of them carry bad side effects.  If I did have to get on a med for BP, what would be some of the ones that are generally easier on the body than some of the nastier ones?  Thanks in advance for your response.  Any other professional insight you might have to offer about my other symptoms would be welcome.  I can provide more information but I didn't think that applied to this thread.    Thank you,  IA\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- You come across as a profoundly anxious and somatically aware person. This happens. Some of us are, some are not, but anxiety is such an unpleasant emotion it often becomes disabling. Alprazolam is a good rescue drug (to abort panic attacks) but is not a good long-term therapy for anxiety. It's working for you now, but there are other, better long-term medications. Also, alprazolam (brand name Xanax) is known, in rare patients, to cause paradoxical effects, but elevated blood pressure is not one of them in the literature so far as I am aware. Mostly what it has been known to do is produce agitation in a certain few patients. The elevated BP needs to be evaluated separately, as it may be a separate problem (comorbidity, the condition of having more than one problem at the same time). Of course it also could be secondary to anxiety, which is one more reason to have it evaluated.  The use of Flowmax (tamulosin) can cause a number of untoward side-effects including lowered BP. There is always the possibility that a latent anxiety-related disorder can be unmasked by use of certain medications, so this may have been the case with you, although the problem likely was dormant beneath the surface anyway. It is impossible to be certain, but it's also not worth trying to determine, either. The anxiety and elevated BP are your problems of the moment. You have, for the moment, managed the panic attacks, and a BP med may well be indicated as well. There are a whole lot of different drugs for this, from many different families, and any of them can work well with one person and not another. None of them generally have disastrous side effects, but rather annoying ones, so it's important your doctor choose the starting one based upon all he knows about your history. If one doesn't work there are plenty more to choose from. It's impossible, from a distance, to name one as more or less likely to work for you and agree with you, but there are so many available you should be able to arrive at the right one in one or two tries.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Well you defintely took what could be considered an overdose of Adipex, which is an amphetamine-type diet drug. It was taken in combination with alcohol which, while not generally a real good idea, may well have helped you avoid more serious consequences in this case, since Adipex is a stimulant (and does any possible damage via that route) while the drinks were alcoholic and so somewhat counteract the potentially dangerous overstimulation you might otherwise have experienced.   The subsequent symptoms are a combination of the two on a mornng-after basis. Unlikely to kill you, this certainly still wasn't a healthy or wise thing to do, and obviously didn't solve the problem you were dealing with. I hope this isn't lost on you.  Your post was delayed by about a week, so I'm assuming you've recovered fully now from the unpleasant results of what you took into your body. Again, it could have been worse, but in general it's unwise to mix any sort of drug with alcohol. It just happens to have probably been providential in this instance that you did just that.   Kindly think several times before even considering this sort of thng in future. There are things that obviously need to be worked out, and this doesn't get you there. Talking and/or sound legal advice likely will. Meanwhile, if you do feel any lingering aftereffects of this \"experiment\" I'd suggest seeing a doctor and being very frank about what happened. Doctors aren't in the business of judging you but of helping. I'm hoping by now both the hangover and the other problems are resolved. Please let us know. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- The ankle/calf problem should not in any way be related to the benign familial hematuria (\"thin membrane disease\" otherwise known). This sounds actually fairly normal, although there could be some sort of poor venous return causing his distended vein you've noticed. Of course it's also possible a sensation in the area only caused you to pay attention and notice this vein, which may have been there all along. If there is pain or swelling in the area it needs to be evaluated by a doctor, but otherwise I suspect it is just a muscle tightness, possible slight soft-tissue injury not noticed when it occurred. Again, any swelling, pain or discoloration means it should me medically evaluated. It has no relation to thin membrane disease nor should it have anything to do with high blood pressure.

    "title": "Wildly Fluctuating Blood Pressure and Tachycardia",
    "content": "I am at the figurative end of my rope and am willing to take any advice that might point me in a direction in my search for answers.  I have been suffering for years from extreme sporadic hypertension and tachycardia as well as ventricular tachycardia (found that out when a monitor in an ER started flashing that and ringing alarms while that old familure fluttering went on).  In 1999 I had a surgery under general anesthesia on my foot, half way through my blood pressure spiked, and when they treated it, it plummeted to unregisterable.  I am told my heart never stopped, but to regain a blood pressure they did a fluid overload, enlarging my heart to 4x normal size and filling my lungs with fluid.  The heart size resolved in CCU and I was off the vent in 4 days and back in surgery to complete the operation under spinal anesthesia in 15 days.  In 2006 I was tested for Pheochromocytoma, with mets at 819 and a negatice clonadine supression test it was ruled out.  I was then tested for Cushings, which they also ruled out.  In October of 2007 I went to the ER with a BP of 224/130 and chest pain, it was 150/90 within minutes of getting there, they hooked me up to a EKG and checked my cardiac enzymes... all was normal and they were about to release me when my heart went into 45 sec of v-tach.  They gave me a 0.1 clonadine and my BP crashed to 94/48 heart rate 40.  A week later they released me telling me \"nothing happened\".  In Jan of 2008 I became violently ill with severe gastric issues and was told that I produce too much gastrin.  From that time on I have not been able to keep any oral medications down and am on a very bland diet and have lost 55 pounds.  Last Wed I went to see a new Primary Care Dr for the first time and tried to explain everything that has been going on.  My BP was 126/70 upon arrival and he said I do not have high BP then asked me to move to the exam table.  He then noticed that I was flushed and sweating and checked my BP again... it was 190/100 (L arm) and 189/110 (R arm).  He wanted to give me a clonadine, but remembering what had happened in 2007 I asked him to wait a few minutes first.  He checked my BP again in 10 minutes and it was 120/68.  He had me go to the Hospital to be admitted and believes that it is a Pheochromocytoma... and with my fluctuations he did not want me to leave without meds I could take.  I went, got checked in with a BP of 160/100 and spent the next 22 hours with a heart monitor and BP checks every 8 hours.  The BP checks showed borderline high BP and one Stage 1, the heart monitor showed PVC's and a few short runs of sinus tach, so they released me to go home and finish the 24 hour Pheo test at home.  I was told as they released me \"I would not treat your BP, it is not high, you just need to meditate\".  My echo of 2007 showed EF of 65-70% (which is good) 11mm left ventricle, there was no blockage found in the thallium stress test, heart cath was unremarkable and only mild irritation to the front of my heart. (No one has ever told me what that means)  A Rheumatologist has ruled out autoimmune involvement, and Oncologist has ruled out Carcinoids with a 5HIAA 24 hour urine.  If my new PC had not 'caught' the drastic BP fluctuation himself he probably would not believe it was happening.  The Dr's at the Hospital definately didn't.  My kidneys are fine, my CBC Chem 7 is perfection...  If you have any suggestions on what I could possibly have looked into I would be very appreciative.  Though this is all very depressing, I do not have anxiety (except for when my heart does the fluttering I now know is v-tach and takes it's sweet time settling down and it is hard to breath) and generally try to have a good sense of humor.  I just really need to have my life back.  Some days I can take a shower and brush my hair, even cook... others I can't even brush my teeth without taking breaks.  I am sorry if I have rambled, I am just hoping that something might trigger a memory and lead to an idea that I can have acted on.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Syralia --  First you are not alone. Not here and not in terms of your suffering these seemingly crazy symptoms. Now  then: we obviously don't know, at this point, just what's going  on, but an inventory would be useful, so bear with me: Spiking blood pressure a la pheochromocytoma, briefly sustained episodes of V-tach, optical migraine, idiosyncratic response to general anesthesia, chronic gastritis, excellent LV ejection fraction, so no LV dysfunction, healthy kidneys and blood chemistry. Autoimmune ruled out (but I would put a flag on that for future reference). I also would keep pheochromocytoma filed away for a possible second look.   I feel almost foolish asking, but have you had, in the course of your workups, an echocardiogram? I may have missed mention of it in your lengthy (but very clear and helpful) post. I'm wondering if you might not have, just as a clue, not a cause, a very tiny septal defect, a hole in the dividing wall of your heart's chambers. The reason I ask is that with the colorful history and this particular problem, well, a significant subset of otherwise healthy patients who have all this or many parts  of it also have a septal defect, usually a very tiny one. This can be found usually (but not always) on echocardiogram. It would help narrow the field a little.  There is also the great similarity to pheochromocytoma, which I think should be revisited, since many of the subject symptoms often also attend that and with the things you're having to endure I think all the usual suspects should  be rounded up and reviewed.  That includes both autoimmune (Hashimoto's is autoimmune) and some variation of Ehlers-Danlos or Marfan syndrome. This much seems fairly clear. There is a history of consistent heritable defects in your family occurring in unusual groupings.  There is also one more possibility that hasn't been explored, it seems, and could be consistent with your history: seizures masquerading as cardiac symptoms. This does happen, rarely, and is even more rarely uncovered without a struggle and some dedicated clinical detective work.   Meanwhiie you probably also ought to undergo genetic counseling, and have your daughter checked for WPW, and treated if it is present,  as  patients younger than 35 statistically are at a far greater risk of serious events which tend to fade beyond that age point.   I hope this is helpful. It's no answer, but I hope it will open a dialogue that may bring us closer to pointing you in the right direction.  This has to be  a horrible thing to deal with and I very much admire your strength,patience,  and forebearance. With any luck we can help you get to the bottom of this. Good luckto you and please follow up wtih us here as needed,  and just genrerally  keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am hoping to get some answers for the following questions.  For over 4 months now I have been taking and ACE inhibitor (karvea 150mg) and now ramipril 5mg, along with the ramipril, I take lipitor 4omg, nexium 20mg and a genreic aspirin.  I also take singulair 10mg and seretide 500 with ventolin for asthma.  Since I began taking the ace inhibitors I have suffered from varying muscle pain, normally down my left side, my left pec, inside my left biceps and down to my forearm, with tingling in the fingers.  This pain varies in its level and frequency of pain, it also moves around my body to my jaw (sensation of having my wisdom teeth removed) very hard to chew and swallow, my chest and my right knee.  I also had a very sensitive inner ear, to the point where even the slightest noise woul make me cringe, when I apply a heat balm I do get some temporary relief but the pain comes back when the rubs effect wear off.  Blood pressure was high 140/90 when I smoked and very high when I went for a medical 160/110).  I had problems of muscular pain about a week after I started karvea, I went to A and E and was admitted with suspected heart attack, my ECG came back with a negative reading in the II lead and showed I had had a heart attack, after several blood tests for troponins (all back negative) and an agiogram all came back good and clear.  My last lot of blood tests came back all good with my LDL well within range and my HDL solid.   I stopped taking my meds for about 5 days and it was like I had a withdrawal, my muscular pain intensified and I spent the whole night tossing and turning with the pain moving up through my shoulders and around my body like a massive flu.  I have started taking them again, but do not wish to continue, I have changed my diet right aorund to follow the DASH diet and am completing 2 hours of cardiovascular work on my cross trainer a day (when off work).  What I wish to know is if I do stop taking these meds, will the pain go away and if so how long, also I am completing daily exercise, I do not smoke and I am back training again like I used to.  Is there a real threat of stroke if I get off these meds?  My BP sits around 130/80 and drops into the 120/70 after exercise, What alternatives are available to me also?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello-  While I can find no side effects listed for ramipril which would match  up with what you're descrining I have heard people complain of similar things while on it. That, along with Karvea, which does apparently have this sort of side effect potentially, would probably, in  combination, probably potentiate each other and may be  responsible for the pain you're experiencing. It does seem to be muscular or perhaps neuromuscular in nature (since it responds to heat balm). I'd question the simultaneous use of Karvea and  ramipril together anyway.   I'm unclear  as to why you're on all these meds although I do see you have high blood pressure, but two ACE inhibitors in combination, while sometimes effective in trials, often can produce twice the side effects as well. The  Lipitor apparently isn't contributing to the muscle pain (as it can on rare  occasions) because you've had blood tests that  didn't show any muscle enzymes that would be released by damage caused by this.   You need to have your blood pressure under control, obviously, but there are a lot of options in that department. Since Karvea, at least,  is known  to have this side effect (muscle pains) you might want to discuss discontinuing this one with your doctor, and set up a plan to wean yourself or replace it with something else; you can also discuss eliminating ramipril as well, since ACE inhibitors, while generally well tolerated, can cause some pretty annoying side effects in selected individuals.   The \"heart attack\" episode clearly was not related to your heart, since the abnormality in Lead II only, without corollary changes in another lead (avf or avl most likely) wouldn't really make much sense. More likely what happened was the result of faulty lead placement, hyperventilation or position. At any rate, the good news is it wasn't your heart, but if this pain is causing enough disruption to lead to this sort of stuff happening,  then  you really do need a change of meds.  If the change in medications doesn't stop the pain, it may be that you have two different things going on at the same time, and this may be nerve pain you're experiencing and  the onset at the time of starting the Karvea could be  just one of those awful coincidences. If that turns out to be the  case you may need a consult with a pain management specialist (neurologist) to get to the bottom of this. First, however, your doctor should take into consideration  the obvious and eliminate that first.   I hope this is helpful. If you have any additonal information to share, that might be helpful.  If not, please keep us updated. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "John, firstly thank you for the prompt and thorough reply, I will clear up that I am on ramipril now and had stopped the Karvea (which was 150mg) this was done by the cardiologist that performed the angiogram, he concluded at the time that my discomfort may of been viral, however several blood tests did not show the presence of enzymes related to such infections, subsequent blod tests also came back normal (last two weeks).  I understand that ramipril acts higher up the chain as an ACE inhibitor for want of a better word, the pain I am experiencing is less with ramipril than it was with karvea, karvea produced a very severe muscular response and tinnitus that was causing me to cover my ears just to talk to someone.  However that is in the past, I have found through weaning off ramipril, I last about 5 or 6 days with bp readings going through the range of 140s/90s then down to around 120s/75s when I havent had them, by about the 6th day though I get anxious and last night I slept about 1 hour only and tossed and turned throughout the night, I finally settled when I took ramipril, I worked today in overalls out in 40 degree heat, with the sensation moving around my body, shoulders, back, Lat dorsi (both sides) obliques, abdominals, upper, middle and side of left pec.    My concern is that I wish to come off ramipril, but fear the muscular stress will lead to a potentially dangerous episode, I work shift work and have completed over 8 hours of cardiovascular work in the last 5 days (crosstrainer and bicycle) off, I work a physically demanding job in heat and find the ramipril does make me at times slightly nauseous and slightly dizzy, not so that I am out of control but enough to make me feel unsafe.  I have reduced my salt intake, changed my diet to 95% fruit and veg, no coffee or soda and I dirnk tea ( I have found peppermint tea to be of some assistance in reducing muscular pain).  I am 6 ft 3 and weigh in at around 135kg, whilst carrying a little at the front I am broad shouldered and have lifted weights since my late teens.  I had been sedentry for around 3 or so years and had spent most of 2008 riding and playing golf, however since all this began four months ago I have been regularly completing 1 to 2 hours a day cardio work to loose the kilos and strengthen the heart, I was 142kg now hover around mid 130s.  Once again thanks for the information, by far the best response I have had from a professional, I shall consider a second opinion next week when I am back on our days off, If you have anything to add from the new information I have added please do, and wish you a marvelous 2009\n\n",

You've created some pretty solid cause-and-effect evidence regarding both medications (and so probably, for you, ACE inhibitors in general); You will need some sort of BP management, so I'd suggest you press your doctor for an alternative family of medication.

As for the talabafil, while most drugs in that class can potentially cause some problems with BP meds, the main ones you need to watch out for are calcium channel blockers, not ACE inhibitors, although concomitant use could cause some lightheadedness. Ramapril shouldn't cause any dramatic interactions, just be aware of the potential for standing up quickly. You should be just fine otherwise.  Stay in touch. Thanks for the feedback.\n\n",

    "content": "My son just turned 14 and went in for a sports physical and his blood pressure was high 160/90, he had just eaten. His diet is less than desireable-he doesn't eat red meat but alot of chicken sandwiches. (he had just had mcdonalds chicken sandwich right before blood pressure was taken), eats alot of carbs (I try veggies and fruits, some success...), when we got home it varied from 118/78-140-89! I am a psychotherapist and my husband used to be a respiratory therapist (so he knows how to take blood pressure)...  A little history-he was small when born (5 lbs), with no risk factors and an almost perfect APGAR. (went right home no health problems), but I had ALOT of stress when pregnant (my mother died suddenly, not health related...). He has had no health problems other than a urinary tract infection when he was 7. (they didn't see any irregularities in kidneys...) but I know it is rare in a boy but in reading can occur. His height and weight are a little under 50th percentile now. He doesnt get any exercise other than PE and volleyball (thus the need for sports physcial to do crew which would be excellent exercise)  I must say I have NO trust in the healthcare system (as a provider), and I am VERY reluctant to engage the system. (and I think providers do not understand the real degree of horrific results this sytem reeks on human beings) Going to a doctor or a hospital puts your life at risk, in my opinion, and should be done only with extreme caution. Your thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- Your son would seem to have a possible endocrine problem, quite possibly pheochromocytoma (an often tiny adrenal tumor which may be located on one of the glands but which can also be found in almost any area inside the viscera at times). This is but one possibiity and it may be a lot simpler, but is always best to rule out the most problematic and/or serious issues first. Since there seems to be no other good reason for this elevated BP (diet may not be ideal but doesn't sound horrible either), my first thought is to eliminate renal and adrenal issues as possible cause, at which point the problem may require temporary symptomatic treatment to manage the BP while the underlying cause is determined.  While I recognize there are problems in the US healthcare system, I feel most of those problems are organizational/systematic, and so retain a great deal of confidence in the great majority of providers, who are also struggling to find ways around the constraints places upon them by health insurance providers. The essential product, the care rendered, hasn't suffered as much as has access to it. So I can't agree with your conclusion that seeing a doctor or being hospitalized constitutes an automatic risk to one's life. Believe me, virtually all providers are more than aware of the problems the system sometimes wreaks on the patient population, as much of this is simply placing limitations on what a doctor can do that is appropriate and necessary vs. what a CEO feels is most cost-effective. While having a competent patient advocate is always a very helpful thing (you being a healthcare professional allows you some insights into the process others might not enjoy), I've worked in the acute/emergent/critical care areas for a very long time and have tremendous confidence in the abilities of most providers and nursing staff so far as they are allowed to practice their art. The system itself is a problem, hopefully on the verge of major reform, but the essentials remain the same, and elevated BP in a 14 year old is unusual enough to be worrisome and warrant at least further exploration, either by an internist or a team effort if need be, including endocrinologist and urologist, depending upon where initial testing points, and one of the first tests should probably be a 24 hour urine test to look for excess adrenaline in the urine, which would point toward pheochromocytoma -- a usually benign and often quite manageable problem. It's just a guess, we're working at a distance and in cyberspace, but this seems, given your son's youth, one of the more likely possibilities among several.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed, and do update us as you learn more. Good luck to you and to your son.\n\n",

Well, the blood preassure reading came back 252/199 and all the heart rate said was \"high\". I stop the treadmill. Came home next night took bp before I got on the treadmill, 117/72 and pulse 80. 3 minutes on the treadmill bp gose to 255/232 pulse \"high\". I have apointment with my heart doctor in the next days, and i saw my pulmonary doctor today. Said they wanted the heart doctor to have a stress done and to stop the exercise.

    "title": "Re: Greatly flucuating blood pressure",
    "content": "Hi there -- Good idea to put the exercise program on hold til this is resolved. There are a couple things that come to mind right off, and one is the question marks placed next to \"Toprol\" in your history. Does this mean you weren't sure of the spelling or that you maybe have recently discontinued the drug? See, this sort of thing definitely shouldn't happen if you're taking a beta blocker. On the other hand, if there is something happening that can override the Toprol it needs to be re-evaluated. You could be having reflex increase in cardiac output for some other reason, and heart rate is the most commonly affected when this happens. Your whole output is going way up, though, during exercise. Sometimes this happens shortly after heart surgery and maybe even after the occasional MI, but you didn't have surgery and your MI was 3 years ago. This leaves one or two possibilities, one being pheochromocytoma (an adrenal tumor that releases extra adrenaline and causes rapid heart rate and BP spikes, but that would likely be happening all the time). The other is an autonomic reflex that's very unusual and may require some sort of therapy to decrease sympathetic tone. This is pretty rare,at least in my experience, and you definitely should have the stress test done (with nuclear scan) but I'm betting the test will be stopped early due to rate and BP. Very strange. Your cardiologist will absolutely have to make the call on this one. Please follow up with us here as needed and by all means update us after you've been seen for it. We'd love to know what you find out. Good luck to you.\n\n",

After life saving surgery by another hospital I was left with two stoma's and bags.  Massive weight loss incurred and I had problems with renal function, extreme low bloodpressure. I had a nervous breakdown and was treated for depression.  After 10 surgeries and 18 months in hospital I was finally on the way to recovery.My intestine was shortened, I have no 'pockets', but I have been left problems akin to severe irritable bowel syndrome.  I am no good with stress, and have gained too much weight my BMI is approximatemy 29.5.  A medical has just diagnosed me with hypertension 166/90, and blood results show my  HDL at 0,42 and the LDL at 1.41 (in Nov 2008 HDL = 0,44, LDL 1,16)  I am facing further surgery to repair a massive umbilical hernia, to perform an appronectomy and to remove a large overian cyst (1OOmm in size - weight about a kilo) .  I have an ongoing court case against the hospital (french) that caused all the problems, massive financial worries beause of the european recession plus many other personal issues that I have trouble dealing with.  I know I need to improve my diet and increase my excercise, though I do not excisively overeat, I do comfort eat (I've been controlling this recently).  I ride my horse during the week and try to walk as much as possible - though I know that this is enough and I am beginning yoga classes next week.   I am only 49 and have two children, I am seriously worried about these results. I don't want to keel over wth heart failure - my family have been through enough trauma.  i also don't need another emotional crisis, I am not dealing with stress very well these days.

    "content": "Hello -- You've had a very difficult and stressful time, and stress can cause a lot of side issues or make pre-existing things worse. It may be responsible for your moderate hypertension right now, and that can be treated as can the stress, to a certain extent. While high blood pressure is a risk factor for future congestive heart failure it's not high enough nor had it been going on long enough to damage your heart as yet, so with proper medication and stress management that factor can be contained. Your HDL is a very good number, but the LDL is rather high, so this may require a statin drug in combination with improved diet and exercise. Again, stress probably also plays a role in this, and a stress management program, along with appropriate medication, may well eliminate that risk factor. Stress unfortunately is always with us, but it can at least be managed. Relaxation techniques can be learned that can even lower blood pressure.   Hopefully justice will be served in your lawsuit and your future surgery should go well. None of that has a direct effect on your heart heatlh but the overall stress of the surgeries and the lawsuit can certainly cause some of this. Again, you would not appear a candidate for keeling over, but you do have some risk factors that can and should be managed with the assistance of a good and sympathetic physician.   I hope this is helpful to  you. Good luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane,   No, you're not out of line -- you're a good, vocal advocate for your mom. However, there needs to be a balance between what you observe and what the doctors know, and  here's where it gets tricky, because while  such a reaction is rare and unusual, the first response of \"We've never heard of that happening so it's not happening\" just isn't helpful. There's a first time for everything, cause-and-effect counts for something, and the itching and rash are probably directly related to the statin drug in question while the crazy BP numbers may well be related to the allergic reaction.  You're not wrong in your observation. They're not wrong in their knowlege base -- but that's not all there is to it, and while there are times when medicine is actually trial-and-error, as a rule it is not. There is, at the least, something to manage the allergic reaction; there are also alternative statin drugs that could be tried, since they may not all affect your mom the say way. It's obvious she needs this therapy to help keep her arteries clean if she has stents in rather random locations. Those arteries have to stay open. However, there may be a statin  drug that won't cause this reaction and, as I already said, in the meantime there are certainly medications that will at least take the edge off the allergic reaction. The BP (mostly systolic hypertension) could be due to kidney problems related to the stents, even if the are patent (open and working).  This needs to be looked into as well.  My advice to you would be to continue to watch, reason, observe, ask questions, and if necessary bring information back here so we can help you process it. You've already started doing that, and that's a very smart move on your part.  I think  the response \"We've never seen that happen\" is fine -- by itself. When someone adds \"therefore it isn't happening\" is almost always a big mistake.  Everyone's \"never seen\" something before. That doesn't mean it hasn't happened or that it isn't happening for the first time. This needs to be sorted out -- the trial-and-error part -- but the immediate problems can be treated symptomatically anyway, and not just denied because they are unusual.   Your mom is foruntate to have you on her team.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please stay intouch with us here.\n\n",

I understand mom had alot of questions but partly because she has a cardiologist that has given her meds but the meds lists of the 2 doctors are not the same & it seems like doctors don't want to step on other doctors toes.      I'm really confused, myself, it seems like there isn't co-ordination of care, As her daughter I don't know what to do.  Her top number was 220 today & her bottom number was 95 the family doctor said yesterday, priority is the blood pressure and not her 160 blood sugar number.  Mom called me & asked me what I'd do.   I told her if based on yesterday, take a bp med.   Any suggestion on how to get the doctors to talk?  should I ask the family doctor if he doesn't want to make this decision?   It's just that it's easier to get into a family doctor quickly rather than a cardiologist,   I just don't know what to do or how to go about getting her information.  Thanks Diane\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Diane -- I think your best bet right now may well be to see the general practitioner/family physician, as he can (and often should) act as \"quarterback\" for the specialists and help to prioritize the care your mom needs. While I can well understand the concern over the elevated blood pressure vs. a glucose level of 160 (the very high BP poses a more immediate risk of complications than the glucose level) but both need to be addressed, BP immediately, diabetes right behind. In fact, there's no real reason why they can't both be addressed, but the unwillingness of some doctors to interact can be a real problem for the patient and makes very little sense, yet it happens quite often. The nurse who spoke with you also was pretty poorly equipped to deal with a living human patient. Your mother has a right to be addressed as the patient, and to be given clear and useful instructions and explanations.   Definitely try and recruit the family doctor to be the coordinator of your mom's care, and the one to make certain the specialists will at least communicate with him. It's the ideal situation, actually, and eliminates a lot of potential for overlaps and errors.   Good luck and please keep us updated.\n\n",

This isn't something I would have thought of even though now that I've heard it it makes total sense. This is one of those obscure history things that should have tipped someone off along the way and finally someone picked up on it. It would seem this was the sole cause (which it certainly can be), and the numbers are so much better now, even though a little on the high side, that the relief to your mom's heart and vascular system is probably tremendous. This will have to be watched over time, but knowing the source of the problem, especially after all the missed chances to diagnose it, is really a huge help and should allow the prevention of further hypertensive crises.   Thanks for following up with us and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 39 year old female with 4 leaky valves",
    "content": "Hello -- While some of this could have been caused or at least aggravated by smoking (and is a really good reason to start working on smoking cessation, something I don't usually stress too much to people who don't have any chronic or potentially serious disease because they already know and don't want to hear it again) I suspect there may be something else going on here as well. Again, smoking can only make this worse, the real challenge is to figure out what \"this\" is. It would seem either you have a congenital multiple valve problem, mostly mild, which is going to be exacerbated by smoking, but may also not be genetic and may have been caused by some other factor. What often is in the background when this sort of thing is seen is use of the once-popular weight-loss medication combo called Phen-fen. This has been known to cause both multiple valve problems and pulmonary hypertension which can vary from very mild to progressive and quite serious. It is otherwise pretty unusual. I would, therefore, be certain to have this followed, and hopefully it is just a genetic oddity and not progressive. If Phen-fen is anywhere in your background please let us know, however, as that is a whole different ballgame. If it is not, this is probably either genetic or a very rare disease process and just follow it, but by all means, and I don't usually say this, but I'm saying it now with good reason: Stop smoking.  That and regular followup should keep you in good shape. So far so good. Let's keep it that way. This may wind up being a big nothing, but it is just unusual enough to warrant some healthy concern without undue anxiety.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do keep us update here.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been on lisinopril HCTZ 10-12.5 for about five years.  In March my blood pressure went to 179-117 and the doctor changed the dosage from once to twice a day and gave me Xanax to help me sleep (and no worry so much about the BP).  During the summer my blood pressure readings were as low as 100/65 so the dosage was lowered to once a day.  It's been fine ( 125/82 three weeks ago at the MD) but now, as I return to teaching, it's back at 170/110. I'm 54 so menopause issues also come into play.   Is this normal?  Should returning to the twice daily dose fix this?  I was taking Crestor beginning in January but due to the high copay have very recently switched to simvastatin.  As the wild fluctuation was a problem before, I don't think that is the trigger here.  It's a vicious cycle as the higher it goes the more I worry and it goes still higher.  Should the MD be adding a second drug? Thanks for your input.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Wildly fluctuating blood pressure",
    "content": "Hello -- Given the factors of return to work and menopause and given the numbers you've quoted here, it would seem twice-a-day dosing should be ideal for you. When your BP was at its lowest it was a perfectly acceptable level, and as it increased it stayed okay til stress acted on it to send it back to pathological levels. Since changing a statin drug would in no way set off the problem but increased stress (and possibly menopausal issues) would, it follows logically the halved dose would only hold up til a return to work. You may well love your work, but even if you do it is a stressful job, and menopause only adds to this.   I'm not a huge fan of combination drug (except for the type you're currently taking) therapy for hypertension except in severe, intractable cases, which doesn't seem to apply here. I think the twice-a day regimen should bring you back into a comfortable range. If not, addition of an additional drug might be justified. I doubt, given your history, this would be the case.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Im still seeing the same floaters as when I was hospitalised, as well as the pressure headaches and numbness of the left side of the face.

I feel not too bad getting some hot back pain, but don't want to do myself any damage.  My Dr says I must have a uti (which is causing the wbc and protein) but that it must be a rare type of bacteria (which is why tests are always coming back neg).  I just don't know what to do.  If 150/90 is just going to be my normal bp reading and the number is fine then I'll just move on :)  Thanks. 26 yr female, healthy weight and lifestyle.\n\n",

My doctor insists I stay on the Lotrel because it is working for me, however, I can not afford it, and he is not offering me any other help or ideas. With my new, only part time job, with no insurance, I do not earn enough to pay for Lotrel and my other medications along with my bills. Lotrel IS offered in generic form, however, not in the strength I take, so it still cost the same, because I must take two pills a day. A new solution is needed as I must stay on some blood pressure medication or my blood pressure sky rockets (I was in the hospital when I first learned I had high blood pressure, it was at 214/190). If I go off of it for more than two days, I usually average 170/100 (on the meds I'm 130/80 average on a daily basis). So, I am just asking for a cheaper solution. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "I appologize for taking so long to see this question.  I will tell you that I have never heard of such a method whatsoever.  The only ways I know to lower blood pressure without meds is to do a few things.   First, cut down on the salt intake.  Change your diet to a low fat diet to prevent clogging the arteries/vessels.  Exercise, lose weight and don't smoke.  I have never in my life heard of a method cutting you down to 10 breaths a minute for that many minutes.  Especially since the lower end of the breathing rate for most of us is 12 breaths per minute.  We are all different.  But depriving yourself of breath and oxygen does not seem to me to be any way to lower blood pressure by any means I have ever heard.  I have been a practicing RN for 17 years.

    "content": "Hi  I have had sharp pains in my chest sporadically since I was a teenager, sometimes while lying down in bed.  More recently, (the past 4 yrs or so) I have also been getting pins and needle in my hands and feet, (at least once/twice a week) and numbness in my fourth toe, which shooting pains sometimes are felt in.    I also for the last 7-8 yrs feel like I am running a fever most days (esp if I haven't slept properly) but have always put this down to allergies/side effects of anti-depressants but have stopped taking anti-depressents 2 yrs ago! (I also do not have a fever when I measure it with a thermometer-but I feel so shivery and hot in thr face and eyes, this makes no sense!)  My joints often ache, in my knees and fingers and sometimes I feel dizzy or faint.  My heart feels like its racing when I wake up and I feel nauseous and headachey.  What is this?  Is it my blood pressure?  or is it just bad allergies plus pins and needles with a bit of stress thrown in?  I should say I am being treated for sleep hypopnea, and have alopecia, but not being treated for that.  I have been taing anti-histamines every day for several yrs, and don't know if there are any problems with doing that.  I hope someone can help, Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pains + pin+needles and numbness in hands and feet",
    "content": "Hi there --  Sharp or stabbing chest pains are rarely  cardiac related and can be caused by any number of neurlogical, GI or orthopedic things. The tingling or pins and needles in your extremities may be related to this in terms of a neurologic or orthopedic issue, and in fact specific shooting pain in your fourth toe does suggest some sort of nerve problem, possibly due to something being impinged upon, which could  overlap as an orthopedic problem as well. It's of course difficult to even guess at a distance, but I would definitely bring this to the attention of your doctor, who might then refer you to either a neurologist (my personal preference for starters) or an orthopedist.   The apparent racing heart should be clarified -- and you can do this by counting your pulse while this is going on, by sitting or standing still and counting your heartbeats either at your wrist or your carotid artery in your neck (next to your larynx) for 15 seconds, then multiplying by four. This would give you an idea of whether or not your heart is actually racing, as this is often a mistaken perception that doesn't seem to jive with the sensation. Anything between 60-100 would be considered normal generally, and you can even establish what is normal for you, resting, seated, and then compare this with what you feel is \"racing.\"  Sometimes it is racing, but if it's under 120 beats per minute we'd have to consider all else going on at the same time,so if you can sit down when this happens and do the count, that would be helpful in sorting out the symptoms. I suspect this may be separate from your other symptoms and of course sometimes can be caused by certain antihistimines as well.   I hope this is somewhat helfpul at least. Please follow up with us here as needed, maybe try and give us a resting and \"racing\" heart rate. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for such a long and detailed answer. I am glad sharp pains are not usually cardiac related.  I will certainly start measuring my heart rate.  I will also go and see my doctor about the pins and needles etc.    The sharp pain is like a stitch when I breathe in....I have to stop breathing for few seconds until it goes away.  If it's neurological that might make sense as I had some strange electric-shock like sensations in my head too.  (Perhaps I have posted in the wrong forum?!)  I take it feeling like you are running a fever, but having a normal temperature is not a widely recognised symtom of anything?  It could just be stress, but it is so constant, not correlated with stress, I don't think.  Will consult my doctor, but don't want to sound like a hyperchondriac!  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for providing this forum.  My 11 year old daughter has been diagnosed with hypertension- unmedicated, her blood pressure is around 150/105. She is 4 feet 4 1/2 inches and weighs 92 lbs. As an infant, she had urinary reflux, a partially paralyzed vocal cord, and RSV. She does not have any of those conditions anymore.    We were admitted to the hospital with a reading of 189/115, and stayed for 4 days until they could stabalize her numbers.   While there, and for the 2 month following, she took  many tests, all of which turned out normal. (Renal sonograms, MRI, 24 hr. urine test, EKG, lots of bolld work). Last week she had a renal angiogram, which was also normal.The doctor took renin samples, and we don't have those results yet.  I am nervous to just accept the fact that \"she just has high blood pressure\", and I am not excited about medicating her for the rest of her life. I am considering trying some kind of alternative (herbal) medications.   We have tried losing weight, but that does  not have any effect on her numbers. She takes 5 mg amlodopine, 2x daily and 5 mg lapidolol, 2x daily. On her medication, her blood pressure is around 112/64. She still complains of stomachaches (almost daily), and has trouble holding her bladder at night. We saw a urologist who put her on a urination schedule. I'm not sure if that is helping at all.   Is there something we are overlooking? Thank you so much for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  First of all you have my full sympathy on your young kid having hypertension at an early age. Hypertension in children though rare, is not unheard of and infact many of young adult hypertensives could actually be child hypertensives gone undetected.  Hypertension is of two types. Primary and Secondary. Secondary hypertension, is the more ominous one. It has a 'Cause' like a kidney disease, an endocrine disease etc. These causative diseases are mostly of serious nature and cause some reduction in life expectancy.  When all the tests done to check for such a 'Cause' of the BP come normal as in your daughter's case, it is called Primary Hypertension. It is just there. There is no underlying kidney infection, kidney stone, hormone imbalance etc.  Now that your daughter does have primary hypertension, it will be counter productive just to deny it or trying an escapist route. Beacuse then she will land up in some complication of hypertension like retinal damage, brain or kidney damage, heart disorder etc. It is wise to face it head on and keep taking the treatment to control it.  I would suggest though, looking at the doses and the BP of 112/64 after the doses to talk to your physician if she would agree to reduce some doses so as the BP could remain in the range of 120/80 and the side effects like excess urination, [can be caused by amlodipine] could be avoided.

    "content": "About five months ago I began having days when I would be at work when I would begin to feel like I was going to pass out. Also, for about the past ten years I have had times where I feel like I have butterflies in my chest. One day the light-headedness was particularly bad and the feeling lasted for longer than normal. I had my blood pressure checked and it was 150/120. It was checked three times over the next half hour and never went below 148/118. I was sent home and went to the doctor. They did a bunch of tests on my blood to check for Thyroid issues, electrolytes, potassium, a whole chemical work up, and an EKG and everything came back normal. They sent me home, and asked me to come back in a week to see if it was just a fluke, because before all this began my blood pressure was normally between 90-115/60-70. I went back and it was still high. So, I was put on Metoprolol and sent to see a cardiologist. On the Metoprolol my blood pressure stayed around 130-140/108-110 on most days. When I went to see the cardiologist they did another EKG, and a stress test, an Echo, and a CT Angiogram. The only thing they found was that I possibly have a bicuspid aortic valve. They saw that the Metoprolol is not working and put me on Sular. Again, this medicine did not lower my BP. The only time of the day that my BP is usually normal is in the morning when I first wake up. They now have me taking Cardizem CD. I have not been diagnosed with Hypertension. Because of my age (28) they feel there is something else going on, and for now they are saying it is not my heart.      I am concerned because I have days where my blood pressure rises really quickly. One day before I left work I checked it and it was 120/93. A half hour later I was walking somewhere when suddenly everything seemed to be floaty (if that makes sense), and I suddenly felt really weird. I went and checked my blood pressure and it was 142/102 and it is staying around that even on medication. I have been getting a lot of headaches. I just wonder if there is something more that I should be making sure my doctor checks, and whether or not this is something I should be really concerned about (my diastolic blood pressure).\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Should a diastolic pressure of over 100 be a concern?",
    "content": "Hello -  First,  yes, a diastolic pressure consistently above 100 is a concern. It's just not supposed to be that high very often (not even during vigorous exercise). So this needs to be resolved.   Your doctor is very likely right regarding your age. While blood pressure does tend (or at least historically it has) to increase with age, at 28 there's no innocent reason for your pressure to suddenly step up that way, and the underlying cause should be discovered if at all possible.  It's not always possible -- this is then called \"essential\" hypertension -- but many times the cause can be found and corrected. It's woth a try to avoid having to be on BP meds for an extended period of time.  One thing that should be rule out due to the sudden onset of this problem is pheochromocytoma -- a generally benign adrenal tumor. These tumors are often found right on the adrenal gland or glands, as one might expect -- but not always. This is why they are such a problem to discover: they're not always where they'd be expected. They can actually turn up anywhere inside the thorax, and the main problem with them is that they produce adrenaline, just like the adrenal glands. I suppose it goes without saying that when these are present, so is too much adrenaline, which can cause a sudden spike in blood pressure which may be chronic.   There are both blood and urine tests to determine if there is excess adrenaline in the body. If this is the case, the hunt starts for the tumors (which can be very tiny at times, and difficult to identify via usual imaging techniques). If this is the problem, it is usually quite fixable, and tests to rule this out or in should be done for sure.  Also, since there is a history of thyroid disease in your family, and since it doesn't matter whether it was hyper or hypo (since the  disease can transpose from one generation to the next and even between siblings), hyperthyroidism needs to be ruled out as well. This is neither as complicated to diagnose nor correct, but it definitely should be done, and quickly.   If these two possibilities are eliminated and there is not other evidence of kidney disease, then you'll probably be classifed as having \"essential\" hypertension, at least for the time being, and treated symptomatically -- to control the blood pressure first and foremost. This is necessary anyway, and hopefully, eventually, the underlying cause will be discovered. Ideally it would turn up in the course of trying to rule out the disorders mentioned above.   I hope this is helpful to you. The bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) may have some obscure relationship with elevated blood pressure also, but there's no clear cause and effect. Still, if you do have a BAV you'll also need to be followed for possible development of an ascending aortic aneurysm. Since you currently have high blood pressure, and since this is a risk factor for aortic aneurysm independent of BAV, this is especially important to watch as well, so the diagnosis of BAV needs to be clarified and, if present, followed with at least an annual echocardiogram.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Early pheochromocytomas can sometimes be very difficult to visualize because they can be so tiny. This is where the 24-hour urine test comes in handy, as it can show excess adrenaline and lead to a more thorough exploration (via imaging) to try and locate the source, assuming there is one.  For some reason there seems to be an occasional problem being certain if an aortic valve is bicuspid. The best thing is to have the echo repeated, hopefully using a different tech. A better method for \"seeing\" this area is a transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE), which is done by sedating the patient and dropping the transducer down the throat, into the esophagus, behind the heart. This puts it in very close proximity to the area in question, doesn't take very long, and gets the most accurate result. Otherwise, it seems to me if there's any doubt about BAV it's probably best to err on the side of caution and take an annual look, until or unless it's positively ruled out. While it doesn't seem to have any particular issues in and of itself, it is strongly associated with ascending aortic aneurysm, and that's also fairly easy to check for periodically, maybe at the same time as an annual echo.  Hope this is helpful. Stay in touch.\n\n",

Could this be caused by my blood pressure problems?      My doctor basically dismissed my blood pressure as more than likely being stress related, if not herditary. They think it is stress related because more often than not my blood pressure is okay when I am at home, and high when I am at work. I am hardly ever home, and when I am I am not being active. When I begin to go places and am standing on my feet for long periods of time, this is when I more often notice symptoms of my blood pressure going up.      Today I took my medicine like normal, which has been working most days, but I have also been sitting more. Today at my job I did not have the choice of sitting down for about two hours. I had to stand and walk around the entire time. When I got done I felt off and had a headache along with the tight feeling in my legs. I had my blood pressure checked and it was 140 over 103.

    "content": "HI there --  This is a really common problem, and the answer usually depends upon how long it's been since you were supposed to take the drug and what the dose is. The higher the dose, especially of blood pressure medication, the better more problematic it is taking the possible second dose. In your case you're on low-to-moderate doses of two blood pressure meds, so if you're not certain if you've taken the day's dose or not, you should at least wait til halfway through the dosing interal (12 hours), and hopefully this will be at night, so that if the effect is exaggerated (blood pressure low enough to cause weakness, lethargy or light headedness) you will be going to bed anyway and could sleep through it. If you're not certain if you've taken it or not, better to wait at least 12 hours to avoid the doubling up of a dose, vs. not taking it at all, which may or may not present a problem. With beta blockers this is especially sensitive, and I would only risk doubling up at that 12-hour point. Usually it's better to just leave it alone, unless you have morbidly high blood pressure.   Along these same lines, it would be wise to try and develop some sort of system to remind yourself if you've taken your meds or not, like turning the bottle upside down after taking the pill, or leaving a colored sticky note on the medicine cabinet afterward, something that can become a habit, regular practice, to help you know what you've done. It is, for some of us, a real problem. These little tricks can really help avoid having to decide whether or not to risk doubling up. At the doses you're taking it is probably not too bad to do, again, especially if you wait til halfway through the dosing cycle.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  First, Lipitor is  for control of cholesterol levels and benazepril  HCL is an ACE inhibitor (for control of blood pressure) along with a diuretic (to increase elimination of fluid, also to control BP). Now that we've got that part straight, let's get to the Extenze. It is a \"natural\" supplement,  once which contains a number of common plant extracts and the usual things found in non-precription \"male enhancement\" aids. It is not  Viagra, which is, essentially, a blood pressure medication with an interesting side effect.  One should not take Viagra along with any blood pressure meds without first consulting the doctor. However,  Extenze, which may or may not do anything for you, should not interact with the medications you've been  prescribed. There is also no clinical study to support its claims that it might actually work as claimed, and that is something you'll have to find out for yourself. Be aware, however, that the manufacturers are trying to make a buck off something that costs virtually nothing to make, and will encourage you to keep using this if there is any perceived \"improvement.\" Personally I'd rather go with something that is a known quantity and has some clinical studies to back up its claims, but the Extenze probably won't cause any problems, at least in combination with your current medications. Good luck to you with this and please feel free to follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "HI there --  This is a question only your prescribing physician can answer, but I can at least give you some help with it. First, while both drugs under consideration are often used for blood pressure control you are correct that they are not in the same family of drugs, so their mechanism of action is different. This doesn't mean one could perhaps not be substituted for the other, but there are even more options than just this one. This needs to be weighed and explored by your doctor in light of your specific personal medical history. Enalapril certainly is a possibility, and would fit well, at least in a very general way. The two drugs do not share direct milligram-for-milligram interchangeablitliy however, and this is a frequent misunderstanding among laypeople. This, and the fact that they act in utterly different ways to achieve the same result can be confusing, which is why this has to be a decision made with the supervision of your doctor. Enalapril is certainly one possibility. It's a shame your insurance has removed nisoldipine from the formulary, but this is happening all over right now, and many people are having to find alternatives to the known and effective drugs.  Luckily you do have numerous alternatives.   I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you and please do follow up here with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a very active 26 y/o male.. I have a resting pulse rate in the 40s and work out ~6 days a week.  As far as I can tell, though, I have a fairly high pulse pressure (systolic minus diastolic) - I had a recent bp of 140/60.  Should I be concerned about this? I don't have any symptoms at all - no shortness of breath, shaky hands, palpitations, or anything of the sort. Some of it might be related to just being a little whitecoat hypertensive.  I've been looking through the literature, but most of it just pertains to elderly patients - there doesn't seem to be much about a younger population.  I did find one article which seemed to link high pulse pressure to early cardiac events. I'm a little worried, and was hoping to get some input. Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Should I be worried about a high pulse pressure?",
    "content": "Hi there --  While isolated systolic hypertension (ISH) is fairly common in the elderly, and is considered an inveitable part of aging (a faulty theory I believe, but beside the point in this discussion), in young, athletic types such as you appear to be, it is often a direct function of altered hemodynamics because of fitness level.  Since your heart rate is only in the 40s, the heart has more time to refill between beats, so the cardiac output is going to be much greater, thus much higher systolic pressure is a possible logical outcome.   That being said, certain problems could and should be ruled out, such as hyperthyroidism and any causes of unusual stiffening or constriction of the vessels. Both  these seem rather unlikely, but it wouldn't hurt to run this by your doctor, just to be safe. I strongly suspect it is increased cardiac output due to extreme fitness level, and probably not problematic. If you should find the systolic pressure creeping on up above 140, however, this would not be right and should be investigated. For this reason I think it probably prudent to bring this to the attention of your doctor now. Bear in mind that with normal/low diastolic pressure, any treatment of the systolic will also lower the diastolic, and there's not much room for that to drop. Wide pulse pressures are, again, often seen in athletes. Just a quick look at a few critical areas should clarify whether there's any reason for concern. I doubt there is, but why take the chance?   I hope this helps answer your concerns. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: switching from beta blocker to ace inhibitor",
    "content": "Hello --  First your husband has been on a very high dose of atenolol. Second, it is not the same class of drug as lisinopril. While the lisinopril can be started as prescribed, with such a high dose of atenolol it should be reduced some first, and in any event  it needs to be tapered off carefully over a period of 10-14 days to avoid potentially very serious side (rebound) effects such as heart attack, blood pressure spike, chest pain, cardiac arrhythmias, etc. Since the dose is so high, it should be tapered to at least 1/2 before the lisinopril is begun in order to avoid wild fluctuations in blood pressure (first likely very low, then possibly spiking a little later). This should have been carefully explained by your husband's doctor. If the doctor is not a cardiologist then perhaps before this changeover is done your husband should have a consult with a cardiologist  who can supervise this drug switch. Again,  the current dose of atenolol is very large, so I'm assuming the effectiveness was being lost over time and now the doctor wants to try something new. Beta blockers cannot be stopped abruptly, even if one is being replaced by a different sort of drug for the same problem, because other side effects can still take place as outlined above.   I hope this is helfpul to you. Good luck to you and your husband with this. He's lucky to have you watching out for him. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I also am wondering why you feel the need to take something to lower your cholesterol levels. Is this just a precautionary measure or do you know you have elevated lipids? If the latter is true, do you know what those levels are? Depending upon whether or not you actually have a confirmed need to lower your blood fats, you may need to be on a real medication to lower these levels, and if that's the case then you may not be able to use MagnaRX which, like most such remedies, is composed of botanicals which generally shouldn't be a problem, but they do warn, for unclear reasons, not using this with statin drugs. It's difficult to know why, since MagnaRX is not a clinically tested or recognized drug, so there's very little actual information available on it.  I hope this helps.

    "content": "Hello -  Lisinopril was causing you no side effects for a month, then you began having nausea and palpitations. OK, while both of these are occasional side effects of the drug, it's unusual to develop side effects from most drugs after a month, during which they've usually come and gone (if they're going to go). This doesn't mean it couldn't have been the lisinopril, but makes it less likely. By the same toke those symptoms are both fairly common in the general population: you could have had a GI bug or eaten something that disagreed with you.   Atenolol, along with lisinopril, probably would affect a lot of people in an unpleasant way, so that's not surprising. Beta blockers sometimes cause sleep disturbances, so that makes sense. It also should have increased the antihypertensive effect of the lisinopril, which could have made you quite lightheaded and lethargic.   You took the last lisinopril yesterday. I don't know when you stopped the atenolol, but you were only on  that for a week. Your blood pressure, after having stopped both antihypertensives, is only about 145/80. While the upper number (systolic) is higher than we'd like to see it, it's not at a critical level, and the diastolic (lower number) is fine. I'm wondering if you really needed to be treated for high blood pressure to begin with. If your BP wasn't that high to start with, you could have had some untoward effects. We don't know what dose of lisinopril you were on, either, but in a day or two it will have completely cleared your system. You may well be feeling anxious about the symptoms and  that alone could be driving your blood pressure. From the tone of your post you sound like a somewhat anxious person to begin with. Discontinuing both drugs would have a certain amount of perceived unpleasant effect, but it shouldn't last long.   If your blood pressure was treatment-worthy before you started lisinopril, it would help to know what the average pressure was and what dose of lisinopril you were on. You may or may not need treatment for elevated BP. You may benefit more from an antianxiety medication.   If you can fill us in with some additional facts to clarify what the situation was previously, we might be able to point you in the appropriate direction. As it is right now you sound agitated, but we still don't know enough to suggest anything other than to bring all this back to your doctor's attention. Please try and recall what led to your being prescribed the lisinopril to begin with and what the dosage was. That would be a great starting point. Thanks, and we'll look forward to more information from you.\n\n",

I was originally perscribed Licenopril (10 mg 1 time a day) cause it was consistantly high at the doc's office...140's/90's.    This may apply to another forum, but since I started here not sure if I should repost in the ear nose and throat section...  currently what is driving me crazy is: Dizzy/ light headed for almost 4 weeks now (its all the time). Tennitis pretty bad a little lethargic anxiety my eye twitches a lot...  symptoms that I no longer have: heart palps have pretty much gone I'm not as freaked out as I was... not sweating like I was,  no heavy legs not chest pain  I did have, and at the time of the original post didnt catch the corrilation, about 5 weeks ago a NASTY sinus thing going on...lots of mucus that kinda backed up into my head.  As soon as that cleared (about a week) is when my vertigo started then tennitis.  Thank you very much for the responce!...\n\n",

    "content": "Overall this is a very positive report! It's very important that you're able to recognize and work on your anxiety issues. The blood pressure seems to be stabilizing somewhat, also. A walk can raise the pressure slightly, or sometimes it can reduce it (if the walk was especially relaxing). It's hard to say which would be the case, but the fact that the pressure was near normal is certainly encouraging.  If Lexipro worked for you before, you may as well add that into your regimine for the time being. Remember, you're not married to the medication, but sometimes, if it's effective, it can buy you some quiet time to re-order your thinking and responses to stressors. Just feeling relaxed and normal is often worth the bother of taking a pill once or twice a day.   The dizziness and tinnitus are probably related, and may well be related to the sinus infection. There could be some residual congestion somewhere near the eustachian tube on one side. A good way to find out if this is the case is to try over-the-counter meclizine, either as the generic or one of the brand-names, such as Bonine or Dramamine Non-drowsy Formula. It won't correct the tinnitus, but if it helps with the dizziness it will help narrow down the cause of both.   Eye twitching is a very common, random complaint, but it is seen more often in anxious people. It tends to resolve on its own, but of course is crazy-making while it's going on. Try to be patient with that and it should go away shortly. It sounds as though you're making excellent progress. Keep up the good work!\n\n",

I havnt fallen down or anything, but any kind of exorcise makes it worse.  A couple weekends ago i did a three mile walk (around the mall in DC) and it made me feel awful (dizzy and weak/lathargic)  currently I am still dizzy and lathergic.  Monday night I went to bed at 730 and slept through.  The dizzyness is just wearing me out!  Is this something that goes away with time?  I have an appointment with an ENT doc next week, if I'm still dizzy by then it will have been 7 weeks of dizzyness.  oh yea, I have a lot of ringing in my ears too...  Is there anything I should tell my ENT doc next week...?  I guess just a written out solid history report.  Thanks!!  oh, I also posted in the wrong thread about being on Amoxicillan for two weeks to hopefully correct an infection I had.  didnt really do much.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  I too have been having problems with dizziness since September of last year.  I am football coach, and just before the start of the season I began to experience lightheadedness.  I went to the doctor and my bp was very high 190/90.  My doctor put me on lisinopril  Unfortunately the lightheadedness did not subside so I went back to see him about 4 to 5 weeks later.  My blood pressure had gone down to 145/80, but he said that he would like to see it lower.  He uped my dosage of lisinopril.  (Wish i had the exact dosage with me).  The dizziness did not improve, and for about the next 3 or so months I experimented with how much to take (bad idea I know).  I got to a point where taking 1 pill a day instead of two was the best option, but still the lightheadedness did not go away completely.    Just last week I went back to my doctor because I have basically been living with some lightheadedness since Sept.  This time he put me on Athenol along with the lisinopril.  I was in his office for about 5 minutes!  A bit frustrating because he seemed to not really take my problem that serious.  He told me to come back in 6 weeks for a check up.  The combination of meds put me back to fairly severe lightheadedness.  I feel best in the morning and evenings, and the most severe symptoms are during the day.  I can function through it.  In fact I played basketball a few days ago, but was very frustrated because I played teriible.  Understandable considering my symptoms.  It is things like this that frustrate me, because I cannot do the athletic things I used to.  I am a former offensive lineman and I am very overweight.  I am 6'3 300lbs, but i am very athletic.  I have been working on my weight ever since i stopped playing the game.    I don't seem to have symptoms while I am coaching.  I guess I just get focused and don't notice them.  My father, sister are very anxious people and worry all the time, but I do not consider myself to be this way.    It seems that when I take a high dose of lisinipril the symptoms are worse.  I have even gone of the meds and pretty good for awhile, but the lightheadeness always returns.    I am very frustrated and any info you can give would be great.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Low blood pressure/ low pulse Should I be concened??",
    "content": "Hello --  While some people are naturally vagatonic (the vagus nerve dominates their heart rate and makes it slower than normal) and runners and the very fit also often have very slow rates, this can also be caused by an electrical problem. Since this was uncovered during blood donor screening there probably wasn't an EKG done, and that's one thing that  should be done just as a baseline thing. If it looks fine then there's no sinus node nor AV nodal problem (no heart block or sinus slowing) and this is probably just an idiosyncrasy, especially if your wife has no other symptoms because of the lowness and slowness.   The 12-lead EKG and possibly an echocardiogram wouldn't be unreasonable, just to be certain this is all good. However, if your wife is very fit, a runner, or otherwise very athletic, this is often seen as a by-product. Some ultra-fit people even develop something called neurocardiogenic syncope,  where the rate and BP get so low they get lightheaded and/or pass out. This is not a serious problem either, except that no one needs to be falling down or passing out, and one can get a head injury that way. If this isn't happening chances are there's nothing really going on, but to be  on the safe side the EKG at least should be done just to be certain.   Making certain one is well-hydrated and has enough salts (electrolytes) in the blood can also help avoid the low BP if not the slower rate. Just an afterthought.  Hope this is helpful to you (and to your wife). Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Having feeling of Blacking out for Years",
    "content": "This is the first time I have ever posted or found a forum like this to talk to doctors but I am very excited to be able to get everything out without sitting in a doctors office.   I am 26 years old, I am 6'2 and have a weight that is always somewhere around 185-190lbs. I have never drank any alcohol smoked anything or done any drugs in my entire life. Growing up I was very active and in very good shape. After high school I admit other then having spurts of working out maybe a couple months out of the year I don't get too much workout time in. But being at the height and weight Im at and looking in good shape im assuming I don't have a weight or just being out of shape problem. I also have always been very social in school and would never be concidered a misfit or someone who would get anxiety around other people. I was always popular and felt I would never get a problem like this.   When I was 19 and at college is when my problems began. I had always had an issue with doctor visits and blood and all that. I had passed out a few times durring doctor or dentist visits when I would get nervous. I was back from school visiting home and went with some friends to get my ear pierced. Knowing my fear of needles I was very nervous. Needless to say when I got my ear peirced I passed out and hit my head apparently. My friends woke me up I stood up and walked off a little woozy. I was fine after that for a few weeks, then while watching tv at a girlfriends house I started to feel like I was going to black out and started to panic and had to leave. I began to do this quite often after that and really never felt normal. Always felt dizzy and had symptoms of passing out, the blacking out feeling was pretty much always there. Sometimes it would get a little worse and I would panic, which of course doesnt help.    While back at school I stopped going to class and couldnt leave my room for awhile I was so dizzy I could barely stand up. I had everyone bringing me food and trying to get me through the day. After a few weeks of this I finally was taken to the hospital where they ran a bunch of tessts on me. All I really remember them saying was I had low red blood cell count and was dehydrated. I could have told them that after laying in bed for a few weeks not eating or drinking too much what did they expect. But they released me with them saying that was my problem, but I knew it wasnt as before the 2 previous weeks I had been eating and drinking fine and was most likely not dehydrated. Regardless they gave me some IV fluid and sent me on my way. I did as much as I could the next week to stay hydrated drinking water everytime I went to the bathroom and that just made me pee about every 2 or 3 minutes throughout the day. A week later I went to the university of washington campus medical center and they wanted to take blood. I told them I needed to lay down as I would most likely pass out, they said I would be fine and went ahead with the blood draw. After a few seconds the guy taking my bllod realized I wasnt kidding as my eyes must have started to look a little off so they sat me in a wheel chair and wheeled me to a bed. They proceeded durring that day to give me some meds and take chest xrays and a few other things and when they were closing up after a whole day of being there sent me to the hospital where they again said they couldnt find anything but I had a low red blood cell count and couldnt find any bleeding anywhere, after a rectal exam and so on. The results of my blood test at the medical center were low red blood cell count and the doctor telling me she thinks I have something in my blood stream allowing not enough room for the red blood cells and she didnt know what it was. I gave up going to them and withdrew from school and moved home.    The next year or two I spent going to doctors, had eeg done and mri and catscan, they ruled out brain tumor. I starting seeing a brain specialist and he was also a psycologist. He started giving me celexa a anxiety disorder drug. I took it for a few months and went back to him monthly and he would walk in the room and say ok heres another month of pills and walk out. I gave up on him and after another month quit taking the pills as I for one hate taking any kind of medication, and two they werent doing anything. I didnt notice a difference with them. I gave up going to doctors and decide I could get over it and deal with it on my own. I spent the next 5 years of my life in a constant state of disorriantation(forgive the spelling). I worked a job where I was around lots of people all day long, I would have a hightened state of being nervous every once an awhile or feel a little panic come on but for the most part I was in a constant 24 hour state of having trouble concentrating and feeling slight symptoms all the time that I was going to pass out. I have not felt normal or ok the whole 7 years since this started. But I always felt I could figure it out and solve it on my own.    After that many years I figured I should give a doctor a try again but of course I had developed the worst anxiety towards seeing a doctor. So its very hard to go in and see a doctor and its even harder once I get there to be able to tell him how im feeling. I finally went when I started to get chest pains.. Not horrible ones but I felt a constant pain 24 hours a day and I would give it a 5 on a scale of 1 to 10. I sat down the nurse took my blood pressure and looked up and asked me if I was ok?... I said yeah I feel fine actually this is how I always feel, maybe a little increase from being there but still decent. She told me my blood pressure wasnt ok at all and went to get the doctor. Apparently it was somewhere in the high 150's over mid 90's. Of course I said well being in here im sure isnt helping. I told him I really want something for my anxiety im finally willing to try some meds. I was getting to the point where I was scared to drive and even was anxious while sleeping and waking up in the morning with a horrible nervous feeling. He gave me a month supply of clonazepam and said he wanted some blood work to see if my body was creating too much adrenalin, as well as a urinalisis. He wanted a full 24 hours so I brought that in as well as got my blood tests done. I went back in to see him and he walked in said everything looked fine and walked out... I told him I needed more info but he acted busy and just walked away. Needless to say I was frustrated again and left with no new info and some medical bills. I ran out of the pills and didnt wanna go through the anxiety to go to the doctor to get more so my mom gave me some lorazepam which I believe is basically the same. I was only taking .5mg a day split up into two times, .25mg at day and night. I have remained on it although once again I have noticed no difference. The doctor also wanted me to take a high blood pressure med but I have heard horrible things about them from my dad who was a paramedic for 30 years. So I wanted to hold off on taking those. Over the past 8 months or so I have been keeping track of my blood pressure a few times daily along with blood sugar, weight and temp. Everything they regularly check on doctor visits. My temp is on average 97.8 to 98.4. My blood sugar is on average 80, never above 100 and sometimes all the way down to 60 but thats rare. It generally is 70 to 80. My blood pressure while completely relaxed and as normal feeling as I can be is sitting 130/85 to 90 with a pulse around 90 to 100... when I take it standing up its usually 120/78 with a pulse of 130. Those are rough averages as it does vary sometimes higher but never lower. Im not sure why my pulse is so high as that is like a target pulse for working out. I would like to get back into the doctor but am losing faith in that route. I wouldnt mind trying another anxiety med but I think anxiety is the chicken not the egg for me. I now can barely stand up in lines or sit in meetings without getting lightheaded and having a strong feeling of blacking out. When I wake up in the morning I already don't feel good and if I get in a situation with a slight bit of stress or if I do get a little anxious it imidiatly shoot my blood pressure up to 150/95 and my pulse is racing, I feel like im going to black out.   This has slowly been eating away at my life and what I feel like I can do as I have a fear of passing out all the time cause of how I feel. I know the anxiety doesnt help and I try my best to control it. Im looking for any advice out there and maybe come up with some stuff that I can bring to a doctor instead of nothing getting solved when I get there.      Im sorry for this being so long but I hope I put enough info to at least get a response and maybe someone can start to help me or send me in the right direction. KC\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KC,  Having passed out once initially, it has made you sensitized and now you seem to have not only episodes of passing out but also anticipation and anxiety of it, which is making your problem worse.  Low RBC count or low Hemoglobin CAN cause this if it is significantly so.   Another likelihood is positional hypotension, though the BP readings you mention practically rules it out.  The precipitation of the event at the sight of blood or a needle prick leads one to think of the possibility of neurocardiogenic syncope [vaso-vagal syncope].  I strongly suggest you get in touch with your physician and discuss with her what tests can be done to rule this out.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I went for blood pressure test and cholesterol test at a clinic yesterday and was told my blood pressure was high and cholesterol total 5.89. The first blood pres reading was 164/102 and I was told to wait few minutes an then another reading was done 146/90. I was told to come back on Tuesday to check again. I went for these test as i felt very tired and my head sometimes spinning and very heavy. Sometimes it feels like my heart is throbbing in my throat. I felt this way since I came back from the UK on a flight of 11 hours. My feet and legs and hands were very swollen after the flight and had difficulty walking. My lower legs were swollen tight and  even the skin was tight - felt like bursting. ( I had the same problem with swollen legs after the same flight beginning of January 2009) Now most of  the swelling has gone done but I still get a feeling of restriction?/like calves being pulled tight with elastic and during the night I have difficulty sleeping due to my legs being uncomfortable and hurting - lots of cramps. I also get up lots of mornings with a very puffy face and hands. Do i need to go and see my doctor for this? or just wait till it gets back to normal? I am also worried that my kidneys may be part of the problem  - my father had one of his kidneys removed when he was in his forties and my brother had one removed when he was in late 30's. I do not know what the reasons were for removal but worried that it made be a family problem. Help wil be much appreciated. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While the family history of kidney disease makes this a slightly greater possibility, the likelihood is that it's not behind this at all. Overweight can play a big role, as can confinement during long flights. However, you describe some other symptoms that make it seem suspicious -- the sensations  of tightness, especially in your calves -- and some other things, that  make this seem a good enough reason to see your doctor and to arrange for a duplex doppler sonogram of both calves to rule out deep vein thrombosis (DVT), which could account for a lot of the symptoms,  and is becoming increasingly evident as a complication of long flights.   There may be something else going on as well, and of course blood work to rule out kidney involvement should be done, but something is not right, and you certainly should at least see your doctor, and I would  hope he/she would perform or order the appropriate tests to rule out the various possible causes of all this.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us as needed, and keep us updated.\n\n",

I would have bet that it was not a heart attack, but I wasn't willing to completely bet my life, so I went to my doctor and had an EKG.  It was normal, but he suggested a followup stress-echo test anyway.  I have borderline high blood pressure, with my readings usually running in the 135/85 range.  The day I went to the doctor to get the EKG it was much higher, and after several checks I ended up with (a best of) 140/92.  So my doctor prescribed Lisinopril 10mg daily.  I went for the stress echo test on Monday and my BP was 136/86.  When I did the treadmill, the doctor seemed concerned that my diastolic blood pressure rose quite a bit.  I was roughly in the 200/140 range at one point.  He said the systolic should rise when exercising, but he did not have an explanation for why the diastolic would rise so much while exercising.  The ultrasounds and EKG's looked good, it was just the strange blood pressure anomaly that remained unexplained.  Is this something that is an obvious diagnosis?  Any thoughts?  Thanks! TS\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High diastolic BP during stressecho test, what does it mean?",
    "content": "Hello --  While it is normal for systolic BP to go up quite a bit during vigorous exercise (and desireable up to a point, even), it is less common to see the diastolic rise as yours did. However, given your fitness level and body mass index (BMI) this shouldn't seem as surprising. You fall into the obsese range (BMI of 31.6). With the weight and poor fitness level working against you, it's really not surprising the whole system was working overtime during the stress test, and this is all  useful information.  It tells you first that you really need to start a supervised exercise and diet program, with exercise starting out very conservative and working up. In fact, if it's within insurance guidelines you'd do best starting with an actual cardiac rehab program if it's feasible. Then you could move over to Phase III or unsupervised (but still guided) program, as well as working on weight loss.   I really think these factors are at the bottom of the problem, and if your doctor feels this is abnormal you may want to monitor your blood pressure once or twice daily as well as during and after exercise, but this does happen with people who are deconditioned.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "BACKGROUND:  I was diagnosed with narcolepsy at 16, am 66 now, so I have taken modest doses of stimulants (currently 10-15 mg. of generic Adderall daily) for 50 years.  In 1995 I was suddenly widowed and within one month had abruptly menopaused and developed HBP.  I could not tolerate the side effects of atenolol, so after one year dc'd this.  A few more years, and I was put on Accupril.  Worked OK.  After a few years, added Norvasc 5 mg., then last year increased to 10 mg.  So-so control and I began to get one-sided ankle edema.  I have faithfully complied with diet, exercise, lifestyle, except for use of CPAP, which I find very difficult.   Last month was put on Benicar, to no effect so far.  Tomorrow I am to add Bystolic.    QUESTION:  If my Adderall is adversely affecting my BP,  would there be some answer other than adding more and more BP meds ?  (I cannot tolerate \"shake-down cruise\" side effects  for even a few days as I have a demanding, stressful job which does not allow for headaches, fatigue, nausea etc. and I will not take anything that would risk weight gain or sexual side effects.)   N.B. I did try Provigil but could not tolerate side effect.  I can't just blow off the HBP, but I still  have to drive a car and teach classes so some stimulant is necessary ... Suppose I do lose that last 10 lb. and learn to sleep with a CPAP but the HBP is still not well-controlled?  I feel I'm in a stand-off between Cardio and Neuro -- Godzilla vs. Rodan ...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: adderall prn narcolepsy but resistant hypertension",
    "content": "Hi there --  It's an awkward combination of problems, but it shouldn't be this complicated. It seems very often doctors are prone to the Rube Goldberg approach to blood pressure control, which is something I just don't understand. The  need for Adderall or something similar is understood, and it shouldn't really jack the BP that much, especially with all the meds you're already taking for BP. The CPAP mask would help part of this, no doubt, and maybe more than you realize (sleep deprivation not only makes us tired -- it can really up the BP); it's not an easy thing to adapt to, but it may be well worth it.  Meanwhile there really ought to be something that would work better (and be simpler) for the high BP. Since you seemingly did well with atenolol (side effects duly noted and pretty well expected with that drug), there may be a different cardioselective beta blocker that would work for you and spare you some of the really annoying side effects. Metaprolol controlled-release has the same once per day dosing, but seems to have a much better record for tolerance with patients, while performing as well as atenolol. There are some others as well, but this one seems to be the most universally well tolerated. I'm not a fan of adding on and combining different families of blood pressure meds, and you're clearly getting some unwanted effects (ankle  swelling -- edema -- isn't helpful, and Norvasc is famous for that).   Sometimes the best approach is to basically clear the table and start over. While you obviously can't be without some measure of BP control -- too risky -- you might tolerate a paring down and even a switch, and in the meantime give the CPAP one more shot, as this could play a really big role in BP control anyway.   It's a difficult position to be in, so we have to try and find the thing that will cause the least difficulty and yield optimum results for you. Some suggestions, as above, may help you find that middle ground at leaast. Hope this is helpful. Please  follow up wth us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

I was given Hydralazine 50 mg twice a day and Amlodipine 10 mg once a day to counteract the effects, but it is not working.  Just last week I was diagnosed with Diabetes and given Metformin 500 mg once a day.  I also was given Diovan 320 mg and take Bumex .5 mg, once daily. My BP is running around 157/95 even with all these meds.  I think my doctor has given up and doesn't know what to do next.  I'm afraid to carry my laundry up three flights of steps because of the increase in heart rate doing just simple tasks now, like walking up the steps.  Have any suggestions?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stopping Inderal LA 120 mg",
    "content": "Hi there --  The period of weaning off any beta blocker can be protracted (week or two at least) and sometimes even after there will be some residual rebound effect. Since your switchover to Inderal LA was because of elevated BP and the discontinuation was due to depression (Inderal and some other beta blockers can contribute to depression, although it's controversial whether it can actually cause it or not), it's probably best to at least get off it, and what you're experiencing is basically what one would expect, and it does get better. However, the BP problem isn't being managed by dedicated BP-lowering drugs, so there's something else going on. You may not need a beta blocker, but there is probably something better that will manage your BP for you without the depression symptoms. Still,  once you've moved passed the period of mild rebound symptoms your BP should come down some, and your heart rate, which really isn't too bad (the BP concerns me more) will start to normalize. Since you've been diagnosed with diabetes Inderal would best be stopped anyway -- there are just a lot of reasons for you to not be on that particular drug. There are other beta blockers which have a lot less side effects, but first you should clear the Inderal from your system and then look at management of blood sugar and blood pressure. Sometimes BP meds must be put on a trial-and-error basis til the right combination is found.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Costochondritis and Elevated Blood Pressure",
    "content": "Hello --  Costochondritis has no direct relationship to elevated blood pressure, and while both can occur independent of each other (and at the same time) there's no reason to associate the two clinically. On the other hand,  the diagnosis of costochondritis can be confirmed fairly easily (even by you) and if it's present then the BP needs to be managed apart from that. If there is serious doubt  about constochondritis, then you may have something else going on and the chest discomfort can be related to elevated BP without any superficial inflammatory process.   How to tell: costochondritis can be confirmed by manual  pressure on the affected area producing increased pain and tenderness, as well as upper body maneuvers which  will stretch and place tension on the affected area with the  same result. If this doesn't happen and the pain does not respond to non-steroidal anti-infammatories (NSAIDs), then it's probably not the cause of your pain, and you'll need a more thorough cardiological workup. Oh,  and one more note: even if the pain responds to ibuprofin (which would strongly suggest costochondritis), use of NSAIDs can, in some people, lead to temporary increase in blood pressure, so keep an eye out for that also.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Palpitations,high systolic/low diastolic,SOB,headache",
    "content": "Hi there --  A healthy concern is rarely misplaced, although needless concern or frank worry rarely are helpful. The trick is recognizing which is which.   A good many of your symptoms may be attributable to GAD, which tends to run a chronic, relapsing course, but doesn't necessarily have to be a lifelong burden, as it can often be managed quite well with cognitive behavioral therapy, appropriate medication or a combo of the two.  Now then: even one diagnosed with an anxiety disorder can have something physical going on, a fact often lost on doctors for some reason. So it is very reasonable for you to wonder what may be stirring up these symptoms. As for the palpitations, while they are almost never of any diagnostic nor prognostic significance, they certain can be unnerving and sometimes also very uncomfortable. When they seem to take one's breath away the reason is almost always because of the timing (and the more frequent they become, the more likely this is to happen), and when they occur while the pulmonary valve is closed, it causes a backup of blood with regurgitation into the jugulars, causing a feeling of pulsing or fullness in the neck, pressure in the chest, lightheadedness and momentary or intermittent taking away of the breath. This is fairly literal, though harmless, and is because the blood destined for the lungs is momentarily detoured. It causes a very odd, breathless sensation. One or two of these is alarming. When they are frequent it starts to feel as though something has gone wrong. Usually this isn't the case, but it certainly is reasonable to have someone take a quick look. While again most of your symptoms may well be attributed to anxiety, this is no reason to ignore symptoms of concern, and in post-menopausal women heart symptoms can sometimes be too subtle and atypical to fit any recognizable pattern. For this reason, it would probably do you good to have a face-to-face and review with your cardiologist. Everything was good a year ago and if it still is, that's a plus. If there should be some (highly unlikely) problem, better to know about it and be ahead of it.   Your blood preeure and elevated heart rate are probably more likely related to emotional response to the more disturbing palpitations. This is quite common, but I'd be the last one to blow someone off simply because of a known anxiety problem. It's way too easy.   There's also the matter of having come off Inderal recently. While that's probaby all to the good, it is going to result in at least some return of the symptoms it was meant to treat. If you and your doctor decide you might benefit from a beta blocker, perhaps one with fewer side effects (such as metaprolol ) would be the way to go. It would probably kock back the heart rate and blood pressure increases quickly and may not make you feel as lethargic as the Indreal often can. An alternative beta blocker would probably also keep the migraines at bay (and again, d/c of Inderall may be a big part of the reason you're having these symptoms anyway).   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed, and good luck to you. I think you're probably just fine, but I will never tell someone to \"walk it off\" just because of a history of anxiety. A quick look could only help.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. I do hope the Buspar works for you, since if you do have GAD it's a better choice than Xanax, although there are other things which,  in my experience at least, have worked better. But we'll see. It does take a while  to reach its effective level.   GAD is rarely situational (related to some current life problem) but usually is either a \"hard-wired\" problem or, more often, and as you mention,  due to PTSD. This latter is only beginning to gain the attention it should have had for many years. If you endured an abusive childhood you're certainly a candidate for PTSD, as many relatively less terrible things can cause it as well. It's just such an insidious thing, and  often will wait years to make iteself known. By then we've often lost track of the potential connection between a long-past incident or situation and the current symptoms. For instance, situational anxiety (\"right now\" anxiety) is usually perfectly rational and  clear in its connection to the thing causing it (a poisonous snake appears in our path, or a loved one winds up in the hospital -- these are perfectly reasonable causes for anxiety). But when it comes out of seemingly nowwhere, it's almost always associated with some \"trigger\", usually from a past experience (although it also can be an erroneously learned response).   When we have something like this fall on us we sometimes blame ourselves (your comment about feeling \"weak\") but in reality we deserve credit for even being able to function when  the underlying issue has never been adequately addressed. Give yourself some credit for this. You're managing. It's difficult, but it can be worked out. Especially helpful is congnitive behavioral  therapy (CBT), a self-limited form of retraining our thought process and getting the real demon out where we can knock it down and get rid of it instead of burying it. That and a good antianxiety med can go a long way toward feeling totally normal again (whatever \"normal\" means). Living without stress is almost impossible, but we certainly can learn to manage it more effectively and this is what most people don't realize because they haven't had something stressful enough to traumatize them.     I'm gratified my response was helpful and hope you will soon be feeling much less anxious -- and knowing that you don't have to rely on  medication  for the rest of your life as a rule, but even if you did, it would be so much better than dealing withthe symptoms of GAD/PTSD.  Look into CBT, too, if you haven't already. It has got a lot of people  past this often very difficult and painful problem and  helped them move on into a happy, productive life without feeling as  thought there's something \"wrong\" with them (because there isn't, you know).   Hang in there, and please let us know how things are gong. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The  ideal was considered to be 120/80. There was, for a little while, a trend toward getting BP significantly below 120, closer to 110, but this was splitting hairs. And it's all describing a desireable range. While 128 systolic is higher than the textbook ideal, it's not necessarily a bad thing, and certainly not a cause for concern, especially when it's come down from the  140s to the 120s. It's a lot like lab values for blood work. There is a \"normal\" range, but if some of the values are a hair above or below from time to time, while it bears watching, it generally means little or nothing. Same with blood sugar levels in diabetics, which tend to be \"normal\" or acceptable at a considerably higher level than before a person is diagnosed as diabetic. We really work with a lot of ranges. Your systolic pressure seems to be just fine right now, so long as there aren't sustained, significant spikes.   Hopefully this sets your mind at ease. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Maybe and maybe not. Here's the problem: your blood pressure has been lowered to an acceptable range by whatever med you're taking for it (you don't mention  what it is, but that would be helpful to know).  Tadalafil can also lower blood pressure, potentially to dangerously low levels when combined with whatever you're taking specifically for BP management. So what you need to do is discuss this with your doctor. Hopefully you would be getting the tadalafil via a doctor's prescription anyway, so the two simply should be weighed together, in the context of your specific history and needs. It may work fine for you, it may be dangerous. Hard to say without knowing the specifics, but this really is a job for your doctor anyway. If you've already had this discussion with him and he says it's OK, then it should be fine. If he says no, then just don't do it, but maybe look into alternative meds for BP that might be more compatible.  Hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am M/53. Two nights ago I had a severe allergic reaction to, (I believe), the Diovan I am taking.  A few minutes after taking it, (Just before bedtime), I collapsed on my bed.  My blood pressure rose to 140/100 which is odd because the medication had been keeping me at 110/70.  My body went cold, very cold, shivering cold. I live in the tropics but I had to curl up under a down filled comforter in 90 Degree heat.  Then, a couple of hours later, I got too hot.  In the morning it felt like I had been bitten by 1,000 mosquitoes but as the day wore on I could tell it was hives.  These have persisted until the second day and my lips have swollen also.  I still have itchiness all over which I am treating with a local cortisone product.  I am in the Philippines.  I researched the Internet and found that the Diovan is an ACE inhibitor.  I want to find a different product which will not give me an allergic reaction but will help maintain my BP.  Note that I have used the Diovan for almost 2 years now but I only use it for a couple of weeks at a time, then I stop taking it because (a) my blood pressure has gone down and stays down for a while (b) I don't feel good when I am on it, (even before the reaction) (c) I don't have a drug reimbursement plan.  Is it likely the Diovan caused the reaction and is there an alternative type of medication?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Alternatives to ACE inhibitors?",
    "content": "Hello --  There's a reasonable chance the Diovan did cause the anaphylactic reaction. I would definitely not take it again before discussing this with an MD. While this sort of reaction is rare, there is a slightly greater statistical chance of it happening with an ACE inhibitor,  and if it's being used only for blood pressure control there are certainly plenty of alternatives. Calcium channel blockers are less likely to cause this sort of reaction (and of course it may not have been the Diovan either,  but you don't take it on a regular basis anyway). There are also beta blockers, athough if you're going to take the drug on an off-and-on basis this wouldn't be a great choice, because when it's stopped there is often a rebound effect and it needs to be tapered to avoid this. There are several other families of drugs that might work well that could be tried, and if you weren't feeling well anyway with  the Diovan then you may just as well look for something more agreeable, especially after this  episode.   Talk to your doctor about a change. ACE inhibitors are generally very good for BP control as well as post-coronary care, but they do have some potential odd side effects (a dry, tickling cough is another one seen frequently). I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Two and a half year ago I was still diagnosed as having prehypertension and the blood test show that the BUN, creatinine, and BUN/CREAT ratio were all basically in the middle of the acceptable range.  Late last year I was diagnosed as having hypertension (perhaps it went undetected for 1 1/2 year because I thought I was having prehypertension and taking  hydrochlorothiazide on and off as needed.) and is taking lisinopril/hydrochlorothiazide combination drug.  I am scheduled to take a blood test soon.  Having read about kidney disease and its symptoms (or not) in the last few days, I am afraid that I might have developed kidney disease.  I basically can be considered to have no symptoms at this point (or I can not definitely say that I have one or two symptons).   How likely (in terms of percentage if possible) that I have early stage kidney disease already.  I am already very worried  so I want to have an idea of this likelihood because I have to wait about 2 weeks.  I want to spend the next 2 weeks worry the proper amount so I would appreciate some viewpoints to help me through.   Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While you haven't defined in your post what was considered to be pre-hypertension (in terms of average and peak blood pressures), if the BP is at or below 130/80 then it is considered controlled. Hypertension damages various persons' kidneys at varying rates,  so even if there were a useful per centage or other statistical answer to your question, it would only apply to the broad category and not to you specifically. I am unaware of any statistic which would give the answer you're seeking. I do know the damage occurs over the course of years, and if you're not hypertensive (that is, if your normal, resting blood pressure is at or below 130/80 then you're not at risk of kidney disease.   I think the \"proper amount\" of worry would be the amount that would be compatible with a relatively low-stress existence, which would in turn help maintain healthy, normal blood pressure. One doesn't go into end-stage kidney disease over night, and if you've been monitoring your blood pressure and it's not out of control then the best thing you can do for yourself is to take life one day at a time and educate yourself as to what will best maintain your good health. If you're being treated for high blood pressure and it's being managed well, then you have every reason to expect a good result from your blood tests. If not, then the testing is certainly prudent in order to keep track of the function of your kidneys, nothing more than  that. Taking a positive and pro-active stance toward one's health and health problems is always going to yield the best outcome. Statistics can be very dangerous.  I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck with the tests, and please follow up here as needed. Update us, by all means, once you've gotten your results.\n\n",

    "content": "You're welcome. Your labs (as reported) are all normal, which is of course what we want to see. It's not always possible to correlate serum protein with urine protein, because protein can find its way through the kidneys, where there might be a problem, but not in quantities sufficient to drop the serum level. In fact, there are a number of condions which may cause proteinuria, kidney disease merely being the most common of them. Mere presence of protein in the urine is not de facto evidence of kidney disease, but some standards are highly technical and will call this \"stage I kidney disease\" even if it's not actually due to kidney failure, because it then must be considered. It's not, strictly speaking, correct, however.   Chronic protein in the urine does mean one has proteinuria, which simply is another way of saying there is (chronically) protein found in the urine. If it is low levels there will likely not be any symptoms, but there is still reason to try and uncover the underlying cause. Again, serum levels tell part of the story (that kidneys are functioning well), but cannot rule out proteinuria because blood is not urine.   I hope this answers the question. Good luck with this and please keep us updated.\n\n",

You're doing everything right but your body isn't responding the right way. There are a number  of endo-related issues that can cause this sort of problem. You've done well with the triglycerides with medication, but if you could start to lose instead of gain weight  those numbers would  likely go down a lot more. As it stands you're at risk of developing diabetes, among  other  things, so if you can find an endocrinologist to take an interest in solving this it would be a huge advantage to you.

At your age though having high BP already makes me think you may be genetically predisposed to hypertension. The variance in blood pressure you are having is known as labile blood pressure. I am glad to see you are concerned, I believe people should be health advocates for themselves bravo! Believe it or not although fish oils are very good for the heart they can cause high blood pressure in some people(many studies). I would first start with some walking, this will help your depression and blood pressure. If blood pressure remains elevated over a long period of time years of uncontrolled blood pressure stretch the heart muscle out and make it weak a condition known as LVH left ventricular hypertrophy and also kidney problems/failure. So if you can, walk and keep an eye on your BP if it does not come down after a month or 2 follow up with the doctor and say it did not come down with exercise and weight loss.  Good Luck,  Paul\n\n",

In my years of experience I have noticed that patients pulse are elevated when they are being administered their bp test and pulse rate. For some reason people tend to get a little nervous and this causes a spike in their pulse.   You have been stressed and this is a good reason or atleast part of the reason why there might be weight gain and increased bp along with it. This is something you should pay attention to. If left ignored may result in heart complications down the road.   My advice is that you establish good eating habits. Fish is a fantastic source of nutrition and actually is great for your heart\u2019s health. But t0o much of fish is not good for reasons such as excessive mercury consumption depending on the type of fish you eat. The rule of thumb is, the larger and older the fish, the more its flesh is contaminated with mercury.  After establishing a proper diet, exercise is the best method to help with your depression, and of course will aid in helping you shed of those extra couple of pounds and even bring your blood pressure to where it should be.

    "content": "Hello, I was attracted to this topic, because I too have elevated bp and often wonder about its causes and my risks for heart and circulatory diseases as I age. I read as much as I can online, probably too much, but I have recently learned that there is a correlation between something called \"hs-CRP,\" which is a marker in blood for one's risk of these diseases, such as stroke, athereosclerosis, or congestive heart failure. The marker, hs-CRP, is known to be associated with inflammation processes, and seems to be caused by them.  The literaure on this marker is confusing to me, because it seems to say hs-CRP is only a RESULT of these disease states even in their very early stages, but other articles seem to be indicating that the mere presence of hs-CRP COULD be the causative agent. If the latter hypothesis, hs-CRP as causative agent, is correct, that would mean that any irritant or activity that causes chronic inflammation could cause high bp and other conditions related to heart disease. Would this suggest that a reversal of high bp could be affected favorably by eliminating physical activities that cause irritation? Could eliminating certain allergens from one's diet reduce chronic allergic-related irritation and thus lower the concentration of hs-CRP? Logically, this might cause lower hs-CRP => lower bp, etc?   I'd appreciate clarification on this subject, and if there are any sound clinical studies addressing this issue involving hs-CRP?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There are two problems which cause confusion regarding the meaning of rs-CRP levels: the first is semantic; the second is that your question hasn't been fully answered as yet.  So far, rs-CRP is regarded as a marker, only, for inflammation. The fact that inflammation in one part of the body can sometimes find it's way to other parts (and our concern here is when it finds its way into the lumens of coronary arteries). Since, for example, inflammation of one's gums can be directly traced to inflammation of coronary arteries (even if it is caused by bacterial infection), this causes the subject's CRP levels to go up and definitely places the patient at higher risk of cardiovascular disease.  What remains to be determined is whether this CRP molecule actually plays a role in inflammation, and if elimination of it could eliminate inflammation, is still open  to debate and, more importantly, research. There are studies in progress right now to try and determine this. However, until the \"truth\" changes, rs-CRP is \"merely\" a marker for inflammation in the body, and chronic inflammation anywhere is believed to place one at a greater risk of CAD.   That being  said, your question about eliminating as many forms of inflammation as possible as a potential means  to avoid CAD doesn't apply -- yet, anyway -- because much of the sort of inflammation we endure normally is transient and localized. Allergies, for instance, are usually localized and  even when an allergic reaction goes systemwide, it's usually a transient event, as  either it gets better or the patient dies from anaphylaxis. There are some sorts of inflammation, mostly rheumatoid (which may be viral in origin anyway), that are implicated in the formation of CAD lesions. This isn't likely because of the presensce of rs-CRP so much as the thing that causes it to form. The  inflammation is the end product of a process, perhaps always viral (it will be some time before we know the answer to this and  other questions), so for now rs-CRP may be regarded as a sign that there is something going on  somewhere, perhaps dormant,  but inflammatory in nature, which could \"blossom\" as  heart disease first, before it shows up in any other body system.  I  hope this helps clarify, for now at least, what rs-CRP is believed to represent, and  therefore answers your questions about reducing other inflammatory processes in the body. We generally want relief from  those anyway, but when the causative agent hasn't found host tissue yet, the thing that causes it is still at large, somewhere, and rs-CRP exposes it.   Thanks for the very provocative question. Hopefully some others here may have other, better-informed insights into the subject.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you, Doctor, for your very comprehensive and thoughtful response to my question. OK, I get it that much more research is needed to fully answer it. You mentioned, however, that it is known that inflammation anywhere in the body is a risk for coronary inflammation. You gave as an example that gum infection could cause heart inflammation.   My wife used to take a few-days dose of antibiotics before having a routine dental checkup at USC. She endured stomach upset for a week to assure lower risk from the visit. Recently, she discovered that this practice is no longer advised; that is, the use of antibiotics as a prophylaxic strategy. Apparently, it was found (by research?) that there was really no risk or connection between gum infection and harmful heart inflammation. What recent information do you have on this topic that could clarify this association?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: pre hypertension, causes?",
    "content": "Hello again -  The reason  your wife used to have pre-dental antibiotic therapy would have almost certainly been because of her having been diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and there was, for the longest time, a practice of preventive antibiotic therapy prior to any  \"dirty\" procedure (which dental work is considered to be). However, it was not only found that this didn't improve the outcomes , but that overuse of antibiotics was defeating the purpose, and  more and more bacteria were becoming immune, so this practice has mostly gone out of favor. (This was done, incidentally, not to avoid inflammation but to prevent bacteria entering the bloodstream, where certain types have a predilection for settling on the mitral valve, or at least this was believed to be the case, and occasionally someone would acquire an infection, endocarditis, this way). The antibiotic wasn't to prevent inflammation except as related to a very specific sort of infection likely to be acquired via dental work, which is directly invasive and can introduce bacteria into the bloodstream via disrupted gum lines. That's why that used to be done, and why it isn't any longer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I'm a 32 year old male, who keeps relatively fit (go to the gym 2-3 times a week, mostly weight training), has an ok diet, and doesn't drink excessively.    I have had mild hypertension since I was 18 or so.  I was recently put onto Lisinopril by my doctor, to try to bring it under control.  I was started off on 5mg, then upped to 10mg as it wasn't having any significant effect.  I went back recently to my doctor (who didn't even know what Pulse Pressure was) who suggested I tried 20mg.  So, I've been on 20mg for around a week now.  What concerns me, is that my pressures seem to be going up with the Lisinopril.  I have a home monitor (expensive arm cuff type), and I have the following average readings:  5mg, 152/64 10mg, 156/66 20mg, 165/70  What is also of concern, is that my pulse pressure (difference between SYS and DIA) seems to be going up.  My last reading was 165/62.  From what I have read, ACE inhibitors (such as Lisinopril) are supposed to DECREASE pulse pressure.  Does anyone have any suggestions?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lisinopril doesn't seem to be working",
    "content": "Hello -  Well no, the lisinopril certainly doesn't seem to be working for you. Why the pressure keeps going up is a separate concern,  as it likely would be happening whether you were on this med or none at all, but something is driving the numbers up, and despite the apparent paradoxical effect (something occasionally seen in a certain few patients with certain types of drugs, but I've never heard of it happening with any BP med), I think there's something else driving this.   Alcohol consumption can sometimes cause a slow incread in blood pressure, but this seems to have started jacking up recently against a consistent alochol consumption, so that's probably not the cause.   All that said, it needs to be noted that the usual dosing for lisinopril is between 20 and 40 mg, and your doctor apparently wanted to titrate upward so as to use the lowest effective dose (always a good goal); it may be that your pressure is going up for some other reason and that the dosages so far have been inadequate to keep up  with it. When there's some underlying cause of hypertension it's usually either something ingested (too much salt, steroid use) or physiolgical (excess adrenaline, often due to pheochromocytoma, an adrenal tumor or tumors which secrete adrenaline along with the native glands, producing too much in the blood and causing sometimes creeping or spiking blood pressure).   Your doctor could either continue to try and increase the lisinopril (up to 40 mg at least -- it doesn't seem to work better once it's hit that 40 mg threshold, although it may be pushed to 80) or try changing to a different drug. He also might want to look for an underlying cause, since you've had this problem for such a long time.   As for that pulse pressure issue (or mean blood pressure), athletes generally (though  not always) will have their pulse pressure increase (expand), which is a desireable thing, and not necessarily something lisinopril would be capable of changing. A widened pulse pressure gives you a greater hemodynamic range and potentially greater aerobic capacity. The real question is why your systolic continues to climb. Again, there is some wiggle room left for the lisinopril if your doctor wants to stick with it for a while longer.   It is a little surprising that your doctor was unfamiliar with the meaning of pulse pressure, although I suppose after a while those things which are rarely used are shoved way in the back of the mental closet. A sports medicine specialist would know right up front what this means. However, many doctors see \"pulse pressure\" as being the same as mean pressure, which it is not (and is no longer considered important).   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed, and keep us updated as to the situation. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

The doctor recommended starting at 10mg, but I suggested started out at 5 mg, but realized it had no effect on me as the doctor was suggesting. Not thinking, the next day I took 20 mg to see the effect while studying. Then after 2 hours, I felt that the Ritalin was wearing off so I took 15mg more. That day my BP reading was 158/94. After that for a week I stayed away from the medication, but my BP has not been decreasing much. It averages between 130 to 150. I am just concerned because it typically is at 119 and seem to be stuck in this prehypertension state. I jog regularly, eat healthy, and stopped drinking coffee for some time now.

    "title": "Re: Took inital dose of 35mg ritalin, have high bp week later",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is a great cautionary tale about the dangers of self-medication. Adjusting the dose yourself is never, ever a good idea. What's happened in your case is that you took a substantial amount of Ritalin early on, it is a powerful stimulant, and it will raise your blood pressure. Often when we do something like  this that jacks the blood pressure up initially, it \"resets\" the system and may take a while for it to return to the previous norm. In the meantime, I would most definitely take the 5 mg. Ritalin as prescribed, no more, on a very regular basis. You may find your BP very slowly gets back to around normal, but even so, while on Ritalin it may run a little higher than you've been used to previously. If you have any other bothersome side effects and decide you'd like to stop the Ritalin, you should advise your doctor first and discuss the decision with him.  Again, I'd take the medication as directed, for long enough to determine whether or not the prescribed dosage is going to work for you or not. If it doesn't, then contact your doctor. If you find your blood pressure is consistently greater than 130/90, also advise your doctor of this.   I  hope this helps.  Best of luck to you with this, and  please let us know how you do.\n\n",

I wouldn't take alprazolam routinely in this situation -- just my opinion -- but do think it could be handy to have in case it's needed. So far the propranolol seems to be doing the job but if it were to permit breakthrough (it's not actually an anti-anxiety drug and can be overridden) then alprazolam might be a good backup plan.

    "title": "Re: How Propranolol in Time release (TR) form works?",
    "content": "Hello -  If by asking how propranolol TR works, I'm assuming you mean how the Time Release function is designed, but in case you are wondering about the function of propranalol and beta blockers in general, I will explain both. starting with the TR function first (as opposed to immediate release version): Time release propranolol is simply a capsule containing propranolol hydrochloride, soluble in water, but formulated from a number of different batches, each made using different inactive ingredients which slow the dissolving and absorption of various parts of it over time, at varying rates, so that it's not all absorbed at once; some remains unchanged in the GI tract, liver or bloodstream for longer periods of time, while other portions of the medication is absorbed at once. There are a large number of variants, specifically formulated for each capsule uniformly, so that each capsule behaves almost identically to all the others in terms of release of medication into the bloodstream.   Regular propranolol is all unaltered in this way,  not bound to anything which will slow the absorption to take place naturally. It's important to understand that there is no simple milligram-for-milligram relationship between the two forms, since much of the time-released form is bound to other inactive ingredients, so, for instance, 20 mg. of regular propranolol taken four times daily should be replaced by 80 - 120 mg. of the time-released form taken usually taken once daily.   Now then: the way propranolol and other beta blockers work, in general,  is to block the beta adrenergic uptake receptors in the body, which is how naturally-produced adrenaline reaches its destination and manages to cause the \"rush\",  increase in muscle tone, and all other bodily functions affected by  adrenal release. Beta blockers block the uptake of adrenaline at the receptor sites rather than reducing the output of adrenaline. Propranolol is a non-cardiac-seclective form, and is the oldest of all the beta blockers. By blocking uptake of adrenaline at all sites in the body, it reduces the effects of  adrenaline, whether on a chronic basis or in anticipation of panic situations such as you will  be using it for.   Since you will  be using propranolol as a means of aborting or controlling emotionally stressful situations which could trigger panic, if these are situations that can be anticipated or if it is intended to abort or at least ease the effects of panic attacks,  then the regular (not time-relaease) version is going to be more effective, and is in general better for use on an as-needed rather than therapeutic basis. It takes effect a lot more quickly than the time-released version,  for obvious reasons, and it also clears the system more quickly when it is no longer needed.   I hope this answers your concerns. Good luck to you with this. Please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Propranolol is often prescribed for tremor, especially when associated with anxiety (especially anxiety related to making public presentations, ie: \"stage fright\").  It seems to be working for you.  To answer your specific questions,  there is no harm in taking propranolol on an as needed (PRN) basis, as you are currently doing, so long as your doctor is made aware that you are doing this instead of taking as directed.   As to the second question, yes, if taking propranolol continuously for an extended period of time (weeks, months or years), it must not be stopped abruptly,  as this can cause a discontinuation \"rebound\" effect, which includes nervousness, increased heart rate, spikes in blood pressure, palpitations, chest pains and, in people with known heart disease, possibly even a heart attack. While it seems you don't have any known  heart disease, the discontinuation would still likely be highly unpleasant at best, so it needs to be tapered off slowly over the course of a week or 10 days.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: TRACE MITRAL REGURGITATION",
    "content": "Hello -  To quickly set your mind at ease, \"trace\" mitral regurgitation is only even noted because it's not how the mitral valve is supposed to work according to the textbook. If this is the only negative note you've found on your echo report you're doing better than most of us. It means virtually nothing. It's recorded (along with any other non-perfect findings) as a way of describing your particular heart. Trace regurgitation is negligable by definition. As to the issue of how it might progress (or not) the truth is that while  it is technically possible this could, over time, progress to something more significant, statistically there's no reason to believe it would any more than someone else's trace mitral regurge. Most mitral incompetence is found when it's quite marked anyway. Since almost everyone has some trace regurge (the mitral valve is designed in a very interesting way, but its engineering causes it to be less than perfect most of the time), it still works just fine. Yours is just fine too.   If this were a common precursor of trouble I'd be saying so. In fact, this is a finding so common it's truly unremarkable. I often wonder if anyone has a textbook perfect mitral valve.  Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and  please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While it is not unreasonable to ask such a question, since you haven't been diagnosed with hypertension (although your home monitor certainly suggest it), there is generally little problem with normal airline flights even with people who have diagnosed high blood pressure. However, it is prudent to ask. You should probably schedule a visit with your doctor and have serial blood pressure checks done to ascertain whether (and if so,  how severe) your hypertension is.  Home monitors can often be wrong,  and the number you quote here, while definitely higher enough to qualify, could be a \"part-time\" reading (our pressures do generally vary a great deal during the course of a day) or the monitor could be inaccurate,  which often happens. Better to not self-diagnose. Have your doctor check, and have him also give you the green light to fly. It shouldn't be a problem, even if you are mildly hypertensive.  Hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been weaning of off Cymbalta for the past month and have also stopped taking Yaz (a birth control pill).  I began taking Wellbutrin 75mg a month ago with no side effects but energy and a connection to life again.  The wellbutrin has already helped my depression so much but since I moved up to 150mg my blood pressure has been high, like 146/100 last night and my pulse rate has not gone below 100. When I had my son a year a go I had some issues with hypertension and was treated and a few months later it subsided so I stopped taking meds for it.  But this past week with my BP so high I began taking them again.  My blood pressure has leveled out but is still high at times.  I've been taking it every 2 hours or so.  My main concern is my pulse which has been over 100 for several days, I've been out of breath and dizzy at times.  Could this be caused by the Wellbutrin?  Yesterday it got up to 133 and when I am lying still or sitting it is between 105 and 115.  I am very worried and out of town for the holidays.  Thanks for any direction.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hypertension, pulse rate and Wellbutrin XL",
    "content": "Hi there -  Elevated blood pressure and sinus tachyacardia  are both potential (and relatively common) side effects of Wellbutrin. Tachycardia (faster than normal/faster than 100 beats per minute) in particular is common, reported by more than 10 per cent of users. Elevated BP occurs in about 5 per cent. Wellbutrin, then, is a very likely cause of both symptoms. The shortness of breath and dizziness are possibly related dizziness is another commonly reported side effect, much less so shortness of breath). Collectively it seems very likely the Wellbutrin is the culprit, and your doctor may want to try a beta blocker to control your BP, which would also slow your heart rate some (unless that's already the kind of BP drug you're taking). The elevated BP is actually a greater concern than the tachy heart rate. Both should even out with time, but high BP isn't something we'd want to just leave alone. If you're not already on a beta blocking drug this is something you might want to try (or add). A low dose of a cardioselective beta blocker like metaprolol might work well, and is less likely than some of the older ones to exacerbate depression (we don't want to undo the great effect the Wellbutrin's had).   Hopefully this is helpful to you. Relaxation exercises may help some, but the heart rate should, over time, come down closer to normal as your body adjusts to the doseage of Wellbutrin. The BP needs to be kept at a reasonable level. It's not morbidly high, but higher than we like to see. If you can reach your doctor and discuss the possibility of at least a temporary prescription for metaprolol (long-acting would be best, at one of the lower doses such as 25 or 12.5 mg) it would likely make enough of a difference to help you feel more relaxed about the  side effects til they subside.  Best of luck to you. I hope your long holiday weekend is a good one. Do your best to relax and  enjoy it. Please follow up with us.\n\n",

What makes Tylenol PM a sleep  aid is a small amount of diphenhydramine (the active ingredient in Benadryl). Again, no problem there. You may feel more sleepy at night after taking Tylenol PM while taking Lisinopril/HCTZ, simply because one of the more commonly reported side effects of Lisinopril is drowsiness (also lightheadedness). If you're going to sleep anyway, this shouldn't be a problem.   Hope this helps.\n\n",

BP was good throughout pregnancy...only got 2 high readings and I was extremely anxious during both (readings really weren't THAT high...maybe 130-140/85-95).  When I wasn't anxious, BP was good.  Got put back in hosp 5 days after c-section because of high BP (190/120).  Stayed for 2 nights and had several tests run (echocardiogram, CT of lungs, ultrasound of legs, blood work...all came back normal).  Have since been diagnosed with anxiety/panic attacks and my primary care dr. thinks that I was having a panic attack at the time my BP was 190/120...one other instance of a panic attack, my BP reached 180/110.  I have been put on Lexapro 10 mg once daily and Xanax .05 approx 6 times daily until my Lexapro kicks in.  Have since had several other tests run...EKG's, another echocardiogram, and wore a holter for 24 hours...cardiologist said all looks good, but put me on BP medicine b/c my BP was something like 135/93 in his office, even after I explained I was very anxious (cardiologist put  me on HCTZ 12.5 mg every other day and toprol 12.5 mg every Monday and Thursday).  My general doctor does not think I need to be on these meds, especially since my BP was great before and during pregnancy.  Can anxiety and panic attacks shoot your BP up that much?  Should I be on these BP meds...they make me feel horrible!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Chronic anxiety and panic attacks can cause, in many individuals, really marked spikes in BP, far above what one would expect. Not everyone will spike to the degree yours does, but it still is a fairly common finding. There is also \"white coat syndrome\" to consider, especially during your last reading which resulted in your being placed on both a beta blocker and a drug containing a diuretic.   While I am not only not a doctor but not your attending doctor, I hesitate to argue against the blood pressure medications prescribed, but they do seem excessive (especially the HCTZ), in light of your history. The Toprol is a very low dose and could actually be beneficial in helping to manage the anxiety/panic attacks, but I do question the HCTZ. For someone with chronic elevated blood pressure this might be a good combination. You are what's known as a \"hot reactor\", an anxious person whose blood pressure spikes precipitously during spells of anxiety, but is normally fine. In fact, there is a test for this -- and please  don't try this at home, trust me -- whereing the patient's left arm is immersed in ice water and serial blood pressure readings taken. Hot reactors will show very abrupt and  marked BP elevation, while regular responders will have a slow, stead, less steep increase as the discomfort increases. I don't think you need be subjected to this, and your cardiologist may not even be familiar with the test. It's pretty irelevant here. The history is pretty clear. Hopefully Lexapro will be effective for you. It and other SSRI-type antidepressants can be effective in anxiety and panic disorder, but sometimes have the opposite effect, so if you find you're experiencing more agitation  rather than less, let your doctor know. Also, if things do seem to level out, be sure to taper down the Xanax, which is better used as a \"rescue\" drug than a therapeutic one, for panic attacks.   If the BP medications are making you feel poorly, by all means let the cardiologist know this,  and be assertive about the untoward side effects. It is entirely common to see spikes such as yours during panic attacks, and it is also common to see somewhat elevated to quite elevated BP during office visits, when patients are anxious. These are, as a rule, repeated later in the visit, assuming the doctor feels the patient has relaxed sufficiently. You know best how you feel and if you're anxious, so your testimony on that score has to be taken seriously.  I hope things beging to settle down for you very soon. Remember,if the Lexipro doesn't do the trick,  there are other, dedicated anxiolytic drugs such as Klonopin (clonazepam) which are very effective at reducing or eliminating panic attacks and anticipatory anxiety as well.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Based on both your family history and your athletecism, I would suggest a baseline cardiological workup just for the record. While the one-time blood pressure increase doesn't concern me, as it was very moderate and these things do happen, the chest pains and palpitations in a person of your height and  weight, when considered in light of extremely high fitness levels and with  such an early family history of heart disease, warrants a cautionary workup which can then be used as a baseline measure as well as a way to uncover any possible occult heart disease, which would, at this stage, most likely be structural rather than involving coronary arteries (although  with  the history, either is remotely possible).   I hope you will see a cardiologist just based on your fitness level, athletic regimen and family history. You probably don't have any disease currently, but this would be a very good time to establish an adult baseline for all your cardiac parameters.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You don't mention what your blood pressure readings have been (especially the higher ones), but based on your overall set of symptoms I would suggest seeing a PCP for a complete physical and,  if your blood pressure actually is elevated chronically, to find out why, since elevated BP can often be secondary to some other problem. Since high blood pressure rarely has any distinctive symptoms of  its own (it can sometimes, but usually it does not), the other  symptoms  are  actually of more concern and getting to the bottom of them could resolve the BP  question as well. On the other  hand, if you're one of those rare  people who actually can feel symptoms as a result of high blood pressure, that needs to be understood as well. However,  I strongly suspect that if your BP is, in fact, pathologically high, it  is  probably secondary to some other  problem, possibly one involving kidney or adrenal function. You certainly won't be prescribed blood pressure medication  unless you need it, and if there is an underlying problem that can be corrected then you may not need it at all.  I hope this  is  helpful.  Please do follow up with  your PCP and let us know what you learn. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "tibby, I, too, was recently told by my PCP that I had hypertension (this was in early July).  I'd had several borderline high-to-high readings at my regular Dr. visits for the past year or so.  I should also mention that I am perimenopausal, which, not so coincidently, is a common time for women to develop hypertension, as it can be related to the drop in estrogen and other important hormones.  Anyway,  my PCP decided to put me on Lisinopril at that point, and then two weeks later, added hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic).  He offered no other information or advice as to how I might assist in lowering my BP, other than with these prescriptions.  I hate taking drugs or depending on them for my well-being, so I immediately went home and did some research on my own into the various alternatives for lowering blood pressure.  I learned that if you are overweight, even losing 5-10 lbs. can make a difference in your blood pressure, and there are many other easy diet and exercise changes that can be done and readily found on the internet by Googling \"treatment for hypertension.\"  One of my favorite sites for any medical question is http://www.mayoclinic.com, obviously, a very reputable source.  So, I filled my prescriptions, just to have them on hand if needed, but I also bought a home BP monitoring cuff, began a sensible weight-loss program, lowered my sodium intake, added some vital supplements, etc.  In one month I lost 7 lbs., and really never missed the extra salt that I used to add during food prep, or to my plate.  I don't normally eat alot of prepared foods anyway, so it wasn't that big of an adjustment to reduce my sodium intake.  I also kept close watch on my BP, monitoring it at the same time every morning and every evening.  Over the course of that month, I watched it go from the 150-155/95-100 range down to 128/82 eventually.  I went for a followup visit in early August, where my BP reading was 127/86, and the Dr. reviewed the chart I'd been keeping during the month, showing the steady decline in readings.  He seemed rather surprised, and asked if I'd been doing yoga or some type of relaxation therapy!  Apparently, they don't usually see such an impressive result in only one month with the typical medications routine, and I guess it never occured to him that a little change in diet, some exercise and weightloss might actually work.  When I thought about it later, I was pretty appalled that these options were never even mentioned, at least as something I could do in conjunction with the medication.  In my opinion, most Drs. are far too quick to push drugs on their patients, and far too remiss in properly advising them about the alternatives, or things they can do in conjuction with taking medications.  That said, I would never advise or recommend that anyone do what I did without consulting their doctor first, as there are many variables to the causes of high BP that might, in fact, warrant testing and taking medication.  But, in my opinion, it can never hurt to educate yourself, and take a pro-active approach to your healthcare either.  To this day, I am maintaining my blood pressure in very healthy ranges without the use of medication.  Good luck, tibby.  I hope you are doing better.\n\n",

I too am proactive about my health like you and shuddered at the thought of being on drugs for the rest of my life. I was prescribed Telmisartan 40 mg due to high bp reading of 154/105. I took it for 5 days and experience signs of transient hypotensio with cold extremeties and felt like my heart was beating weakly and I had palpitations. My dr. reduced it to half and still I did not like it.  Encouraged by your experiences, I too have decided to buy a blood pressure monitor and went and got my dr to change my prescription to hydrochlorthiazide in case I needed it. I have always been a morning walker, now I have added some simple yoga exercises to y routine. I want to know if you took any magnesium supplements, cause apparently that is one of the things that a women may require more.  Here's wishing you continued good health, Cheers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The literature and common practice both dictate that Zanaflex (tizanidine) be discontinued by tapering off the drug gradually over a period of one to two weeks. While there may be some rebound effect if it has been taken on a regular basis for a considerable period of time, gradual reduction of the dose will usually prevent any significant rebound effect. There is no replacement or step-down drug, just tapering, which is often easier with the tablet form rather than capsules, but if capsule dosage is relatively high it can be halved, and then, if necessary, one's doctor can prescribe a lower dose to continue the tapering at a lower dose.  I hope this is helpful to you.\n\n",

    "title": "High blood pressure that WILL NOT come down",
    "content": "My grandmother has had high blood pressure for many years and has been on medication for it as long as I can remember (I'm 23 years old).  Around 3 years ago, her medication seemed to be doing no good, so her doctor changed medications.  The new one worked for a while, then her blood pressure creeped up again.  After about a year of this, her doctor sent her to a cardiologist in a larger town.  In September of 2007, and after 2 years of this problem, he finally admitted her for testing.  He thoroughly checked her kidneys; no problems.  He tested veins and arteries around her kidneys, heart, and neck; no blockage.  In fact he said she has the veins of a teenager.  He diagnosed her with stress, put her on xanax, and sent her home.  The xanax made her basically like a junkie as her body did not handle it well. Also after a couple of weeks on xanax her blood pressure went right back up again.  The doctor took her off of xanax since it was doing no good and changed her BP medication yet again.  Her medication has been changed more times than I can count in the past year and she told me that she has been diagnosed with congenitive heart failure (I believe that is what she called it).  Finally, after a year since the testing, he has decided to do a sleep apnea test.  She has trouble sleeping and is tired a lot during the day.  She also snores, so this is a possiblity.  What concerns me is that, even on medication, her BP has been staying around 150/105.  For some reason she just really isn't responding well to any medication that she has been on for the past 3 years.  She has also recently formed mild cataracts and complains of slight eye pain.  She is urinating constantly (not sure if this is just because of age - 72) and has always complained of leg pain and a little swelling in her calves.  If it turns out that sleep apnea is not the cause, we are at a loss.  We are desperate to save her because we know the effects of long-term high BP like hers. I know 95% of hypertension cases have no known cause, but since hers won't respond to medications it seems that it must be secondary to something else and we're running out of time.  If there is anything else that you can think of that may be causing this that I haven't already mentioned, please let me know.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High blood pressure that WILL NOT come down",
    "content": "Hello -  This must be very frustrating for you and especially for your grandmother. It does happen sometimes, and as you've correctly deduced, it almost always is secondary to something else. Sleep apnea is a frequent culprit, so this may be  the answer to the mystery.  If the sleep apnea theory doesn't pan out, the only other thing I can think of off hand that might be causing this (and which probably has been ruled out, but I'm not certain) is pheochromocytoma, which is an adrenal tumor. While these are usually found  atop the kidneys and growing on the native adrenal glands, they also can sometimes develop in other parts of the body, so are not always obvious (they can also be quite small and difficult to visualize). They produce additional  adrenaline, and this extra \"dose\" is what causes persisten and often inexplicable high blood pressure.   Given the history youv'e posted here, I have a strong sense the sleep apnea theory will turn out to be correct, and if so,  that should  lead to  stabilization of the problem. If not, and if pheochromocytoma is ruled out, then combination blood pressure therapy is the best likely hope of controlling the problem.  Please let us know how things go with the sleep study and generally update us. Best of luck to you and your grandmother.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: high initial BP reading... normal second",
    "content": "Hello -  There are a number of possible explanations for this. What is termed \"white coat syndrome\" usually takes place in a clinical setting and it is assumed this is why the anxiety-driven initial high readings take place. Of course anxiety can exist in other settings as well, and if there is concern over one's BP to start with, this could possibly be the explanation.  Another  possibility is that you walk into the room where you take your blood pressure, sit down and just take it, after having been up and active. One ideally should be sitting, relaxed, for a couple minutes before taking the reading, as the first one is likely to be higher due  to the activity involved in arriving at the place where the reading is taken.  Some people run lower than what you've quoted as your initial reading when active, but many do not, so if you try sitting quietly for a moment or so before you take your reading you may find this makes a difference. There's no other logical reason  for this to happen. It has to involve something that makes the cardiac output higher the first time, even if it's something you've just stopped doing -- or anxiety, which can have the same effect. Are you concerned about your blood pressure or other circulatory problems? If so, this could be the cause. In any case, waiting a couple minutes in a relaxed state should make the difference. Try it and let us know if it makes a difference.\n\n",

Last night took a pill and within 30 minutes my nose started bleeding...don't remember last time had a nose bleed.  I was actually concerned about low blood pressure so took bp and was 155/112.  I take bp medicine and it runs in a normal range so the pressure was quite high.  Over the next 12 minutes my bp continued to steadily rise peaking at 194/152 with pulse getting to 90.  Wife was driving me to hospital and as quickly as rose, started down and was normal within the next 30 minutes so drove back home without going into er.  I only had a sip or two of a mixed drink when nose started bleeding.

    "content": "Hello -  This is a very disturbing development and on the face of it wouldn't seem to make much sense -- but it happened. For the moment I would strongly suggest not using any ED drug until this can be sorted out. It was either a very dramatic and scary paradoxical reaction or else you somehow got hold of a bad pill. Save what's left, have it analyzed, be certain there wasn't something wrong with your Cialis.   Sometimes a rare patient will have a paradoxical reaction to a drug, but this is extreme. There is very likely something else going on here, since you take two drugs that lower blood pressure plus whichever ED drug you may be using at any given time. It's remarkable you're able to maintain sufficient blood pressure with all that on board at once. That your pressure went so very high so quickly suggests something really wrong somewhere, and while I can't begin to tell you what it is, but a defective lot of Cialis (a pretty unlikely but not impossible scenario) or a paradoxical reaction (which would require a whole rethinking of the ED situation) are two of the more likely things that come to mind.

    "title": "Re: Numbness in Arm",
    "content": "Hi there -  From your description of the numbness and the way it comes on and goes away, it would seem you have some orthpedic problem which is causing pressure on either a nerve in your arm and/or the blood supply serving it. The most common cause of this is probably thoracic outlet syndrome (TOS), in which one of the major nerves serving your arm and hand, as well as blood supply to the arm, pass between the collar bone and the  first (top) rib. If these bones become too close together (often  due to something as simple as poor posture or sometimes one is born with a tendency toward this and as the patient grows the bones become too close together and in  either case, this causes pressure on the nerve and/or the blood vessels, and the arm (usually the forearm, sometimes the \"pinky\" side of the hand, as well) can go numb. Raising it above one's head with this problem  usually will cause a cutting off of the  blood supply, but since raising it reverses the numbness for you, I still believe this is a very likely cause of your problem,  and that it  is simply working in reverse in your case.   There are other orthopedic possibilities as well, and they all should be explored if this becomes a chronic problem (look also for puffiness of the fingers and/or hand of the affected arm with TOS). It is certainly not heart-related, as it can be corrected by movement of the arm.   I  hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Greeneyes58,  It sounds as if you have two issues, high blood pressure and tachycardia.  The beta-blocker medications (the atenolol and toprol) are great choices since they block both the elevated heart rate and lower the blood pressure.  Unfortunately, it sounds like you are not able to tolerate this class of medicine.  The Avapro is a newer class of medicine known as an angiotensen recepter blocker.  It can be very effective at lowering blood pressure but does less to control heart rate.  There are a few other classes of blood pressure medicines.  None of them are quite as well suited at treating both the heart rate and BP issue but they may be worth a try if you are still having trouble.  I would suggest you see a cardiologist to discuss your treatment options and get a specialist recommendation for which treatment you should try.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hypertension and tachycardia",
    "content": "Hello -  That blood pressure, if it is chronically in that range, is not normal at any age. However, during the course of a day we all experience BP ups and downs for various reasons. You'll need to check your BP a couple times a day for about a week to be sure that wasn't just a coincidental spike. Situations (especially emotional ones) can cause that sort of thing momentarily. One reading isn't enough for a diagnosis of high BP. If you don't have a device at home to measure it then either use one of the machines found in some drugstores, or have your doctor recheck it several times. It may not be your normal pressure at all.  As for tachycardia, whatever makes the blood pressure rise can also cause the heart rate to rise. I'm not sure how you define tachycardia, and there are several possible causes for it, including emotions (anxiety and stress especially), caffeine, etc. What was the rate you considered to be tachycardia?   Also, what's going on in your life right now? Are you under stress? Are you an anxious person? At age 23 a lot can be going on. Hopefully your symptoms are transient and related to emotions. Only your doctor can tell for sure, though.   Please follow up with us here as needed. I hope this info is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been feeling pretty terrible for the past 4 months, weight gain of 15 lbs, new high blood pressure of 165/105 (have been put on a diuretic Hydrochloracyacide sp?), and just a general sense of feeling lousy. I am a 30 year old female, with two children 6 yrs and 3 yrs. Here are my recent lab results. Doctor's seem baffled as to what if anything is wrong with me. Hoping someone here might be able to help. Thanks. Just reporting mostly on odd numbers (others numbers in normal ranges). My blood pressure has been down around 127/75 since starting meds. Any idea what could be causing hypertension at such a young age? Oh, and I am 5'5\" 140 lbs (even after weight gain), not overweight.   Here is my recent blood work.

    "content": "Hello, Generally in a young person who is not overweight or a smoker, the hypertension is caused by genetic factors.  Some people are just wired that way and it can develop at any time.  It can also be secondary to other problems such as chronic kidney problems.  Hormones play a factor and this is probably the hereditary part.  Because we can reduce some of the risk with a healthy diet, exercise and avoiding bad habits such as smoking and excess alcohol, we tend to think we can prevent all of it but in truth, a small percentage will still have it in spite of their best efforts.  This doesn't mean you shouldn't continue to do these good things, since the bad lifestyle will make it worse and cause other problems.  But, just realize that not everything can be prevented.  You should take your blood pressure regularly to get a good picture of the average, since some fluctuation is normal.  You may need to take medication for high blood pressure for life.  At least there are effective treatments.  Your doctor will monitor and experiment with medications until you have the right one.  Some people even require more than one to do the job since there are different categories of medications that can help.  After you become stabilized you will likely return every six months to be monitored. Whenever you take a diuretic it is important to have your labs checked regularly to be sure you don't lose other important electrolytes such as potassium and magnesium and you must drink plenty of water daily.  Good luck.\n\n",

Six weeks ago, a Saturday, was feeling sick, cold sweat, shaky inside feeling, discomfort left chest and shoulder area...   Blood pressure had spiked to 170/117... went to ER, did a cardiogram - found borderline (something, can't remember what it was called!!)... 3 weeks later, sent me for a stress test and heart scan - blood pressure had come down a bit by then, 127/91...  stress test/heart scan was normal...  today, 6 weeks later, bp is back down to normal for me, 117/78, but have almost daily chest/shoulder discomfort...  I was walking 5.5 kms per day, fast walk up until 6 weeks ago, find I'm too short of breath now...  always seem to have some kind of burning 'aching' sensation in chest... my husband says he's certain I have sleep apnea - he says I stop breathing during the night - scares him to death he says, he says just when he goes to wake me up, I finally take a breath...  I know that I've woken myself up a few times, feeling like I forgot to breath - wake up panicky...  Any ideas what caused this bp spike and this chest/shoulder discomfort that's still there?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden spike in BP",
    "content": "Hello -  While you've gotten a pretty definitive green light from  the negative stress test and nuc scan, it would seem something is still not quite right. It may not be heart related, however. First, though, the issue of the blood pressure spike at the time of the chest and shoulder pain: this often happens in such a setting due to anxiety (some people are what are known as \"hot reactors\" and situational anxiety can cause a brief, marked spike in blood pressure such as you exhibited at the time).   You did all the right things and although the stress test and nuc scan are very useful, they do not constitute the \"gold standard\" for corornary disease diagnosis -- this is done only via cardiac catheterization and angiogram. Still, in a step-based diagnostic process, the angiogram would probably be contraindicated unless your stress test had shown some significant abnormality. Nothing showed up, so unless your symptoms continue or increase, there is a great likelihood that you're ok in the  heart department.   If you do, in fact, suffer from sleep apnea (and it is usually discovered by  a spouse, for obvious reasons), then you are at some increased risk for heart disease. From your description of the nocturnal episodes it sounds as though you may have sleep apnea or you may be experiencing nocturnal panic attacks. Still, the fact that you can no longer sustain your former level of exercise without symptoms is troubling, and I think you'd be wise to bring this to the attention of your primary physician, along with the possibility of sleep apnea (diagnosis of this is usually accomplished via a sleep study). But there's more...  What's happening could be as simple as an orthopedic problem which is causing the pain and some restriction of ability to inhale properly, or it could be as off-target as atypical, exercise-induced asthma, which often can cause chest tightness and pain (due to use of accessory muscles). If this latter is the case, it could also explain your episodes of nocturnal breathing difficulties. For the record, both nocturnal and exercise-induced asthma are very often secondary to gastric acid reflux disease (GERD), which is often missed early on as the cause. This is also well-worth exploring, especially since you have done so well with all your cardiological exams.   To sum up: unlikely but possible occult heart disease, possible anxiety disorder, possible sleep apnea, very possible combo of anxiety/hot reactor profile plus asthma secondary to GERD.   Hopefully this will give you something to bring to your doctor's attention, since something is definitely impairing your exercise tolerance compared with the recent past. Probably not heart disease, probably not sleep apnea, very possibly anxiety and GERD. All need to be considered.  Best of luck to you. Please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pain between shoulders and lower back upon excitement.",
    "content": "Hello -  What you describe could be due to muscle tension (although you describe it as \"internal\" in quality), could be orthopedic, or could be due to an increase in blood pressure. It would be really helpful if you were able to check your BP at the time this happens. That may, however, be impractical, in which case there is an in-office test some doctors will perform, to see if the patient is what's known as a \"hot reactor\", someone whose inner tension and/or anxiety during certain situations will convert into increased cardiac output, increased BP and elevated heart rate. The reason it is important to know if this is the case with a given individual is that it can, in the precence of occult heart disease or a weakened segment of the aorta or other blood vessel, and even possibly cause a heart attack or promote (or cause rupture of) an aneurysm somewhere if one already exists.   If your blood pressure does, in fact, spike dangerously during these periods of anxiety and tension, then you would want to treat the condition as though it were chronic hypertension, because sudden spikes can at times be as dangerous as constantly elevated BP. The fact that you have what seems to be internal or visceral pain between your shoulder blades and also lower in your back, could be atypical angina, could be transient pain related to spiking BP, or could even be caused by increased pressure within a thoracic aortic aneurysm. Of course,  as I said earlier, the pain could simply be due to muscle tightness or an orthopedic problem,  but the fact that you recognize a rather intense level of anxiety associated with the specific situation,  and pain occurs simultaneously, it is well worth learning whether or not you actually do experience BP spikes at those times. If you don't, you probably still would do well to have a cardiological workup for the baseline findings, since you are now at what is generally regarded as a higher risk age-span (and oddly enough, while the risk begins to rise dramatically around age 50, it begins to decline, statistically, later on). The fact that you have no heart history thus far is a fine thing; however, it's impossible  to know with reasonable certainty there are \"no heart problems\" without a timely workup. The symptoms you describe are as good a reason as any to schedule such an exam, which can serve as a very useful set of parameters (for what's \"normal\" for you, in particular) in the future.  I hope this is helpful and that you will take some steps to at the very least learn whether or not you actually do experience significant BP elevation at the times you describe. That alone would go a long way toward easing the concern.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am writing on behalf of my sister, who was once again hospitalized for severely high BP, which fluctuates rapidly.  She is a 50 WF with a positive family hx for essential hypertension which is well and easily controlled in both parents with common rx.  In a matter of minutes her BP can go from normal to stroke levels (e.g. 220+/120+) and then back again.  An example, she said yesterday she woke up, her BP was low at 95/50.  An hour later her BP was 215/130.  Thirty minutes after that it was 160/100.  Ten minutes later that it was a normal 130/80.  The sharp rise in BP is accompanied by rapid heart rate, crushing sensation in her chest, and head aches.  This has been going on for at least a decade, but frequency was rare (a few times a month).  In the past few months, though, frequency has been increasing to multiple times per day, and she has been hospitalized numerous times by her internist or cardiologist.  They say it is NOT an MI.  They keep treating her with the same common BP meds (e.g. diruetics) but it does no good and until today, the keep running the same tests with negative results.  Today they did an angiogram (no significant problem found) and also did something to examine her kidneys because the thought she was at risk of kidney failure (no problems found).  Maybe 8 years ago she was dx with Wolff-Parkinson syndrome, with similar but infrequent symptomology and they did something to zap a section of her heart.  Symptoms disappeared for maybe six months, then have been gradually returning in frequency and severity until the frequent episodes began within the past few months.  As her brother, my concern is they keep running the same tests, trying various meds to treat essential hypertension, but nothing has done any good, and she's getting worse.  They keep her in the hospital for a few days, and then discharge her with no answers or no game plan for what to try next that would be different.  I was always taught \"insanity\" is continuing to try the same thing over and over again, expecting different results.  Any ideas what might be going on here?  After researching this issue, so far the only answers I have found that seem to match her sx are: mixing prozac with MAOIs (she doesn't take antidepressants), chronic marijuana usage (I'm 99% positive she doesn't), or baroreflex failure.  Or maybe its related to her Wolff-Parkinson's, but her doctors know that and have ignored it thus far.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello psyclops615 - When your sister had the WPW accessory bypass tract in her heart ablated you say she had been having similar symptoms but they improved briefly after the ablation. I don't know of any reason the two would be related in any way, but I do find that interesting. I'm going to throw something out here, even though I suspect it's already been covered in the course of all the testing she's undergone, and that is pheochromocytoma. Stop me if you've heard this before. It is a condition marked by small adrenal tumors, more often then not benign, and most often (but not always) located on the kidney in the native adrenal glands. Sometimes they are not there, though, and can actually occur almost anywhere inside the thoracis cavity. They can be very small and difficult to spot at times. They are composed of adrenal tissue and so secrete adrenaline rather randomly. Pheochromocytoma often features sudden spikes in blood pressure. The fact that her BP can also be quite low at times would sound more like baroreflex failure or perhaps some variation on dysautonomia, a condition in which the autonomic nervous system does things that are inappropriate (such as raising or lowering BP when an  opposite action or none at all would be the correct response).  Again, while I know of no reason why having an RF ablation to correct WPW syndrome should cause the symptoms to abate for a while, I do find this fact interesting and perhaps worth further exploration. Neurological and endocrinological workups, if not already done, would seem likely directions from here.   As I was reading your post, the definition of insanity you made reference to had already occurred to me as well. It would certainly seem time to branch out, even into areas not normally explored. The family Hx of hypertension may be acting as a red herring.   Your sister is fortunate to have you as an advocate. Keep prodding, and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "John, thank you for a very helpful response.  I had not heard of pheochromocytoma until today, but someone else was helping me research this issue today and came across that, so you're the second person today to mention it.  I read what your web site had to say, and it is clearly a possibility which we need to mention for her doctors to consider.  I saw where a test for pheochromocytoma is to administer clonidine, which interestingly is also what I read as a treatment for baroreflex failure and what I used many years ago (in the form of a catapres patch) to stop smoking.  Vanderbilt U was doing a research study on that, I mentioned it to a doctor friend, and he gave me a couple of patches...worked for me, but I guess the research never panned out or was surpassed by nicotine replacement therapies.  I have mentioned both possibilities to my sister to discuss with her doctor.  On an encouraging note, I found a local clinic at Vanderbilt that specializes in the treatment of ANS disorders like baroreflex failure and got their phone number for my sister to call.  On the Wolff-Parkinson-White that she was dx many years ago, I checked with my sister and had the symptoms a bit wrong.  She was having mild BP spikes then, but the primary symptom was irregular heart beat and rate.  I recall now that she went around wearing a Holter monitor off and on for months.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again - You're very welcome! Isn't it strange that pheochromocytoma came up twice in one day and had never been mentioned before? Maybe that's a good sign. There is the clonidine test and also there is  a 24 hour urine test which is often a preliminary screen. It i(clonidine) s a treatment for baroreceptor reflex failure as well, and to make that  a trifecta, that's pretty interesting about your having been part of a smoking cessation study involving the same drug! Then to top off all that you found an ANS clinic at Vanderbilt. There are so many coincidences!  It does all sound very promising, though.  As for the WPW thing, I just figured \"You never know,\" but in a way I'm relieved because I kept trying to figure out how that could have worked. :)  Thanks for updating us and please  do stay in touch..\n\n",

    "content": "John,      Well, my sister was in her local hospital for several days, then transferred to Vanderbilt for two days.  They ran a bunch of tests, including both hospitals doing a 24 hour urine to test for pheochromocytoma, but found nothing.  They decided since nothing they have tried has helped, it must be her fault (e.g. she must not have been taking her meds), despite the fact that while in the hospital they had control of her meds and some were given IV  When discharged, she was still having episodes of high BP, although not as high (over 200 systolic, 120 diastolic) as she had been having.  From some of what she told me about questions she was asked, I can only guess that they might be thinking Munchhausen's, and they even brought in a psychiatrist to see her (which really pissed her off when she found out), although I defy them to come up with an explanation as to how she might be causing this or why, if they were correct, she hates being in the hospital and now refuses to go back.    I did speak with her cardiologist, who has since fired her as a patient.  He sounded very frustrated and fed up with not being able to help her, and clearly thought she was the cause.  I tried to get him to look at how if he felt like giving up, imagine how she must feel, but apparently to no avail.   No ideas what to do next, and she is so fed up she doesn't want to do anything.  Some of the meds they discharged her with she is taking, one she says she told them she refused to take because she had taken it before, it didn't help, and caused too many side effects, but they prescribed it any way as if they could care less.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello psyclops615 - Well that sure would seem like a waste of time and energy. Hopefully something positve will eventually come out of it, although at this point I'm not at all sure how that might happen.  The frustration of doctors is often quite palpable when they are faced with a seemingly unanswerable question. Your sister certainly doesn't sound, based on what you've posted here, like she would be a candidate for Dx of Munchausen's, never mind the fact that she was, for a period, completely under the observation and management of hospital staff and providers which, as you point out, makes Munchausen's extremely  unlikely unless this were being played out on a TV drama. In fact that notion (Munchausen's) never entered my mind til this posting, and it just won't stick. It's fortunate no one actually said it out loud.   Still, her dismissal by her cardiologist seems like an awfully desperate (on his part) reaction to a difficult situation.   Hopefully something more will emerge with time that will expose the culprit in this baffling situation. In the meantime about all I can suggest is that you both hang in there and, of course, explore additional diagnostic sources.   I wish you and your sister the best. I also wish I had more to offer. Do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Since my last post my sister has seen several different doctors, been hospitalized several times for dangeously high BP and is back in the hospital again one day after having spent two weeks in the hospital!  After exhausting treatment options in her hometown, she had been going to a cardiologist at Vanderbilt who did the same thing as every single doctor she's seen, put her on a variety of anti-hypertensives, none of which have done anything.  I've lost track of all the different things she's been on, but she said last week she was on 14 different medications, 5 of which were for hypertension.  Clondine is the only thing that seems to help her BP a little, but it turns her into a zombie.  Over two weeks ago she went to her local emergency room, short of breath, chest pain, and red flushed face, and with very high BP, so they admitted her.  But she couldn't hold down any food, and kept throwing everything up, including all the pills they gave her.  So, the cardiologist called in a gastroenterologist, who determined her gall bladder needed to be removed.  So they scheduled her for immediate surgery.  One small complication...they can't do surgery with her BP so high.  So they feed her more BP pills, which of course she promptly vomits back.  Each day they schedule her for surgery the next day, only to determine the next day her BP is too high to do surgery.  Duh!  They've been pumping her full of various combinations of anti-hypertensives for over six months now, without any results, so they keep doing the same thing over and over again!  This went on for two weeks until finally they did surgery Tuesday and removed her gall bladder.  She said the surgeon said it was the worst gall bladder he'd ever seen.  She was discharged yesterday.  The only problem is her BP is still over 200/120 + and she still cannot eat anything or hold down any food or pills.  Today at the urging of a neighbor she went to see another new doctor because she was still in such terrible shape, who brought in another new cardiologist and she's back in the same hospital again with the very same symptoms she had two weeks ago.  This cardiologist thinks it obviously wasn't her gall bladder that was causing her g/i disturbance so he's bringing in another gastroenterologist.  And he thinks her BP is related to her hx of WPW...which her previous hometown cardiologist said was impossible, and then when she told the cardiologist at Vanderbilt about her hx of WPW, he initially thought that could be it but later decided no way.  Are all these doctors \"nucking futs\", incompetent morons, or is her case just beyond medical comprehension?  With BP that high and unable to eat anything now for over two weeks, she's going to die and all they do is go around in circles.  All they've been able to determine now after numerous hospitalizations and surgery is that her BP is normal when she's asleep.  Anyone have any ideas how to save her life?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again! I am really sorry - and somewhat discouraged - to learn that so little has changed in your sister's situation. Well, I guess there have been changes, but nothing about the essential problem has changed. I have to admit it seems to be a really bizarre thing. As I was reading your post I was hoping I'd find the gallbladder was somehow causing reflex hypertension. The gallbladder sometimes can affect the sympathetic nervous system, although I don't understand the mechanism. But that obviously wasn't the answer. Further, although I can think of no causative connection between WPW and malignant hypertension, the electrical derangement is due to an abnormally developed nerve pathway. This got me to grabbing at straws, one of which is that perhaps in rare WPW patients there are other, cardiovascular-related nerve tissue derangements, since those develop in vitro at about the same time. Perhaps there is something wrong with the baroreceptors or some other part of the  sympathetic nervous system. I'm beginning to wonder if maybe there isn't some other accessory pathway that's developed early on in her sympathetic nervous system which carries inappropriate signals to this area and tricks something into believing the blood pressure needs to go  up. It could cause a chronic constriction of the blood vessels, which would naturally keep the pressure much higher than it's supposed to be.   Has anyone tried givng her even a single dose of nitroglycerine? It is a potent vasodilator. If she  responded, even momentarily, to this with a significant drop, then it would suggest something is causing a constant  constriction  of the blood vessels like  an overdose of pseudoephedrine would. If such a trial was successful then at least a nitroglycerine patch might keep her blood pressure lower temporarily. This is, of course, brainstorming out loud, but if there is  some short circuit that is causing any player in the blood pressure regulating mechanisms (again, WPW just led me to think if it can occur in the heart it might also exist somewhere else) then denervation by some method could  be the  solution to the problem. How this would be  determined and how it would be corrected I really don't know, but at this point we have to consider hypothetical scenarios which are  rarely seen. After all, it  is extremely rare to see a patient in which almost nothing will control the symptom.   I wish I had something more to offer. I don't think the doctors are nuts, but they may well be constrained by the need to think within the generally known and understood diagnostic algorithims. Unfortunately, once in a great while a square peg turns up. It takes someone  with unique vision as well as tremendous knowlege to solve this sort of mystery. I only hope you and your sister find such a person and soon.   Again, I wish  I could offer something more, but this would seem to fall outside the box. Hopefully someone else here has more insight into this  sort of problem, which is certainly rare, strange, and infuriating. My thoughts are with your sister and with you as well, as you have invested so much energy, time and emotion into helping to get this solved.   Thanks for the update, and  please do let us know of anything new you may learn.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the response, and for trying, John.  As you can probably tell, I am extremely frustrated with the situation and fearful for my sister.  Yes, she's been on nitroglycerine prn, and according to my sister it did intially help some....not lower her bp to normal but bring the systolic down below 200.  However, the night she went to the er three weeks ago, she said her BP was way up despite her regular oral meds, she took a nitroglcerine, and it did nothing to help at all.  After being in the hospital for two weeks, and being home less than one day, she has now been back in the hospital for about a week now, under the care of a new internist and new cardiologist.  At least these guys are willing to try something different.  I'm not sure what all she's on now, but they gave her hypertension meds via IV and her BP has been down (for her, she said around 160/100) for several days.  She said her doctor said anyone can get your BP down with meds via IV; if so, I have to wonder why the geniuses who were previously her attendings kept giving her meds orally when she could not keep ANYTHING down and thus had to keep rescheduling her gall bladder surgery for two weeks because her BP was so high.  Of course, with all the IV fluids they're giving her, she looks puffy and bloated, like she needs about a ton of lasix, so that probably is causing her BP to be up some.  But, according to her, this is the best BP control anyone has been able to achieve for her in months of trying.  The current doctors gave her an enema thinking the recent bout of regurgitating everything might be due to constipation.  Whatever they're doing, she has improved, and has been able to hold down a liquid diet for a couple of days.  However, when I called her earlier she was vomitting, which she attributed to all the junk (don't know what) they're making her drink in prep for a colonoscopy tomorrow.  (When I had mine done a couple of years ago, all I had to do was drink some laxative mixed in a gallon of Gatorade.)  She had endoscopy during her previous hospitalization, so I guess they're trying the other end this time. ;)  At least she seems to have more faith in these doctors, and unlike some previous ones, both seemed to have made A's in Bedside Manner 101.  She says her current cardiologist has plans to look into the possibility of recurrence of WPW after they've been able to keep her BP out of the danger levels.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, since I last wrote, my sister has practically been living in hospitals.  They'd put her in for a couple of weeks, get her BP down with IV meds, get her stomach stable enough where she could hold down jello, counsel her to take her BP meds orally, and then discharge her.  She'd be back within 48 hours with high BP, once almost 300/200 she said, and vomitting everything up.  They'd put her in ICU, get her BP down again via IV, and lecture her about taking her pills outpatient.  Duh!  She hasn't been able to hold anything down before they took out her gall bladder a couple of months ago.  What makes them think she can hold down her BP pills?  Her local hospital finally gave up on her and transferred her to a major hospital here in the city last week.  Of course, sending her records with her would have been too easy, so the doctors here have repeated everything that's been done the last 20X she was hospitalized.  But at least she finally got a doctor that was willing to think outside of the box, didn't assume it was all in her head and bring in another psychiatrist, and entertain the notion I've been saying all along...she does not have the normal hypertension that many people get as they age, and treating her for essential hypertension is a total waste of time.  They ran some new tests on her yesterday and have concluded her renal artery is almost completely blocked.  According to my sister, her doctor says that's what's been causing her rapid BP spikes all along.  It may also explain why one time they claim her kidneys have shut down and she needs dialysis, but the next time they test her her kidneys are fine.  It may even explain all the g/i problems she's been having and why she hasn't been able to eat for many weeks now.  They're doing the cath in the morning, and possibly put a stent in.  Maybe months-long the nightmare is almost over?  Thanks for listening, John, and trying to help.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, it looks like our rejoicing was premature.  My sister said the cardiologist dx her as having a blocked renal artery on the basis of an MRA (not MRI, and I'm not familiar with an MRA although I gather it is somewhat similar) that showed her renal artery was almost completely blocked.  So today they did the cath and were prepared to put a stent in.  Only once they got in they found absolutely no blockage at all.  So we're back to square one again.    The attending's brilliant plan?  They're going to discharge her and refer her to their pain program and also to a psychiatrist because they think she's depressed.  OF COURSE she's depressed.  This has been going on for almost a year now, but they have the cause and effect backwards.  And now they're on my turf because I used to work with both populations, and helped start their pain program, so I know that program is for people with chronic pain problems where traditional medicine has done everything it can, and the patient now needs to learn to better cope with a chronic condition.  What he's really saying is I have no clue as to what to do next, so I'm going to punt and cover my ass, so I can safely wash my hands of the case and be rid of her.  Which is what has happened with the last dozen or so doctors she's seen.  So, what does the future hold in store?  Unless someone can figure out what the true etiology really is, she will be discharged tomorrow, unable to eat or hold down any food, much less the BP pills they give her, and within two or three days she will be rehospitalized with BP spiking at over 250/150, which is what has happened the last several times she was discharged.  And they'll blame her for allegedly not taking her BP pills and want to call in a psychiatrist.  Anyone have a clue?  Here are her primary sx over the past year:  Fluctuating BP that can go from normal to stroke levels in just a few minutes.  It stays fairly normal when she's asleep, although it sometimes tends to start rising shortly before she awakes,  During the day it can fluctuate from 120/70 to typically around 230/150, but it has gone much higher.  When very high it is usually accompanied by SOB, flushing in the face, crushing sensation in the chest, and severe headache.  Over the past several months:  Increasing G/I disturbance to where she has been able to eat practically nothing for the past three months, except for a bland liquid diet when given something like phenergan right before eating.  She reports constant nausea, frequent vomitting to the point of dry heaves, general pain in her abdomen, and occassional sharp, shooting pain in her abdomen that she says feels like someone punched her in the stomach.  Phantom kidney problems.  Three times now, to my knowledge, she's been told her kidneys were completely shut down and she may need dialysis.  But when seen by specialists she's told her kidneys are fine.  Sometimes she urinates normally, other times she can go days without.  Right now she has not urinated in about 36 hours so they put in a cath.  Phantom renal artery blockage.  They said it was almost completely blocked yesterday, today it is fine.    Phantom gastro paresis.  She was dx with that last week in her local hospital, which is the main reason they supposedly sent her to a major hospital here in the city.  And shortly after being admitted here, she was seen by a gastroenterologist who in a matter of minutes said she definitely does not have gastro paresis and whom she has not seen since.  Since then, she's been seen primarily by the internist/attending, a cardiologist, and now by a radiologist.  Gall bladder surgery.  She never had problems with her gall bladder before, but a couple of months ago they decided that's what was causing all her g/i problems and removed her gall bladder.  She said the doctor who removed it said it was the worst gall bladder he's ever seen.  Except she still can't eat and still has the same g/i problems, only worse.  Phantom cirhossis.  Two days ago they told her her liver was severely swollen.  Today it is fine.  A couple of times now they were convinced she had pancreatitis.  Only a couple of days later she didn't have pancreatitis.  Yesterday she was running a fever of 101, etiology unknown.  Today she is fine.  She doesn't think she was given any antibiotics.  Eye problems.  She's seen an opthamologist a couple of times now because on progressively bad vision, who thinks she has hemmoraging in the eyes, probably as sequellae to the bouts of high BP.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been wanting to reply to \"psyclops615\" ever since I read his story last fall.  But it wasn't until today that I was able to register to the forum.  I want to let him know that his sister is not alone.  Her story is my story!!  I too, have had EXTREMELY fluctuating blood pressure episodes for the past year.  I have been rushed by ambulance to the hospital 6 times in 11 months with BP reading of 220+/140+.  I feel like I am suffocating, going to pass out, have chest pressure and nausea, dizziness - and feel like I am \"on my way out.\"  It is really scary.  Especially since these episodes come with no warning - sometimes while I am sleeping or just relaxing or sitting at my desk and sometimes when I am upset. In between episodes my BP is uncontrollable.  I am on Labetolol and the BP fluctuates constantly (and within minutes) from as low as 90/55 to 160/95. And it makes me feel weird, and I always have a slight headache and ringing in my ears. My doctor is baffled.  I have had every test in the book for kidney and heart problems. And everything is normal!  And like the woman in the story,  I too had a history of WPW and had a catheter ablation done 9 years ago.  And I also am wondering if the long term effects of the ablation could have something to do with what I am going through now.  I noticed that ever since the ablation, I lose my breath easily.  I have always been  very active - mountain biking, kayaking and hiking.  I still do all those things, but ever since the ablation, I can't make it up a hill without stopping because I get  totally winded.  I am one who hates elevators and had always walked the stairs as long as it was under 10 flights.  But now it takes me too long, because I have to stop so often to get my breath.  And for the past two years, I noticed that cuts and bug bites can take up to 8 months to heal - they always get infected and fester for months.  I have been checked for diabetes and my sugar is normal.  But something is causing poor circulation.  I would love to know if there are any others out there who have had ablations and are experiencing the same things. If so, I would like to hear from you!  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry I haven't been on for quite a while but until today there's been nothing new to report.  But I've got some good news about my sister that might yield some hope for deb and bj who report similar symptoms to what my sister had.  Basically most doctors she'd seen had given up on her, many of whom \"fired\" her assuming she was either willfully noncompliant with meds or assuming it is all \"in her head\" and wanting her to see a psychiatrist.  But my mother had seen a report on some TV news show about someone with similar sx that was helped by a new experimental device being investigated I think out of Rochester, NY.  Naturally this would not be covered by her insurance, but as she checked into it more and thought this might be helpful, we we thinking of flying her up there and paying for it ourselves.  But my sister's perseverance paid off and she discovered they were thinking of opening clinical trials here at a local major hospital.  She got signed up right away, was accepted into the program, and had surgery yesterday to implant a device under her collar bone that is attached to the baroreceptors on the carotid artery and applies a small electrical charge.  I think its called a baroreflex activating stimulator and I can post a web site that tells more about it and the company that makes it.  The bottom line is so far the indication is that its going to work great.  When they first tried it and applied a small charge her BP dropped 60 points.  They have to wait 30 days for her to heal before they can program it and use it all the time, but tests yesterday and today have the staff very optimistic it will be successful.    I gather they've been experimenting with the device in Europe for awhile, because they were flying in a doctor from Europe to supervise the local surgeon but he had to cancel so they got someone he'd trained here in the states.  It's only been done less than 3 dozen times here in this country, and since my sister is the first in this region, they will not be using her data in the clinical trial so she gets to keep the device on all the time instead of on/off like they will be doing with patients in the clinical trials.    The bottom line is we're now hopeful this will allow her to return to a normal life, so there is hope for people with similar problems.  So, don't give up bj and deb!  And to all the doctors who wanted to put the blame back on her for this, all I can say is, \"Ththththththth!\"\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again psyclops615 -  Last things first in this instance, since I have been away for a while and have now caught up with your sister's travails and this newest development. I will also reply to the others in the thread, here, but you were the originator, and your poor sister is the one who went through all this craziness.   I am so relieved to hear what you've reported! I  have a notion that a few (probably very few, but I know of no studies one way or the other so far) who have had radiofrequency ablations just may  have some other parts of their autonomic nervous system affected by the procedure, depending on variables too numerous and complex to cover here. However, this would possibly explain why this very disturbing problem began and is now responding to the new therapy, which is one I only recently learned of myself. I am very encouraged to hear this, as the nightmare may now be ending. You have been an incredible support for your sister during all this awfulness and you deserve something more than a medal for sure!   Please do keep us updated, and I am back, and I will be here!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello debhenry and welcome to the forum -  Right off the bat I am intrigued by the similarities between your situation and that of psyclops' sister's. Since you both formerly had WPW and ablations I am suspecting that there is some heretofore unproven association between the two, especially since the autonomic nervous system is like the electrical system in, say, a home theater component, and many of the circuits are connected. That RF intruding, especially on part of an autonomic system which already had an abnormality (the WPW accessory bypass tract), may just mean that either the ablation somehow manages to affect the relatively distant baroreceptor apparatus, or that perhaps WPW, as a congenital defect, may also be associated with baroreceptor abnormalities. At any rate, this certainly does seem promising in the one case, and may well be worth bringing to the attention of your own doctors. I would also suggest you take note of the earlier suggestions as to what may have been causing the problem, such as pheochromocytoma, kidney problems, etc. Pheochromocytoma is very often associated with sudden spikes and drops in blood pressure due to abrupt output of excessive (and utterly unwanted) adrenaline from the little adrenal tumors which cause this condition.   Still, I  have a feeling the WPW/ablation link may be worth a first mention.   Best of luck to you and please do keep in touch here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello bjacob26, welcome to the forum  and to this thread -  This has certainly turned into quite an interesting and broad thread since last fall! You describe symptoms similar to those of the others here, but they are at least a little more consistent with what one encounters in many hyptertension patients. I  suspect, in your case, what you might want to do if you haven't already, is to go back to the early posts and responses in the thread and read the suggested potential causes (all of which did not pan out for psyclops' sister, but could be very useful to you). While you also could have some disorder of the baroreceptor system, it seems more likely that your problem is probably nearer the kidneys. Since many of the obvious possibilities have been explored and discounted by a good number of doctors in various specialties, it may be time for you to visit an endocrinologist, as many times kidney problems can cause this sort of spiking. And of course right on top of the kidneys sit our adrenal glands, which are sometimes plagued by a peculiar sort of tumor which causes a condition I've mentioned in the  responses above, called pheochromocytoma. This can cause rather sudden and often severe spikes in blood pressure, cardiac output, etc., and the tumors may not necessarily be located only on the adrenals, but can be very tiny and located almost anwhere inside the thoracic cavity.   One useful and fairly simple test for this is a  24 hour urine test to look for abnormal levels of adrenaline there. There are, of course, other tests as well, but if you haven't had this avenue explored I would highly recommend you ask for a referral to an endocrinology specialist, and to carefully read through all the rest of this thread as well. It would be far too much to repeat here, and it's already up there.   Meanwhile, I hope this finds you well and I hope you will keep us updated as to anything new you learn or anything at all.  Best of health to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John, Thank you for your response.  Since I have had every test possible for kidney and heart problems, I was very glad to hear that someone else might also think that there could be a connection between the ablation and the symptoms I am experiencing at times.  I have not felt the same since I had the ablation, as I have had problems with getting winded easily from the day I came home from the hospital.  Then when I went through menopause, the other symptoms with the blood pressure, etc. started.  So, it looks like hormones play a role in this too.  Knowing how complicated the human body is, it amazes me that more things don't go wrong with it! Thanks again for posting you comments.  I will keep watching this website for more information.

    "content": "Thanks for the support, John.  Nothing much new to report.  My sister's been having some pain and numbness post surgery which they say is normal for this type of invasive procedure and nothing to worry about at this point.  She was pretty miserable at first but is slowly getting better.  Her BP is now as bad or worse than it ever was...she said it was 250/150 at one point last week, so we can't wait for the end of the month when they can fly someone in to program the device and turn it on for good.  I was intrigued by some of the technical aspects...they program the device externally, I guess via something like wi-fi.  Deb, best wishes to you.  I'm as interested as John with the possible WPW connection.  Also, I might mention this all seemed to flare up about the time my sister began complaining of hot flashes as she went through menopuase, so I wonder if John is correct in thinking there might be a hormonal relationship here.  I'll need to ask her about the details and the exact proximity between her BP beginning to fluctuate and when she entered menopause.  Will keep y'all posted if any new developments, particularly after they turn the device on.\n\n",

That's still some pretty high BP, but maybe once things are running smoothly that will change. The programming is done via magnets as a rule, and usually is totally non-invasive and non-intrusive, although it can make the patient  feel odd for a moment or two during the process. This seems more likely in your sister's case because if that blood pressure drops to anywhere near normal she may feel quite lightheaded for a while. If that happens it will resolve, and it will be the best outcome (minus any lightheadeness) if it does. Please do let us know, and thanks for checking in  here.\n\n",

    "title": "Slight Left ventricle enlargement",
    "content": "I went to the ER one night a couple months ago because of a severe panic attack.  At the ER they did an EKG and a Chest X-ray all of which were negative.  They kept me for a little while and then about 4 hours later they did another EKG and some blood tests.  Everything came out fine there as well.  So I went home and a few days later I went to my doctor and he prescribed Prozac to me.  About a week in taking the Prozac I went back to my doctor because I was having mild heart palpitations and dizziness.  He did an EKG which showed slight Left Ventrical Enlargement but said everything else looked OK, so he sent me in to have a 24 hour Holter Monitor done just in case I was having \"episodes\" of something he didn't catch on the EKG.  His nurse called about 5 days later and said I was fine according to the Holter. I did experience my palpitations and dizziness during the test so I know they were on there.  She didn't offer any information on it at all though.     So my question is, do you think that is thorough enough? Also why did my left ventricle enlargement not show up in the ER after 2 EKG'S and a chest x-ray but showed up on the docs EKG a week later? If I have even slight left ventricle enlargement shouldn't I still be concerned?  Why did the doctor just shrug it off?  I suffer from severe anxiety and panic disorder and even mild agoraphobia and am now constantly focusing on my pulse rate and things like that.  If I stand up my heart rate increases dramatically (I am in horrible shape as well) and sometimes I will feel pressure in my head along with a slower heart rate after standing up and feel like I may black out.  But I never do.  My insurance just ran out and I cannot afford any kind of tests at the doc because I am jobless and certainly cannot afford an ER visit unless it's life threatening.. What should I do?  Should I trust my doc?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Slight Left ventricle enlargement",
    "content": "Hello dmbfan07c -  Since your left ventricular enlargement diagnosis has been made via EKG, and since this appeared very shortly after a negative finding on EKG, here are some observations that may help you feel better about this:   First, deep waves (high amplitude QRS complexes) on EKG are sometimes a first indicator of left ventricular enlargement. However, this is far from the Gold Standard for such a diagnosis, even if it happens to be regarded as not serious. An echocardiogram is the best (and, for some, the only) way to to determine if the left ventricle is enlarged or thickened, and this apparently was not performed.   Now then: you have acknowleged being a very anxious person. The recent \"excitement\" of an ER visit and the precipitating anxiety and panic preceding that may not have caused your cardiac output to become strong enough to cause \"false\" deep waves on your EKG, but that can often happen, and since by the time you saw the doctor in his office you'd had time to worry more about the potential problems you could have, this may have had you in a more agitated state (minus outright panic) and could account for the deep waves suggesting an enlarged left ventricle. At that time I would have hoped the doctor would have sent you for an echocardiogram in order to rule that in or out at once so you wouldn't have had it to worry about in the interim period.   So the thing that makes this a happy call is that you do not develop a true LV enlargement overnight. It takes a long time to develop, and there are almost always EKG indicators, not just off and on. So the odds are enormous that you do not have any enlargement of the LV. The palpitations and dizziness you experience are partly normal for the general population, and more common in the extremely anxious patient, who is aware not only of them, but of pretty much everything their hearts are doing at any given moment. This is not a criticism but an observation. It's not something you learned overnight, and you can't stop doing it overnight, but the good news is that generalized anxiety and panic disorder can be very well managed, which can usher in a whole new and far more satisfying life for you. It will require some work on your part, but it's worth it.   In the meantime, it is by far better to seek reasoned advice on things such as this concern about the enlarged LV, which of course nobody wants and would be a worrisome thing if there were any real evidence for it. The evidence you have provided actually argues against it. Your ER EKGs would have also shown the same findings as the EKG the doctor did separately. And without an echocardiogram the doctor has a very slim basis for his suspicion. Had he compared the two EKGs he would have seen this was not a consistent finding. Had he recognized your profound anxiety problems he would likely have couched his findings in more reassuring words.   Your description of the pressure in the back of your head and presyncope (feeling as though you might faint) are also very common in the general population (either as orthopedic hypotension  or cardioneurogenic presyncope, both benign but annoying and common and best accommodated by standing slowly and waiting a moment to get your bearings). And to answer your posed question \"...is this enough?\" I would say generally yes, it is enough at least to convince me you are physically fine. It may not be enough for you, however, in which case you do have grounds to ask the doctor to refer you for an echocardiogram (or perform one himself) to once and for all rule out (for your peace of mind only) an enlarged LV, or, failing at that, to get a second opinion on the matter.   I see no way, given your detailed information, that you are likely to have an enlarged LV, and were it not for the ruminant thinking of anxious patients, I'd say that should be enough. However, I know it is likely you will be concerned until and unless you have an unequivocal clincal \"no\", so I'd push for the echo. Absent that, I do not think you have an enlarged LV at all, and would strongly recommend you find a good psychotherapist who works with anxiety and panic disorder, preferably one who specializes in fixed-term cognitive therapy, a discipine which is interactive, modifies behavior and reactivity, and has pretty good success at helping people to change their own \"wiring\" so as to improve their lives by getting free of the anxiety and panic attacks which can be so crippling to one's lifestyle.  I wish you all the best and hope this has been helpful to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Stress and High Blood Pressure and heart disease",
    "content": "Hello greenstone312 -   You do sound like an anxious fellow, so I can empathize with you. Anxiety and stress are some of the most unpleasant emotions we can experience, and they also cause far more dramatic and easily measured symptoms than the opposite, which would be depression or dysthymia. However, except in the most rare and extreme cases (usually where significant heart disease was also already long-established) these emotions  will not damage your body, at least not in the short term. There is some evidence that over the long haul there may be some evidence to support them causing or at least assisting in the development of heart or kidney disease and high blood pressure. But this causal relationship will require more study, and what evidence there is suggests that it may happen to people who are extremely anxious over a period of decades. You aren't there yet.  Anxiety first of all robs us of the ability to fully enjoy our lives, and that alone is sufficient reason to get it fixed. This is a personal challenge, and one which often responds best to longer-acting anti-anxiety medications (Xanax is popular because it is fast-acting, but its effect is also rather brief, so it's not the best therpeutic approach, though it does make an excellent \"rescue\" drug for panic attacks or really disabling spells of acute anxiety). Clonazepam (brand name Klonopin) is highly regarded by some psychopharmacologists, although the SSRI family of antidepressants is currently more popular. These latter do have the undesireble potential of actually worsening anxiety in a small subgroup of patients, however, and at least one well known specialist in the treatment of anxiety and panic disorder relies heavily on clonazepam as the first line of treatment, combined with cognative therapy (a sort of behavioral modification psychotherapy that is not open-ended like general \"talk\" therapy for more subtle conditions). I'd strongly suggest looking into a change of medication as well as CT. I'd also look  into meditative and relaxation techniques to help quiet yourself as much as possible. I know you've probably tried to talk yourself into being more calm, but the trick there is that it is like telling one's self not to think of, say, an elephant. Soon as you've decided what you're not supposed to be thinking of, sure enough you can't get it out of your mind, because, after all, it is the target of the exercise! So CT, a longer-acting, longer-term medication, and a look into some serious meditative techniques would probably be the way to go.   Your blood pressure, while higher than desireble when it does get up there, is not surprising or unusual for an anxious person. While it does you no good, over short periods of time it also usually will do no harm, either. If it should get much above what you've quoted here, you might have to be put on a beta blocker, which is another possibility for the person who suffers especially from situational anxiety, such as the fear of public speaking, flying, etc. This family of drugs does lower blood pressure, slows the heart rate, and often has a generalized relaxing (or overall slowing) effect on patients, and is usually reserved for heart patients and people with consistently and dangerously elevated BP, but some doctors will prescribe it for certain selected anxious patients.  Anxiety is an awful thing to deal with, and stress and anxiety of course go hand in hand. Anything you can do to reduce your concern over things you cannot control will help with this, as well as looking into the suggestions I've made, and perhaps discussing them with your doctor.  You have a lot of years to enjoy -- or not! I certainly hope you are able to start enjoying them more fully with less stress and anxiety. They add nothing but take away a lot from our enjoyment of life.  Best of luck to you, and please do keep in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello hinchcliffe -  While most allergy medication-related blood pressure problems are traceable to decongenstants rather than antihistimines (or antihistimines which contain psuedoephedrine, usually having a \"D\" after the regular name), it is well known that some people can have both increased heart rate and increased blood pressure as side effects of plain (no \"D\") antihistamines, and this seems very likely what has happened in your case. But first, please be certain none of the drugs you've been taking have had that \"D\" suffix, and that you haven't taken Sudafed or generic pseudoephedrine either, as that will most definitely raise the BP in most people, though not always  as high as you report.   As far as how long to correct, if the problem is being caused by the antihistimine use, a week or so at most and the drugs should be totally cleared from your system and if that was the culprit your BP should return to normal levels.  Oh, also, sometimes significant weight loss can actually precipitate a short-term but marked rise in BP before things normalize. True, more often than not it is the other way around, and that is one of the hoped-for benefits, sometimes the loss of the weight tricks  the blood pressure regulator, which takes a little while to adjust to the lessened load it is supporting.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I am a 28 y/o caucasian male. I'm in good physical condition 6ft 1in, 206 lbs, and work out regularly. I have had borderline hypertension since the age of 17. During my time in the military and after (til now) high blood pressure has never effected me. The doc always would say \"well, your bp is a bit high\" but never put me on medicine. Approximately 1 year ago I spent about a month in third world countries, sleeping and eating unhealthy food out of airports. My immune system was down and developed what was to be determed as Shingles. At the time I had shingles my blood pressure was pretty high and I was placed on blood pressure medicine. The strength of the first medicine was not strong enough, but once the mg's were raised it seemed to bring my blood pressure down. I began to eat healthy, run/workout more often, and take my medicine. At my next doctors visit the blood pressure was good.   Currently I am under consideration for employment and must take a treadmill stress test. I know I will do well with the test as I am in good physical condition. My concern is that my blood pressure is too high, which will cause me to fail the test. Blood results, chest xrays, etc have all come out clean as I have been checked recently. Besides high blood pressure I have no signs of heart disease. My blood pressure (although lately normal at my regular doctors visit was slightly elevated at the physical for future employment....I attibutate that to nerves. BP at most recent physical was 130/72. My questions are:   1) If there are no signs of coronary artery disease/heart disease, but my high blood pressure is high (most recent on file 130/72), will this be something that could cause me to fail the stress test?  2) Do doctors only determine the health of an individual strictly based on blood pressure, or do all factors come into account?  3) Does my blood pressure, which seems to be only borderline, pose any imminent threat (pending everything else with me is healthy) to me having a med clearance?  4) Is a reading of 130/72 at a doctors office with the anxiety of getting a job a bad reading?  Any and all insight would be helpful. And as you can see, maybe I should be in the \"anxiety\" forum as well! Thanks for your help. Hope to hear from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It is good that you started the BP medicine which controlled your hypertension. A BP of 130/70 is never called high and is perfectly within normal range.   High blood pressure does not always mean an abnormal stress test. With your BP and your physical attributes, and your workout habits it is unlikely you will fail stress test.  Doctors determine health by various parameters BP being only one of them.   I would not consider your BP 130/72 borderline, it is normal.  All in all I do not think you have any issues on your medical clearance.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can't say this definitively but I would guess that you are anxious on the first reading, but then you calm in time for the second.  Perhaps similar to \"White Coat Anxiety\" frequently noted when a person has their BP checked in the doctor's office but otherwise it is normal.  But when repeating the blood pressure it's best to wait at least ten minutes between or do it on the other arm so the blood has a chance to return to its normal resting pressure.  What I would suggest is taking it several times and keeping a record (daily for instance at the local drug store).  Only test it once at each session.  You become comfortable doing it in that setting and the pattern that emerges will likely be quite accurate.    If it continues to be high, see your doctor and bring your record with you.  The second readings you have here look fine.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "If I am not under medication for my hypertension (just diagnosed), can my hypertension actually be the cause of almost immediate headaches and a little dizziness when getting up from bed, walking across the house and sitting at my desk for 1-2 minutes?  Reason and background of question:  Approximately 3 weeks ago I saw a doctor at an quick care facility for a severe headache that started during sexual activity.  After it did not go away, I thought that it should be checked out.  The doctor advised going to the ER to rule out a stroke.   I had a CT scan, spinal tap and MRI and everything came out looking good.  My blood pressure has been high ever since that day (no history before this).  I followed up with my primary physician.   First he prescribed lisinopril.  I had very uncomfortable side-effects that included stiffness and cramping in the neck.  Secondly, he prescribed atenolol which started with similar effects, but much more severe  I am waiting for a new prescription on Monday.  Hopefully that will do the trick. This is the reason why I am not under medication(yet).  My blood pressure ranges from fairly normal to up to 153 over 107 (the highest) over the last week.  When it was at the highest, my headache was severe.  My doctor thinks that blood pressure medication should take care of these symptoms...do you agree?  Thank you in advance for your assistance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lardude,  Hypertension is of two types. Secondary and Primary. Secondary is one in which there is either a kidney disease ir a hormone disease which is the cause of the BP. Primary is one where there is no 'causative' factor and it is just there.   Hypertension is a largely silent disease. meaning, majority of the patients do not have any complaints or symptoms due to hypertension and the disease is mostly detected as a chance finding during a routine check up or a check up for some other complaint.   In your case the maximum BP of 150/107 is a level which is not so high as to be the cause of the headache although it may well in some cases. In any case it has to be treated. And kept near 120/80.   However I would suggest you also to start with regular brisk aerobic exercises, low salt diet, high consumption of fruits and vegetables and weight reduction also in addition to the medicines.   If the headache persists even after reducing BP consistently to normal levels you may consult an internist to deal with the headache.  I hope this is useful,\n\n",

My problem is that I have a bad case of \"white coat syndrome.\"  Now I wouldn't worry too much about this, except for the fact that if might stop me for getting my dream job of a city firefighter.  I have purchased an Omron home blood pressure monitor, and at home or at work, it ranges from 115/70 to 125/80.  At some point in my life I must have developed anxiety going to the doctor's office.  Once I enter a clinic's office, I get tachycardic.  Then I get a BP reading as high as 160/100.  Now I am a pretty relaxed individual, and this never happens at any other point of my days.  The doctor recently made get an ekg and echocardiogram in order to get a clearance form filled for school.  He told me I have a heart of an athlete and great function.  So my problem is that when I get the fire dept medical, they're not going to like these numbers.  I'm trying to meditate, and even considering yoga.  Vitamins I take include fish oil and b-complex, and I eat pretty healthy.  Aside from these steps I have taken and bringing my BP monitor to the medical to show them regular numbers, do you recommend any other herbs or vitamins to supress my epinephrine from being released at the wrong time??  Im not too keen on taking xanax or valiums..\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  White Coat Syndrome is a well recognized and a relatively common problem. I fully understand your predicament getting clearance form the medical board.  White coat syndrome occures from psychological conditioning. One you are conditioned that way it is going to strike with more force every time you enter a doctor's chamber. Adrenalin is the hormone which starts flowing and increases the heart rate [fast pulse] and force of contractions [high BP].  One way out is to wait in the chambers for about 15-30 min while reading some un-important magazine, before entering the cubicle. However this does not work many times.  When a clinician suspects a white coat effect, she generally advises a test called 24 hours' ambulatory BP monitoring. This is akin to Holter monitoring. The patient is wired up with electronic BP apparatus with a recording box the size of a Walkman and asked to go home and do the daily routine. The next day the box is decoded and  a seires of BP readings of the previous 24 hours gets printed out. Thus one can easily check what the readings have been while one is not in the clinic and involved in his/her daily chores.  You can ask your doctor to get this test done and produce this result at the time of your medical board examination.  Apurva\n\n",

Along with this i also sometimes have headaches, which often occur at the same time as i get high blood pressure reading (I have an electronic machine at home and check regularly). In addition, i get spells of extreme sleepyness, and have been sleeping a lot more than usual. I do not smoke, and drink very rarely. In the past 4 years there are period when i experience no symptoms. These periods are rare, having occured 3-4 times, and short lived, lasting in the span of weeks, to a month max. During one of these periods (a few months ago) i had a few blood and urine tests done to see if anything was wrong. The doc said i had no problems with my thyroid, and no indication of any adrenal tumors. However, my renin was a little bit lower than the prescribed range, and my aldosterone was also low. I don't remember the actual numbers. The outcome of that was nothing, and i am on no medication for bp.  Lately ive heard that it might be caused by an allergy to tryptophan, and am thinking about changing my diet to remove cheese and any other things that have it.  I would love any professional advice.

    "content": "Hi,  It has been a norm in medical prcatice to define hypertension as anything above 140/90. However lately the international peer body on hypertension has made this criterion stricter and though the definition has been kept the same,[140/90], the recommendation is to keep BP below 120/80 as far as possible.  However on the treatment front, in a fresh patient with hypertension which is BELOW 150/90, the first line of action is diet modification and lifelstyle changes, and not drugs. Only when these two measures fail, the drugs come in.  So even though you are not overweight, you must exercise at leat 5 days a week for 30-40 minutes, and cut down on your salt and saturated fat intake.   Your hormone profile is normal which means you do not have 'Secondary Hypertension' which is a more serious form.   Tryptophan has mixed effect on BP, in lowr doses it increases and higher doses decreases.If you are getting headaches, it just could be tryptophan in your cheese that could be the culprit.  You should consult your doctor soon and get your BP rectified.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Hypertension is a largely silent disease. However when it goes unnoticed or untreated it can play havoc with the body systems. BP should be kept below 140/90 and by current consensus preferably below 120/80. Having said that, it is equally true that untreated BP up to 150/90 should first be treated with diet and lifestyle modifications.  There are four major drug classes to treat hypertension. Ace inhibitors/ARBs, beta blockres, calcium channel blockers and diuretics.   As a rule of thumb relatively young patients like you are first given beta blockers and/or Ace inhibitors. The atenolol which you are taking is a betablocker. In addition the associated MVP which you have also calls for a beta blocker.   Beta blockers do have such side effects like cold hands and feet. They also cause bradycardia or slow pulse as you have 48/min. Cold hands and feet I can understand but mere fact that you count your pulse to be 48 should not cause you any worry unless it causes you some symptom or discomfort.   If you are uncomfortable with atenolol you might be switched over to some thing like Lisinopril, an ace inhibitor. Please check with your physician if your MVP is more than Grade 1 or really significant and whether any of your symtoms are because of MVP. If not and if your physician thinks it to be ok you can be on only Lisinopril and do away with the beta blocker.   Apurva\n\n",

I have never had any heart disease symptoms, but a screening stress test in Jan. 2007 showed 3.7 mm ST depression.  A coronary CT scan was also positive, so I underwent angiography.  There was 90% blockage mid RCA; a stent was placed.  Severe stenosis also found at several points in circumflex, to be managed medically.  I\u2019m taking daily: HCTZ 12.5 mg, lisinopril 10 mg, Zetia 10 mg, Lipitor 40 mg, aspirin 81 mg.  With these meds, BP at rest is consistently normal, last test showed LDL-C 59, HDL-C 69, TG 60.  Unmedicated (and with poor diet), my SBP was typically 130-140, cholesterol as high as 315.  Last December, I took a routine physical that included a stress test.  Though EKG remained normal and I felt fine, at 13 minutes the tech said that she would stop the test because my BP was 258/78.  Like an idiot, I said that my HR (158) had leveled off and perhaps I could finish the stage.  30 seconds later, BP was 271/76 (HR 159) and the test was halted.  Luckily, I did not have a stroke.  Six weeks later, I took a stress echo, both as follow-up on CAD and to check for a hypertensive response.  At 16 minutes, my HR of 166 had not changed for 60 seconds, and the test was getting to be not fun, so I asked to stop.  Surprisingly, maximum SBP was only 176 (no change in meds).  EKG and echo were normal, and I felt no pain.  I would greatly appreciate it if you could please answer a few questions:  Should my exercise BP be investigated further?  Would running until exhausted have made the test  more sensitive?  Would there have been a significant risk?  On a stress echo a year ago (one month after stent), max HR was 176.  Should I be concerned that my max HR has apparently fallen 10 BPM in just one year?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Stewart,  First let me congratulate you, having a strong family history, you were detected for CAD and successfully treated with PTCA-Stent well before you got an MI.  Your post PTCA follow up also seems very good. You are on a good set of medications, your lipids are very much at the desired level.  No, you should not worry that your exercise heart rate has fallen by 10 in a year. This actually indicates better exercise tolerance or conditioning.   You definitely have a hypertensive response to stress, though your BP at rest could be normal. This means that BP would be going beyond acceptable levels while you are exerting day to day without BP monitoring. This definitely calls for some twaeking of your BP meds. Betablocker is a good option if your cardiologist agrees.   I hope this is useful to you, bye,   Apurva.\n\n",

Atenolol and HCTZ are meds with proven track record worldwide and unlikely to cause kidney malfunction. His kidney function deterioration is likely due to unchecked hypertension of the past.  If the BP is now under control without meds and WITH on going alcoholism is  something I am not in a position to believe. Alcoholism means excess amount of drinking more that 2 large per day and almost starting from the morning. Your husband's BP problem is beacuse of alcohol itself. Get some professional help on this front and get him de-addicted. His BP problem is then likely to vanish.  Apurva.\n\n",

Not sure how bad the meds & drinking are together versus elevated blood pressure and no meds but drinking??    Kidney function went from 90% to 60% in a year when he started his meds - whether it was from the meds.  HCTZ does say adverse effects can be  kidney dysfunction, nephritis and renal failure ... thus I wasn't confident the meds weren't affecting his kidneys.\n\n",

Exercise also can reduce blood pressure.  Overall, I suspect that your healthier lifestyle is having beneficial effects on your blood pressure.

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your decision to take charge of your health.    First of all I would encourage you to follow the directions on your monitoring device to a \"T\" to be sure you are getting accurate readings.  Secondly, take your blood pressure at least twice a day to get a good overall average score.  As you probably know, 90 for diastolic is borderline high so measures to reduce it such as you are doing with salt intake reduction is good.  You can also benefit by increasing the amounts of calcium and potassium rich foods (fruits, fish and oats are good here).  Avoid eating saturated fats.  Don't eat \"hydrogenated\" anything or trans fat (TFA).  Avoid caffeine, get sufficient rest without oversleeping.  Regular exercise is also good and losing even 5 to 10 lbs can make a difference if you are at all overweight.  If you smoke, quit.  Don't wear any tight-fitting clothing, including socks.  If you get an indentation where your socks have been, they are too tight.   It can take several months to notice a difference but even if you can lower it just slightly and it takes a year, you are going to be in better shape next year than you are now.  Some hypertension is just genetic and in spite of good habits, it still requires medication.  That doesn't mean you should throw in the towel.  These health improvements will still reduce your risk of disease in the long run.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm glad to see you are now being treated for the hypertension.  It is difficult to say both how long you may have had this and what damage may have occurred as a result of no treatment.   Many people have no symptoms at all even with severe hypertension.  Others sometimes experience visual disturbance, headache, dizziness, shortness of breath.  Untreated hypertension can lead to heart failure or stroke without any prior warning (thus, the label \"silent killer\").  For this reason, regular medical exams which include such screenings are recommended for all people.    Chronic high blood pressure can lead to an enlarged heart, kidney failure, brain or neurological damage, and changes in the retina.  This is usually associated with people who have had hypertension for quite a while; not the newly acquired.  Early treatment can prevent most of the complications.  If you have never been checked for this in the past, it is hard to say how early this might be.  Best wishes.\n\n",

History of high bp more than 5 years ago (lasted for 3 years, usually in the 140s over 90s) - went up with weight gain, managed with meds, off meds and fine after weight loss.  I have gained 30lbs within recent months.  BP has been fine until Nov when I went to dr for URI where it was elevated to 140/104.  NP wanted to watch it and it went down (around 135/97).  Went again for continued cough in Dec and it was slightly elevated but less than the first time.    This past week I have been monitoring at home.  I bought a manual monitor so I could use the stethoscope to watch my son's lungs - he was having strong bronchospasms.  I have consistently had high readings with an average of 175/112.  Tonight I took it in both arms because it seemed like there was a difference.  My right arm (dominant) was 200/140 and left was 175/115.  This freaked me out a bit so I waited and retook after 1 1/2 hours and it went down to 175/115 in right and 150/98 in left.  Why is there so much difference?  I do have some muscle weakness and pain in my right arm that is on and off since summer - NP thinks it may be tendonitis.  Could this explain the difference?  Also, tonight I've had some \"bruising\" from the cuff (dotted lines up and down arm like broken blood vessels).  Is it possible I'm doing something wrong?  I grew up experimenting with bp monitors because my dad has had high bp for years and his father died from a heart attack in his 40s.  So we used to take ours for fun.  I think I know how to do it, but I've never had such high readings.  And why would it be so high over such a short period of time?  Can I wait to lose weight or do I need to do meds?  Also, my mother (and 2 sisters) have high bp treated by meds and my mother's father died (in 70's) of heart attack.  Please advise.  Many thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dama,  These blood pressures are quite high.  Ordinarily, when one sees an elevated blood pressure in the right arm is significantly higher than the left arm it can indicate that there is a narrowing of the aorta between the take off of the two subclavian arteries, called coarctation of the aorta.  It would be very unusual to have this condition and not have it diagnosed until adulthood.  It may be that the difference in blood pressure is not actually a significant difference.  I would definitely recommend that you have this reevaluated by your doctor.  Loosing weight will likely help your blood pressure, but at these measurements I would not personally be comfortable waiting for weight loss and would start a blood presssure medicine if your pressures are confirmed that high.  I would also recommend you see a cardiologist for an evaluation of your heart to see if the underlying cause can be determined.  Tendonitis is very unlikely to be a cause of the elevated blood pressures.  The bruising may simply be due to the elevated pressure from the cuff since you are needing to use higher pressures.  Follow up with your doctor is very important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello WilliamR,  A good rule of thumb is that in 5 half lives a drug has reached the new steady state of where the concentration will be with the current dosing.  So using this same rule, 5 half lives will result in no further effect.  The half life of HCTZ is anywhere from about 6 to 15 hours, with it being closer to six in most people.  So it ranges from about 1 & 1/2 days to a little over 3 days before the effect will be gone.    Best wishes.\n\n",

The changes seen on an echocardiogram generally represent compensation for long standing hypertension.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 32 yrs old female with 2 kids. I'm generally healthy before this events. On 16 Nov early morning (around 4am) I woke up with SOB and palpitation, I asked my husband to open the door and windows to get more air in. I feel like there is a lack of oxygen in the room. I took my BP: 128/18mmhg, PR 78bpm. However, I just did not feel right, and could not go back to sleep again. I got up at around 5am, and for the whole day I felt palpitation. I checked my BP again in the afternoon when it became worse. Sitting:131/99mmhg, HR 120bpm; Standing: 139/108mmhg HR 133bpm, and lying BP:128/96mmhg, HR 96bpm; And seen my GP, I had a ECG done, it only shown sinus tachycardia (HR 118bpm). I was then advised to go home and rest. The next day, my BP in the morning at around 6.45am was 128/87mmhg, and HR 87bpm, lying down. I revisited my Dr as instructed, and the BP was 128/96mmhg, HR 107bpm, sitting. My Dr told me that it is called diastolic hypertension. My Dr told me to observe if it's persistent, then he will consider a 24hrs BP monitoring on me.  I would like to know if this condition is reversible (should I rest more or should I take some gentle exercises) and the causes to this condition?   I am not on any medication at the moment.  Thank you for your advice.\n\n",

If your blood pressure is elevated persistently then you'll want to consider treating it.  Initial treatment options can include reducing salt intake and undergoing a healthy exercise plan.  If this is not sufficient, there are several medications that can help.  This may also simply resolve on its own over time but I would recommend at least trying to limit salt intake.  Limiting caffeine intake can also help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have beeen taking an ARB + HTCZ (Benicar 40/12.5) which has very effectively controlled my BP.  Adding the HTCZ had a huge impact on my BP, dropping my systolic by 30 points and my diastolic by 20 points, so I was initially very pleased with this combination therapy.  I am also pre-diabetic (fasting glucose = 100).  As I now understand that these HTCZ diuretics (Thiazide Diuretics) can sometimes contribute to increased insulin levels and increased insulin resistance, I have been working with my Doctor to try to come off the HCTZ, by substituting Tekturna for the Thiazide.  It appears that the Benicar + Tekturna is not going to be enough to keep my systolic below 140.  Are there any different types of diuretics my Doctor might consider for me that can help with my blood pressure that do not also affect glucose / insulin?  If I have to use a thiazide to maintain proper blood pressure control, I assume less is better and by minimizing the dose, I may be able to avoid negative metabolic effects?   What other combination therapies might we consider that are blood sugar neutral?\n\n",

If I were you I would be watching the diet and exercise as this is know to affect insulin and is something you can modify.  Choose foods with a low glycemic index.  You can google information here and get lists of foods with their corresponding GI.    There is some debate about whether there is really such thing as pre-diabetes.  Either you have it or you don't is the thinking there.  But, it is known that regular exercise, maintaining a normal weight and a diet low in sugar can actually prevent the development of Diabetes II in many cases.    Good luck.\n\n",

High blood pressure can lead to strokes or heart failure.  I'm not able to explain why your blood pressure is doing this.  Perhaps you are having releases of epinephrine for some reason.  This would be associated with a rapid heart rate and feelings of anxiety (basically the fight or flight phenomenon).  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor about this to discuss the issue further and see if a cause can be found.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I've told my doctor and have even been hospitalized for a fainting spell.  They tell me to keep taking them and give me things to treat the other symptoms. I was without my medicine for about a month recently and noticed that I was fine and didn't have any of the other symptoms at all.  I actually felt great and could be more active.   I'm back on the medicines and am really miserable.  Headaces are back and worse than before.  Lately I've noticed that my arm will fall asleep if I'm holding my phone up to my head, this has never happened before. I think it's the medicine, but my doctor keep insisiting that it is not.

    "content": "Hi Happyhappy,  EKG's have a few things that can give clues to prior heart attacks, including the presence of \"Q-waves\" where they should not be.  Without seeing the EKG it is hard to say for sure what the concern was about.  Most likely, you'll not be cleared for surgery until you get the stress test to be sure everything is OK, since there has been concern raised.  If your current blood pressure medicine is not working there are a few reasons: 1) it isn't an appropriate class of medicine for you or 2) the dose isn't high enough.  Generally, before changing to another class of medication the dose will be maximized to see if better effect is obtained.  If this fails a second medicine is often added but the first may not be taken away.  Based on what you are saying, it sounds like you are getting appropriate care.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I think a cardiologist or a neurologist would be best suited to assess this condition. The only that can judge who would be best consulted would be her primary care physician.  There are many causes of syncope. Vasovagal attacks and postural hypotension are amongst the most common causes include:  -Neurogenic (Epilepsy, Transient Ischemic Attacks) -Cardiac (Obstructive cardiomyopathy, arrhythmia, ischaemic heart disease, aortic dissection) -Drug abuse and certain medications.  -Psychogenic (diagnosed by exclusion).  The investigations performed would depend largely on the clinical examination. If it points in a certain direction, the doctor will likely want to confirm the possibility.  Best regards,\n\n",

If so this could be a type of postural hypotension where there is a sudden drop in blood pressure with the sudden change in position.  This is best treated by making gradual changes from lying to standing, with a sitting resting period in between.  Swing legs down and sit, giving blood a chance to equalize, then rise carefully.  It's just a matter of learning a way around this problem.    Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm glad to see you will be going to your doctor soon.  The dizzy feeling you get when standing up quickly is related to a sudden fall in blood pressure (low, rather than high).  It happens most often after you've been lying down for a while.  It can also occur when you are anemic or dehydrated, taking certain medications and with some diseases.    This does not mean you couldn't have high blood pressure as well but only having it checked can you know if you have it.  It is sometimes called a silent killer because it can be doing damage to your body without giving you any warning signs.  Doctors routinely check blood pressure when you go in so I trust yours will when you see him/her.  It can have symptoms such as headache but don't rely on that.  Best wishes\n\n",

I believe the pill may even have a scored mark across the center.  I would suggest you call your pharmacy and ask the pharmacist to be sure it is safe, just to double check me since I'm not 100% sure.    The best way I have found to cut tablets is to use a tablet cutter that can be purchased pretty cheaply from almost any pharmacy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It is also possible you are having some normal level of fluctuation or what is commonly referred to as \"white coat hypertension.\" In that case you have anxiety in the doctor's office and your blood pressure reflects this.  When in the drugstore, it checks out OK.  Let your doctor know if you notice this phenomenon in your situation. Just say, \"hey, I was noticing that my blood pressure is only elevated when I'm here.\"  Than ask if the doctor thinks this might be what is going on with you.  This is a good question.

You may want to consider being evaluated for something along these lines.  Anxiety or other behavioral disorders can cause physical symptoms and can be successfully treated. Call for an appointment with a mental health professional for this.   Since you also expressed concern about blood sugar fluctuation, it might be good to have a general physical exam, mentioning these symptoms to your doctor.  Some people have diabetes or hypoglycemia without knowing it and these things can be serious if left untreated.  Visual disturbances should always be checked out as well.  Tremors, like you describe can also signal some underlying problem so an exam is your best course of action.  Good luck.\n\n",

He has been a habitual heavy coffee drinker for his entire adult life, and he began to drink coffee as a child.  He has had an EKG and x-ray about a year ago, and they said his EKG was fine, and his heart was not enlarged.  With borderline hypertension about a year ago, he began to watch his BP closely.  We eat well and exercise when we can, but that can be sporadic.  Over the last few months, we have again had a stress overload.  He has been monitoring his BP closely.  It ranges from about 145/90 back down to 127/70.  His heart rate ranges from 106 back down into the 70s.  Under extreme pressure, his BP has spiked higher than this, and his heart rate, as well, although this is the approximate range.  I have noticed that the systolic is inversely related to the heart rate.  Why would this be?  He is on no medication and had cholesterol checked about a year ago.  It was just slightly high, and the next check, it was good.  He really is opposed to going to the doctor and getting on meds.  He is just trying to control the stress levels while maintaining a healthy diet.  Why is the systolic and rate inversely related?  I've also wondered if the glass of red wine he drinks at night could cause the fluctuation.  He used to drink alcohol heavily, as well, but no longer does.  He quit smoking when he was 27 but did breathe second-hand smoke frequently until 16 years ago.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi RLH-MAH,  When you say that the systolic blood pressure and heart rate are inversely related I am presuming you mean that the heart rate goes down when the systolic pressure goes up.  This occasionally can happen because the overall issue related to the heart is perfusion of the body organs.  To an extent, when blood pressure goes up, each heart beat does a better job of getting blood to the body so the heart rate can go down.  This really only is true in a narrow window of blood pressure ranges.  Generally, the opposite position is more commonly seen.  When the systolic blood pressure gets too low the HR goes up for the same reason.  I would recommend he see a doctor to have his BP formally evaluated.  Even with some normal values if his BP is elevated more of the time than it is normal it can still cause problems.  The red wine is unlikely to be the culprit although in a few people this can occur.  There is actually some data to suggest that a glass of red wine per night may be protective of the heart.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 56 year old female recently diagnosed as having mild hypertension. My family physician has been monitoring my blood pressure for about  5 months. Most of my readings have ranged from the low 130's and to a high of 156/96.  Last month he requested a 24 hour BP monitoring and shared the results with me four days ago.  My highest daytime reading was 148/92 and my lowest night time reading was 103/80.  There is a history of hypertension, stroke, and heart attack on mother's side. I also have the following medical issues: chronic Immune Thrombocytopenic Purpura, Rheumatoid Arthritis, Acid Reflux, Carpal Tunnel Pain and Hypothyroidism. My current medications are: WinRho, Synthroid, Pantaloc, Relafen, and Gabapentin. Methotrexate was prescribed for the RA, but I could had drug intolerance. Planquinel has been prescribed but I am having problems with it too. I am sensitive to medications; both my Rheumatologist and family physician have to make sure that new meds do not cause my platelet counts to drop.  My physician has prescribed Ramipril for my hypertension: 2.5mg for 7 days, 5mg for 21 days, and 10mg for 7 days. After that I'm to see him for a BP check. I was told  that Ramipril has the least side effects of the ACE inhibitors.  I've taken the 2.5mg capsules once daily for 4 days and have been feeling dizzy and extremely tired.  I am concerned about the dosing schedule and wonder if I should be on the lowest dose for a longer period.  This evening I took 2 bp readings, 3 hours apart. The first one was 92/67(I felt very tired) and the second was 110/74 ( I felt a bit more energetic, but perhaps that was due to having a boost of sugar from a dessert.) With these bp readings, do you think it's unwise to move to 5mg in 4 days. I'm planning to call my physician's office on Monday but would sure appreciate your input.   Thank you\n\n",

I have been on 150-175 mcg of levothyroxin for years for hypothyroid.  BP has been \"borderline\" for a couple of years (often about 140/80) I have been on HCTZ once a day for a year, although did not always remember to take it.   So here's the question: at dr. visit this week my BP was 160/68 and 160/66. Dr. prescribed Lisino-HCTZ 25mg 1X day.  I know that the systolic is quite high, but what explains (in anything) the diastolic being so relatively low?  If I continue to lose weight and walk (more consistantly!) any guess on the chances of getting of this BP med? I realize part of it may be hereditary.  Thanks for the help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mothermary,  Your diastolic is not dangerously low.  Actually I like to see diastolic blood pressures in this area.  There are a few reasons why one may have a high systolic and low/normal diastolic blood pressure.  Probably the most common reason is anxiety (white coat syndrome) which classically raises the systolic blood pressure.  Another possibility is that your thyroid levels may be getting too high.  This can also cause a high systolic level.  When taking the blood pressure medicines you should monitor your blood pressure regularly.  Sometimes they will drop both numbers causing the diastolic to actually get too low.  Exercise and a proper diet (with low sodium) can decrease blood pressures.  This may or may not be enough for you to come off the blood pressure medicines but it is certainly worth a try.  And, doing this will help your overall health also.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctors, I am 51, female and was prescribed Norvasc  (5mg daily) when I went to the hospital with a bad headache and a spike in blood pressure of 180/90 (which I now think could have been a panic attack and extreme pain from TMJ).  My BP until then was averaging around 130/74.  I took the Norvasc for 2 months with no problems, but then started having VERY severe leg cramps on waking, horrible palpitations, on one occasion a weird racing heart, constant, slow twitching of the muscles all over the body, badly inflamed gums and now almost complete insomnia for the past 5 days. One doctor told me that these are not side-effects of Norvasc;  I phoned the hospital and a doctor there told me to stop taking it. What do you think? Can it build up in the body after a couple of months?  If not Norvasc, what could it be? My serum K is borderline and I am taking a supplement. What would be a good alternative medication, for me, less potent?  Any ideas? Thank you very much for your help.\n\n",

If there is suspicion of the Norvasc causing the problems it is wise to stop it.  There are many different blood pressure medications of various classes.  I would recommend you discuss changing to a new one with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The palpitations and cramps have already improved - the cramps have gone completely and the palpitations are very rare now.  I still have some muscle twitching from time to time, but nothing like the sensations I had before. I still have the insomnia, but that might be due to upset sleep patters because of  the symptoms over the past couple of weeks.  I am still worried that I will have a \"rebound effect\" and that my blood pressure will suddenly shoot sky high now that I have stopped the Norvasc.

    "content": "It's good to hear you are feeling better.  Any blood pressure, when stopped, can have a rebound effect.  It is a little less likely with norvasc than with some of the other ones but should still be watched for.   Also, if you were needing the norvasc for high blood pressure and now are on nothing it is very likely that your hypertension will return.  At that point your doctor can recommend a different class of BP med to see if this works better for you.  Also, you may want to have your calcium levels checked.  Low calcium can cause twitchy muscles.  Norvasc is a calcium channel blocker so it can exacerbate this problem if the calcium is already low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The reason it's so hard to believe that it is not a heart The fight or flight response is a vital function of your nervous system and you wouldn't want to live without it.  However, when it gets activated for no apparent reason, you're left wondering what is going on.  In the absence of an appropriate frightening experience, the physical symptoms of flight or fight do feel like something very bad, physically, is going to happen.  The very best treatment for panic attacks is a combination of medication and psychotherapy.  Go see your physician, hopefully he or she will refer you to a psychiatrist.  Best of luck to you!\n\n",

This means anyone can have the problem, even when they are doing everything \"right\" to lower their risk (diet, weight, health maintenance, exercise, etc).  You might call it \"luck of the draw\" and you may be one of those unlucky ones who drew the gene for high blood pressure.  What this means is that you should do all you can to eat right, exercise and monitor it, but you may also have to have a blood pressure medication to counter the effects of your genetic predisposition.

    "content": "I don't know where to post this.  I've had a recurring peculiar problem with my blood vessels. All of a sudden they'll start fluttering. Not a prolonged time, just one quick flutter\u2014I can feel the blood going through, I can feel the vessel tube quickly shudder. It happens repetitively and intermittently.  One vessel or a bunch together, and often in several places. Most often:  in my left eye; in the upper middle part of my legs; underneath the left ear. Can also be in my foot, arm, or cheek. The quick fluttering in the vessels extends from a quarter of an inch, up to about six inches in the big vessels in my leg. If I hold my hand firmly on the place where the vessel is thumping, sometimes it stop, but it will cause other vessels to start up!   They happen with the heart-beat, but not every beat. It can often be  physically felt on the skin and seen by a depression. It is intensified by stress and stressful situations. Extended rigorous exercise can cause it. Caffeine doesn't effect the symptoms. It feels like something I read where the blood might be backed up and then bursts through the vessel, so I tried taking nattokinase for a while, with not much results. Also tried pomegranate juice, which actually helps.   The symptoms are painless, but very annoying. Once they start acting up, they usually keep going for quite some time, even if I'm not doing much. Lasts from a moment, to a few hours, to as much as continuing for three days. These symptoms will go away altogether for extended periods of time, even weeks.   Been happening for 10 years;  I'm 29 now and slightly overweight. My blood pressure has always been normal and my pulse is 55.    ===>> Why do I think these are not muscle or nerve spasms?  Because I have had both muscle and nerve spasms so I know the difference. And because I can just feel that they are blood vessels, kind of hard to describe.   I'd be interested if you've heard of any conditions that could involve these symptoms or just anything you can connect them to. Or of course you can give the standard answer if you don't know what the heck this stuff is!  Thanks!\n\n",

You may actually be experiencing a muscle tremor rather than an actual cramp.  This can give a vibrating type of feeling.  I'm not exactly sure who would best be able to help you.  My best thought would be to see a neurologist.  Your primary doctor can also test your calcium level to make sure it is OK.  Sorry I can't give you much more.  I hope you are able to find out what the cause is.  If you do please update us.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 59 male and all my life i have suffered strange attacks. Sometimes it can be a year between attacks other times a few days. I get the attacks mostly when I become very upset but getting hot or hard work can bring it on.  Basicly I get upset and my heart rate goes up the thoughts then keep going around in my head. I become withdrawn then I go moody and finally I will loose it I wont be fully in control and I become very strong and able to lift great weights which I couldnt normally do just like the incredible hulk. I then pass out but its like a controlled action were I suddenly just let go like a rag doll its like a pretend passout if that makes sense.  When I get worked up people have told me my eye dilate. Once I get so far I cant control my self until I pass out Missing meals or if I become hot from exercise will cause it as well.  For years the doctors give me anti depresants but I think I may have  hypoglycemia  I have had blood test and I am not diabetic but on one test the doctor said I was the worse diabetic he had ever seen he did another test and said I wasnt.\n\n",

    "content": "This is certainly an interesting situation and I'm sure it is very frustrating for you.  I don't know what is causing your \"attacks\" but  it does seem that seeing a mental health therapist might be helpful.  They may be able to help you find another way to deal with your issues that would not have a physical component.  Perhaps a good psychiatric evaluation by a psychiatrist would be in order if you haven't already done that.  Of course blood sugar fluctuations can do strange things to you as well.  You could research the hypoglycemic diets and follow them religiously to see if this helps.  It certainly won't hurt anything to treat yourself as though you have diagnosed hypoglycemia.  Even a basic diabetic diet could work.  Add to this other healthy lifestyle choices such as getting regular exercise, eliminating harmful habits (tobacco, alcohol, etc.), getting enough sleep at night, etc. and you improve your odds considerably.  Exercise also helps with your blood sugar/insulin response.    It sounds like you have some warning signs of an impending \"attack\" so skills can be learned to help you identify and possibly avoid this or at least respond differently when it occurs.  Good luck.  Please let us know how it goes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rlopez112,  It is less likely for a herniated disk in the neck to give chest pain.  It can most certainly cause pain down the arms and disk compression does classically cause pins and needles pain.  There are several causes of chest pain.  It sounds as if you have had your heart quite well examined, making this less likely.    I would recommend that you see your primary doctor for a work up of your chest pain.  Reflux is a common cause of chest pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was very scared for mum because I know that hypertension could lead to heart stroke and I was very afraid of losing her.  After almost 2 years of medication regimen her blood pressure was still high \u2013 at least 165/88 mmHg \u2013 so I decided to find something through the net which could help to reduce high blood pressure. Then I learnt about Capoten. I talk it to mother\u2019s GP and finally she was put on capoten. It is such a relief, finally the medication did reduce her blood pressure at a normal level and to not have to constantly worry about all kinds of medical problems. She did not have any side effects but till yesterday she is suffering from some kind of dizziness and I am very much worried for her. Can you please tell me what could possibly cause of this dizziness\n\n",

    "content": "Dear brat, ALL blood pressure lowering medications have the potential to do exactly what they are supposed to: lower blood pressure!  Whether Capoten (an ACE inhibiting medication), or any of the other medications her doctor prescribed, ( and you did not mention if she is taking Capoten exclusively or in conjunction with other blood pressure medications), it is possible that at times, for various reasons, the blood pressure can drop too low - possibly causing the dizziness you referred to.  Do you have a home blood pressure machine?  In the US many major public pharmacies carry inexpensive home use blood pressure monitors.  You may consider purchasing one for your mother and monitor her pressure at home.  A low blood pressure can indeed cause dizziness, and if her pressure is low at the time, you need to let her doctor know so that a dosage change may be ordered if appropriate. I commend you for taking good care of your mom.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - This sounds like some sort of peculiar autonomic reflex response which may in some way be related to the gallbladder surgery, since it occurs after eating and only lasts a short time. Also, I infer from your post that this didn't start happening until after the surgery.   If your current BP med doesn't prevent this it may be time for your doctor to try an alternative medication. While the elevation is brief and predictable, it is also pretty marked. It would be nice if it could be reduced or eliminated.   Precisely why this would happen has me stumped, but I do suspect it is some sort of reflex that may have been triggered by the surgery. I know that's pretty vague. The first order of business is to try and reduce or eliminate the problem. Maybe someone else on the staff here will have some ideas as to why this would be happening.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

The clasic story is that the person is at the doctor's office and gets an abdominal exam.  A few minutes later, the patient's heart starts racing and the patient feel all their symptoms.  The examination causes a burst of hormones to be released resulting in the symptomatic episode.  They are not particularly common but your symptoms certainly can be explained by this.

    "content": "Hello  I have been having pain in the back of my head for years now. It usually happens once or wice a month. Maximum 4 times a month. About a month ago I was sitting in front of my monitor where I felt dizzy and decided to  check my blood pressure, it was 160/115. I went to hospital and they did  an EGK, it was OK. They kept me there until my BP came down. They did  blood test and every thing was OK. They asked me to follow up with my Doctor, so I did. My Doctor asked me to monitor my blood pressure over  a week and give her the daily average. My daily average was high, like  140/95. She asked me about my father and I told her he has high blood  pressure and he is also on medication. He is however 73 years old and I am 38 years old. My doctor decided to put me on medication, so she gave me Ramipril which is a ACE inhabitor, 5 mg once a day. I have been taking  this pill for the past 3 weeks now. In the first week my average was good, like 130/80. But now it seems like my BP is slightly going up again.  For example, tonight since 6:00 pm it's been around 140/90 in average. It went up to 145/100 at one point. I am no longer having my pains in the back of my head since I am on ramipril, but i know for sure if I was not taking this pill, tonight would have been one of those nights where I would have my pain in the head. Every other day I go for a long 1 hour walk and after the walk my average BP is 125/75. I do not eat salty food and I am  a smoker. I also believe I do have stress.  Here is my question, Should I be worried about being on Ramipril and still sometimes having high BP like tonight?  Should I increase the dosage from 5 mg to higher number? Basically I am worried that I should be on a higher dosage and my doctor did not put me on. Also, when blood pressure goes up due to stress or smoking, should it come down in 5 or 10 minutes? Is it normal to have BP of 130/90 in average over period of 6 hours even though I am on Ramipril?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "OK, looks like it takes a while to get answers here. Which is cool! But I have an update, I am now on 10 mg Ramipril on a divided dose. 5 mg at 7:00 am and 5:00 mg at 7:00 pm. My Doctor says the drug takes effect immediately,  I have been on the 10 mg  for 24 hours now but my blood pressure is 135/91 .  I started taking Ramipril a month ago, 5 mg first. I guess my question is  should I wait a month again to see the effect of the drug or does this drug work right away and since my BP is still high I should  change my pills?\n\n",

If you BP is elevated that's the first place to start.  Once your BP is controlled, if you still have symptoms you may want to talk with your doctor about other testing to help find the cause.

    "content": "Hi! I'm Mrs. Cristina Mira, 43 years old female. Two years ago I started to have a fluctuating blood pressure. The highest would be 140/90. I went to a doctor and gave me a beta blocker to stabilize my bp. The medicine has side effects on me so I stopped taking it. I went to another doctor and gave me calcium channel blocker. I did not continue with the medicine again because I feel like it's not helping me so much but rather I feel worse things than not taking it. I resort to changing my lifestyle. I do exercise and avoid food that would keep me overweight. I'm now in a good weight of 108 lbs. and my height is 4\"10. However, most of the time I would feel extreme hunger and sometimes would feel very weak in case I won't be able to satisfy my hunger. I hate feeling this way. I don't really understand if this is brought about by my hypertension. My bp would play sometimes at 120/90 or 110/80. I also feel some uneasiness in my heart followed by a feeling of weakness especially in my knees. Please help\n\n",

    "title": "Essential hypertension = essentially we don't know..?",
    "content": "Hi,  I was admitted to hospital for four days last February with accelerated hypertension (225/135) after going to see my GP about the headaches I had been getting for the previous couple of weeks (they would wake me up in the night, last 14+ hours, were completely unaffected by any painkillers and completely incapacitated me). She measured my BP and I was taken straight in and put on an IV drip of amlopidine, bisprolol and doxazosin until my BP was under control. Luckily the only damage seemed to be grade III retinopathy, which resolved itself once my BP was reduced.  I'm only 34, have no familial history of hypertension and prior to this episode I was very fit (gym 3+ times a week), healthy (hadn't even had a cold in at least 2 years), drank plenty of water and alcohol only very infrequently (maybe every couple of weeks), hadn't smoked in over 3 years, ate a healthy diet (little dairy, plenty of fresh fruit and veg, with mostly fish or chicken), and could hardly be considered overweight at 6'4'' and 210lbs. The only anolmaly was a tendency to get very swollen ankles and feet on long flights, but I always put that down to being tall and flying economy!  The side effects of the drugs I was put on were in my view disastrous. I had chronic fatigue, my heart rate was down to around 30-34 (usually only around 48-52 resting as it is), my extremeties felt permanently desensitised and as soon as I started walking, my feet would first get pins and needles and then go completely numb (even though they would be warm to the touch), I would get severe muscle cramps in the back of my thighs, and feel out of breath and dizzy. I could barely walk a hundred yards without needing to stop and sit down, and I would practically faint after a flight of stairs!   After six months of arguing (as far as the consultant was concerned my BP was under control and that was all that was important - I was even advised to eat more salt to help with the cramps!) I managed to get off first the amlopidine then the bisprolol, with the introduction of candesartan instead, and finally, before Christmas, the doxazosin. At each stage the side effects markedly improved and I was able to carry on with life almost as normal, so much so that I was able to start running again a couple of months ago. However, I still get pains in the back of my legs if I have been standing even for a minute, that usually go away when I sit or crouch, but that will return almost straight away on standing up again and frequently get pins and needles in my feet when walking. The only time my legs feel normal is if I have been running at which point I might get a few hours respite.  In the meantime, I have had a renal angiogram, a cardiogram, a 24hr ambulatory BP monitor, several ECGs and more urine and blood tests than I care to remember. So far I have been diagnosed as in excellent health by everyone (low cholestorol, normal levels of elctrolytes, creatinine, renin/aldosterone, TSH, T3/T4, good liver/kidney function, no infections etc, etc). All in all nothing.  So, and apologies for taking so long in getting here, what else can I do?   On 16mg Candesartan my BP is controlled (typically 130/70 with a pulse of around 50), but the thought of having to deal with the muscle cramps every day for the rest of my life is driving me understandably insane. I also can't help but think that the severity of the cramps in my legs might be indicative of a circulatory problem in my legs that may be causing all of this.   I have mentioned all of this several times over to the consultant, but despite noting the iatrogenic effects, it appears that they are out of ideas and/or enthusiasm. Coupled with the infrequency of appointments (every 2 months), it is all very very frustrating.  I would very much appreciate any and all suggestions for further tests.  Thanks in advance for any help you can give,  Fred.  Age: 34 Height: 6'4'' Weight: 210lbs Sex: Male Past diagnoses: Accelerated/Malignant hypertension Past surgeries: None Famial history: None Current medication: 16mg Candesartan Current BP, pulse: 130/70, 50.[/list]\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fred,  Rarely, candesartan causes muscle aches and pains. It can increase the enzyme secreted by the muscles called cpk. It can sometimes cause inflammation of the muscles called rhabdomyolysis.  If you were not tested for elevated cpk levels previously, please, ask your doctor if this is appropriate in your case just to be on the safe side.  Not having any side effects of the medications that you are taking increases patient's compliance. Please, discuss this issue more with your doctor and ask him/her to start you on another medication if he thinks that this side effect is caused by candesartan.

    "content": "Hello revsettle -  I wouldn't be worried for two reasons: first, worry only adds to your stress level and accomplishes nothing; a healthy concern would be a better way of looking at it. Secondly, this finding of \"borderline\", especially in a very young man with no apparent remarkable family history really needs more clarification by your doctor first. Carotid stenosis usually doesn't show up until middle age or beyond (although of course it is not completely unheard of). Calling the image finding \"borderline\" really doesn't tell you or us much that is useful. Definitely not the time to be worried. Perhaps your doctor can clarify this and suggest what you might or might not need to be doing (such as taking an 81 mg. aspirin once a day, something else rarely done at your young age). If you have some additional information or can get further clarification about that interpretation of the study I'd love to hear it.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- I am a 64-old female (wrote in about double asthma meds on 12/30 in asthma forum) and I am concerned about proper medications.  I have been taking Hydrochlorothiazide for about a year for borderline hypertension which has stayed under control, and 30mg. of Benadryl at night to help me sleep for many years (chronic insomnia since menopause).    I have been seeing an allergist for a month and was put on Nasacort AQ (2 doses each nostril twice a day) and Singulair on 3/2; on 3/5 he added Allegra-D.  (Skin tests did not show really high allergy response, mostly +1 and +2, and blood test result for IGE was a 4).  On 3/11 I called him because my BP was 182/95 on home monitor and I felt strange;  he took me off the Allegra-D, assuming it was the pseudoephredine  (I have not had a problem with Sudafed before).   In his office on 3/15 (about 30 minutes after Xopenex inhaler), my BP was high again (180/90) but he thought it was my monitor and his Omron office monitor being faulty, because twenty minutes later the BP was 148/85 on his standard wall BP monitor.  I wasn't convinced.  (He also prescribed a Xopenex Inhaler which I have not used).  He added Loratadine to my meds which I took at 8 a.m. on 3/16 and at 3:30pm I went to my regular clinic because BP was 182/89 on my monitor and I wanted to verify it; it was 182/90 in their office.  Was asked next day to see a different physician (mine not available on Saturday) and reading was 148/85.  He prescribed Cozaar (50mg) and told me to see my own physician next week (3/26) to see how it's working.   I have NOT taken it yet since I am unconvinced about this whole thing and don't know if we're on the right track or not -- afraid to start ANOTHER medication.  Is it possible that time-release antihistamines can increase BP? What about the Xopenex?    Sorry this is so long, but I don't know how to get an overall evaluation for my health and am scheduled to fly from Hawaii to North Carolina for two weeks in April which I will have to cancel if this isn't resolved better.  I would appreciate any suggestions.\n\n",

    "content": "The pseudoephedrine in Allegra-D (the D or decongestant part) most definitely can elevate blood pressure; however, the fexofenadine (Allegra) part is not reported to have an affect on blood pressure.  Albuterol is made up of 2 isomers, an L and an R isomer.  The theory is that it is the L part that gives most of the benefits and the R part that give most of the side effects.  Xopenex is only the L part of albuterol.  Thus, it should have the beneficial effects of albuterol but less side effects.  In studies this has been shown to be true to an extent.  If the Xopenex is used frequently, the side effects match that of regular albuterol.  Xopenex used 4 times per day or less should, in theory, have less side effects than albuterol.  Having said that, there are some people that get the side effects no matter how little they use it.  One of the side effects is increased heart rate.  This can also increase blood pressure.  Generally, this effect wears of after 30 minutes or so.  I would not recommend checking your blood pressure right after using the Xopenex if you want a representation of what your blood pressure normally is.  If you want the upper limits of how high it's going, check after  using the Xopenex.    When combining medications, caution must always be used.  I would recommend that you discuss all your medications with your primary care doctor.  Your primary care doctor should be the \"coordinator\" of all your medications and discuss issues with the specialists in order to make sure that all the specialists know what is going on.  Best wishes.  I hope this isn't too confusing.\n\n",

    "content": "My question is pretty simple. I am a recovering alcoholic, 41 year old Male. Two years ago I was prescribed 25 mg of Toprol . Since my drinking always had a part in my HBP(140-160/95-110)) it never seemed to work. In the last 6 months I have been given several other meds. They all had horrible side affects. My doctor then prescribed 50 mg Toprol. In my time of sobriety I chose to try to wean myself off of the medication . In the past 2 weeks I have been cutting the pill in half and taking meds every other day. And now not taking them at all since my BP readings were great. My concern now is what is to low. I don\u00e2\u20ac\u2122t seem to have a problem during the day. My readings resting are around 132/82 or 127/78 depending on time of day. But when I retire and am resting in bed watching television they drop to 117/71 and sometimes a little lower .Before relaxing in bed I have been drinking 1-2 large mugs of strong Chamomile tea to relax The low pressure makes me feel so weak and gives me feelings of faintness. Last night I awoke with this fainting feeling and my BP was an amazing 108/56 .. While sleeping what is considered normal and what is considered Dangerous..? I have been doing great in dealing with and fighting off the Depression and Anxiety /Panic that I was plagued with during my heavy drinking. I know that last night seeing my blood pressure being so low started to bring on Anxiety and Panic. I do not want to feed any of my emotions to elevate these problems..  ( I have had many test's from EKG, Eco. and heart monitor 6 months ago. I could post the results if you would like to review them on a seperate thread) Thank you Edward D.\n\n",

    "content": "Edward, First of all congratulations on your sobriety and your obvious efforts to remain off the alcohol!  Overcoming any addiction is very difficult and I commend your courage and \"stick-to-it-iveness\".   A couple of things: 1.  You did not mention all of the reasons that your MD had recommended Toprol for you - or why he increased the dosage.  I gather that he had considered other medications, but again you did not indicate if they were all for high blood pressure or for any other conditions - including withdrawal. If you have other cardiac issues, then Toprol may indeed be the drug of choice for you. I have given as little as 6.25 mg of the medication, depending on the patient, medical concerns, and pt tolerance to the effects of the medication.  2.  Blood pressure parameters also may vary from person to person. \"Normal\" for one person may be as low as 90/50.  For another it may be 140/ 86. For another, an uncontrolled blood pressure may be 200/ 120.  (Such an individual definitely needs medication to support a more optimal blood pressure.)   Medical problems can cause the body to run either high or low or high normal or low normal.  If you are feeling dizzy or weak, I strongly recommend you tell your primary physician, and let him know you do not choose to take medications if they either are not necessary, or if they make you feel strange.  Please be sure to follow up on all your appointments, and any ongoing blood tests that your primary MD feels is important for your care. Especially tell him of your abnormal symptoms. He may be able to adjust, or even eliminate any medications that may be not needed at this time.  Your medical team of doctors, nurses and ancillary support services work together with your input to provide the best healthcare possible. When you feel you can trust these people, your anxiety level should decrease.\n\n",

    "content": "The most important thing you can do is make sure your blood pressure comes under control.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Regarding your pupil size, there are a few causes of this.  They range from a harmless, incidental finding with no real cause identifiable to more severe things like a mass pushing on one of the cranial nerves that control pupil size.  CT scans are good for looking at the brain.  MRI's are better for looking at masses in that particular area.    Elevated intracranial pressure can cause this as well; however, increased ICP to this extent generally will be associated with vomiting and mental status changes.    As long as you are feeling well (no vomiting, no bad headaches, etc.), this is not something that you need to go immediately to the emergency room for but you should bring this to the attention of your doctor as soon as you can to get a full evaluation and make sure that nothing serious is going on.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I moved to a different state 6 months ago, encountering new flora.  I also have a cat. I am 5/5\" and weigh 140, a size 8.  I tend to gain around the middle. I have been in good health always, except for the allergies.    Since moving, I have needed to use Albuterol more often.  I was taking Claritan-D, but have since started taking just Claritan (without the decongestant.)  I did that because I noticed that I was having an elevated pulse rate, all the time.  My resting rate (during the day, have not taken it on rising) is around 95-105.  After I noticed that, I started taking my blood pressure, and it is ranging somewhere between 118/89 to 124/99.  EEEK!  Could this be a reaction to the combination of albuterol and pseudoephidrine?  I stopped the decongestant, but I have been going through approx an inhaler evey two months.  If it is not a reaction to that, then it must be hbp.  I have started a comprehensive multi-vitamin, fish oil, coq10, potassium and additional b vitamins, and am really watching the salt and fats.  I also go to the gym 3 times a week.    Help!  Do you think it's the albuterol, and perhaps I should look at a preventative instead, like Singular?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mejo - Everything makes sense, at least up to a point. The change in area with exposure to new flora, increased use of Claritin D and albuterol, increased resting rate and slightly elevated BP. However, the psuedoephedrine is now out of the equation (and for the best, in my personal opinion, as with allergic rhinitis and/or asthma the pseudoephedrine isn't all that useful as a rule).  Still, going through an albuterol inhaler every two months on average, you almost certainly should be on a preventive maintainance steroid-based inhaler like Singulair, with resort to the albuterol only when asthma symptoms break through (albuterol is best used as a \"rescue\" medication rather than as a means of keeping chronic symptoms at bay).   The albuterol alone,  in the amounts being used, could very well be causing the moderate increase in heart rate and blood pressure. I would recommend asking for a maintainance inhaler like Singulair, save the albuterol for when you're having real problems despite the steroid, and then see if things don't settle down within a week or so of starting the new regimen. Meanwhile, the rate and pressures you're having now are within or very close to normal limits and not something to be  too concerned about unless both continue  or increase after you've reduced albuterol use.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

While I do think sIngulair would be more effective for you than  Claritin, my reference to \"steroid-based inhaler\" was intended to be a separate reference to Advair DIscus inhaler. That and  SIngulair, with albuterol only during breakthrough symptoms, should give you the best coverage and in  all likelihood eliminate the elevated vital signs you've discovered.

Her endocrinologist said - we have about a million dollars in tests, and there isn't anything that shows up to cause it, so it must be primary.  Hers was 160/130 when she went to the school nurse with symptoms, and we've had just about every test you can think of.  She's now on lisinopril.  Anyway, I guess bp is a little \"top of mind\" for me after all that.  Although I've always been low/normal, I did notice my pulse rate was much higher than it should be, so I checked my bp (on her machine) and was concerned.    I will go and ask re: Singulair and Adavair, although there are some concerns about the Adavair long term, as well, I understand.  I was only on that once, Feb. 2006, when I had pneumonia, and was on it for two months.   Ok, I'm cutting back on the caffeine, finding a doctor here so I can do an asthma maintenance plan, and continuing exercising!   But, I do wonder why only the diastolic number was so elevated.  I was concerned, so thanks for the feedback!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - It's not surprising that elevated BP would be up front in your mind given your daughter's problem. Was there by any chance a 24-hour urine test done? I am thinking that when chronic elevated BP presents itself in someone this young it is often caused by pheochromocytoma, a usually bening adreanal tumor which secretes its own adrenaline. If that has been ruled out then there would seem to be no other choice than to resort to controlling the symptoms.  As for the concerns with Advair, I am assuming you refer to the warnings issued a while back because of its containing salmeterol, the active ingredient in Serevent. Advair is a combination of salmeterol and fluticasone (a steroid). If for any reason Advair is contraindicated because of the salmeterol, then there are maintainance inhalers containing a steroid only which are available. Almost all of the asthma-related deaths involving salmeterol were in either seriously compromised pulmonary patients or those with rapidly deteriorating asthma. If you or your doctor feel your asthma has worsened recently compared with the long-term, then that may be sufficient cause to try something that doesn't contain salmeterol. It is generally felt to be better to manage the overall problem without resorting to a \"rescue\" drug like albuterol, because of the potential to cause symptoms such as you have mentioned here.  I hope this is all useful to you and that you find a comfortable way to manage your symptoms.\n\n",

I was actually hoping for the pheochromocytoma, which I guess isn't such a great thing to have, but I thought that it was at least somewhat correctable.  But no.  Yes, we had a 24 hr. urine, plus even tested for Lyme disease (that was far-fetched) the only things high on the blood test were LDL at 138, total cholesterol 199.  They did a CT scan of the head, renal artery doppler, 24 hr bp moniter, checked cortisol, abdominal angiogram, etc. etc. It all took about 6-9 months to get to all the doctors and do all the tests and go through every possible idea.  And finally ended up at an absolutely fab pediatric endocrynologist at St. Joseph's in NJ.  Don't know why, not happy that I don't know, but  the answer for her is a lifestyle change (losing 20-30 plus exercise).  So, I'm cool and will go the smarter maintenance route with the singular first, then add Advair if needed (discussing with my doctor, of course - disclaimer, disclaimer :)  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello hatfield954 - A week should be more than sufficient to know whether or not the HCTZ is going to be effective. It's an odd swap from a beta blocker to a diuretic. Often the two are combined, or something other than a beta blocker is combined with HCTZ. Since your elevated blood pressure may actually be a long-term reflex response to your brain injury, one would think a beta blocker would be preferable, and there are many with less annoying side-effects than those associated with propranolol (which has been reported to cause short-term memory impairment, at least temporarily, as well as lethargy). In short, it seems you were getting what you needed with the propranolol, but were you actually experiencing memory loss during its use, or did you choose to discontinue it simply because of the possibility of memory loss? If it wasn't causing the actual problem and was working, it may have been a better choice than the HCTZ, which appears to not be working at the dose you are taking, and which has problems of its own, such as causing electrolyte imbalance due to excessive urination.  There are now many beta blockers and other groups of blood pressure meds that might work as well as propranolol without the annoying (or potential) side effects of either drug you've tried so far. You might want to discuss this further with your doctor, especially since after 6 days your BP wasn't properly controlled.   Good luck with this and please keep us update.\n\n",

Since my accident, there are a lot of days where my mind is not clear and I feel like I am in a dream all day long.

There are now many beta blockers and other groups of blood pressure meds that might work as well as propranolol without the annoying (or potential) side effects of either drug you've tried so far. You might want to discuss this further with your doctor, especially since after 6 days your BP wasn't properly controlled.   Good luck with this and please keep us update.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again - If you had no noticeable side-effects with propranolol and it was working for you, you'd be a lot better off on that or a drug from the same family.  HCTZ, by reducing the amount of fluid in your body it also reduces the fluid in your skull, which probably is causing the increase in CNS symptoms. I hope your doctor will change the prescription back as easily as he switched it the first time. I think you'll feel a lot better. Good luck to you and I hope you'll keep us apprised of how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello tinadee - I'd like to go down to near the end of your post and address something there first, then we can work our way back up. You ask \"How worried should I be?\" Forgive me for turning your question around this way, but ideally you shouldn't be worried at all. Worry only contributes to stress, anxiety, depression and increased blood pressure. On the other hand, you might well be concerned, mainly because of your remarkably positive family history for heart disease, which is in large part why your doctor has taken unusual steps to keep you healthy. A positive family history plus obesity is a big risk factor and you are now doing well with the numbers, so you have  less reason for concern than you might have had prior to starting the meds. Your lipids are all within normal limits for someone who has not experienced a coronary event, and the CRP and homocystine levels are, as you suggest, borderline. This is all pretty good, and your HDL (the \"good\" cholesterol) is fairly high, which is very good.   The number of medications you are taking is a lot to manage and I hope you will be very careful in keeping them organized. Hopefully you are also in some sort of ongoing psychotherapy to help you deal with the actual traumatic stress of the loss of your mother. The cardiac meds are probably going to have to be taken for a long time. The other stuff may just be temporary, so for the time being just try really hard to keep all that on schedule, and do try not to worry. Your doctor has taken the bull by the horns and is being very protective, but I don't think it qualifies as an \"overboard\" approach but rather a healthy concern.  The stress you have undergone can definitely have caused the sudden upswing in blood pressure. If it is managed well you may be able to come off the blood pressure meds in a while. I don't see anything in the mix of medications that is likely to have caused the increase in blood pressure. Stress alone can do that.  You are also doing a lot of positive things to help protect and improve your personal fitness and health, and that (exercise) can also help you manage depression and anxiety. The benefits of a regular exercise program, under the direction of a doctor, cannot be overstated. All this should work together for good.   I wish you all the best. It sounds like you are in good hands and are also taking a lot of initiative too.\n\n",

    "content": "I appologize right away if this is a little long, but I need to be as detailed as possible.  I am a 24/m who has been having elevated blood pressure, anxiety attacks, and chest/heart palpitations.  I used to have problems with anxiety attacks back in 2004 before I had surgery for Hernia.  They told me if they came back after my surgery they would diagnose me with an anxiety disorder and put me on medication.  After the surgery they went away for a while but gradually started coming back.  For the past year I have noticed I had a palpitation that made me cough occasionally.  It doesn't happen too often, sometimes when I'm standing, but the majority of the time it's when I am laying on my stomach.  Feels like a hard pound or skip beat and then a cough.  They sometimes occur right before my body starts to have an anxiety attack.  I went to the doctor to talk to them about all of this and he told me to monitor my blood pressure for 4 weeks then come back and he'll talk to me about the palpitations.  For the past week and a half my blood pressure has been averaging about 150/88.  With the last two days being 163/88 and 163/98, also noticed some minor chest pains.  My body then tried to have 3 anxiety attacks within 3 hours, so I called my doctor and talked to a nurse who said that one per hour isn't good, go to the emergency room.  I went there, they asked my history, what the anxiety attacks and palpitations felt like, hooked me up to a heart monitor and said everything looked good.  The doctor gave me anxiety pills to take for the next week and a half, and said if they didn't help, tell my doctor and they might put me on a at home heart monitor for 12 weeks.  This emergency room trip was 2 days ago, and my occasional chest pains haven't gone away.  I don't want to go back to the emergency room again since he said it was nothing, and I don't see my doctor until January 12th.  I am currently enlisted into the Army and scheduled to go to basic training May 17th...they don't know about these problems, and affraid if I tell them I could get discharged and won't be able to go...I am going for special forces so the training is intense, and I have to jump out of planes for airborne training.  I'm just affraid that if I don't tell them the problems will persist down there and something bad could happen durning a jump or during the hard conditioning.  Should I be really worried about these problems? Would it be safe to not tell them about this?  I NEED HELP!!! SO CONFUSED... Oh, and I'm a healthy person, not overweight, have always been athletic, eat healthy....5'11 180...I have taken steroids before in my life but only for about 3 months, have also taken multi vitamins, creatine, and lifting supplements from GNC...High blood pressure runs in my family, but not heart problems...That is why I am really worried, I'm 24, in good shape, and eat healthy. Please someone respond..\n\n",

    "content": "Hello JdubC3 - It seems you have at least one clearly defined problem (panic disorder) and possibly some other symptoms may be arising from that one, or they may exist independently.   Your history as you decribe it pretty clearly includes panic a chronic panic disorder. The palpitations you describe are of course felt by most people from time to time normally, but in a highly anxious person they can become more frequent. This is not in itself a problem, except that it often increases the baseline anxiety level, and so lowers the threshold for panic attacks.   PD also has as a typical symptom chest pain, which is usually located on the left side of the chest, and is usually, though not always, of a sharp, stabbing or fleeting nature.   Panic attacks can very often precipitate spikes in resting blood pressure as well, which further clouds the issue here, as you also could have hypertension independent of the PD. It makes it a lot more difficult to be certain, but taking  the pressure several times during different office visits often shows a relaxation response with normalization of the blood pressure in people who are simply \"hot reactors\" when anxious. These are the ones whose blood pressure spikes during anxiety or panic attacks then returns to normal afterward.  Two other matters stand out in your post: one is that you mention you have used steroids \"for three months\" but don't say whether the use is current or when it took place. The reason I mention this is that in some people steroids can precipitate anxiety and panic attacks because of the release of cortisol into the bloodstream.   You also mentioned that you were prescribed anti-anxiety medication, but didn't say which one it is. Knowing that would be helpful, as with some of them, some people can experience breakthrough of symptoms and may need a change in meds or an adjustment in doseage.  The other matter is that of you anticipating entering the armed forces and joining a very exciting and challenging unit (read that potentially anxiety producing). With as much problem as you are having with anxiety, panic and attendant symptoms, as well as the possibility of having high blood pressure (which would require medical treatment), it seems unwise to keep this information from your recruiter, as it could have a worse impact on your military career and performance than a delay or even a diversion into another field. You may well need to be on an anti-anxiety medication for some time, and may also wind up requiring something for the blood pressure as well. It seems unwise to go forward with your very admirable plan to join an elite military unit until and unless you have these issues  managed first.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again, and you're very welcome. I'm glad to hear the steroid use is not recent, although the first period of use occurred in the same year your panic attacks first began, so that is suggestive that it may have been the thing that triggered them. Of course you were also anticipating an anxiety producing event at that time, too (surgery) just as you are now (military service). Anticipation is a big part of anxiety disorders and panic attacks. Steroids can raise the cortisol levels to the point where anxiety and/or panic takes over and even though the steroids may be out of your system, once a person has had a full-blown panic attack the thing sometimes takes on a life of its own - the patient then anticipating the next one. This becomes a self-fulfilling cycle.   Alprazolam is one of the most commonly prescribed drugs for panic disorder, and it is effective, in sufficient doses, over the short run. However, it has a short half-life, so clears the system fairly quickly and can allow breakthrough anxiety to start the cycle over again. As well, .25 mg is a fairly low dose (and of course doctors wisely try to start people out on the lowest dose of most any drug, and work up to an effective dose). The problem is that alprazolam is more like a band aid approach to a potentially long-term problem and has potential dependency issues as well (it can begin a cycle of anxiety, take a pill, feel better, pill wears off, anxiety comes back, take another, etc.). There are other drugs in the same family which are longer acting and may be more effective at keeping the problem under control.   None of this addresses the potential for a separate medical problem in the form of hypertension (which also could have been begun by the steroid use). I'm glad to hear you've sworn off using those substances, as while they do have some great medical purposes, when used as an adjunct to body-building they can be extremely dangerous.   The most immediate problem you face right now would seem to be whether or not to disclose your medical issues to your recruiter. While you probably don't have any life-threatening problems in the short run, being in the military at all, let alone during wartime and in a special forces unit, while trying to cope with significant anxiety and panic disorder could lead to you finding yourself unable to function at the top of your form, which could be life-threatening to you and others, in a very different way than simple illness. A bad judgement call in the field or the inability to think clearly under the stress of extreme training or battle conditions could cost you or someone else his or her life. I hope you will consider this while you are working on restoring the balance in your personal health situation.   Again, best of luck to you. There is a lot for you to consider. I hope this has been helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Diovan HCT is a combination medication that includes a hydrochlorothiazide (a diuretic) and valsartan (a newer class of medication known an an angiotensen receptor blocker or ARB).  The valsartan has similar side effects to the more well known ACE inhibitors.  Norvasc is amlopdipine which is a calcium channel blocker.  This medicine works to reduce the smooth muscle contraction of the blood vessels andallow them to relax some (simply put).  It also has some effects on the heart's pumping strength.    There are no significant interactions between these medications, with the exception of both being blood pressure lowering medications, so the two together can occasionally lower BP too much.    If you are experiencing side effects from the medication I would suggest you talk with your doctor.  There are many \"regimens\" to control high blood pressure.  You may be able to change to a different method that will give you less side effects.  Also, some side effects fade over time, so you may just need a little more time on the medication to adjust to it.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "high systolic but low diastolic",
    "content": "Hi everyone,  My name is Tim and I'm a 25 year old veteran. I do not smoke and rarely drink. No family history of heart problems however ironically all the guys have been heavy drinkers and smokers for years without any health problems. For the past 3 years I have been suffering from severe episodes of heart palpitations that are completely random as well as hypertension that is just as random. I was put on Diltiazem and could have sworn my doc was trying to kill me. It made my condition 3xs worse. Since then I haven't been taking meds. I have mild anxiety symptoms and don't sleep very much. Always been a high strung kinda guy but also exercise religiously. Just recently I have been getting a steady ache just left of my sternum just where you feel your heart beat. I have been a well conditioned runner for the past 5 years but recently injured my ankle so exercise has been slim to none lately for the past 2 months. I have been to doctors more times than i can count and have received ekg's and the other one where they use sonar. I have been told everything has been perfectly fine. However, I have always had a very strong heart beat that jolts various parts of my body. I just recently had my blood pressure taken that resulted in 151/ 70? How is it that my systolic is high but my diastolic low? What could this be a sign of? I really feel cheated due to living as a health enthusiast. Any professional educated guesses would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Palpitations can be caused by many causes:   1. Unfitness (obviosly not in your case).  2. Smoking.  3. Too much caffeine in the blood, for example coffee, tea, pop that contains caffeine.  4. Thyroid problems.  5. Heart problems.  6. Lung problems.  7. Electrolyte imbalances.  8. Not getting enough sleep.   It looks like most of the above problems have been excluded (thyroid, electrolyte problems cause abnormal rhythm which would show on your EKG).   Generally speaking the broad definition for hypertension is a blood pressure above 140/90 mmHg measured on both arms at two instances (several weeks apart).   It is very unlikely with your current reading that you do have hypertension at your age. Isolated hypertension in which the systolic blood pressure alone increases is more common in those above the age of 60.   Your elevation may be a case of white coat hypertension. However, it would still be a good idea to get another reading in a couple of weeks. If your readings are still high then a trip to the cardiologist may put your worries to rest.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks Dr. Fouad,  I have seen a cardiologist who actually thought I may need a catheter ablation. However, after giving it more time and thinking that it could have been after effects from war they decided against it once the palpitations started to settle. I have been going in for follow ups and have had high systolic on multiple occasions though it is normal or even low at other times. I have learned to relax when I feel palpitations or pains just from experience and time. The steady pain is something new though. I was originally concerned of an over sized heart due to my heavy heart beat and intense exertion while in the military. However, they said that it was in good shape. They also gave me the option to try other blood pressure meds. that I haven't done quite yet. Thanks for all the information it is something I am interested in and read about occasionally. I'll probably be on this site browsing around from time to time. Thank you...  Tim\n\n",

    "title": "Low urine sodium...",
    "content": "I am part of a bp study and I was taken off of my bp medication (hydrochlorothiazide) the first week in January.  The first week in February, I did a 24-hour urine study.  The nutritionist called to tell me my sodium value was low (I do not know the number) and I would want to speak with the person I was working with in the study.  I talked to this person (not the physician running the study), and she thought it was not big deal.  From what I've read, a low value can be caused by being on diuretics, but I couldn't find anything about if someone were to be off of them for a while.  Could this still be caused by the diuretics even though I had been off of the for a month?  Also, I have been having a lot of fatigue for the past several months, and could this have anything to do with a low sodium level?  Thank you,  Angie\n\n",

    "title": "Low Urine Na",
    "content": "Hi:  This is probably not significant, and is probably not related to the diuretic.   Thiazide diuretics inhibit reabsorption of sodium and actually increase the amount of sodium in the urine.  The increased sodium in the urine draws water out of your body, and decreases blood pressure (HCTZ also lowers BP by other  mechanisms).  Your kidneys naturally increase or decrease the amount of sodium that is reabsorbed based on your hydration status...If you are dehydrated, your kidneys will reabsorb more sodium.  This will draw water into your body to keep your blood pressure normal.  Urine volume decreases when you are dehydrated primarily because of the reabsorption of sodium.   Your urine sodium was probably low because you were slightly dehydrated.  Long term use of thiazide diuretics can theoretically cause a brief rebound effect of increased sodium reabsorption (and low urine sodium) when they are discontinued, but I think electrolyte movement would have normalized after a month.   Low *serum* sodium can also cause a low urine sodium.  Because you are experiencing unusual fatigue, it wouldn't hurt to have your serum sodium checked...This is a routine test that your family doctor can order.   My guess, however, is that the low urine sodium is simply due to a normal reaction by your kidneys to mild dehydration.  Thanks for your question!  -Reid (medical resident)\n\n",

    "title": "Shoulder pain and hypertension",
    "content": "Hi:  Your shoulder pain and numbness are not likely related to your hypertension or the beta-blocker (metoprolol).    Your symptoms are probably due to a musculoskeletal injury.  This is more likely if you've been doing any unusual physical activity lately (ie. lifting something heavy or playing sports).   Because of the numbness, I would also consider nerve root compression, although this is much less likely.  This may happen if you've injured your back at around the level of the shoulder blade.   Right now, I would take some ibuprofen (advil) for the pain, and try to rest your shoulder.  If the pain and numbness don't get better over the next week, I would return to the doctor for an x-ray or MRI of the spine.  However, I'm confident that advil and rest will relieve your symptoms.  Thanks for your question!  -Reid (medical resident)\n\n",

I guess that might be because of the minor stroke he didn't even know he had until like 3 weeks later.  He was doing fine taking only tenormin and felodipine.  It hasn't even been a full week and the changes are drastic.  Doctors recently changed his medicines to include all of these because blood pressure readings were not consistent at all appointments  He also takes carbamazepine and amiodarone HCL.

    "content": "Hi anthony2360, The information on the drug interaction check provided by Click here! provides the following information which has been copied and pasted from the site: You have searched for drug interactions between the following drugs: clonidine, tenormin (atenolol), felodipine, valsartan, carbamazepine, amiodarone  Please note: only generic drug names are displayed. Drug-Drug Interactions clonidine and carbamazepine (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Central nervous system- and/or respiratory-depressant effects may be additively or synergistically increased in patients taking multiple drugs that cause these effects, especially in elderly or debilitated patients.  MANAGEMENT: During concomitant use of these drugs, patients should be monitored for potentially excessive or prolonged CNS and respiratory depression. Ambulatory patients should be made aware of the possibility of additive CNS effects (e.g., drowsiness, dizziness, lightheadedness, confusion) and counseled to avoid activities requiring mental alertness until they know how these agents affect them. Patients should also be advised to notify their physician if they experience excessive or prolonged CNS effects that interfere with their normal activities. amiodarone and atenolol (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Additive effects of severe bradycardia, cardiac arrest, and ventricular fibrillation may occur in patients administered amiodarone and beta blockers. The mechanism may be related to additive slowing in AV conduction. In addition, amiodarone may inhibit the first pass hepatic metabolism of some beta blockers. However, a post hoc meta analysis suggests that the addition of amiodarone in patients in whom it is indicated, who are recovering from a recent myocardial infarction, and who are already receiving beta-blockers decreases the incidence of cardiac or arrhythmic death.  MANAGEMENT: Clinical monitoring of patient hemodynamic status and response is recommended.  atenolol and clonidine (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Clonidine and beta-blockers may have synergistic pharmacodynamic effects resulting in marked AV block, bradycardia and hypotension. Conversely, cases of antagonism of hypotensive effects have been reported, the mechanism of which is unkown. In addition, potentiation of the hypertensive rebound associated with abrupt withdrawal of clonidine or both clonidine and the beta blocker may occur. Increased blood pressure, hypertensive crisis, hypertensive encephalopathy, strokes, and fatalities have been reported after clonidine withdrawal. The proposed mechanism is related to increased catecholamine release after clonidine withdrawal, and concurrent beta-blockade results in unopposed alpha-adrenergic effects of the catecholamines, resulting in vasoconstriction. Patients who discontinue clonidine while taking noncardioselective beta blockers appear to be at a higher risk of developing rebound hypertension.  MANAGEMENT: Close monitoring of blood pressure is recommended for patients receiving this combination. Patients should be advised to notify their physician if they experience a reduced heart rate, dizziness, fainting, or headaches. Clonidine should never be discontinued abruptly, but should be tapered off over 2 to 4 days. The beta blocker should be discontinued a few days before gradually discontinuing the clonidine. It has also been suggested that replacing clonidine and the beta blocker with labetalol (an alpha and beta blocker) may prevent rebound hypertension although some symptoms from increased catecholamine levels occur, or selecting a cardioselective beta blocker (e.g. atenolol, betaxolol, bisoprolol, metoprolol) which is theoretically not expected to exacerbate the pressor response. Patients being withdrawn from clonidine should be carefully monitored for blood pressure changes, severe headache, tremors, apprehension, flushing, nausea, and vomiting. atenolol and felodipine (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Additive reductions in heart rate, cardiac conduction, and cardiac contractility may occur when calcium channel blockers are used concomitantly with beta blockers, particularly in patients with ventricular or conduction abnormalities. While this combination may be useful and effective in some situations, potentially serious cardiovascular adverse effects such as congestive heart failure, severe hypotension, and/or exacerbation of angina may occur. The proposed mechanisms include additive slowing in AV conduction, reduced cardiac contractility secondary to beta-blockade, and decreased peripheral vascular resistance secondary to calcium channel blockade. In addition, some calcium channel blockers may inhibit the CYP450 metabolism of hepatically metabolized beta blockers, resulting in increased serum concentrations.  MANAGEMENT: Close clinical monitoring of patient hemodynamic response and tolerance is recommended if a calcium channel blocker is prescribed with a beta blocker, and the dosage of one or both agents adjusted as necessary. The same precaution should be observed when beta blocker ophthalmic solutions are used, since they are systemically absorbed and can produce clinically significant systemic effects even at low or undetectable plasma levels. atenolol and valsartan (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  GENERALLY AVOID: In the Valsartan Heart Failure Trial, the combination of valsartan with beta blockers and ACE inhibitors was associated with unfavorable outcomes on morbidity and mortality in heart failure patients. The mechanism is unknown.  MANAGEMENT: The manufacturer recommends that the triple combination of valsartan with a beta blocker and an ACE inhibitor be avoided in heart failure patients. carbamazepine and felodipine (moderate Drug-Drug)  Description:  MONITOR: Decreased felodipine bioavailability and serum levels have been reported in one study of 10 epileptic patients taking phenobarbital, phenytoin, and carbamazepine alone or in combination. AUC was reduced by 93%. The mechanism may be CYP450 enzyme induction by the anticonvulsants. Loss of antihypertensive efficacy may occur.  MANAGEMENT: Blood pressure should be monitored during concurrent administration. Dosage adjustments may be necessary. Alternative antihypertensives (e.g., amlodipine) may be considered.  I would strongly suggest that you notify his physician not only do to the possibilty on interactions regarding some of these medications but also due to the fact that his blood pressure and heart rate may be at abnormally low levels which will also cause him to experience symptoms. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

When my blood pressure has been taken in doctors offices it has come up normal however when I use the self tests at pharmacies I always come up as having hypertension.  I take a very low dose of propranolol twice a day mostly to make sure that my thyroid levels stay normal.  I have also noticed that when I take my pulse right when I wake up in the mornings it is around 60 beats per minute whereas mid day it is more around 80 even if completely relaxed.

    "content": "Dear Ceejay  You have mentioned that the increase in blood pressure you had was related to your hyperthyroidism.  a pulse rate of 80 is normal, and even 60 at rest is normal.  the fact that you are taking propranolol is an excellent choice , since it can help controling your over-active thyroid gland symptoms, and at same time help you maintaining a normal blood pressure and pulse rate.  My advice to you , is that if you feel that your blood pressure is not controlled , have your doctor check your thyroid hormone levels. This is important since your increase in blood pressure as you mentioned was related to your thyroid problem.  thank you very much, and i hope you always feel well\n\n",

    "content": "I have been exercising for Sprint Triathlons - approximately an hour and a half per day.  I started to get chest pains which after 24 hours of continuous pressure went and had a check up. My blood pressure was 158/100, a resting ECG normal.  I have since had my blood pressure taken again 48 hour later and the results were similar.  I have been told to wait another 48 hours and repeat the blood pressure reading.  I am 53 years, female and weigh 145 lb in reasonable fitness.  Can I continue training for my triathlon hobby with my blood pressure at this level while I am waiting for test results of a stress test and further blood pressure readings.\n\n",

Awaiting the test reposrts and the BP records, you CAN continue your Triathlon activity at your level of BP.

Doctor started me on Verapamil SA 120 MG once a day.  I guess for one, I don't even understand what makes that high.  While the lower number is normal, but the above number is high... does that mean something more specific than just \"HBP\"?  Also - is it normal to put a patient on meds for HBP on the first ever occurance of it?  I am 30, female, and I can't shake the feeling this is too young to head down this road.   I am overweight, I have a social anxiety disorder, and tensions are high at work.  My father (deceased) and mother both had/have HBP.     If there is any other info you need, please feel free to ask.  My follow up visit is at the end of the month.   Thank you\n\n",

Next, if the readings show highs most of the times but the levels of 150 to 160 systolic, I would advice my patient to a. reduce weight, b. workout regularly c. reduce salt intake, d. Increase intake of citruc fruits and vegetables, e. Reduce alcohol intake, f. stop smoking.  Next, if above measures do not reduce the BP below 140/90 level, only then I would put her/him on a small dose of Hydrclorothiazide and atenolol combination.  I hope this is useful to you.   Dr. A.

He had inflamation in his stomach andlower and digestive tract.  His past surgeries include back and knee surgery, and also his appendix has been removed  His mother died at 43 of Colon cancer, and his father died when he was very young, of some kind of rare blood disorder  (poly-arter-ritus?) but his fathers family is convinced it was not a natural death  Other than IB pro. and other similar over the counter drugs he is on no medications  He believes his current symptoms are not serious enough to take off work and see a doctor, he just finds the Headaches very bothersome  I, however, am concerned and would like your advice in the hopes that he will take it more serious than mine  Thankyou very much for your time  I.

    "content": "Hi.  Your husband, at age 44, has Stage I Hypertension. The JNC and WHO guidelines suggest that the BP should be below 140/90 mm Hg. However the treatment strategy is that this level of blood pressure which your husband has should first be  changes in lifestyle rather than drug therapy. If the lifestyle changes do not produce satisfactory result within 8-12 weeks then drug therapy should be instituted, which most likely will need to be continued for life.   The lifestyle changes that need to be made are as follows:  1. Regular physical exercise, minimum 25 days a month, like 50-60 min brisk walk, or aerobics or cycling or light jogging.  2. Weight reduction to a BMI[Body Mass Index] of 23. 3. Low salt diet. 4. Low fat diet. 5. Diet rich in natural fibres. 6. Diet rich in potassium. [citrus fruits.] 7. Meditation ond yoga.  The last one also will help reducing his anger and irritability.  The level of BP that your husband gas will not produce any retinal damage but you need to see an eye specialist for the same. Also a positive family history of polyarteritis can be the reason of his eye problem as well as the BP. A consult with a Rheumatologist will settle the issue.  His status of Hepatitis C has no direct relation to his BP. But his liver function tests should be monitored at six monthly intervals. You need to use barrier contraception to avoid getting infected with Hep C.   A. Madia.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Just as your doctor said, the liver problem with your mom can be due to ticlopidine, BUT this is a rare side effect known to occur in less than 1% of patients.  In all of the cases, the liver status will return to normal within a few days of discontinuing therapy. So don't worry.  Adult people can tolerate high levels of bilirubin because its a normal chemical of the body. High levels just indicate that it is not being removed properly(liver disease). Normal levels of bilirubin are: 0-10 micromol/l or upto 1.2 mg/dl. (your report is in micromol/l)  Normal levels: alkaline phosphatase: around 140 iu/l, alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase are around 40iu/l.  Now that the drug has been discontinued, further reports should show a falling trend in all three values. A repeat consult with your doctor will certainly help you. He may consult with a hepatologist/ gastroenterologist.\n\n",

May be increased to 40 mg twice daily.  2. The duration of effect of any drug depends on the dose taken, the interval between doses and the type of drug itself (half life). Inderal has a half life of 4 hours. This means after 1 dose of 10mg, maximum effect occurs in 2 hours, after 4 hours half of the drug has been metabolized, therefore you might expect the effects to last for upto 8-10 hours.  3. If taken in prescribed dose, and you are not asthmatic or  allergic......its ok to take it daily.  4. No effects on sexual performance noted at doses for social phobias/anxieties.\n\n",

Kidneys filter and maintain the bodies eletrolytes, such as sodium, and can further exasterbate hypertension if they are not funtioning properally. The kidneys regulate the balance of salt and water in the body, and if there is excess sodium, further causing the blood pressure to go up b/c of fluid retention. Your wife needs to have her kidney infection treated. As far as her increased fatigue, that is one of many sypmtoms of hypertension, and could also be an effect of the medication she is taking. Your wife should also consider a low saturated fat, low salt, low cholesterol diet to not further enhance her hypertension, and eventually lead her to coronary artery disease or other problem related to her hypertension.\n\n",

    "title": "Can blood pressure meds make your pressure higher?",
    "content": "Hope someone can shed light on this, on the verge of switching doctors.. I will try and make it short.. I was not feeling well, a flu a few years back and went in for some meds to help. They took my blood pressure and said it was high, so they had me wait a few minutes and took it again, it was lower. The doctor perscribed generic ziac which is bisoprolol/ hctz  at a dose of 2.5/6.25. Me not knowing anything i began taking this everyday.and the flu has passed several visits to check on the reaction on this on my blood pressure, its always high initially and found out in my opinion I have white coat hypertension.. A year has passed.. i went in for my yearly checkup and now he says my thyroid is low.. so now im on levothyroxine .75.. he upped it to .100  then to .112   6 months have passed and went back for check up and now again more med changes.. its now back down to .100 on the levothyroxine, still says my blood pressure is high and still on the generic ziac and he added lisinopril at 5mg     A few more months have passed and just had a check up and again more med changes... now its back up to .112 on the thyroid med, same 2 blood pressure meds, and now says my potassium is LOW.. so perscribed them and wants to do a addominal ultrasound to check liver damage?  I think this is getting way out of hand now, I don't drink at all ever, never smoked, but i do not eat right at all... how can all this happen when i never felt bad except for a cold... I really believe i feel worse now taking all this than before..  So my questions are: can blood pressure meds make your pressure higher, I do know now he has me on potassium tablets, and one of the pressure medicines i am on does make it lower because its a duiretic.. Should I stop taking all of this and let it clear my system and move on to a new doctor and start over... How can i believe all this med changes are not affecting my health to the bad or agrravating things... Please undwerstand .. I don't feel any better physically, if anything not as good.. and by the way.. my blood pressure is 117/77 to 181/81 in the morning before i take any meds... then it goes up..could this happen? Help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Blood pressure medications are meant to lower the blood pressure. The only time when they actually increase blood pressure is when one stops taking them, usually called a rebound increase. Diuretics are mild antihypertensives that do not usually cause this problem if begun alone. I do not think another doctor would approve of stopping all your medications. The range of values on your blood pressure measurement within  a day indicates that it is labile hypertension, that which swings out of normal. However, I do think that another doctor would help you understand your condition from a different light and rule out other possibilities. Diet restriction (decreased sodium/salt) and exercise go a long way to help control hypertension. What did your doctor say s/he wanted the liver ultrasound for?  bill\n\n",

    "content": "antihypertensive medications are indicated for  lowering  blood pressure, however it is very important that you stick to the schedule of taking your blood pressure medicine at the same time of each day. many times, non compliance, or skipping those medicines will cause rebound hypertension, making your blood pressure to go up. Make sure you never quit your antihypertensive medication suddenly, as it can cause your blood pressure to go up. your two medications seem to be reasonable, ziac and lisinopril. Note that doctors might be increasing or decreasing your medications to optimize your therapy, and many times the process takes time , or require changing in medicines to get into the blood pressure goal.  as far as for your thyroid medication, the doctors usually prescribe it based on your TSH and T4 leverls (thyroid stimulating and throid hormones). if the T4 is low, the doctor will increase the levothyroxine, and if its high, the doctor will need to decrease the dose. too much of levothyroxine will make you hyperthyroid, and this is undesirable side effect.  as far as for your liver scan, you have not indicated why the doctor asked you to do so, you may want to check with your doctor regarding that.  at this time, i recommend  - to continue seeing your physican and stick to his recommendation, and avoid seeing multiple and multiple doctors, as this might lead to multiple unwanted drugs, and therefore undesirable side effects. - to continue taking your thyroid med, as prescribed, and have your throid hormone levels monitored as recommended by your physician. - try to stick into low sodium diet and well balanced excercise program. thank you .\n\n",

If there is a big difference between the two arms, the reading of the higher arm is the one always used.   Yes, some of the cardiomyopthies can be reversible such as alcoholic cardiomyopathy. Taking a beta blocker such as toprol makes the heart functions improve in cases of cardiomyopthies as well. It is not a bad idea to start weaning the toprol and see the effect on the heart function.

    "title": "Sudden High Blood Pressure",
    "content": "10 days ago, in a rush to leave town for a funeral, I was feeling more stressed out than usual, very tense, jittery, somewhat short of breath, and palpitations.  I checked my blood pressure and it was 158/98. The symptoms passed after a few minutes but I didn't feel well for another couple hours.  My blood pressure stayed high (over 140/90) for the next several days, but otherwise I felt ok.   I saw my doctor when we got back to town 5 days later.  My BP was again 159/98. She did an EKG which was normal, and did some blood work which I am waiting to get results on.  She told me to stop the  oral contraceptives and put me on a diuretic.   My blood pressure is all over the place since then, but averaging still around 140/92.  My blood pressure has never been higher than 135/80 in the past, and is usually in the 120/70 range.  I have some tingling around my face and in my hands and generally don't feel quite normal, but started the day I started the diuretic, so I figure that may be a side effect.  My cholesterol was high last time I had it checked (6 months ago) but not high enough to warrant meds at the time.  I think the total was 230.  I do not smoke.  I am 5'5\" and 160 lbs.    I do weight training 45 minutes every other day, and walk some or shoot basketball  those days as well.  I got short of breath,  light-headed and had very rapid heartbeat after just a few minutes of shooting basketball on Saturday, which had also happened to me about a month ago.    I am still waiting to hear from the doctor on lab results and next steps.  I am worried this may be a heart condition.  If I had had a heart attack, wouldn't it show up on the EKG?  What should I expect the next steps to be?  I don't see the doctor again until next week and I am worried. Any light you can shed on this would be a big help.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Fluctuating BP and heart rates",
    "content": "I have found myself in a peculiar situation that no doctor has yet to successfully identify or treat.  Back in January, out of the blue, my face began to burn and tingle, my throat felt constricted, I broke out in hives, my heart rate accelerated, I was light headed with flushing sensations and my bp went up to 158/92.  I went to the Med Center and they treated me with Benedryl because they thought I was having an allergic reaction to something.  I felt better and went home.  A few days later I started having similar spell more frequently and at times with greater intensity. However, at times my BP dropped to 89/60.  I went to the ER and they ran some tests and everything was fine. They instructed me to follow up with my primary doc and I did.  They believed I was having some type of allergic response and they started me on steroids.  That night I had an \"explosion\" of symptoms and also had tremors in my legs.  I went to the ER and was admitted.  I was on steroids for a couple of days and was then removed.  They started me on Allegra and also on Troprol and Prinivil because my BP would not go down.  It ranged 130-150/90's.  I stayed in the hospital for 6 days while they did a ton of tests - holter monitor, ekgs, eegs, echo, blood work, urine collections, chest xrays.  Everything came back fine, although the holter did capture a heart rate of 130.  I was released with no diagnosis and stayed on Toprol for awhile but was taken off.    Since that time I have had random symptoms; sometimes only a few and other times all together.  The main thingsat this point in time are fatigue, fluctuatin bp, and heart rate.  Sometimes I feel like I my pass out.  My vision is blurry from time to time and my memory seems foggy.  My BP has been low (avg 90/50) and my heart rate will randomly take off, even at rest.  Stress is not an issue and nothing seems to provoke it.  If I'm up and about, my heart rate seems fast often.  I had a tilt table test and was told it was \"fine\"  They did not give me the drug because they didn't think it was necessary.  My BP stayed consistent but my pulse did raise to 118.  I had other symptoms during the test as well.  They prescirbed Nadolol, which I took for one day and wound up back in the ER with an explosion of symptoms and high bp with tremors.  I was taken off of it.  I was recently diagnosed with low blood volume, although they are not sure if this was a cause or an effect.  I was prescribed 5 grams of salt, gatoraide, and florinef.  I started the florinef and after a couple of days I felt horrible.  My BP was also up and I was light headed, had severe burning and tingling of my face, hives, etc.....  I ended up in the ER with a bp of 154/105.  After that, I saw a neurologist and he suspected that I had brain sensitivity (I did hit my head 12/31/04, but it was no severe and no concussion, although I did feel naseous and fatigued for two days).  He prescribed Effexor.  I was on it for a few days and could barely tolerate it.  When I developed chest pains (yet to go away but docs say they are not heart related) I was taken off of it.   So over the past few weeks, by BP fluctuates quite a bit, but usually low, especially when I am lying down.  I don't seem to get a drop in BP upon standing (occasionally I have) but the pulse does tend to increase at least 20 beats or so.    I am a 29 year ol female who was healthly and led a full life.  For the past couple of months I have had difficulty working and functioning because of my fatigue and other symptoms.  At times, I feel like I am \"hung over\" for days and nothing seems to help.  Drugs thus far have seemed to make things worse.  I had tons of tests - they've even looked for carcnoid and pheochromocytoma and found nothing.  My body doesn't really ache and some days I'll feel better (but not great) but in a couple of days, I seem to relapse.  There seems to be no triggers.   Sometimes symptoms will last several minutes while other times they last hours or days.  The only history I have is that two years ago I had an excellerated heart rate but did not have any of these other symptoms.  They gave me 25 mg of Toprol which I was on for a few months and then went  off.  I had been fine ever since.  Does anyone have any ideas or thoughts on additional tests or types of doctors to see?  I just want my life back.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Teikelberry,  i think you had an extensive work-up to rule out even the rare diseases.  The way your symptoms presented sounds that you had a major histmaine release in your body or stimulation of histamine receptors.   i recommend that you see a specialist in allergies if you haven't already seen one. If you are deemed to be allergic to something, you might end up having to change your work place or even where you live.  It is not easy to detect pheochromocytoma and carcinoid. i would recommend that you be seen an endocrinologist to have these tests performed in the best way possible if you haven't already seen one. Many of your symptoms point to either of these disorders. Especially the fact that when you had nadolol, your blood pressure went up and this could be a hallmark of pheochromocytoma. Increase in the blood pressure if prescribed a drug of the beta blocker group. Taking the toprol (which is a beta blocker) with nothing happening does not necessarily mean that you don't have pheo.  And i would also recommend that you have a test to detect adrenal insufficiency as well. Even though you were on florinef and it caused you problems, this does not exclude the possibility of adrneal insufficiency. These medications are best given under the supervision of an endocrinologist (in my limited experience).  i don't think that your symptoms are primarily related to the heart.   A neurologist was actually a good idea, were you tested for autonomic neuropathy? Even though these are not the typical symptoms but the fluctuation of blood pressure and heart rate might point to this condition.  No need for medications at this point unless absolutely necessary.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you kindly for your response.  Back in January I did have a 24 hour urine test to test for pheos and carcinoid while I was hospitalized.  I also had an MRI of my abdomen.  Both tests showed nothing..  I recently saw an endocrinologist and he repeated the 24 hr urine and did some blood work.  Everything came back fine again.  The only abnormality was that my metanephrine was low, which he told me not to worry about (are there concerns here?).    Over the last several weeks, my blood pressure has been rather low ranging from 89-107/52-75.  It seems to be the lowest in the morning and afternoon.  My legs have been extremely achy and my feet have been extremely cold.  I've had more tests on my heart - stress test and cat scan, blood work, ekg's and again, it looks fine.  Just yesterday though, at around noon I had a BP 97/59 with a pulse of 83 at rest.  It hovered around that area for a  an hour or so and then it shot up to 122/89, pulse 90.  A couple of hours later I ended up in the ER feeling weak, numbness & tingling in the left arm, and chest pressure.  The first reading was 137/96.  About an hour later it was back down to 93/67 and then a couple of hours later it read 107/74.  For some reason, I don't seem to have the ability to regulate my BP at this point.  What could be the cause?  I also recently repeated another tilt because I continue to have the episodes of racing heart, both at rest and upon standing.  For instance, I'll be up and about doing normal things (i.e. shower) and my heart will go into the 120s.  With this tilt, they layed me down for five minutes and then up for five minutes several times and gave me isobutronol (not spelled correctly I'm sure).  My heart immediately went up 50 beats (apparently the standard is 30) and it stayed up.  At the very end of the test, my diastolic pressure dropped to 42.  My systolic stayed the same for most of the test.  So, they gave me Lopressor (1/4 tablet twice a day).  I was on it for four days and developed an extreme thirst.  It was also about that time that I developed really cold feet.  They took me off of it.  They also prescribed Florinef again, but only .05 every other day for two weeks and then every third day.  It started off ok, but I then began to have some headaches and achy legs and more fluctuation in BP, so I assumed it was the drug.  I go back to the cardiologist tomorrow.    I'm not sure if I have been tested for the adrenal insufficiency.  I saw a nephrologist who did a work up but I have not got the results back yet. What type of doctor normally does the adrenal insufficienty test.   I've had no neurological testing at this point, aside from physical exam.  I did have an MRI of my head and cat scans which were normal.  At this point, he thinks I may have some impaired nerves in my neck screwing things up.  I'm not sure I am comfotable with that diagnosis at this point, but I am undergoing physical therpay in hopes of helping.    The other problem I have is a continuous burning/tingling of my face.  It comes and goes, varying in intensity but I can't seem to identify a trigger.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Teikelberry,  Thank you very much for the update.  i think that you should be seen by an allergie specialist. Histamine release can cause low blood pressure.  Regarding the low blood pressure, the blood pressure is not a constant number, i know that you are having symptoms with low blood pressure but there is no need to be so possessed about your blood pressure.  The adrenal insufficiency test is done by an endocrinologist.  Please, discuss the possibility that this could be a type of autonomic neuropathy with your neurologist even though the clinical picture is not typical.  If you have fatigue there is an entity called chronic fatigue syndrome and you can talk to your doctor about how this is worked-up.

The noise that you hear in your ear is actually the carotid artery as it passes near to this area.  i am not sure what is causing your headaches, sweating and blurred vision, these are non-specific symptoms, they don't have to be necessarily due to high blood pressure.   i suggest that you have a 24 hours blood pressure monitoring device to keep track of your blood pressure all through the day, while you are awake, sleeping, running, etc...

Hypovolemia here does not necessarily mean that the patient is bleeding and is hypovolemic  but it means that the intravascular compartment needs to be expanded more than that to have a more effective blood flow to the tissues.

Did you mean blood cholesterol instead of the blood pressure?  A blood cholesterol of 210 in a healthy young person with no risk factors for coronary disease does not warrant treatment. What was your bad (ldl) and good (hdl) cholesterol? You might want to have a follow-up blood test in a year or so.  If you meant blood pressure was 210, you have to make sure that this was not just a one time high reading and you have to have your blood pressure checked twice on two separate occasions and if it is found to be high, you need treatment.

The doctor said he wanted to try to control with diet and exercise.  I've totally cut out fast food (fries, fried foods) which I used to have only once in a while but then over the last 2 or 3 years has become more habitual.  Now I am only eating soy products (garden burgers etc), no cheeses, no dairy, lots of tea.  The question is this:  I've seen a few conflicting bits of information regarding what to eat.  Some say avoid foods high in cholesterol and others say its not relevant.  One dietician (Click here!) says eat something starchy at every meal (potatoes, bread, rice).  Others say avoid carbohydrates.  Prevention.com says that eating avocados is one of the top ten cholesterol reducing foods since it contains beta-sitosterol and that this reduces the amount of cholesterol absorbed from foods and the combination of this with the monounsaturated fat in the avocado makes it an excellent choice.  The handout my doctor gave me says to avoid avocados.  See why I'm confused?  Now I don't know what to eat.  Can anyone point me in the right direction or a source of information that is reliable.

    "content": "I am 24y female who has: high cholesterol since 10, been on med for 9 months to only watch my numbers rise.  9months ago I was at 262, now I am at 266.  My bad has gone down tho from 220 to 190.  I have a LENGTHLY family history of high cholesterol ranging from my father who died as a result @ 40y to a cousin who is 2yrs older than me and has had 3 heart attacks.  I also have another cousin who @ 30y has had numerous stints (coated) and quadrupal bypass (which blocked in 9 months).  I am extremely concerned about my health.  I have talked about this concern with my GP and although i trust his opinion, something is just not right.  I was sent to a cardiologist by my ob when I was pregnant last year because my heart rate was always above 160...even resting.  The cardiologists hesitated to check my cholest. because he said I was so young I had nothing to worry about.  I never went back to him.  But, I have gotten a pain from my jaw line down my neck...left side.  1st time I was on a roller coaster, 2nd time I was just really mad and stressed out.  I feel like I am not being taken seriously because I am so young.  I am well aware that my age makes it highly unlikely for many things...but i believe my concern is valid.  I guess my question is:  Could that shooting pain from my jaw to my neck be heart-related?  It only lasted until the roller coaster was over, well...it was still there a little but it became tolerable.  then, I went on another ride and it happened again in the same extremely painful intensity.  All in all, after the 2nd ride, I stopped and the pain...although much less intense, was still there for approx 30 min.  I also have heart palpitations.  I did wear a 24hr holter and dr said of 8 abnormal beats only 2 were of concern and because they were just outside the \"inside abnormal limits\" I shouldnt be concerned.  I think I covered everything.  If not, just ask me questions and I will answer them as best I can.  Oh, yeah, is there any test (besides a stress test) that could be done to check for a blockage (maybe) somewhere in my neck?  Any info you can offer I would greatly appreciate or any suggestions of questions I should ask my doctor would also be useful.  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello shartley, Some cases of high cholesterol run in families. They are rare and are known as familial (hereditary) hypercholesterolemia. There are many subtypes that differ in severity and in the abnormal process involved.  If your cholesterol is high and you have a family history of ischemic heart disease / stroke then this puts you at high risk of developing CHD. Symptoms such as you have described could be psychogenic, muscular pain among other things. They could also be due to heart disease. In your case I would take them seriously.   Have you done a stress test? Another test associated with a little more morbidity is cardiac catheterization, which involves the introduction of tiny microscope into the heart.  I am not saying you should do any of those tests right away. However, you should be taken seriously. I would advise you seek help from a second cardiologist. He will better assess the significance of your symptoms in relation to other risk factors.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Blood pressure measurement varies with time, position, and body status. What we measure now might not be what we measure a second later. On standing from the sitting position, there is bound to be a very brief slight drop in BP followed by a slight increase above sitting after about a minute or two. Prolonged standing may result in an additional drop in BP. A higher pressure during standing may be part of a person's hypertension. But a drop in BP more than 20 mm Hg could mean orthostatic hypotension, which occurs in dehydration, shock, drug side effect, etc.  Blood pressure measurement should be done such that the place of cuffing, be it the arm or the wrist, should be at level with the heart.   Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - I am not sure if this is cardiology related or should be somewhere else.  I was at our local health clinic a couple of weeks ago with a sinus infection and bronchitus.  At that time my BP was 150/100.   This past Friday our company had a health clinic at which time my BP was 164/100.  I purchased a BP cuff and have been monitoring it several times a day.  Most times it runs right around 150/100, but has been as high as 160+/110.  Lowest in past 3 days was 140/98.   Also I received results from blood tests taken at the health fair which is saying that a few of the numbers are high (compared to a range).  Alkaline phosphatase, hemoglobin, and hematocrit.  And as far as I can tell looking at the report the readings they are calling high are only a few decimals above the the high for that particular test ( like if the high was 15, mine might say 15..  I have an appointment scheduled for March 24th to establish a primary physician, and explained the BP.  Is there any reason I should try to get in before then.  Also, the fact I was getting over a sinus infection and  bronchitis, could that have made the blood test results higher?  I am 49 years old, and I smoke, and have heavy cardiac family history on my mothers side.  Thanks for the advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear juzme,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Most probably you have high blood pressure according to the readings that you told me you had on severeal occasions.  There could be a pitfall, however. You currently have a sinus infection and on augmentin, are you taking any of the over the counter medications? Many of these medications contain substances that can elevate the blood pressure, so, if you are taking any over the counter medications, it would be reasonable to stope taking them for a week or so before saying that you have hypertension.   From the figures that you told me regarding your hypertension, it looks that you have mild to moderate hypertension. This type of hypertension can be treated by trying things other than medications and then see the effect on the blood pressure and decide whether or not you need a medication.   First of all, you absolutely have to stop smoking. Second, if you are overweight, you have to try and lose weight. Your diet has to be low salt. You have to start an exercise program but before you do that you have to be cleared medically and it is a good thing that you are going to have a primary care physician. i don't think that you need to go to see your primary care physician sooner than the 24th of march unless your blood pressure reaches real high levels. i would stop smoking and start low salt diet and try to lose weight (if you are overweight) even before going to your primary care physician.  Regarding the abnormal lab values, if it is just decimal points above the normal value for the test, i don't think that there is anything to worry about but i would advice you to mention this to your primary care doctor once you meet him.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sir,  I would be most grateful for your help.  My mother is 71 year old. She has been suffering from high blood pressure for the last 40 years. Several months ago she has developed symptoms that may point out the presence of angina pectoris. Symptoms include chest pain attacks triggered by physical exertion or emotional stress, vertigo and tachycardia attacks. She has been prescribed the therapy which is a combination of ACE inhibitor, Vasotec (Enalapril Maleate) 2x10mg, beta blocker Inderal (Propranolol) 2x20mg, potassium sparing diuretic Lometazid 5mg and two nitrates, the first one being ISMN (Isosorbid Mononitrate) 20mg at 8am and at 3pm and the second one being Dilcoran (Pentaerythritol Tetranitrate) 40mg in the evenning. She is also advised to take 100 mg of aspirin with a meal once daily.   She is feeling much better now. However, I have some concerns and I would like to hear your opinion.  Firstly, is there a risk of hyperkalaemia associated with the combination of potassium sparing diuretic and ACE inhibitor? Secondly, is there a risk of developing tolerance to nitrates in her case? Finally, is the persistence of symptoms like tachycardia attacks a sign that a prescribed beta blocker is not efficient in her case?  I am looking forward to receiving your reply.  Sincerely, Branko\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Branko,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Yes, there is a risk of hyperkalemia in a patient who takes an ace inhibitor and a potassium sparing diuretic especially if this patient has kidney problems. But, although i am not really familiar with lometazid, from its name it sounds like a combination medication in which a regular (non-potassium sparing) diuretic of the thiazides family is included may be with a potassium sapring diuretic as you mentionned in your message. Even if your mother was prescribed the ace inhibitor only, her potassium should be checked after 1-2 weeks after starting the ace inhibitor to make sure that her potassium did not go up.  There is always a risk of developing tolerance to nitrates and that is why there should be a time interval called nitrate free interval to minimize this risk, this time should at least be 8-12 hours and i think you mother by taking her last nitrate tablet in the evening is not bad (but most probably i don't think that she will have a real nitrate free interval as dilcoran is a long acting nitrate and her blood will still be containing at least some nitrates for a while before the levels go down enough to be called a real nitrate free interval). i am not sure though why 2 types of nitrates. She could have been prescribed only one type and if she still develops chest pain on the first type then a second type could be added.  About the tachycardia, it could be the result of nitrate therapy and that's why beta blockers and calcium channel blockers are usually prescribed with nitrates to abolish this reflex. However, beta blockers are of course a corner stone now in treatment of patients who have coronary disease because of their protective effects on the heart.   i am not sure what you mean by tachycardia but if you mean that your mother's heart rate is not as low as it should have when she is taking the beta blocker, then this means that there is still room to increase the beta blockers or add another medication like a calcium channel blocker to obtain a lower heart rate (which is very desirable in patients with coronary disease) as long as patients tolerate this low heart rate. Don't forget that your mother is 72 and her heart in addition to suffering from coronary disease, is also affected by age related degenerative changes in the electrical wiring of the heart (conduction system) which sometimes makes it difficult to give medications that affect the heart rate for fear of developing heart blocks. To make a long story short, i don't think that the beta blockers are not efficient but rather the dose that your mom is taking is not sufficient.  In addition the only thing that you have not mentionned is what is your mother's cholesterol level and whether she is supposed to be taking cholesterol pills. And actually some of the studies show that even if the patient has normal cholesterol that the statin group of cholesterol medications has a protective effect on the on the arteries irrespective of its cholesterol lowering action. So, discuss this with your mother's doctor to see whether he thinks it is a good choice for your mother.

When you mentioned your cholesterol level, did you mean total cholesterol? How high was your 'HDL' type cholesterol? Have your thyroid, liver, and kidney functions been assessed?   Coronary heart disease is what you are at risk of with a high cholesterol, with your hypertension and diabetes adding to that risk. If your mother had her first heart disease before the age of 55, that would be yet another risk onto your list. I cannot definitely tell you if you are on the verge of a heart attack without looking into an angiogram, but I would definitely worry about your cholesterol level as long as it's not the 'HDL' type of cholesterol. A very high 'HDL' type cholesterol has a protective effect and would cancel one risk, if that is the case. A smoking history would again add to the risk.  Yet another risk would be brain attack or stroke.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Indeed your cholesterol value is the highest I have ever encountered.  Smoking is the single most significant source of preventable morbidity and premature death in the United States. Smoking is the best risk factor to eliminate to prevent heart-disease-related deaths.   High cholesterol could be due to two causes. Primary cause and secondary cause. Primary causes include Familial variety, in which one need not always expect one's family members to have the same problem (the polygenic variety). However, it would be best to screen the family to detect a primary variety. The secondary causes include diet, hypothyroidism, diabetes, nephrotic syndrome, uremia, liver disease, dysproteinemia, and certain drugs including thiazide diuretics, beta-adrenergic antagoniss, glucocorticoids, estrogens, progestins, retinoids, anabolic steroids, alcohol all have effect on cholesterol.   To rule out the secondary causes like hypothyroidism, nephrotic syndrome, and liver disease, it would be best to assess the thyroid, the kidney, and the liver respectively.  Among the drugs you take, dyazide would probably help increase your cholesterol because of its thiazide content.  Hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

I gasp for air, it is like I have to have a large amount of oxygen, this happens it seems when I am real relaxed laying down or after I slow down after activity, the first time it happened was last year, I was walking around the mall and stopped to look in a book store, it was very embarrising when I gasped a big breath, it is noisy and everyone around me looked. My friends always notice, it happens to me daily. I take 100mg of Atenolol in two doses daily, my current readings vary, by my own monitor they read higher in the mornings at 180/90-95 I have not had my monitor checked for accuracy so I don't take too much notice of it. I always see my doctor in the mid afternoons and I am always around 150/75-80. When I first went to the doctors a couple of years ago, I was very short of breath, and was generally weak, I was also having eye sight problems, my BP was 190/120. The small arteries behind my eyes were blocked causing my vision problems and I was told that other small arteries in my body were more than likely damaged due to my neglect to seek medical attention. I feel like sometimes my BP is too low during the day as I have periods where it is real difficult for me to consentrate and I get confused finding it difficult to answer questions..... I seem to take an awful amount of medication. The doctors had a problem getting my bP to come down and this combination was put together over time. Duretics have no affect on it at all and I was told when I requested to be put on duretics for my insurance to cover me that I could not be controled with them.  I would appreciate any advice.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 23 years old and an avid weight lifter.  I'm getting ready to start taking a few supplements so I decided to get my Bp checked before I start.  I know I will retain a little water, which inturs raises my Bp while on my supplements.    I check it 7 times a day in each arm and average the totals.  Left arm is 145/80.  Which is wayyy high considering my diet and cardio I do. Right arm is 120/65.    Why the difference in each arm.  I take it various times a day while sitting down.  I know my BP monitor is accurate.  Do I have high blood pressure? which arm do you go off of? Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Interarm blood pressure difference",
    "content": "Dear Oubeta, An acceptable inter-arm systolic blood pressure difference is 10mmHg. The difference in your case seems to exceed that. I would suggest before delving into the causes of this condition to have a doctor examine your blood pressure. Note that you should be rested for 5 minutes before the reading and that you should use an appropriate sized cuff.  If a doctor does indeed conclude the blood pressure difference is high (he may need to confirm this with a doppler), an underlying condition should be sought. Congenital conditions in the differential diagnosis include aortic coarctation and thinning of 1 of the subclavian, axillary, or brachial arteries. Acquired arterial conditions include aortic dissection, atheroma, thrombus, embolus, and extrinsic compression (as might be seen in association with a mass in the upper chest).  In this case you should have a contrast-enhanced CT of the chest to effectively delineate among the possibilities mentioned above. A vascular ultrasound would be helpful as well, but the CT would better show an extrinsic compression.   Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am questioning my physicians decision to start me on Zocor 10 mg. daily for an elevated total cholesterol level of 194.  I am a 43 year old female with no general health problems other than migraines.  My father has a history of high cholesterol. My mother has recently been diagnosed with Arteriolosclerosis at the age of 66 (with vasular dementia).   After testing my levels about a year ago my doctor suggested diet and exercise to try to get my numbers better.  I have been watching my diet for about 9 months and have dropped 18 pounds.  I have yet to get myself into a regular exercise routine.     After one years time-  My triglycerides which were only 82 at original testing dropped to 65.   My good cholesteral went from 39 to 43.   However, by bad cholesterol (136? can't find my report!)  and my  total cholesterol did not change one point - still at 194.    At this point my doctor suggested 10 mg. Zocor daily.  He states that he would like ALL of his patients to take statins - because they are soooo good!  He would like my total level to be below 160 for optimum health.  I am very nervous about starting statins after hearing such opposite information. Either they are the best thing since penicillin or they are to be avoided completely!  HELP?  Just wanting to hear someone elses opinion.  THANK YOU!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Joana, Blood pressure is actually two readings. You will often here a reading such as 120/80.  The first is the systolic (happens when blood is forcibly pumped out of the heart creating a pressure wave in the body arterial system. The second is the diastolic blood pressure which happens as the heart relaxes. If you are referring to systolic blood pressure then the lowest 'normal' is usually 90. For diastolic blood pressure the lowest acceptable reading is 60. However, variability does exist and to answer more properly yes it is possible to attain lower blood pressures than this without serious decompensation.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Cyberchick.  Thank you very much for using our website.  The symptoms that you mention could be worrisome. Depending on your age, if you are near the age of menopause then these symptoms could be related to menopause, the hot flashes, lightheadedness, shakes, not sleeping well and have mood swings. All these could be symptoms of menopause.  But if you are not near menopause then a few possibilities could be taken into consideration: 1. Early menopause. Uncommonly, a few number of women go into menopause earlier than others and blood tests should be done to check ther hormone levels in the blood. 2. Thyroid hyeractivity especially if you are getting nervous more nervous than usual, loosing weight, not sleeping well (Sounds like menopause, doesn't it?).   3. Condition called pheochromocytoma where there is an excess of adrenaline in the body. This is associated with high blood pressure. 4. Condition called carcinoid syndrome where there is excess of a substance called serotonin especially if you have occasional wheezing and diarrhea at the same time you have these episodes.  My advice to you is be checked by your physician to make sure that there is nothing going on.  About low blood pressure, how low was it and who checked it for you and where you having symptoms then when it was checked? Do you have any chronic medical problems that you are being treated for with chronic medications? Are you taking any over the counter herbal medicines or nutritional supplements that might contain substances that would make your blood pressure go down and you would not know about.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and waiting for your reply.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
