    "content": "I got mono when I was 29 years old.  Prior to that infetion I was EBV free.  I actually had to beg the Dr. for the test because he thought there was no way I could have mono at 29.  Anyway, it's been 2 and 1/2 years and i have not been well since the infection.  I have had numerous URI with bad bouts of bronchitis and sinusitis.  Since July of 2008 I have had 5 infections.  Since january 2009 I have dropped 20lbs.  My last infection started in March.  I just woke up with no voice and had Acute laryngitis for 2 weeks and eventually ended up with another bout of bronchitis.  This prompted my dr. to check my immunoglobulins.  IGM was 32 and my IGG was 836 can't remember what my IGE or IGA was.  CBC was normal.  It is the end of April.  I still have a cough at times but seem to have a fever that comes on in the evening a few times a week.  I have had some night sweats and intense itching at night on my feet and across my chest. I'm tired of being sick all the time and i am completely exhausted.  Should i be worried at all about Lymphoma with a normal CBC??  How great is the risk when exposed to EBV later in adulthood?\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a swollen and painful supraclavicular lymph node left side since February 2005.  I went to the Dr. and they asked if I had been sick?  Yes, I had a terrible respiratory, cold infection in January that lasted about 3 weeks -but had no fever. After I told them that, they prescribed Bactrim -antibiotic? and decongestant, and nasal spray.  I took those for 10 days, and there was no improvement.  I went back to the Dr., and they referred me to a surgeon for a biopsy.  I went to see the surgeon, and we started with a chest x-ray, and now I am scheduled for a CT scan with contrast of the neck and chest on Monday.  I am having a terrible time with all the wild thoughts that are coming in my head (and also some of the things that I have been reading on the internet, ex. that for people over the age of 40, a supraclavicular swollen lymph node is cancer 90% of the time.  So I have convinced myself that it is cancer (because I do smoke) and I am dying.  Is there anyone who can shed some light on this and maybe ease my mind a little bit that I am NOT dying?  I have tried to get some answers from the Dr. about the chest x-ray, but they won't tell me anything.  Would you progress with a CT scan if the x-ray showed something abnormal, or would I be progressing to a CT scan even if the x-ray showed normal so they can rule out (I hope, I hope) certain things?  I am an extremely nervous person, and these wild thoughts are getting the better of me -I need a Xanax.     Thank you for anyone who might be able to help me.\n\n",

The fact that it was tender at one stage is more in favour of inflammation which is why your doctors put you on antibiotics. If the lymph node is large enough (more than 1 cm) or is growing then I would follow your doctor's procedure of ruling out cancer by CT scan of the chest and if needed abdomen and pelvis. According to the clinical examination you may need further investigation. Best regards.\n\n",

I have no  mouth lesions and the other areas of lymph nodes are not affected, from what the dr. says.  The pain radiates to the back of my neck sometimes.  I am just so scared at this point and hating to have to wait for the testing on MOnday.  So you are saying this stuff I read on the net can be wrong about the % of being cancer?  I just would like to think that it could be something other than cancer.  Again, thank you for taking time with me.\n\n",

Many 'inflammations' of the lymph glands can persist for some time. If it is two centimeters in size then all I can tell you is that it should be taken seriously. That is exactly what is happening now. Until the results come out I would not worry about it if I were you. Let's go one step at a time and not jump to any conclusions.

    "title": "CT scan results back",
    "content": "HI.  I went to the Dr. yesterday.  My results of the CT scan of the neck and chest showed a mass on the left side on/in the thyroid.  The first doctor thought it was a lymph node and was puzzled so he sent me to another doctor that he says has more expertise.  He was nice enough to send me right away instead of lettimg me wonder what the heck is going on.  He is very compasionate and understands that this is really playing havoc on my nerves.    The new doctor read the CT scan and (chest x-ray, which was negative), and said the mass is on the left thyroid causing my wind pipe and stuff to move to the right side and be out of place.  He also did an ultrasound in the office.  The Dr. decided that a needle biopsy would not do me much good since the mass must be taken out anyway.  I guess then they will know if it is cancer or not (praying it is not).  If it is, he said they would remove the entire thyroid and maybe a couple of lymph nodes, and then I will have to do some type of radioiodine thing.    He also mentioned that there were some 1-2 mm spots on my lungs but did not seem too worried about that and just talked about the thyroid.  He told me that thyroid cancer has a good prognosis?  He also told me at this point, he just does not know if it is cancer or not.  I am having panic attacks constantly now because I have convinced myself that this is it, and a year from now, I will be dead.  I do smoke and I want to quit desperately, but all this stress has made this virtually impossible.  Without even knowing it, I will light up.  I then think \"you stupid idiot\" stop this immediately.    I am very scared to say the least.  The doctor's office is supposed to call today and get me set up with the preoperative testing and then we go from there.  I am just praying that I will get through this without losing my mind.  Thanks in advance for any input.\n\n",

They decided not to remove the swollen supraclavicular left lymph and just cut out pieces and sent in for biopsy.  It came back malignant from an unknown origin.  The surgeon flat out told my husband that I have lung cancer.  When I went to a medical oncologist, he told me that I had to have more tests to determine the origin of the cancer.  I am scheduled for a PET scan on Monday.  Needless to say, I am petrified what all this means.  Does it make a difference which side of the neck the swollen node is on?  I know I have cancer but where could it really be?  One doc says lung and one says he is just not sure he can say it is lung cancer.  The node is on the left side of my neck.  Anywhere I could look to find some info out about this?  At this point, all I am feeling is gloom and doom.  Any input?\n\n",

The sooner they have the reason, the sooner they can treat you and make you better, so keep your chin up!  Don't look at it as being on the road to disease, but rather, you're on the road to recovery!  Would you mind too much if I asked you about the nature of your swollen node?  Could I ask if you could feel the node itself, or did you have general tissue swelling above the supraclavicular nodular area?  I've read the statics as well, and I too, am very concerned and worried about my personal situation.    Take care and I pray everything works out well for you, Bdusk\n\n",

    "content": "About 3 or 4 days ago I woke up and noticed a slight stiffness in my neck. On the back of my neck, left side at the hairline, a small, hard lump appeared under the skin literally over night. The lump has no coloration and is perfecty round, not irregular and pea-sized. I am not sure if it is just a \"kink\" or somethink to be concerned about.   Over the past couple days the area surrounding the small lump has become relatively tender. This could be due to the fact that I'm constantly poking and prodding the area but, again, I'm not sure. There have been no headaches, no blurriness of vision and only a slight throbbing (mostly noticable when I mentally focus on the area).  What are the possibilities here? I'm worried about things like an aneurysm, but from what I've read, they are not hard and immobile if they do protrude. I'm also wondering about possible glandular problems, but I don't know gland location so well. Any ideas? Am I just being paranoid over a kink or an ingrown hair?\n\n",

    "content": "There are glands in the back of the neck. You will find reference to them in the article I posted to you. These are the occipital lymph nodes, the posterior cervical lymph nodes and the jugular chain of lymph nodes. If we assume that this is a lymph node then most of the time the cause is an infection. The only clinical concern is to rule out any possibility of malignancy. I am leaning towards an infection but given the constraints of the internet I feel that I have not been able to satisfyingly rule out possible malignancy. Ofcourse it could be a myriad of other things which are less alarming. Aneurysms tend to be throbbing on touch (you can feel a very strong pulse there). Being in the back of the neck that wouldnt be a classical presentation. I would recommend you have someone look at it. There is no substitute for clinical examination in your case.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I've a problem similar to those stated here.  I'm 17 and for the past two years I've felt a lump at the back of my neck, about an inch from my right ear, and about a centimeter below my head. The lump is about 2 cm in size.  I asked my father about it (he took four years of pre-med in college before switching to dentistry) and he told me it is nothing, so I let the topic die for a while.  After reading a novel where the main character had lymphoma, the topic had inhabited my mind once again.  Soon, I began to search the rest of my neck, pressing hard on it, and I found other lumps...one was less than a cm in size, and rest about the size of this: O.  Eventually I went to my physician and she, also, told me not to worry about it.  My problem is this, I told the physician about an ear infection I had for the past three months and I think she assumed the lumps where associated with that.  But, like I had previously said, they have been there for much longer than three months.  Should I continue to worry, or see my GP again?  Oh, and the lump is painless (unless you count the occasionally pain in the neck I get).\n\n",

These  bumps are nto pea-sized though and my school nurse has no clue as to what they could be.  She says I should see a doctor soon about it, and im going tommorow, but i just thought I would check online first.  One morning I woke up and these bumps were here.  About 2 days later they start to get very hard like scabs and give out a pulsing pain almost like a shiver down my spine except it hurts and it goes across my face and neck.  They have darkened I think not that i can really see back there too well, and my neck has gotten noticably tender, almost a raw feeling.  I can't seem to leave the area alone and its right at my hair line about bottom of earlobe level, and I have not recently gotten a haircut.  Every adult I've asked so far says its definetly not a spider bite, but doesnt know what they are.  And every adult has also tried to scare me by saying its that brown recuse house spider or whatever that thing is called, and I have a day to live, and so on.  My parents keep changing their mind about it: first its acne, then its allergies, now it could be eczema or something I can get from getting kissed back there (which I havent been so its obviously not that).  I would like a response ASAP\n\n",

I suddenly realized that it was extremely painful to turn my head to the right, as well as turning it to the left. This scared me, and I immediately went home and lay down for a couple of hours. The next day, the pain was less, and I could turn my head with less pain. That was about two years ago.  Now, the same pain is starting to flare up again. I was playing a football game today, and I noticed the sharp pain again when I turned my head to look for the ball. I can feel a hard lump underneath the skin (right below the hairline, about an inch behind my right ear). When I went to the doctor, he could barely feel it, and said it was probably nothing, but I could have X-rays (really expensive) if I wanted to be sure or know more. What would be the best course of action in this case?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I also have a small lump on the back of my neck. I know I have had it at least 2 years, if not more. The more I think about it, the more it tends to \"hurt\" or \"feel different\". It really doesnt hurt, but recently in the past month or 2, it feels like my neck is getting stiff regularily. What signs should I watch for? I went to a doctor for a work physical and he looked at it and asked if it ever hurts or turns red and i replied no, so he thought nothing of it. I have not been to a doctor specifically for the lump, but I am thinking I should. Other doctors that I have been to have felt it, but said nothing.  I am kind of worried here and I really don't know what \"symptoms\" to watch for if this is really something serious.   Another fact is that I do have my wisdom teeth in, but have not had them removed yet either and they have been in for quite some time. Could this cause it?   There is only 1 lump, and it is on my hair line on the right said of my body. It does not appear to be growing in size. I have not been feeling sick at all and I work out 3-5 times a week and am not affected by the lump then either, just when I am at home and have time to thinkabout it.  I Hope someone can help!!  Worried in WI....\n\n",

I felt around more around the back of my head and found three others.  There are all quite large, firm and painless.  I researched and found that it may be my lymph nodes.  So I felt around the other places of my body where lymph node are supposed to be.  There are a couple of little lumps on the ride side of my groin, several little ones on the sides of my neck and one just above my collar bone.  For almost a  year now I have been fatigued and told my doctor but we weren't able to find a cause so I just kind of gave up.  I also will very frequently have headaches.  These have seemed to occur with the fatigue.  It's been bad for quite some time now but hasn't seemed to get worse.  Is this a cause for concern? If so then what are the most likely possibilities of what it is?\n\n",

I immediately checked the other side for comparision and nothing was on the other side.  The lump is on the left side of the back of my neck, approximately level with bottom of my ear lobe on that side and right between my cervical spine and ear (right beneath my hairline).  It is about the size of a dime and does not move when I rub it.  It does begin to feel hot though after I touch it.  I just had a check up the other day (12/28/05) but rubbing the back part of my neck was not part of the examination.  I did have some blood drawn to check my potasium and thyroid levels.  I really do not want to bother my doctor unnecessarily with this and was hoping that perhaps my blood work would signal if anything major was wrong... but she may only be testing the above levels and nothing more.  What are your thoughts?  Am I worrying over nothing?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.  Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a lymph node enalrgement, followed by ultrasonography and CT scan. PET scans have been reported in some studies to yield better results than CT scan but they are very expensive and not always available. Submandibular lymph node enlargement The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. Suboccipital lymph node enlargement The suboccipital lymph node is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. It drains the scalp and head. Common causes of enlargement include local infection. Posterior cervical lymph node enlargement The posterior cervical lymph nodes extend in a line posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscles but in front of the trapezius, from the level of the mastoid bone to the clavicle (on the side of the neck near the back). They drain the scalp and neck, skin of arms and pectorals, thorax, cervical and axillary nodes. Common causes of enlargement include tuberculosis, lymphoma, head and neck malignancy. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. In children, lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter (along with an abnormal chest radiograph and the absence of ear, nose and throat symptoms) were predictive of granulomatous diseases (ie, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease or sarcoidosis) or cancer (predominantly lymphomas) [4]. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Hve the area examined by your physician. The physician may evaluate the area and prescribe a course of antibiotics depending on whether he/she feels the enlargement is related to infection. The area may also be monitored for a period of 3-4 weeks because again, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations would be a significant finding and warrant additional measures. I hope this answers some of the questions to at least some of you who have posted in this particular area. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN   References: =========== 1. Libman H.

    "title": "Hard Knot in back of neck, possible problems?",
    "content": "I am a 22 year old male college student.  I lift weights roughly 3 times per week, eat as healthy as possible, and spend 40-60 hours with school, and about 20 hours a week at work.  My job is computer transcription.  About a month ago or so, I noticed a hard knot in the back of my neck.  The knot is about halfway between the base of my skull and shoulder which is about ear level.  The knot is about an inch to the right of my spine or around the upper trapezius or levator scapulae if I am reading the anatomy chart right.  The knot is roughly the size of a marble, maybe a little bigger.  It is pretty hard but not quite bone hard.  When I push on it, it moves around somewhat.  My first thought was that it was a myofascial trigger point since I spend so much time typing and studying.  I went and got a massage and meant to ask the masseuse (sp?) about it but by the time she got around to doing that area my time was up.  I couldn't get a sports massage for my first massage so I had to do half swedish half deep tissue.  Anyway it is sitll there.  I haven't went to the doctor yet because I really thought and possibly still think that it was stress related.  Plus the fact that I can't afford all the testing needed, and the people at the university clinic arent really the brightest.  My neck has been really stiff since Ive noticed this knot and I have to pop it alot to make it feel temporarily better at best.  I haven't been sick in I don't know how long.  I might have had a cold once in the past year.  I did have a case of vertigo that lasted 1-2 months about a year ago.  I had several tests ran but it was never diagnosed as what might be the problem.  This was part of the reason I thought it might be trigger points.  Anyway, I feel great except for the neck stiffness and pain.  I don't have any of the symptoms of lymphoma other than the knot.  My thoughts about this just consume me and I would like to figure out what this is or isn't or at least get closer.  Any help would be appreciated.  If any more information is needed, please feel free to let me know.\n\n",

Common causes of enlargement include local infection from the scalp or surrounding tissue.  You should observe it for a couple of weeks. If during that period it should get bigger or you develop any new symptoms then you should contact your doctor immediately.  There's probably nothing to worry about.  Best regards.\n\n",

I was just thinking the subocciptals were located a little higher up but I am no doctor.  I think my knot is apprxoimately 3 inches above the top of my shoulders.

So if it isn't the suboccipital it probably isn't a lymph node.  As such I would recommend you to have it checked, just in case.  Concerning DMSO, I would be best to leave it to our Pharmacy consultant, who also happens to be an expert on free radical scavengers, to answer that for you.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear mpm DMSO does have anti-inflammatory properties. However, the topical use of this drug for musculoskeletal conditions and some other collagen diseases is not approved by the FDA.  This is due to the fact that the drug comes in a variety of forms, and the purity of these products is not controlled. Therefore, contaminates can be transferred to the body with topical administration.  As for any possibility of drug-drug interaction, there is one documented interaction between this drug and sulindac which is a non steriodal anti-inflammatory drug, NSAID. Sulindac may decrease the pharmacological effects of DMSO. peripheral neuropathy has been documented with the use of both drugs.  Possible side effects with topical use include mainly  local dermatitis, itching , and burning.  In your case, there might be no harm of trying this agent, however, I would consult with the doctor first.  Thank you very much, and I hope you always feel better.\n\n",

    "title": "Lumps/Pain In Neck - Advice Sought Please!",
    "content": "Hi, For quite a while now ive been experiencing problems with the right hand side of my neck, and after a few visits to the doctors im beginning to think im a bit of a hyperchondriac, but still get worried. I have quite a few small lumps in the right hand side of my neck, the largest being about 1.5cm in length. They move around ever so slightly when pressed, but not much. In total I can feel about 4 different lumps. Whilst the lumps themselves are not overly painfull, my neck feels very stiff on this side, and have experienced a dull pain in this side of the neck and shoulder on quite a few occasions. I initially saw a practice nurse about 3 months ago, who said the lumps were lymph nodes, but did not tell me anything else about them. After another spell of having a painfull neck, i visited my own doctor, who sent me for an x ray. I explained to my doctor about the lumps in my neck, but it seems to me that by sending me for an x ray that he is ignoring them, and looking for something to do with my bones etc that is causing the pain, but im pretty sure this is not the case. Basically I just want to put my mind at rest once and for all. If these lumps are enlarged lymph nodes, how long do they stay for, as these have been here 4 or 5 months now. And should they be causing me pain? I have checked the rest of my body, and as far as I am aware, i do not have any other lumps that are noticeable.  Any help or advice is greatly appreciated. Also what should I do whenmy X Ray results come back and show that my neck bone is fine? do i then book another appointment, or just leave it, as i don't want to waste my doctors time?  Many thanks Chris\n\n",

    "content": "Hi cjb1981, My apologies for the delayed reply. Let me start first by saying that not one question posted on this forum is any more important than another and they are answered to the best of everyone's ability as we all \"volunteer\" our time to provide answers. With that being said I will try to proceed in answering your questions. Clinical features: abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Enlarged lymph nodes are sometimes monitored over a 3-4 week period and if no further enlargement is noted, no other symptoms are present, and labwork or other diagnostics have normal reports, enlargement may often be due to a bacterial/viral related infection. If the lymph nodes remain enlarged, are increasing in size etc., or other symptoms are present be sure to notify your physician for an evaluation.

I have been touching the first one and wishing it will go away, its tender and painless before, but then after I touched it so many times it started to hurt a little bit, and would hurt if I turn my neck too fast. Now the size got bigger, and it feels like its a bit hard on the top of it but small tender on the side, and it's start to bug me again.

I haven't been 'sick' to require antibotics.   The ENT said it was my masseter muscles because I apparently clinch my teeth at night or retain my tension in that area.  I don't believe that at all.   I can't find anything to confirm that diagnosis.  Now I wonder if I should go with my GPs suggestion of a CT Scan or try Endocrinologist first.  The swelling is not sore, doesn't hurt to touch, and has remained the same size since I noticed them 4 weeks ago.  I've under large amounts of stress and feel completely drained of all energy, and just don't feel well.  There is no cancer in my immediate family.  Suggestions?\n\n",

    "title": "Hard lump on the back of the neck. Should I be worried?",
    "content": "Hi Doctor,   In the past few weeks I've had some headaches. I felt some throbbing in the back of my neck and there I felt a hard lump just about .8 inches below my hairline and to the right side of the neck. When I'm feeling normal, it feels just fine and doesn't really hurt unless I push on it a little. The lump is immobile and fairly hard. I'm pretty sure I've actually had that thing for at least a year or two but I was only drawn to it recently because my doctor thinks I may have a possible sinus infection or vasomotor rhinitis and I started to wonder if that was a swollen lymph node as a result of my post nasal drip (clear phlegm) which has been going on for 7 months now with no other symptoms, though it has been fairly light and not really interfering with life. At least in the past few days which I have been watching it, I have not seen it grow or change in anyway. I'm worried it could be something serious like cancer.   I feel fairly healthy aside from this, except some days I tend to feel sleepy, tired and get headaches, but I'm quite certain this is from my sleep quality getting ruined by my congestion. Poor sleep quality is something which I have had a history of. Another thing which I think may be important is that my post nasal drip was triggered after getting a nasty flu months ago. To treat my nasal symptoms I have just begun to use nasonex which my doctor prescribed.   How worried should I be? Do you have any idea of what this might be?  -Very concerned patient Thanks a lot doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is possible that you have some form of rhinitis and post-nasal drip.But the lump you are describing, seems to be in the general location of the posterior triangle lymph nodes(level 5).  The lymphatic vessels of the nasopharynx drain in two directions, lateral and medial. The lateral drainage pathways pierce the superior constrictor muscle and drain into the lateral retropharyngeal, high Level II and high Level V lymph nodes of the neck(often bilaterally).   The lymphatic vessels of the roof and posterior wall of the nasopharynx drain medially by penetrating the visceral fascia close to the skull base and drain into the median retropharyngeal lymph nodes  The anterior part of nasal cavity drains into submental and submandibular lymph nodes and the posterior part into the retropharyngeal nodes. All of these nodes finally drain into the upper deep cervical lymph nodes.  If the swelling in question is indeed a low posterior triangle lymph node(low level 5),it is unlikely to be as a result of a nasal or nasopharyngeal pathology.  If it feels hard, you must have it examined by your doctor who will be in a better position to determine if it needs to be investigated further(FNAC-fine neede aspiration cytology). Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Any help would be so great! I am feeling alone with this and I am nervous of something more severe. I am a 34 year old male with asthma. I recently was laid off and do not have medical coverage, so extensive test are not really an option. Over the last 4 or 5 weeks I have had and sore and semi hard bump on the left side of my neck kinda even with the bottom of my ear lobe about 1 to 2 inches horizontal from my lobe. People told me to try asprin which I finally did, and its helps a bit. I think my probing at the spot makes it worse. It does not seem to be getting larger in size but does feel like a knot or stiff neck. Like a pressure that is always there. It is bigger then the other (normal) right side and I can feel it when I turn my neck to the side, or down. The funny thing since I have been on asprin I seem to have more pain in my left sholder and down into the middle of my sturnum. Right below like my adams apple is. I think this possibly from the muscle relaxers aka (asprin). And my muscles are recovering from whatever. I can live with muscle aches, but this bump is scary. Does any one out there have any idea? I am going to force myself to go see my PCP soon because the icy hot and heat is no longer working. It does get better when I sleep, but when I get up it starts all over again. Thanks in advance to anyone willing to help!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi engine437, Your description almost pin points the location of the occipital group of lymph nodes. Occipital nodes mainly drain the skin of the posterior scalp and neck. Some other conditions involving the scalp, pinna and external auditory canal that may cause acute lymphadenitis involving the occipital nodes are.. - Pediculosis capitis (head lice infestation), - bacterial infections (folliculitis, furuncles), - tinea capitis (scalp ringworm),   - seborrheic dermatitis (dandruff),  - insect bites, and - viral infections rubella.  Management: - if a clear cut diagnosis is available, the condition should be treated as appropriate. - In cases where the diagnosis of acute lymphadenitis is uncertain, a common practice is to first administer a course of antibiotics and to see the response. In cases that do not respond satisfactorily, an fine needle aspiration cytology (FNAC)  or a lymph node biopsy may be advised.  You need to consult your family physician who will be ablw to examine you and guide you better. Best wishes!,\n\n",

I have a lymph node under my arm that is rather large, one on the back of my neck that is large, and a few lumps in my breast.  The one under my arm as well as the others have been there for years, too many to remember.  Last summer I had a biospy in the breast that came back ok, but was told probably best to get them out one day not pressing.  I have the one in my neck with a recent ultrasound is said to probably come out as well but not pressing either. With all that said, the one under my arm is large, where my husband told me Go to the DR! Went saw the PA, sent for CT with contrast of the chest, called them for results, told me had to get the one under my arm out ,11 cm in size, Really, other possible to come out, could go either way.  (Nurse not Dr told me this), making an appt with surgeon ASAP.  Have some other things that are bothering my, tired, tired, tired, bones tend to ache, no energy, legs itch from knee to ankle sometimes so bad that I scratch them raw (not all the time itiching but a good bit) thinking that is just stress of life.  My question is what do you think could be going on with me?  With that said, in January 09 I was told I was diabetic, A1C was 2 (really) sugar was off and I have lost about 35 pounds (good) in the matter of about 3 months without trying..eating alot of sweets but keep losing..I am still not convinced I am diabetic, but take medication and eat all the time to keep weight from going further.  Sometimes I am made to feel that it is all me in my head...you are just wasting time going to the Dr.. your just a Diabetic!! Could please possibly lead my in the right direction?\n\n",

You have not mentioned about the results of any lab tests that were done (other than for diabetes mellitus).  As the breast lesion has been sorted out, the lymph nodes need urgent evaluation.As soon as possible, an FNAC of the large (11cms) axillary lymph node or an excision biopsy of the cervical lymph node is indicated.This will perhaps would be the right step for you to take without further delay.

    "title": "Re: Posterior Cervical and Supraclavicular nodes enlarged",
    "content": "Hi, Obviously you have enlargement of the level 5 cervical lymph nodes(posterior triangle lymph nodes).  Within the posterior triangle,  Spinal accessory nodes are situated along the spinal accessory nerve and receive drainage from the occipital nodes (which drain the skin of the posterior scalp and neck) and the nasopharyngeal nodes and retropharyngeal / parapharyngeal nodes(which drain the nasopharynx & oropharynx).  Supraclavicular nodes drain into the thoracic duct on the left and the right lymphatic duct on the right. Nodal disease presenting in these areas is more often associated with an infra-clavicular and, sometimes, sub-diaphragmatic primary tumors.  The cervical nodes in your case have persisted since 2009. This certainly needs to be investigated fully (including FNA or an open lymph node biopsy) and expeditiously. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "12 Swollen Aux. Lymph Nodes and Hard Lump in Left Breast",
    "content": "Thank you for taking the time to read my question!  I have tried looking everywhere for someone having the same symptoms as I do but I haven't been able to find it anywhere.  For the past year and a half, I have had recurring lymph nodes swelling in my underarms, recently it's been 7 in my left armpit and 5 in the other. On top of that, I have this lump in my left breast that has just stayed there for the past 9/10 months. The lymph nodes are very painful but the lump in my breast doesn't hurt at all; it's just hard. Radiology screened the lump and said it was very large but I shouldn't worry and they also found a smaller lump that I couldn't even feel myself. But they never gave me a definitive answer.  I have been tested numerous times for both things and they just keep sending me back for more tests. In the beginning, they were testing for cancer and mono which is why I've come to this forum. However, I tested negative for mono and they said no to cancer. My  white blood cell count was a little low  and blood levels were out of whack but nothing crazily so they just kept switching lots of antibiotics around until they found one that worked (coxicillin - sp?) and it took the swelling of the lymph nodes away initially but they keep coming back on and off. Just to top all of that off, I have headaches every single day. I do not have migraines and eyesight is tested and taken care of. That could be completely separate altogether, but it is something occurring every day.  So my questions would be: Why do my aux. lymph nodes keep popping up? Why won't the lump in my breast go away? What should I ask from the doctors?  Just to note: I live abroad and so I don't speak the language fluently. Nothing personal against doctors here, but they do not have all current medical equipment and sometimes getting answers is a bit hard for me. They speak English but it is not their first language.  Thank you again for your time. I hope I've included all of the important information.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is clear that you have 'lumps' in your left breast and bilateral axillary lymphadenopathy. Any breast lump is evaluated by what is known as 'triple assessment' - - physical examination of the breast, - imaging  (ultrasonograpy/mammography) & - a biopsy of the lump (FNA / core-needle biopsy). Precise information on the components of the triple assessment is not available in your account.  As far as the axillary lymph nodes are concerned,they may be evaluated by - physical examination and - by ultrasonography. Guided FNAC(fine needle aspiration cytology) may be done.  Obviously, you need a full work up and you need to take steps in this direction. good luck!\n\n",

He has regained muscle and strength, but gives out when trying to lift or even do small chores. Before chemo, he was healthy and could work all day; even during chemotherapy.

He has hardly ever taken medications, and is normally very healthy; but he now has constant muscle pain throughout, especially the back and legs. His neck now looks like a person taking steroids but has no lumps.

    "content": "Hi ropergal, Your description of your husband's illness seems to suggest a  Paraneoplastic syndrome.   Paraneoplastic syndromes are uncommon.Paraneoplastic syndromes may be defined as remote effects of a cancer unrelated to metastasis(non-metastatic systemic effects). Some of them are believed to be as a result of an auto-immune reaction(production of auto-antibodies).Others may be due to production of certain physiologically active molecules by the tumors(hormones,pro-hormones,other peptides,enzymes etc).   A number of Paraneoplastic syndromes have been described in relation to lympho-reticular malignancies.They may present before, during or following the treatment of a malignancy.  Paraneoplastic disorders may involve any part of the nervous system(central or peripheral - of which, peripheral neuropathies are among the most common.  Some of the paraneoplastic syndromes that need a mention are... - Paraneoplastic Subacute Sensory Neuronopathy/paraneoplastic  encephalomyelitis (PEM),   - Paraneoplastic Neuromyotonia, - Paraneoplastic Demyelinating Neuropathies, - Paraneoplastic Motor Neuron Disease, - Paraneoplastic Vasculitic Neuropathy & - Paraneoplastic Autonomic Insufficiency.  Your husband needs to be investigated to exclude the possibility of his complaints being due to one of these paraneoplastic syndromes(thorough neurologic exam, testing for 'Antineuronal Antibodies' etc). Your oncologist will be in a better position to guide you in this regard. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female, no history of disease, my grandfather had leukemia but other than that no other family history of any disease.  The only medication I am currently on is Implanon for birth control.  I do smoke, hardly ever drink and don't do drugs. I am very thin, about 105-107 lbs & 5'4, I have been able to feel (and see the little bumps) lymph nodes in my groin area for about 6-8 yrs.  They do not hurt, are rubbery and moveable and have not grown.  I have been pointing them out to my Dr's for years.  They all said I can only feel them because I am so thin.  Last year a new Dr sent me to a surgeon who also said he wasn't concerned, they are within normal limits.  However, he did find a thumb sized lymph node in my armpit which he removed last year.  The tests came back normal and he said the node was basically \"doing what it's supposed to do\".  I have of course become extremely anxious about having lymphoma.  I do occasionally have night sweats (over the last few months), but I do wear a lot of clothing to bed but I always have and this never happened before.  Do you think I should push the issue with my doctor or do you think if there was something to be concerned about the lymph nodes would be enlarging/hardening/attaching or the one that was removed would've indicated something?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is common to have lymph node enlargement following infection or inflammation in the area drained by this lymph node group, they regress in size but never to normal size following recovery from infection or inflammation.   When suspicious, a biopsy is the best way to examine its nature and to exclude malignancy. Since it has been proven to be benign (reactionary to infections or inflammation), you can be reassured.  Warning signs include increase in their number, size or when they become matted or fixed to the skin or to the underlying structures.   The presence of weight loss, night sweat and low grade fever, the so called B symptoms commonly seen in malignancies especially hematological ones are not specific or diagnostic.  Symptoms like night sweats although occur in malignancy like lymphoma, it is non specific and can occur with common infections, fatigue, stress or endocrine abnormalities.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with any symptoms, at least to be reassured.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: lymph nodes becoming hard and matted lymph node",
    "content": "Hi, From your description, it is probable that you have what is known as generalized lymphadenopathy (The definition of this at times varies between authors and between specialities).  There is an exhaustive list of causes for this condition, and one of them of-course is lymphomas. You say that \"they have been there for years\".Therefore one needs to think of causes of chronic generalized lymphadenopathy (there is an acute form as well).  You have not mentioned the approximate size of the lymph nodes.  Nodes that are suspicious of malignancy are generally larger(ie. > 1.5 cms.  Nodes <0.5 cm are usually considered benign), firm,rubbery or hard in consistency.Fixity is also makes them suspicious.Matting is usually seen in tubercular lymphadenitis, but also may be seen in lymphomas(peri-adenitis) and other malignancies.  There is an exhaustive list of causes for generalized lymphadenopathy(such as bacterial or systemic viral infections,malignancies,auto-immune disorders,storage diseases etc).In recent times, HIV is emerging as an important cause.  When a lymph node biopsy is planned, it involves certain considerations such as.... - Site (inguinal lymph nodes are usually avoided) - clinically suspicious node is chosen and - easy accessibility.  At times, the most suspicious node may not be easily accessible and trying to excise it would tantamount to a major surgical procedure (in which case, the next best, more easily accessible node may be chosen). For example,in the neck, posterior triangle lymph nodes are technically easier to biopsy  compared to the Jugulo-digastric lymph nodes.  Wonder why a person like you, who is as concerned and as well- informed about lymph nodes did not discuss your concerns with your surgeon prior to the biopsy.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply Dr.M.Aroon kamath it helps me a lot.  As for the size of the lymph nodes in my neck, the one the was taken out was from the posterior triangle at the side of my neck and was soft, movible and was between 0.5 and 1cm this is why it didnt really concern me, as for the other nodes in my neck i have a much larger one which is located in the Jugulo-digastric under the right side of my jaw line that is about 2cm possibly larger in size and does seem to be matted to another node which is much more suspicious, the texture of this node is hard and slightly movible and gives me great concern.  Recently i have had 2 more lymph nodes popping up in the Supraclavicular area which wasnt there before and are between 0.5 and 1cm at the most and are round and rubbery in texture and believe that they can be more of a concern.  Apart from the lymphadenopathy issue that i have been having i am also losing a lot of muscle mass/tone that is most visable in the face, legs and arms and was wondering if this could be linked to my lymph nodes? My muscles in my legs fatigue even after walking which enables mweto do any activities, i was wondering if muscle atrophy could play a key role in my legs to be so tired all the time?  i was hoping for some good advice to see what my next step might be for example another biopsy on a suspected lymph node? any information back from you  Dr.M.Aroon kamath would be much appreciated and helpful.  Sorry before i go i had a C.T scan on my abdoman and that came back all clear thought this may help for further investigations.   Thank for listening Dr.M.Aroon kamath and hope to hear some feedback soon.  Kind regards\n\n",

With head in normal positon I don't really notice it that well .  but if i tilt my head as though I'm looking up and push in (right in the middle . back of neck between back of head and back.  but slightly closer to head) I feel a knobby knot.  almost feels like cartiledge.  I have looked at all sorts of anatomy pictures exray picutes etc showing the neck and cant seem to see anyting like what I feel.  Again it almost feels like cartiledge or bony (its that hard)  Tried to ask a coupe friends to check thier necks too.  they say no nothing like that there.  I'm just really curious what it MIGHT be.   Feels as though I can push towards the inside of hte neck and it moves in that direction perhap a little  side to side as well (but not up and down) Would appreciate anyone that can help me identify what this is. Thanks for anything you can tell me.\n\n",

It feels like its in the middle of my side of my neck. Well ever since then i have been messing with it. It moves also. I haven't been sick or anything like that. So i was wondering if i did something at work. I was feeling tired more but i think that's because i had poor sleeping habits. I would go to bed around 10 or so and wake up at either 4:30 or 5:00 am. and go to work. You can't feel it if your neck is straight but if i lean my head to the right and actually feel for it you can. I haven't been to the dr. yet so i was just wondering what else could it be??\n\n",

All of my tension headaches seem to start from this point (at the base of the skull, about 1-1/2\" to the left of the spine). Sometimes I can press on it like a pressure point and relieve some of the pain. I also have problems with sleeping and fatigue. I have asked doctors about it before, but they don't seem to think there's anything wrong.  Also, not sure if this is related, but since this is the lymphoma category, I figured I'd add it. Sometimes my abdomen feels hard & somewhat tender (area about the size of a ping pong ball) just under the ribcage to the right of my sternum. I've had my gallbladder and liver checked, and all tests came back normal. Are there lymph nodes in this area that could be swollen?  I have a long history of cancer in my family, and all of it very different. Ovarian cancer, Hodgkin's, Brain tumor, Wilm's tumor. I may be a bit paranoid about all this, but I figure I've got reason to be.\n\n",

My Dr. prescribes meds for pain and inflamation which helps, but no diagnosis and I am the only one who seems to be able to feel this knot. I can't afford expensive test either, but did get xrays of my spine and everything looked fine except for some spasms in the middle of my shoulder blades. HoweverI wasn't haveing symptoms at the time. This seems to happen when my body is stressed or fatigued. I go through spells maybe three/four times a year.  Anyone get any answers or diagnoses yet? Please help or post to my comment.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have the same thing and I've had it for probably about 4-5 years or so now(at least that's when I first noticed it). It is a small hard bump at the back of my neck under the skin, not noticable just by looking and I can't feel it if my neck is perfectly straight. It is right around the hairline, right under where the head would be considered to start right about the middle of the back of the neck, but slightly to the right. I think it still moves a little bit but not too much and it is definitely hard. It causes me quite a bit of discomfort and a lot of shooting pains and twinges in my neck and into my head. My neck is also very sore all the time. Anyone know what this could be?\n\n",

It is in what i've always referred to as the litre (not sure on sp.) that runs up the back of your neck on either side.  It is about the size of a half dollar and I have had family member check to see if there was any sign of it being a bite of some sort and they said that there isn't.  It is very tender in what appears to be the center, and less so moving outward.  I only found it today, but have not felt well for a couple of day's and have been exceptionally tired.  I'm not sure if there is any connection here or not.  I also feel slightly light headed.  I am obviously concerned about this.  Any information that you may provide as to what this could possibly be would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

A cyst developed and broke on the back of my head about an inch away from where the rim of my glasses come behind my ear.

It is about the size of a dime and stationary. Along with some tenderness, when I press lightly down on it, sharp subte pains shoot up my head, down the top part of my neck and slight burning sensation is felt.

About 4-5 years ago I noticed a bump on the back side of my neck near where the head meets the neck.  It is about where my hairline is and is on the right side, but not on the side of my head, clearly on the back.  Over time it has gotten bigger, but I haven't ever been worried about it.  However, recently probably within the last 2-3 months I have been getting sharp pains on the right side of my neck. When I get the sharp pains it is usually caused from looking to the left and I have to look back straight to stop the pain.  I don't take any medications, the only medical history I really know of is heart problems and one of my grandparents had lung cancer, also, my mother has celiacs disease I believe it is? Can't eat wheat.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mattrat3000,  There are a few possibilities for what this lump may be.  It may be a lymph node that has become swollen due to it fighting off an infection.  It may also be a lipoma (a small, non-cancerous fat cell tumor).  Lipomas are generally harmless and incidental but occasionally they may need to be removed because they become irritated due to their location, etc.  They often have a rubbery feeling.  Since this lump is now painful it is actually less likely to be cancer.  However, because it is painful I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated.  There may be an infection that is going on, which may need antibiotics to clear up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It started out about the size of a pea and is hard and a little tender to the touch. Around the area kinda feels like I have a rug burn.  I also noticed when I was rubbing the bump that about half an inch from that another bump had formed, pea sized, it has remained the same size and is slightly tender.  Once again I woke up this morning to find another bump right behind my left ear.  I also have a red bump that kinda looks like a rash on the left side of my head above my left ear, no pain but it does itch a little bit.  I also have a red rashy spot on my left collar bone below my neck line that is about the size of a quarter.  Any idea's what these are and what I should do, or if there is anything I can do to make them go down?  I'm getting pretty concerned because I keep getting a new one each day and I don't have insurance and not a whole lot of money to go to the clinic.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thank you\n\n",

This Lymph node has been swollen for about 6 months, and it is currently about the width of my pinky finger.  It hasn't seem to have grown any size; however, it is more palpable in the mornings when I first wake up.   In mid December, I was diagnosed with tonsillitis, and this is when I noticed my swollen Lymph node. My doctor gave me a 10 day course of penicillin. I completed it, and it cured my infection. My Lymph node did shrink after I finished my Antibiotic, but it never did completely return back to normal size where I couldn't feel it.  It is very mobile, small, and painless. I do touch it  often because I am concerned about it. Should I be concerned over this? Should the Lymph node ever return back to normal and within what normal time frame? I do not have any other symptoms like fever or weightloss.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old female who has seen every doctor in my area. I am HIV negative (I had 6 tests this year alone) but have been suffering from signs of immune suppression and no one can tell me why. I have had, and still do have, other chronic health problems. All of my labs are normal besides my RDW. (I was anemic for 8 or more years, when it spontaneously cleared up last month, despite bruising MUCH more than I did. My RDW is still high at 16.7 and is the lowest it has been ever.) I have had abdominal pain for 2 years (upper right and epigastric) and have had 2 negative endoscopies, 1 negative colonoscopy, negative Hep ABC screen (was tested because I had jaundice and brown urine). Liver and pancreatic function panels are normal, and I was negative for porphyria. For a year and a half I have been suffering from general malabsorption (passing sometimes completely undigested food of all kinds) and was put on Creon for it, but it did not help, and about a year ago I started getting diarrhea almost always, sometimes bloody (like I said, no signs of inflammation on biopsy). I experience night sweats on and off, I had them every night for 6 months straight, just drenching, and every few weeks run a low grade fever (between 99.1 and 100.5, I am normally around 97.8). I occasionally get swollen glands in my groin area, and those hurt. I also have 2 glands that the doctors always miss, they're right behind my jaw, under my ear. One of them swelled to over and inch about a year and a half ago, and I never saw anyone about it. Since then, it swells daily, is hard, doesn't hurt (although its under a tendon in my neck, and when it swells, then tendon gets hard and THAT hurts), and now it feels like a there's a smaller one stuck to it. I also developed unstable blood pressure, both too high at times, and too low. It may be irrelevant, but I don't know what is anymore. I have arthritis, but I have had that since I was 14 or 15, but I also get pain in my right leg, my thigh bone. It usually aches, but sometimes is excruciating to the point of collapsing my leg from under me. I know it doesn't seem to make sense, but could it be lymphoma? I've spent the past 2 and a half years sick and last year researching, and I need to know if this could be a strange presentation of lymphoma or if it is something else.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) refers to a group of disorders which are charecterized by persistent and recurrent  infections of nails, skin, and mucous membranes by Candida albicans and occasionally other candida species.CMC are a  group of heterogenous disorders where there seems to be a 'selective' inability to clear infection with the yeast Candida, resulting in persistent debilitating symptoms.  CMC could be - familial (inherited)or - non-familial (non-inherited).  The familial form could be - autosomal dominant or - autosomal recessive.  CMC can be - associated with endocrinopathies/inflammatory disorders or - not associated with endocrinopathies/inflammatory disorders.  CMC can be - early onset (usual) or - late onset.   The association of CMC with squamous cell carcinoma of the oral cavity or oesophagus has been reported in patients with 'autoimmune polyendocrinopathy-candidiasis-ectodermal dystrophy' (APECED) syndrome.  There are reports of patients with late onset chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis who developed lymphocytic lymphoma.  I am in no way implying that you have CMC. As you are immunocompetent & your symptomatology is very complex & several aspects need to be connected up, it may be worth  starting the process by first excluding late-onset CMC.You may need (among other things) a fine needle aspiration cytology from the cervical lymph node.

    "content": "Hello doctor,  i realize that posts with similar questions are on this forum, but i cannot seem to find a satisfactory answer pertinent to my particular problem.  this is the reason i am posting again.  i apologize for causing you inconvenience if this sort of question has been asked too many times.  i am a 20 year old male, in good condition.  i am not taking any medications, have not had any surgeries before, and do not have any illnesses or conditions.  i recently discovered a hard, immovable lump on the back of my neck.  it is just about an inch or so to the right of the very middle of the back of the neck and is perhaps 0.5 to 1 inch above my hairline.    the size is small, and it feels somewhat smaller than a pea.  to give you a better idea, if i am sitting with my neck up, and if i pass my hand over the region, i feel nothing.  even if i move my neck in all directions, and just pass my fingers over the region, nothing can be felt.  but if i tilt my neck to the bottom and press hard, it can be felt.  if i tilt to the bottom and to the left, it can definitely be felt even more.    it's not causing any kind of discomfort so far.  but if it is pressed hard on and off for a 10-15 seconds, there is a level of pain sensation, though nothing excruciating.  it does, however, seem to be embedded deep within.  i discovered this by accident, and thought it was a pimple at first.  i haven't had an all-out flu in the last 2-3 months, however, i did get 5 vaccinations recently since i will be leaving the country soon.  i consulted with a family member who is a physician, but he said that it was nothing and that it's fairly common.  he explained that it's a chronic hardening of the lymph node and nothing to worry about.  but i need a second opinion.  i have been reading that if a lump is hard and immovable, it's commonly malignant cancer  (there is no cancer in my family yet).  perhaps you can understand why i'm extremely worried and anxious.  please let me know as soon as possible as i'm feeling very scared.  thank you so much.  god bless.\n\n",

    "content": "While it is true that cancerous nodes tend to be hard and immobile as well as painless, there are other reasons for lymph nodes to be hard.  I suspect your family  member is correct.  The description you are giving is very consistent with a reactive lymph node that may have had some scarring.  It may also simply be a lymph node that did not shrink back down to unfeelable size after it was enlarged during infection.  This is quite common and termed shotty lymph nodes.    If the node is not getting larger there is really little to worry about.  If you notice that the node does seem to be getting larger it is a good idea to have it checked out.  Also, the area you describe would be a little unusual for a cancer to first present (though not impossible).  Best wishes.  By the way, we never mind having people post similar questions.  Our goal is to provide helpful information to any who need it.\n\n",

    "content": "dear dr. lowe,  thank you so much for the quick response.  it is greatly appreciated.  i have a few more follow up questions that i hope you don't mind addressing.  1) what kinds of infections can cause such a hard, immovable cyst like this?  i am reading a lot about enlarged lumps but everyone mentions that if that is due to an infection, they tend to be rubbery and even movable.    i did have the flu perhaps twice during november and december, and i had a very minor attack of flu perhaps a month ago, but it was far from serious.  again, however, i did get 5 vaccinations just last week (typhoid, yellow fever, hep A, polio booster, meningitis), and i'm wondering if there could be any link.  2)  how likely is it for hard, immovable lumps that are stuck to a surface NOT to be cancers?  i understand that you mentioned location and continuous growth of the lump.  however, i just discovered this.  how long i should wait to see if it does grow or expand?    3)  are there any other indications, apart from increasing size, that i should be looking out for in case this may be a malignant cancer or lymphoma?  you mentioned that cancer wouldn't appear at the neck for the first time, but perhaps this is a sign of another cancer that has gone undetected?  4)  can you please further explain the scarring phenomenon you mentioned?  i understand i must sound like a crazy hypochondriac asking you all these questions, but your time and empathy are greatly appreciated.    god bless.\n\n",

    "content": "I'll try to respond to both posts with these answers.  If I really don't answer your questions please feel free to post a follow up.  Scarring of lymph nodes can occur when the lymph node itself gets infected.  Typically with infections the lymph nodes swell not because they themselves are infected, but because they are processing the infection information and presenting it to the immune system.  In essence, the lymph node is the command center giving the order to the immune cell soldier to go out and find the infection that looks like this.    When the lymph node itself becomes infected, inflammation sets in.  This results in parts of the lymph node being damaged.  Then scar tissue sets in to help heal the lymph node.  Typically, as a cancer invades a lymph node and begins to expand there the cancer cells clump together into a solid ball.  As the mass grows, the lymph node expands.  This gives the characteristic hard feeling rather than the rubbery feeling of normal reactive lymph nodes.  Often along with expanding in the lymph node, the cancer invades into the surrounding tissue.  This causes the lymph node to become fixed to the surrounding tissue rather than be movable as a typical lymph node is.  It can be quite difficult to distinguish between a scarred lymph node and a malignant (cancerous) lymph node.  In these cases, generally time will tell.  Cancerous nodes tend to get bigger while a scarred lymph node does not.  If there are other symptoms suggestive of a possible cancer, generally physicians will choose to biopsy the node rather than wait.  Biopsies will also be done if the node seems a little more suspicious than a typical scarred lymph node.  The best thing to do any time you are concerned about a lymph node that seems to be changing or one that meets the descriptions of a cancerous lymph node is to have it checked out.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "You are correct.  I do still believe that it is unlikely for the lymph node to be cancerous.  This is based on several factors.  While the characteristics that I\u2019ve mentioned previously are accurate there also considerations regarding location, age, and how long the node has been present.  Both of you are young.  In general your odds of cancer are low.  In addition, the areas that you are describing are not the typical areas for cancers to spread.  The common areas for cancers to spread are above the clavicles, to the neck, and to the arm pit.  Depending on the cancer type it may spread to other locations; however, these are the most easily felt areas.   SJ, if you are returning to the country soon it is unlikely that you need to be evaluated prior to your trip.  I hope this helps some.  Sorry for the confusion previously.  If you have any other questions or I have not answered your original question, please feel free to post again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have the same thing and I've had it for probably about 5 years or so now(at least that's when I first noticed it). It is a small hard bump at the back of my neck under the skin, not noticable just by looking and I can't feel it if my neck is perfectly straight. It is right around the hairline, right under where the head would be considered to start right about the middle of the back of the neck, but slightly to the right. I think it still moves a little bit but not too much and it is definitely hard. But mine DOES cause me quite a bit of discomfort and some shooting pains and twinges in my neck and into my head. Do you think this is the same thing, Doctor,(scarred lymph node)? It has never gotten any bigger I don't think since I first discovered it like 5 years ago. I had mono when I was a kid(was hospitalized for three days because they didn't know what it was at first) and I have had issues with my glands swelling up(they are actually swelling up off and on right now too and have been for the past week or two and causing some discomfort under chin, around groin, shoulders, ears and even under my arms a little) and I have caught A LOT of colds while growing up. Is this maybe the same thing as the others or is mine probably something else considering it has always caused me some discomfort and pain and I've had the bump for a long time? A couple things to note: I have always been prone to headaches and used to wear glasses for reading, writing, etc. and stopped wearing them years ago, now I notice a lot of eye strain(dunno if that would have anything to do with it though). Over the last few years I have been stressing over many things, and also I have never had the greatest posture when sitting at a computer desk or anywhere really. Would any of this pertain to the discomfort and pain coming from the area around that bump? A response would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!!\n\n",

About 6-7 months ago I found a movable lump that rests underneath my left clavicle, and it's very easy to move.   Early this September I found a hard, immobile lump right in the center of my neck, like it's embedded in my neck/thyroid. My mother had a thyroid nodule, and has a history thyroid problems.  I also have gynecomastia and many small lipomas in my chest and arms.   I live a very active lifestyle. I don't seem to have any other symptoms of cancer, like fatigue or night sweats.

    "content": "Hi, The lump that you felt below the clavicle could well be another lipoma(like the other ones you have already).But, the fact that you are not mentioning this as yet another lipoma indicates that you feel something odd about this lump.  'Infra-clavicular' lymph nodes are situated below the clavicle in the delto-pectoral groove in the course of the cephalic vein.They are not usually palpable.Enlargement of these nodes is rather unusual and is always viewed with suspicion('significant' lymphadenopathy).  These nodes may be enlarged in some cases of breast cancer as well as lymphomas(more frequently in non-hodgkin's lymphoma). Non-hodgkin's lymphoma can involve the thyroid gland as well.  I suggest that you should consult your doctor who would first determine if the lump is a lipoma or a lymph node.If it is indeed a lymph node, in all liklihood, your doctor would recommed an FNAC(fine needle aspiration cytology) of that lymph node. Best wishes!\n\n",

The oncologist said there is a possibility that it may be lymphoma although it usually is not present in my age group. I am only 33. I am concerned because when I called an internal medicine doctor to schedule an appointment I was explaining my symptoms and the receptionist slipped and said so you may have cancer.

Normally the % of Lymphocytes  is  between 20% and 45% of the WBC  (Ref. Range).  Lymphocyte Count (Absolute)..... Ref. Range 1000 - 3500 Lymphocyte Count (Absolute)   >4,000/mm3 may be considered as high.   The absolute lymphocyte count is calculated by multiplying the lymphocyte percentage by the total white blood cell count.   Absolute counts are used to determine if the percentages reflect real changes in the numbers of the paricular cells. For example, a normal % of lymphocytes in an adult is roughly between 20 and 45 %. That would mean an absolute count of between 800 - 5,000. So, a differential report with a granulocyte count of 90% and a lymphocyte count of 2% might suggest that   a) the granulocytes are elevated OR  b) the lymphocytes are decreased.   Absolute counts would sort out this dilemma. For example,if the white count were high - say 50,000, the absolute lymphocyte count  would be 1,000 or within acceptable limits, therefore the problem is to do with the granulocytes.   To site another example: same differential but a white cell count of 3,000. In this case, the granulocytes are within acceptable limits but the lymphocytes are low.  High absolute lymphocyte counts are seen in many conditions (viral,bacterial,protozoal infections as well as lymphomas and leukemias). Therefore,your counts have to be only interpreted in the context of the total WBC count. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 42year old female, about 3 weeks ago i noticed a soft swelling on the left side of my neck just above the collar bone, it didn't hurt so i left it until last week when i went to see my doctor.  When i mentioned it to him he examined me and said that he could also feel that the left side had a small harder swelling as well. He told me that it was my lymph nodes and could mean a number of things, apart from this i am otherwise fit & healthy.  He sent to me get a chest xray and has also booked me in for an ultrsound scan of my neck this week. He didn't really tell me alot but on surfing the internet i have convinced myself that i may have cancer. Could you please advise me on what this could possibly mean, as i just about at my wits end with worry.  I have got to leave it for a week to 10days before i see my doctor again for the results of the xray & scan.  Please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Any supra-clavicular lymph node enlargement should be viewed with concern. But, clinically,one has to be certain that it is indeed a lymph node - because at times, the inferior belly of omohyoid muscle is mistaken for a lymph node.If in doubt, an ultrasonogram would be able to sort that out.  If it is indeed a left supra-clavicular lymph node,and if it happens to be hard, then tests will be needed to exclude a variety of malignancies.  It is better to wait for the results of the tests before arriving at conclusions. Best wishes!\n\n",

To make it simple,the most common causes of lymphadenitis are bacterial infections caused by streptococci and staphylococci.    Other infections that may be involved include , cat scratch disease, lymphogranuloma venerum, tularemia,chancroid, tubercuosis etc.  There are other causes as well...such as parasitic diseases(filariasis), viral diseases [Herpes simplex virus (HSV), HIV], granulomatous diseases(sarcoidosis) as well as malignancies(including lymphomas).  Upper respiratory tract infections may also be associated with cervical lymphadenitis as well as any infections in the oral cavity.  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: hardened lymphatic vessel in the arm",
    "content": "Hi, It could well be a thickened and palpable lymphatic vessel. I do not know which part of the world you are residing.   In areas where filariasis is endemic, recurrent, acute filarial lymphadenitis and associated lymphangitis (acute filarial fever) at times leads to persisting thickened and palpable lymphatic vessels(sub cutaneous).  During episodes of acute lymphangitis,the larger lymphatic trunks dilate and become visible as reddish streaks.This is because, they usually have a vessel running on their surface which becomes dilated and visible under the skin.Once the acute phase subsides, these vessels may no longer be seen but the lymph trunk may persist(if recurrent acute episodes occur).  I can't guess the cause of lymphangitis in your case but, as yours seems to be of recent onset and perhaps the first episode(whatever the cause), it should hopefully clear in the near future.

    "title": "Re: Is a Basophil of 4% too high?",
    "content": "Hi, The differential basophil counts have poor diagnostic value. An absolute basophil count should always be obtained whenever the differential count shows higher basophil percentages.   The absolute basophil counts also have certain inherent difficulties which may make the counts unreliable and inaccurate. These difficulties are primarily on account of the sparsity of the cell population and to the instability of these cells. Inaccurate basophil counts are often a result of deterioration of the cells on standing (where a significant time interval occurs between drawing the blood sample and subsequent sample preparation and actual counting).  Thus, the \u201cnormal\u201d laboratory reference ranges vary profusely.  Some of the sample absolute basophil counts from different laboratories are as follows:  - 0-0.19K/ul, - 0 to 0.3 k/ul, - 0.4 to 0.2K/ul etc.    Generally, an absolute count of over 50/ul is a subtle sign of allergic sensitization, whereas a count below 20 regularly accompanies allergic reactions.  Basophilia may also be found in association with  - myxedema, - myeloproliferative disorders, - hyperlipidaemia, - ulcerative colitis,  - polycythemia vera, and  - chronic myeloid leukemia.  Basophils in the blood and mast cells in tissues are similar in many ways.They both contain granules which stain metachromially with toluidine blue and contain histamine and heparin. It is also thought that basophils on entering tissues, may get converted to mast cells. Increased mast cell numbers in the stroma of certain cancers is believed to be a good prognostic sign. This has been reported in cancers of the uterine cervix.  Therefore, at least there has been some evidence that basophils may be beneficial in certain cancers. I am not certain if the beneficial effect also applies to T-cell lymphoblastic lymphomas. Best wishes!\n\n",

There are treatments to reduce this but the doctor is correct in exploring the infectious concern first.

    "content": "Hi. I am a 31 year old female that started itching all over in March of 2006. I saw my doctor and had a cbc, metabolic panel, thyroid test, liver test, and an sed rate. All test were normal. I saw and allergist who could find nothing also.  I was prescribed Zyrtec and told it was possible stress. Their was no rash. Only itching all over body and scalp.  This went away in May and I was surprised when it returned 6 months later in Nov.  I have had more blood work. Even had stool tests and urine test. I was also given a chest  X-ray because i was having shortness of breath.  The itching feels like it is under the skin. I now have 2 small swollen glands in my neck. I saw my doctor and he said one was coming from the cysts i occasionally get on my ears. The other was from my sinus drainage and slightly sore throat. I am very concerned that this itching is something more serious.. I also have night sweats occasionally. I do take Luvox, 100mg nightly. I have been taking this for about 9 years. He says it is possible that the night sweats are from Luvox. My questions are: Is this itching possibly caused from Lymphoma?  What about the occasional night sweats? Do the tests coming back normal rule out Lymphoma?  Can you have a normal sed rate and still have Lymphoma? Also, can the itching and symptoms go of Lymphoma go away for 6 months and return? I have no family history of cancer. My brother does have multiple sclerosis.  My current meds are Luvox 100mg, nexium 40mg, Zyrtec 10mg.    Other that the blood tests and chest x-ray, I have had an abdominal ultrasound, upper endoscopy, and upper GI for indigestion and a colonoscopy for constipation that i have suffered from for years.  These were all done in August of 2006. They were all normal.  I would really appreciate your opinion on these health matters. They are of great concern to me and I am very scared that my doctor has missed something. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The history you have given is not enough to diagnose lymphoma, although itching without an apparent cause, could be a presentation for lymphoma (more often HL than NHL). But it is not a specific symptom that is shared with other causes.  I can see also that your doctors have requested a large panel of investigations that would at least show a suspicious of a likely cause. A follow up with your Doctor however, is essential.  Generalized itching may be caused by many conditions including: - Allergic reactions  - Pregnancy - Iron deficiency anemia  - Liver and kidney diseases - Reactions to medications.  Luvox is one of the drug that has been reported to cause allergic reactions, urticaria, itching in few people as well as dyspnea. These reactions although uncommon but are important to be told to your doctor for proper management.  Some medications id taken concomitant with Luvox may increase the like hood complications and should be identified and avoided.   The dose may need to be adjusted in some conditions and in others the body adjusts to the medicine with time. But the consultant is the one aware by which decision to be taken for each complaint.  Hope this information is useful. I advise you to follow up with your Doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

I am very concerned about the elevated ESR and this itching all over is so frustrating. I thank you so much for taking your time to reply to my messages.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I appreciate your concern.  However, although your ESR result is high, it is not significantly high at least to consider lymphoma. This level can occur with mild infection, inflammation or allergy.  Higher than 100 is considerable.  Even though, an isolated high ESR (>100) does not indicate a thorough investigation for an underlying cause unless there are symptoms.  I still can not see any sign pointing to a serious disease including cancer, however if you would like to go for consultation, may be a hematologist (immunologist) would be helpful.  A follow up with CBC, ESR may be advisable.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I recently was referred to a hematologist/oncologist who did some different blood work. I do not know all of the tests. I do know that she did a LDH and a LAP (blood smears). All of the results are normal. I am still concerned because i have a non-tender moveable lymph node in my lower neck above my collarbone. The oncologist did check my nodes and was not alarmed. I am worried because it is still there after 10 days of antibiotic. It has been there for about 4 weeks now. It has not grown but is not shrinking either. I also have a tiny one on the same side in front of my left ear. It is very small though.  I am still having itching and night sweats too. Do you feel i need to still be concerned? These symptoms started out with itching about 11 months ago. There is no rash. It did leave for 5 months in May before returning again. Do lymphoma symptoms go away and return like this? I have no fatigue or weight loss. Should i be worried about the lymph node. Should we still be suspicious of lymphoma? Please tell me if these tests she did can be normal and still have lymphoma?\n\n",

I have had many different blood tests and other tests such as a endoscopy and colonoscopy to rule out any other problems but they all came back normal. also i have had a biopsy on a lymph node in my neck and that also came back negitive except finding the Epstein-Barr virus in the node witch i was told that it was normal for this as 90% of people are found with this at some stage. i am now wating for either a C.T scan or M.R.I scan and im terrified on what might be found. if anyone may have any ideas of the possibilties of what i may be looking at please place a reply as i am extreamly concerned and am getting no answers.  thank you very much for listening and hope to here back someone soon.\n\n",

Then a few days ago I was washing that area without a flannel and felt a pea like lump under the skin (although it feels slightly oblong). It has def grown in size since the last prod!  It does not seem to move at all, not been ill in months and no colds or flu or anything.  Additionaly and maybe not linked a couple of weeks ago I yawned and felt an awful pain all down the front of my throat and was scared to swallow.  Felt like something at twisted or cracked was very odd and probably not linked but I thought worth mentioning.  Is it worth visiting my Doctor and does anyone have any idea what this could be.  I look forward to your responses.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  My first post! I would just like to take the opportunity to thank all of the doctors and medical experts and students for taking the time to offer their advice and possible causes of illnesses and recommendations! I realise how busy you all must be, so on behalf of everyone - thank you! Thank you also to any \"patients\" who offer me advice during my time here!  My first question! I have a small to medium gland which has come up under my right ear. I first noticed it in February 2002, after having my ear block up due to excess wax and then being syringed. It could have appeared even earlier, but I only noticed it then. It cannot be seen with the naked eye, only felt slightly, and I have no other symptoms.  I also had a complete blood count and tests for possible glandular fever in April 2003 - nothing to do with the enlarged gland under my ear; and the tests came back perfect, with no problems whatsoever, and the doctor told me I have perfect blood and am in perfect health. Turns out it was just a viral infection, which gave me REALLY nasty hives! What is your advice about this swollen gland? As I said, it could have been there since I was a baby - it is only a fluke I noticed it upon getting my ears examined.   Could it have come up due to my ear being blocked, and just not gone down yet - even a year later? Should I bother getting it looked at if it is not causing problems? It is expensive to visit a doctor where I live, so I don't want to pay for something that turns out to be nothing.   Should I see a doctor urgently, wait until I visit the doctor next for a checkup/health issue, or just not bother about it. It really isn't bothering me in the slightest - I just get uneasy when I think about it. I feel in perfect health. I am scared it might be lymphoma or leukemia, however I have none of the symptoms, and as I said, the swollen gland isn't causing me problems - just stress!  Thanks heaps for your help and advice,  Matthew Sheehan.\n\n",

On an un-related note - ever since I was little, I've had several glands on my neck and above my ears that go up and down at random, but never go away. Was tested fully, and they were shown to be nothing by my doctor. Maybe the one under my ear is the same?\n\n",

But for the sake of the discussion:   If it is a lymph gland and its not increasing in size and does not measure more than 1 cm, then I wouldn't worry about it either. Lymph glands are there to defend us against infection. While doing so they increase in size. Sometimes after they have increased in size they remain larger than normal.   So points to be monitored are:  1. increase in size of the gland 2. increase in number  3. new glands somewhere else.   Regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Back & chest pain, glands - symptoms every month",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 34 year old male, healthy, no smoking, exercise, good weight, etc.  Over the last 18+ months, I had all kinds of weird symptoms/problems.  They range from:  mild chest paid, weird feeling in the throat to top of my stomach, swollen glands on both sides of my neck, swollen glands underneath my chin, dizziness, numbness in my right leg and right arm, back pain in the dead center of my bad (that spot where you can't really touch with your fingers), other small lumps in my neck (one behind my left ear I've had since I'm 12, one right below it, and one really small one that moves around near my right colar bone).  Used to feel tired too.  Lately, the only symptoms I've had is the swollen glands in both sides of my neck (can be painful, whole neck feels like it's swollen).  This produces a slight pain up to my ears.  I also still have the slight check pain and back pain.  Shoulders are sore too, every 30 minutes I can lift both my shoulders and my neck will crack.  Same with if I angle my head right or left, it will crack (like nuckles, only does it every 30+ minutes).    Had multiple blood work done.  Everything was normal, one time my calcium was high, but had it taken again a few months later and it went down.  Had a MRI of my brain for the dizziness, came back normal - never was dizzy again after that.  Had a 2D echo of my heart, that came back normal with the exception of a mild leaky valve.  Oh, used to have 120 of 80 blood pressure for years, not it can be much higher, been as high as 150 or 93.  BTW, when my calcium was high, it was 10.6.  I didn't get the # when they said it went down.  My white blood cell count was 8.8 in Nov 2006, in Apr 2004 it was 4.7 - is that an alarm?  Bck in Apr 2004 my calcium even back then was 9.8.    I've cut coffee back from 2-3 cups a day to 1 and tried to eliminate caffine besides that.  Also trying to reduce salt for my blood pressure, but seems hard to do!  I've also stopped taking Clarinex for my mild alergies (blood work showed dog, ragweed, and dust allergies - i have a dog).  But just stopped it so I was drug free.  Stopped my Centrum multi-vitamin too when they said I had higher calcium (eat a lot of cheese and milk too).  Tried GERD meds too per Dr., seemed to help with that chest pain.    I've seen 3 drs, each time they don't seem concerned with my glands.  But they have been swollen off and on for 1+ year now.  Had a lot of stress too, 2 deaths in the family within 3 months (ended up being executor and responsible for a lot).  A lot of chest pain and dizzyness/numbness started then.    Sorry for the long post, but any thoughts?\n\n",

    "title": "localized Groin lymphadenopathy",
    "content": "Dear Doc,  Please help me with some positive feedback I have been worrying like crazy.   I am a 28 male I have localized lymphadenopathy in my upper right hand groin area with no additional symptoms. It all started about three weeks ago when I noticed a lump in my right groin area. (I went online and did some research which lead me to become obsessed with worry knowing I may have Lymphoma, Leukemia, or Melanoma). The lump was hard and painless shaped like a kidney bean and about 1.5 cm at the time.   Two week later I went to the doctor. At this time I noticed the hard painless lump to have regressed to 1cm long and .5cm wide. My doctor told me that the lump in my groin area was a swollen lymph node about 1cm. She said it was hard however she said she could move it, but I on the other hand thought it was fixed. To me the swollen lymph node is like a flap, I can flap it over, but it appears to be stuck on the bottom. Would this be considered movable to you? My doctor believes this is movable. Are all hard painless lymph nodes the size of 1cm cancerous? My doctor says not to worry that not all hard painless lymph nodes. Yet, I am so worried because on the internet everyone says hard painless lymph nodes are cancerous.   I also noticed a group of small lymph nodes (shotty nodes) in the crease of my groin and thigh about an inch below the hard swallon lymp node. Is this a major concern? Should I be worried about possible cancer spreading? I am hoping you tell me cancer spreading would not be associated with a group of shotty nodes.  About a month ago I developed blisters on my right foot (the side of the swollen groin lymph node). I exercise a lot and the blisters popped and turned into blood blisters which then pop and then scabbed up. My doctors says this could very well be the cause. She said the popped later scabbed blisters could be an infection so she prescribed me antibiotics. Do you think this could be an infection as well?   After three weeks of a swallon lymph node in my groin and five days of antibiotics I still have the swallon lymph node in my groin and the shotty nodes underneath. There are no signs of growth the hard painless swallon node is still 1cm long and .5cm wide. I am worried sick. My doctor said to come back and see here in two weeks if the node doesn\u2019t  go away for blood work and ultrasound.   One major worry is Melanoma. Do you think you can notice Melanoma on the skin first before it spreads to lymp nodes (please tell me so). My doctor says not to worry I would be able to notice Melanoma first on the skin if I had it. I have checked my moles and skin thoroughly using the internet guideline and pictures of Melanoma I have no signs of Melanoma that I can see. I will be going to a dermatologist just to get some closure.   I thank you so much for your time answering my questions. I am hoping to receive some positive feedback so I can stop worrying so much.   Kindest Regards,\n\n",

I don't know if it affected my inguinal lymph nodes. I feel very well and no pains at all. I am just so worried that the reduction stopped, and am also worried about my inguinal lymph nodes.

    "title": "Enlarged Cervical lymph nodes on right side of neck",
    "content": "Hi I am a 41 yr old female who just went to my regular doctor about 2 weeks ago because I had been feeling unwell for about 2 months (I saw him in October for Pneumonia - would get better then get sick again and then just have not felt right) - I have a cough that has not gone away since the beginning of October.  It does not feel like a sick cough more like a tickle in my throat (like an allergy) and then I cough and cough and can't stop (or I sneeze a million times) - sometimes cough is so hard that it causes me to vomit.  I have about a week or two before I went back to my doctor - woke up and could not breathe out of my nose at all on the right side - felt incredibly congested and had headaches for everyday - finally it appeared it was a sinus infection and I was blowing gross stuff when I could.  And then it just kind of went away, but I still just did not feel right.  I went to rub my neck and noticed there was a couple of enlarged lymph nodes (I had previous DCIS in left breast so I was concerned) - figured I would watch it and figured it was from sinus, but they did not hurt and I did not really feel sick.  They appeared somewhat hard and when I did a search on the internet lymphoma came up.  And I did not realize that itching could be a sign of lymphoma - I have had incredible itching - mainly on my hands, but I have had it for at least 5-7 months and it wakes me up because the itch is incredible and I feel it yet cannot get any relief from scratching for long - almost like it is deep inside.  Went to my doctor - he felt lots of lymph nodes on the cervical region.  I explained all other symptoms and immediately he was concerned about Lymphoma - had chest xray - came back clear.  I just had a ultrasound and bloodwork, don't know results of blood work, but the ultrasound measured a couple of the nodes it saw on my right side (did not see any on my left side), but just determined that they was multiple small enlarged lymph nodes in my neck.  Hmmmm I knew that!  But, they do feel different.  I will talk to my doctor on Monday about all this, but I am still concerned that it could be a lymphoma.  Can Ultrasounds accurately detect if it were lymphoma or should I still request that I have a CT done?  Thanks for your help!  Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  CT is more accurate in assessing a case with possible lymphoma, however, it may not be recommended for every case.  If there is strong suspicion of lymphoma then your doctor may decide to persue his investigations further. The gold standard form the diagnosis of a lymphoma is a biopsy. Indeed it is usually after a biopsy confirms the presence of lymphoma that a CT scan becomes essential for staging. For a lymph node to be biopsied it should be significantly enlarged (usually meaning above 1cm).   Wait and see what the blood work tells us. It could either reinforce of decrease the possibility of lymphoma.   Keep us updated. Wish you all the best.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for replying....  I just wanted to post what my u/s said:  There is a low-attenuating density identified that appears oval in shape in the right neck measuring approximately 1.1 x .5 x .8 cm.  Also appears to be a vascular notch in flow identified centrally with increased echogenicity representing a lymph node.  There is a second node identified in the right noeck measuring approx 1.4 x .4 x 3 mm thought to be a node as well.  Also appears to be central flow with increased echogenicity centrally.  Then they found on the other side (where I do not feel any nodes) a hyperechoic structure identified deep to the strap muscles measuring .8 x .8 cm.  So, the only other thing I wanted to note is that I have been on antibiotics for this in case it was infection and it has not changed the lymph nodes at all.  Like I said I have never felt them there before.  I am also having some hearing loss on that side with massive nasal congestion on that side, but I don't really feel sick.  Also, I have had continuous what sounds like crickets in my head and some ringing.  Hard to explain, but noise all the time for about the same length of time since I found the nodes maybe longer.  Thanks, I am definitely calling my doctor.  Do you think that he would be willing to send me to a doctor to biopsy the biggest one?  Thanks again! Lisa\n\n",

My wbc's were high, but only on the very low end of high suggesting that I did not have anything bacterial, but viral which is why my antibiotics did nothing.  They were concerned about the multiple lymph nodes and I am now being referred to an ENT.  I am assuming that I will have a biopsy scheduled after I see him.  Question?  I have had this doctor before and he did surgery on a benign growth in my mouth.  He is an excellent doctor, but I am not sure that he is the one that I would want to do my biopsy - not really him I don't trust, but I don't like the hospital he works out of.  Any advice on how or what doctor I should have biopsy it if it gets to that?  Does the elevated WBC's suggest even more towards lymphoma with all my other symptoms?  I know you may not be able to answer it, I was just curious.  I just want to be very proactive if needed.  Thanks again!  Lisa\n\n",

The problem with neck nodes is they can be caused by diseases of the head and neck and that should be excluded first before getting a biopsy done.  In such a case its best if it is a surgeon that's specialized in surgery of the neck (eg, oncologic surgeon) unless the nodes are very superficial.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Well, he does not seem to be so concerned.  He said he did not want to do a CT scan because he felt it would be an unnecessary use of Medical diagnostic testing (or something like that).  He said they really only worry when a lymph node was greater than 2 cm.  He scoped up my nose and down - only I think because I really pushed for it, but it looked fine - he just noted clear congestion on the right side which is the same side the nodes are on, plus it is the same side that I have some hearing loss as well and the tinnitus is still constant.  I don't know he saw my bloodwork or just the u/s.  My WBC's were 10800 or 11000.  He is having me go back on the 9th to do a hearing test - I had one about 10 months ago to measure some already known about hearing loss in both ears.  And he said also that he would biopsy it if it gets bigger, but for me to not lose any sleep over it.  Also, said he could send me to a dermatologist for a biopsy of the hands where it is itching so bad.  And I have had my lisonopril stopped for almost a week to see if the cough goes away - so far not.  The one node I feel the most is still there, I thought it might be getting smaller, but today it seemed a little bigger - I just try and not touch it.  Any advice?  I am just thinking that this doctor is not seeing the whole picture and I would rather be proactive and catch something early.  Thanks,  Lisa\n\n",

The lumps at first felt somewhat better, but in the past 2 weeks seem to be alot of nodes there again - and the one is possibly a little bigger.  I also found out that my hemoglobing was low - guess that showed up on my bloodwork that I had in November, but the doctor only told me my WBC's were high.  I found out when I requested a copy be mailed to me.  So, I have made another appointment with my Primary Care doctor - I think he will be more proactive than the ENT.  My neck also has an ache on that side in the line of where the nodes are.  Nodes are still not painful, but my neck has an ache.  I tried to feel my nodes under that arm on the same side and I am not sure if it is muscle or something else.  I also still have the cough.  I did quit the Lisonpril for awhile now.

    "title": "An update",
    "content": "After all of the stuff I posted previously, I had a CT scan of sinuses that showed sinus disease.  I went back on Nasocort and my ENT felt that really we could just watch the nodes.  I had 2 episodes prior to my last visit with him where they swelled and then went back somewhat normal....  And since have felt good - no sickness, the only thing I can complain about is that I have had continuous and progressive neck tightness on the side where I had the enlarged nodes.  So, because of this I have an appt to see my Primary doctor to see if it is anything.  I still have the hand itching that is controlled with some prescription cream my doctor gave to me, but when I don't use it - the itch comes back with  a vengeance.  So, last week I went to the dentist and it has been about 6 years since I have been.  As the hygeniest was checking for enlarged nodes in my jaw area (just as check up) she asked me \" how long has that been there\" and I was like what?  And then she let me feel it and I was like OMG....  So, she told me I need to have it checked right away, hopefully it was nothing, but I needed to see my doc right away.  I explained I had already had an appt due to the other issue and she said good.  I do recall maybe 3 weeks or more ago feeling something really small there, but I just did not even give it another thought and it is much bigger now.  It is not on the same side as my previous enlarged nodes it is on my left side, under the ear - kind of in between under the ear and the jaw.  It sure does not feel so normal and of course as I have more time to think about it I am getting worried.  Any advice?  I would guess it is the size of a almond...  Thanks....  Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  What it sounds like may have happened was that you had perhaps a bout of mono about a year ago, but the blood tests you had done wouldn't have told you if that's what was going on. A mono spot test would have been more helpful, as well as CBC. However, that was a while ago, and what you're left with now, regardless of what sort of infection  you had at the time, it's probably moved on. Sometimes, though,  these parotid (salivary) glands can remain enlarged and even sore for a long time afterward.   Since it's still causing some discomfort, I think it would be wise to have it checked, since it could have developed a walled-off (cystic) infection, although  it does seem to be getting better. A CBC and mono spot (or,  better yet, one or more of the tests for Epstein-Barr virus) would help by showing whether or not you had had mono, which would help explain the cranky gland. If negative, there may be something that can (or should) be done to help the gland return  to normal.   Hopefully this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 21 year old female and in november last year I had strep throat and have had persistent swollen lymph nodes under my jaw ever since about 1.3cm. In february I noticed another one that has been described by several doctors as being between 1.3 and 1.5 cm on the right side of my neck. I had a couple of doctors say they thought it was nothing to worry about and was sent to a specialist anyway who told me he thought it was nothing to worry about and was probably due to glandular fever which my bloods showed antibodies for but also I had never known I had had, but that it could also be an indolent lymphoma which he was reluctant to do a biopsy to diagnose as he said they don't develop for at least 20 years and knowing now wouldnt change anything. I was so worried about that comment I went to another doctor who sent me to have an FNA on the node in the side of my neck which came back normal. I also have a small 0.5-0.7 node in my groin which has been there constantly since feb. All of my nodes have not gotten any bigger but also have not gotten any smaller, I would really like to know if the specialist was right and if all of these things are clues to having indolent lymphoma, I have been so worried and would really like to know so I can get on with things. I have no other symptoms and general health asides from lymph nodes is all good. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: multiple persistent swollen neck lymph nodes",
    "content": "Hello -  While the enlarged nodes could, possibly, indicate an early, indolent lymphoma, I cannot imagine a doctor dismissing early detection and treatment of any cancer. That being said, since you tested positive for glandular fever (infectious mononucleosis), this made the comment about a lymphoma almost gratuitous and guaranteed to cause any patient undue concern. If there is a ready explanation for the swollen glands (and there certainly is) then I can't see any reason to needlessly alarm you with speculation about something that's already been adequately explained. The parotid glands, in particular, can remain enlarged for a considerable time after having had mono, and one can have mono and never know it had been there. While we always hear the stories of people feeling horrible for weeks with it, that's because they felt horrible for weeks. One rarely hears anything about the innocuous cases, because the go unnoticed until something like this  happens (enlarged glands draw attention and the problem is diagnosed).  Because of this, and not the random suggestion of a future malignancy, I would suggest the biopsy is unjustified now. There's a perfectly good explanation for the enlargement, and it will likely take some time to go away. Be glad you weren't aware of the mononucleosis, as it can be an ordeal sometimes.   And odd experience for you, and no doubt unsettling, but I think you can take comfort in the fact that you now know you've had mononucleosis and didn't get terribly ill with it. The rest you might write off to \"thinking out loud\" on the part of the specialist.  I hope this helps. Best of luck to you. Follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I did not actually test positive for having Glandular/ EBV (I did have several tests for it between nov07 and feb 08 while trying to diagnose my strep throat, which came back negative), but showed antibodies for it which the specialist explained to me only indicated that I had had it in the past but could not say when at all which is partly the reason why I was so worried as it could have been years ago which then wouldn't explain the nodes now would it? Also they have been there for almost a year now, is it common or even possible that lymph nodes this size could just stay there this size permanently and not be anything to worry about?

    "content": "My 12 yr old son started with a small node behind his right ear several months ago.  We waited for it to disappear as they normally do in kids.  It has enlarged quite abit.  We took him to dr, and they prescribed antibiotics.  He completed the full cycle.  During the two weeks of taking them he developed 3 more enlarged nodes in his left groin.  2 showed up one day, then a much larger one ( approx 1 inch) showed up 2 days later! He had a cat scan that showed  these 3 nodes along with a mildly prominent spleen, and enlarged nodes in other groin side too..we don't seem to notice them though.. A chest xray reads: slight nodularity through the superior left hilar region.  a small amount of adenopathy is not excluded. Could you please tell me what that means? All of his cbc work came back normal. He shows no infection in his system..they have done countless blood work along with HIV, they all c ame up negative. He also has none of the other symptoms that go along with lymphoma.  I asked the dr. about that, and he said alot of people do not have other sypmptoms or during early stages of lymphoma a person may not exhibit other symptoms..  Doctors have scheduled him for a excision of 2 nodes from his groin.  I would like to know  your opinions of whether or not  this likely  could be lymphoma.  This is what the surgeon said it might  be.  He doesn't seem to have \"matched\" pairs of enlarged glands..they seem to be random.  Does having random enlarged nodes mean anything?   Plus he has none enlarged in his neck as of right now.  Thanks so much for any information you provide!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I hope your son is feeling better. What your son has is best described as generalized lymphadenopathy. This happens when more than one lymph node region is involved at the same time. The fact that new lymph nodes appeared while on antibiotics is also a cause for concern.  There are many causes for generalized lymphadenopathy from viral infections (that will not respond to antibiotics also) to some immunological disorders to several hematologic diseases as well as lymphoma / leukemia. I think your doctor did the right thing. I would definitely recommend excluding lymphoma at this stage.   The good news is lymphoma / leukemia responds very well to therapy in children compared to adults.   Please keep us updated and good luck to your son.\n\n",

It is extremely unusual (certainly not impossible, but quite unusual) to have widespread lymph node pain without any swelling. Are the sites tender to the touch? Can you palpate the actual lymph nodes or are you going by the location of the pains? It is extremely difficult to pin this down, and I'm wondering if the pain isn't actually coming from another, unrelated source (such as nerve pain of polyneuritis), since the symptoms don't fit any disorder  I'm aware of. Also, the random and fleeting nature of the pains suggest nerve involvement rather than lymph nodes.   If you have some history you've neglected to include in your post that might help unravel this mystery. Please follow up with us here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  This now sounds a lot less like a lymph system problem and more like something more obscure. It's true, nerve pain usually has a burning (or sometimes stabbing) quality, rarely pinching. With pain in the extremities as well as the original pain, plus anemia, I'd hope by now your doctor has done at least the most basic blood tests (CBC, basic metabolic panel or BMP, etc.) and will follow this situation.   I'm sure your pain is real, as pain is almost always real, even though it may be \"phantom\", exaggerated (by the body, not the patient, although perception does play a role also), or even inappropriate and therefor quite confusing. This latter may be the case with you, but the anemia factor makes me wonder if there might not be something more arcane going on. Whether it progresses, resolves, or a cause is found in the meantime, your doctor should be continuing the detective work for now.   One question: have you tried non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as ibuprofin or naproxyn (Advil, Aleve) for the limb pain? If so, does it respond? This could be telling.   Please follow up here as necessary, and prod your doctor to explore all the possibilities as well. Pain, by itself, is bad enough. The fact that its original purpose was to let us know something is wrong makes finding the cause (or lack of one) all the more important.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a twenty year old hispanic female and about a couple of months ago I started feeling a pain near my right arm, but I couldn't determine specifically where the pain was coming from. I thought it could possibly be a lymph node so I when I went for my annual check up to my GYN she performed a clinical breast exam and reassured me that everything was OK. At the time I had been taking birth control for a couple of months and my breasts were becoming increasingly dense and fibrous and I asked whether this was normal and she said that in many cases women develop fibroadenomas or fibrocystic breasts due to birth control. She reasurred me that everything was fine and if I noticed any other changes in my breast to return and said that the pain was probably related to my joint/muscle and suggested that I probably \"slept wrong\" or did some kind of activity that aggravated the area. I had been asymptomatic for about 2 months following that and the pain practically disappeared. Recently, however, I have been suffering from terrible headaches, pain in my joints and they crack all the time (especially the shoulder, elbow, hands, knees and ankles), I've had low grade fevers, back pain, malaise, loss of appetite and I lost about 5 lbs in 2 weeks. I went to the ER because my pain only got worse and I was on the verge of tears and they did a CT for my brain since I had been having recurrent headaches, blood pathology (CBC), and urinalysis. They said the CT came back negative, the blood tests came back within normal ranges and the urine was negative for UTI and my kidneys were functioning well, I just had mild dehydration. My doctor said that my headaches were migraines/tension headaches that were stress related and that all the other symptoms were indicative of a virus. I questioned about my submadibular and submental lymph nodes which were a bit swollen and tender and he said that they were \"slightly\" swollen and tender because of infection. He reassured me that due to my age and history I was probably trying to fight off some kind of infection. He told me to get some rest, eat well and drink plenty of water and if the symptoms persisted to return, but to give it about 2 weeks.  If I had a virus wouldn't by WBC count be elevated? And why would I have other symptoms such as joint pain, etc?  I'm a student nurse and I felt like his diagnosis was a bit vague and perhaps he didn't run enought tests.   My appetite comes and goes and I feel nausea but I was able to gain some of the weight back (2lbs). HOWEVER, I feel like my lymph nodes everywhere are out of wack! I can palpate my supraclavicular lymph nodes (bilaterally) and in my groin and recently I feel some upper left abdominal pain which tends to increase when I do heavy lifting or moderate activity. To top things off, I feel nodule-like lumps under my skin in my abdomen, arms, and thighs...SO basically I am terrified. My chest also feels tight sometimes and I feel gasy. ALL the research points to cancer or some kind of malignancy and my father passed away from metastatic prostate cancer in the brain at 54, so you can imagine the trauma I have; not to mention, my paternal grandfather-liver cancer (although he was an alcoholic), my maternal grandmother-lung cancer (heavy smoker since the age of 14), and my maternal grandfather-metastatic lung cancer in bones (probably from my grandma's second hand smoke).   ALSO, I recently was diagnosed with an ovarian cyst, so I feel like my body is completely out of tune. PLEASE HELP!  I have scheduled a doctor's appt for tuesday but I need some insight or peace of mind until then because I am so scared. ALSO if you can please tell me what questions I should ask the doctor or what tests I should request.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Breast consistency differs based on changes in the blood levels of female hormones, thus exogenous hormones like those contained in the contraception pills induce breast changes as your doctor explained. Regular self examination and clinical examination is important to follow up these changes and to exclude a suspicious breast nodule. Bilateral small axillary nodes that are less than 1cm, mobile, rubbery to firm are commonly seen in females with fibroadnosis of the breast.  Submental and submandibular lymph nodes drain the teeth, the gum and the lips. While inguinal nodes drain the genital, the anal area and the lower extremities. Following infection or inflammation in the area drained by them, they grow in size and become painful. When infection or inflammation subsides they regress in size but never disappear.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are smaller than 1 cm in diameter; however, for inguinal nodes, those larger than 1.5 cm are generally considered abnormal.  Those small nodules you feel in the abdominal wall are more likely to be subcutaneous fat rather than abdominal lymph nodes that are detected by radiological examination. I assume that your doctor made sure that the supraclavicular swellings represent fat collection and are not lymph node enlargement. If they are truly LN, they should be considered very suspicious and should be carefully investigated  Your investigations are all normal and CT scans are free of any disease so your condition is most probably not related to cancer. viral infections causes similar clinical picture and having a normal CBC does not exclude its occurrence.  I would advise you to closely observe these lymph node and to follow up with your doctor. A thorough examination of all lymph node groups is essential. Complete blood picture, liver and kidney function tests, ESR, LDH may be recommended too. Thyroid function tests and CT Scans as needed. All investigations are requested based on complete history and physical examination.  Hope you find this information useful. Please Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "First and foremost, thank you so very much for your feedback, I really appreciate it.  Well I returned to the doctor because I was feeling a lot of malaise and muscle/joint aches and they ran a slew of exams including: CBC, electrolyte panel, ESR, CRP, liver function tests, glucose, lipids, immunology tests (RF, ANA, Smooth muscle IgG, ASO titer), chest Xray and the doc told me to choose a joint that had been hurting to avoid exposing my body to radiation so they did a wrist Xray.  Everything came back within normal ranges and the chest and wrist xrays were normal, negative for any acute process, and 'unremarkable'. The one thing that came back elevated was my ASO titer which was at 611 and the doc said the normal range for adults was 0-200.  He prescribed penicillin VK 500 mg BID and did a throat swab for which I find out the results this upcoming week. I still have a sore throat and the area under my jaw line is very tender. I have a lymph node right under each ear that is very swollen and painful to the touch (I would say about 1-1.5cm in size). Ive recently been having tinnitus and ear ache and when I touched behind my right ear yesterday because I kept having a lot of pain I have about 2 pea sized nodes.    Could this be due to the strep infection also? What if the throat swab comes back negative but my ASO titer was + ?  I am really scared about lymphoma. Whenever I look up anything EVERYTHING points to cancer and it is really scary/frustrating when I have to wait weeks between each appointment.   PLEASE give me some info about this, I will really appreciate it. I am a student nurse and I can barely focus on school because I am really stressed out over this whole situation.  THANKS IN ADVANCE and hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sorry for the delay in replying and hope you are better.  If your ASO titre is high it indicates recent infection with streptococci (most common cause). I agree with your doctor that you should receive a full course of antibiotics (penicillin) then your tests should be repeated.  As for these lymph nodes, the ear pain and the throat pain, they are going with streptococcus infection in the throat, so do not be stressed and follow your doctor\u2019s instructions.  A serial clinical examination of these lymph nodes is essential too.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I just wanted to let you know that I have been going to an ENT who specializes in ear/throat cases and he had me under observation for 6 weeks to see if he noted any difference in my lymph nodes and after 6 weeks he noticed they were practically the same. He says that what mainly concerns him is the swelling below my left ear because he can't distinguish between lymph node or whether it is connected to the parotid gland. But he said that given my history and because I didn't have any other accompanying symptoms of weight loss he didn't think it was anything bad but rather reactive lymph nodes of a previous infection/chronic infection. I have still been experiencing some right ear pain every so often and have congestion, and my lymph nodes are painful every now and then. BUT to rule out anything bad and because I have been so worried he referred me for a CT of the head/neck with and without contrast. The person performing the CT said that it clearly showed Left Maxillary Sinusitis but that I had to wait for the written report from the radiologist. I have an appt this friday with my ENT for a follow up and results of my CT (crossing fingers), so hopefully everything will be cleared up! I have been super worried all of these months and now at least I will get some answers as to why the nodes in my neck have been swollen for 7 months.   I was just wondering what could be determined from the CT? lymph node size, etc...like how reliable is it? and if they find something abnormal, what is the next step? biopsy?  Thank you for your feedback, I really appreciate it.\n\n",

I now have Lymph Nodes everywhere under the arms, groin, etc.  I have lost over 65 lbs. and I am sitting around 100 lbs.  2 Biopsies have been performed one removing a large Lymph Node on the left side of my neck and a Lesion Sample as I started to develop these Boils.  Well it has been 1 week since the Biopsies.  The doctor called me in and I am being referred to a Hematologist and he said they would probably do a Bone Maro Test.  I am so scared and so confused.  My doctor is absolutely wonderful I guess I am trying to understand what I might be possibly looking at.  Obivously at this point everything is speculation, but where the Lymph Node was removed for the Biopsy it has now been replaced with an even larger Lymph Node.  I am nauseaus all the time, very run down, sleeping a lot and not hungry, but once I take my gravol to ease the nauseau I try to eat as much as possible.  No matter what I do I can't seem to gain weight.  I understand that until all the tests are done there really isn't an answer, but even if I had a rough idea of what could be going on.  Lymph Nodes on my back shoulder area causing pressure and pain, my neck looks horrible as the Lymph Nodes are so swollen and the sores are disgusting and they weap.  Can anyone help me understand it is like my body is rebelling on me.  SoVeryTired\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I was recently satisfying a small itch at the base of my throat, when it occurred to me the left part of my collarbone (that is near the sternum) felt a bit...larger, than its counterpart? This struck me as a little strange. So as I had one hand on the perceived \"larger\" side and one hand on the other side for comparison, trying to discern if it was just all in my head, I noticed a small lump near -practically on - the left clavicle, near the base of the throat. It is hard-ish and I can move it around a bit. It is not painful whatsoever. At first, I was a bit amused...sorry, I can be odd...but upon somewhat closer investigation I discovered that such a peculiar lump does not exist anywhere else along my collarbone or in my neck that I am aware of.  Now...I refrained from scouring the internet about this because honestly, I don't know what amount of help that could have been. I did however have a friend who had a form of lymphoma some years ago and I recalled that his only symptom had been an enlarged node near his collarbone, on the left side...hence my appearance in this wonderful forum of yours. I was wondering if I should just wait it out a few weeks to see what happens to my new pea-sized friend here, or should I go bother my doc? I'm 20, female, healthy and happy as a clam (and no, I don't smoke or whatever). Haven't been ill recently if you don't count an unfortunate incidence involving poorly prepared grilled squash about a month ago.  Any insights would be much appreciated.\n\n",

Blood and x-ray were fine, but CT came back with the discovery of nodules on my thyroid and other enlarged cervical lymph non-palpable. I have been doing research with only negative discoveries.

    "title": "Re: lymphadenopathy with thyroid nodules",
    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for your question. Nodules in the thyroid as seen by CT scan can be malignant or benign there really is no way of telling for sure without more investigations. The Gold Standard is obtaining a histology. Another option is a FNA from the nodules after excluding thyrotoxicosis as that seems to get confused with follicular carcinoma (false positive). A cold nodule on thyroid scan is also more concerning.  Obviously you are concerned about the presence of lymph nodes in the neck and whether they indicate a spread from a possible malignancy in the thyroid. That is always a legitimate concern depending on the nature of the presentation and examination.   Many things come into play here - the longer duration of onset of these lymph nodes favors a more benign condition. The size of these nodes is also important (>1cm) and whether or not they continue to enlarge or not.   Another important thing is the location of the lymph nodes. The first station of spread of a thyroid cancer would be the lymph glands in its immediate vicinity (prelaryngeal, pretracheal, paratracheal). Lymph nodes in the lateral compartment of the neck (internal jugular) can also happen.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

Then my father fell ill and I had to take care of him so I neglected to find another gynecologist. After my father passed in nov of 08 I made an appointment with new gyne but could not get in until this month (april 20, 2009).  I fear my female problems have affected my body.  Now I have unexplained (persistant) lymphadenopathy in my neck and also a thyroid nodule...I don't believe my personal provider is taking all of my med history into consideration. Is it possible to have female problems that take a toll on the rest of your body??...\n\n",

    "content": "I have had a Right solid dominate Thyroid nodule since 1999.  Initial testing then showed a \"hot\"nodule, all thyroid levels were normal and have remained so. At that time I had a ultrasound guided FNA which was inconclusive.  In 2003, I followed up again, the nodule was bigger and a FNA in the doctors office {not ultrasound guided} was performed and it was negative.  In 2005, I moved to AZ and obtained new docs.  I had the uptake scan and my previously \"hot\" nodule had now become \"cold\", the US showed it had grown, not substantially, but it had and the thyroid levels remained normal.  In 2008, I once again had a US and ultrasound guided FNA, which came back ok.  About three months ago, I noticed that the lymph nodes lateral to my thyroid nodule were swollen, I have not been sick and it is only in that area, all others are non-palpable.  My neck appears full upon inspection and the nodes in that area are palpable.  Last year my nodule measure 2.7 cm by 1.2 cm, upon palpation I can feel a lump beyond my thyroid as well, not overly firm, but definitely noticeable and only on my right side.  My question is... can a previously \"hot\" nodule become cold and turn malignant.  Would the lypmh nodes be swollen in the absence of infection and what are the odds it's malignant?  I see the doctor next week, but am very concerned.  My father did have Adrenocortical Carcinoma, although I don't think this is Medullary Cancer.  What are your feelings on this?\n\n",

I would like to marry him, but my parents say that he may get sick again later and will not be able to take care of me. Parents' blessings in my culture is very important, but this is what I really want. I believe that the chances of it coming back are low since he is young, but what is the correct prognosis for his situation? Also, my parents say it may affect my kids, in the way that they may be handicapped. His doctor has told him that his treatment will not affect his fertility though. Can I get some further clarification on that?  Is there any good information that I could tell my parents to convince them?  I appreciate you taking your time to read this.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pony,  Thanks for your question. You are right to worry about this issue and should not hesitate to get yourself examined. Ideally an oncologist but really any primary care physician can examine you and evaluate your case.  Your doctor will need to check your breasts as well as other lymph node areas. Depending on how large and the growth pattern of these swellings you may need to do a few scans on the breast to exclude any breast tumors.  The presence of lymph nodes in both axillae do suggest a more generalized disease. This could be lymphoma although it does seem strange for it to present in both armpits. On the other hand it could very well be a long standing infection or a complication of an infection (shotty lymph nodes).  Please get yourself examined as soon as possible.\n\n",

These lumps are very painful and the original two lumps have now shrank and now it is just one very large one and the two small ones are now the size of peas.  They also look like bruises.  The large one stings and is very painful.  I am currently concerned because I currently do not have any medical insurance and for this reason can not go to the doctor like I would want to.  Do you have any advice for me as to what I can do to reduce the pain and if there are any options for someone like me who is uninsured?

    "content": "I August I discovered a swollen lymph node in neck during first trimester of pregnancy.  Doc initially sent me for bloods and ultrasound just to measure it.  She tested me for everything from mono to strep and ticks and found nothing wrong.  I subsequently miscarried and she sent me for a CT scan and Xray in September she also put me on antibiotics for 14 days  just in case. The Cat scan showed multiple swollen nodes in neck but chest was clear so she sent me to an endocrine surgeon who performed a FNA and full removal of lymph node. It came back negative for lymphoma, but I developed another swollen node in same area of neck.  I was sent to an oncologist at a cancer center, he sent my lymph node for a second opinion and  who had a PET scan done. By now it was already December and I still had a few swollen nodes in the area of my neck.  The PET scan showed lymphadenopathy.   Now , in March I have  about two small nodes swollen one the size of a pea and one the size of  kidney bean.  The doctor is still concerned about the PET scan and claims that even though the biopsy was negative he still wants me watched for at least six months before I consider myself free and clear.  My question, what besides lymphoma can be the cause of my swellings? Is it possible to have a false negative biopsy when an entire node was removed in October?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It all depends on the clinical situation. Obviously the Gold Standard for diagnosis of any cancer is a biopsy. FNA are not very accurate for the diagnosis of lymphoma. However, if the lymphadenopathy has not been explained and a PET scan is positive. I would certainly think its prudent to stay under close follow up.   PETs are extremely sensitive meaning you won't get that many false negatives with those. Unfortunately, though they aren't very specific - ie, you can get false positives! Especially, distinguishing cancer from an inflammation is a common problem with most functional scans as they depend on increased cellular activity to locate the problem. Standardized uptake values (SUV) can help to distinguish between those.  I hope that helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Have had enlarged lymph nodes in neck, underarms and groin for eight months.  Blood work all normal.  No prior infection.  Two weeks ago an excision biopsy to a node on the side of my neck reported as:-  1. Nonspecific dermatopathic changes 2. Lymph node with follicular hyperplasia and nonspecific dermatopathic changes  My surgeon says all is fine - that they must be reactive but we don't know what to.  The incision healed well.  After approx five days, a node popped up directly under the scar.  It is very raised, approx 2\" x 1\" and very hard.  At my follow-up the Dr said this should reduce.  He said there is also some slight neck swelling, probably due to interrupting the flow of lymph.  He wants to check again in two weeks.  Is this a normal reaction to a biopsy?  There is no sign of infection, redness or soreness.  The only pain is coming from the disturbed SCM muscle.  My health is generally very good.  I had a CT scan in October (for unrelated problem) which found a substernal mass (ectopic thyroid - since removed), small uterus mass (thought to be a fibroid) and some enlarged nodes as above.  Also found 'multiple tiny pulmonary nodules' which are to be followed-up in three months.  I'd appreciate any reassurance, experience etc.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "title": "Palpable Supraclavicular Lymph Node",
    "content": "Hi, For a few days I've had a few palpable  lymph nodes in my neck, and today ,being the hypochondriac that I am, I began poking around my collar bone area for lymph nodes, as I've read they are far more concerning than the ones in the neck. After literally a few hours of digging in my collar bone I began to feel a bump in between two thin veins or tendons in about the middle of my collar bone. The bump isn't very large, no larger than those on my neck. My question is, could poking and digging around in my collar bone for hours eventually cause a lymph node to swell, or at least make it palpable? I can only really feel the bump when my neck is at certain angles as well. Am I being crazy, or should I worry about this bump?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  No, you're not being crazy, and in fact you've uncovered a fact about anatomy and human behavior that eludes most people: you can find almost anything if you bother long enough. While it is possible to have actually irritated something enough to make it palpable, it's also quite possible that you have now honed your palpation skills to the point where they no longer serve you well because of your not having taken a course in anatomy (although I'll bet you have a pretty good idea of much of what's supposed to be where).   None of this is meant to denigrate your find, and if you can leave it alone for a few days, then go directly back to it without having to poke and prod, it may be an abnormal lymph node (which still means little on its own). If it persists after such a challenge, you might mention it to your doctor. Otherwise, it's probably no cause for concern. Again, you'll need to leave it alone long enough for it to potentially recover from having been poke and prodded, and also long enough that your sense memory will have faded sufficiently that you can't find it immediately. We can become so attuned to a feature of our body that  we can find it in our sleep, so you need to literally forget the precise location of this bump. If you can then find it with no exploring at all,  it will mean it is prominent enough to be abnormal. If that should be the case then you'd want to mention it to your doctor. If it changes there would be even better cause to mention it. For now, however, I'd definitely try and forget it. If you can do that and it calls attention to itself, then you'll have some small reason for concern.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply. Since my last post I actually spent alot of time digging around in my collar bone on the left hand side as well. I suffer from pretty sever OCD ,which I am getting help for, but I still did look into my lymph nodes because I found another one on the left hand side after a few days of digging around which actually caused my collar bone area to swell so bad that I could not make a 'hollow' out of it when I tried. The doctors I've seen have said that the lymph node in my left collar bone is not big enough to warrant any concern, it's maybe half a centimetre at best, I've also had a chest x ray (for another reason) which was perfectly normal, and a CBC which was also perfectly normal. I imagine I have no cause for lymphoma concern at this point after these two tests? Also the fact that I traumatized my collar bone area so badly could have brought the lymph node to the fore?  It was palpable at all times when I was swollen, but now I can only feel the node if I lift my arm up high enough and kind of pull it out from behind my collar bone. I suppose the chest x ray and blood work would have found something if there was anything to find?\n\n",

This is unsurprising, and could actually turn into something akin to skin scratching ortrichotillomania, so you don't want to get carried further away with this at the risk of injuring something that's otherwise fine.  And yes, you absolutely could find the axillary nodes, especially since you've been rather obsessive and habitual in probing the area. You could actually become very good at this. Of course without medical school it would be of pretty limited use, but it's interesting for sure.\n\n",

My GP did a cat scan which indicated nothing else other than the area in question - indicating it may be an infection.  I was put in hospital and for five days ran a major course of IV antibiotics.  The lump came down more than 50% and I was released to return home.  However it still causes quite an ache in my neck and is tender to touch but no where near the original pain.   I am now   taking ciproflaxacin and cefadroxil (antibiotics) and having a terrible reaction - rash / itch / nausea...The lump has not changed at all since I got home and I'm concerned.  If this truly is an infection about how long should it take for it to go away??? THe lump is now down to it's original size (olive) and feels hard and rubbery.  I recently gave birth and many believe this could be related to breastfeeding but dr's disagree as I have no other symptoms or signs of infection.  Any ideas?  Please help as I'm freaking myself out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Based on the response of the lump to antibiotic therapy I'd have to conclude this is an infected cyst, probably involving a lymph gland. I'm sorry the antiobiotic is causing so much discomfort, and hopefully that's all  done by now. This thing got pretty large, and sometimes these can  be very stubborn and occasionally require a minor surgical procedure to drain or remove the node in order to resolve any lingering, walled-off infection. I don't think its relationship to breast feeding is important, if one exists. These things  can occur anyway. You're getting the right treatment based on the results, but if the thing remains painful, tender,  or grossly palpable it may require an invasive draining.  This can be done with little to no residual marking, and hopefully won't be necessary. These things can be quite stubborn, so I'd give it plenty of time to go away, so long as it continues to improve or stay stable at least. If it starts to swell again, please inform your doctor and consider surgical drainage or removal.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: ENLARGMENT OF LYMPH WITH EAR RING",
    "content": "Hello --  First, when you use an earring and this lymph node pops up, are you wearing the earring for at least a day? Or does the node become palpable as soon as you insert the ring? You could be having an allergic reaction to the ring or you may have some sort of neuromuscular anomaly on that side of your face/neck that causes this  node to change position when you've gone through the motions involved in putting the ring in place. In either case it doesn't sound serious, since it is only when you wear an earring. If it were a cause for concern you probably would be aware of it all the time.  As for the other node you're able to feel,the one near the back of your neck, since you are able to find it only when  you turn your head and since you discovered it two years ago and it hasn't changed in any way, this suggests it may have been present previously and you just happened to notice it then and it's remained there and unchanged.   If either node changes in any way, I'd suggest you have it/them checked. Otherwise, I think you're fine. You will likely continue to check them out of habit, so you'd notice if anything were to change. So far so good.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While  the most serious things should always be ruled out first when there is even a remote possibility of a problem being serious (there being no clear cut cause at the outset), mono still does seem to be the most likely cause of this, for a lot of reasons. One, lymphoma usually spreads slowly and doesn't usually show up all over the place at once. Second, your son's age argues statistically for mono over other causes, all things being equal.   A monospot test should have been drawn at the outset, which might have avoided the anxiety and avoided the consult with a hemotologist. However, your doctor was able to see the whole patient in person, and it's better to be thorough rather than too casual. Mono does have its own potentially serious problems, but if it's diagnosed properly these can be avoided.   With no other symptoms present,  whatever this is should be easier to manage. I wish I could give you a more concrete answer, but until the proper blood tests have been done you can't really know with certainty what is going on. If it is mono, just please make certain your son avoids all contact sports until the glads have returned to normal.   Best of luck to you both. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "right superclavicular lymph node inflamed",
    "content": "Hi I have a slightly complicated story,  I am a 27 year old caucasian male with no family history of cancer.  I underwent a PET/CT scan at the beginning of December for some inflamed lymph nodes in my occipital region and to investigate the possibility of Squamous Cell Carcinoma (long story involving a lot of people giving me a lot of different interpretations on a diagnosis) and it came back clear. FNA of the offending nodes also came back clear. MY full body PET scan highlighted nothing suspicious anywhere at all.  Recently I noticed my right supraclavicular lymph node was inflamed. I'm unsure when this happened, I just happened to be fumbling around the area and touched on it, it seems to be roughly a centimeter in diameter and firm yet highly mobile. I did a little reading around and found some scary statistics about that particular node, notably that in people over 40, this turns outs to be malignant 90% of the time and in people younger than 40 about 25%. Although I'm in the lower risk category 25% still scares me.  I went to see the doctor today and he gave me some anti-biotics and anti-histamine tabs to take for a week and then told me to come back in a week.  My query is this: As my PET/CT scan was clean with no suspicious areas a month and a half ago, does that rule out cancer for this (at least for lung cancer, to which I believe this node is mostly related)? I asked about the possibility of Lymphoma to my doctor and he grunted a laugh and said \"No .... well at least the possibility is very very small. Either way take the meds and come back again later\".  Other things that may be pertinent: I have a rash, but this is not unusual as I am a life long eczema sufferer (the eczema on my scalp was blamed for the occipital lymph nodes being flared). I also have viral conjunctivitis and the lymph node in front of my right ear is swollen as a result). In terms of possible virus contact, my wife recently had influenza but I didn't seem to contract it from her.  If anyone has any insight into what this could be I would be most grateful, ofc I will continue going to my practitioner, it seems there are very few alternatives on the web to \"cancer\" for inflammation of that particular node group, so I am a little worried.    Many thanks  G\n\n",

    "content": "Another query.  I returned to my Doc after taking the meds and nothing changing. He poked around awhile and looked at my PET scans taken at the start of Dec. He said that he doubted it was lymphoma as I'd see significant increase in the size of the nodes over a few weeks if it were and there hadn't been any.  So I asked him why he thought they were inflamed, he then told me that it was possible that the lymphatic fluid was draining down from the scalp and passing onto the Supraclavicular region. Can this actually happen? Frankly I hadn't heard of this phenomenon before and this particular doc seems like he wants rid of me everytime I go there. If this is a genuine possibility I'll let it rest but if this is nonsense then I will try and get a second opinion. Can anyone tell me if his prognosis is feasible or not?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The lump you feel below the ear is mostly an enlarged lymph node. These nodes are commonly enlarged when the areas drained by them (ear, throat,teeth, oral cavity, skin around etc) are inflamed or infected. Sometimes infection or inflammation is mild and pass unnoticed.   So, lymph nodes may enlarge and regress in size after recovery with no prominent symptoms and signs. Repeated infections or inflammation in these parts make the lymph nodes more enlarged and more easily felt. They are known as non specific reactionary nodes that are small<1cm, mobile, soft to firm and are painless.  Nodes that continue to grow are alarming. Having symptoms like fever, night sweats may signify infection like viral infections, however being that prominent  is considerable and should be investigated to exclude any serious causes.  Simple blood picture, ESR and LDH may be helpful to start with.  Serial clinical examination is essential to exclude any alarming signs.

Why would they say it was normal when it wasn't - twice? He is sending me for a chest xray and a ultrasound of the spleen. Just glad something is being done at last, he is the only doctor that was willing to speak to me like an adult and not a child.   I still can't believe they lied to me!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am glad you are satisfied with your current physician, but just a note; your previous doctors probably meant it is normal to have your count mildly elevated when you caught infection. Would you please inform us about the results of your last CBC as written in the report, so that we can give you a more convenient openion.  When changes in the blood count persists and no clear cause is found, further investigations are mandatory. So, I do not feel upset about your previous visits and do not worry yourself thinking there might be any delayed in your investigations or management.  It would be however more helpful if you can inform us about the results of your last CBC as written in the report, so that we can give you a more convenient openion.  Please keep us updated.

    "content": "I have had very bad reactions to hair dyes. The commercial brands contain ppd which causes sensitivity in some. i used to dye my hair about every 2 months without problems but about 2 yrs ago i started getting itchy rashes around my ears and down my back. Well im not 40 and have more gray hair then my mother so i continued to dye my hair trying several different brands ..all the same reaction only each time i dyed my hair the reactions got worse the nodes behind my ears and all over my neck started swelling and would stay swollen i started wheezing  stomach and gut problems. i had to quit using the hair dyes (3 months ago). i have since switched to all natural dyes ( henna and indigo) and my swollen glands have noticeably shrank. these hair dyes are horrible for your body. ppd is the same ingredient they use in black henna ( no such thing as natural black henna)but several ppl have had reactions matter of fact i think ppds are illegal in several other countries.   anyway i guess my point is it is entirely possible your nodes are swollen because of the irritation on your scalp and i strongly suggest you avoid using any type of hair dye because once you have a reaction ALL subsequent reactions get worse i think its what they call a type 2 sensitivity ppds have even been linked to cancer they are HORRIBLE for your body...\n\n",

    "title": "False Negative After Fine-Needle Aspiration?",
    "content": "Hello.  I am a 25 year-old female with no known medical conditions and I am not currently on any medication.  I am concerned about an inguinal lymph node that has been enlarged and slowly growing for at least two years.  Two years ago I had an emergency appendectomy.  The CT scans from that time show that one of my left inguinal lymph nodes was enlarged, though I do not know what the dimensions were.  Because I was suffering from an acute infection, the radiologist did not even bother to note the enlarged node on the report, as enlarged nodes were to be expected.  Now, more than two years later, I have recently undergone another CT scan to check for an incisional hernia (came back negative), and the node is not only still enlarged, but has grown noticeably.  As of two months ago, the node was 2.6 cm X 2.9 cm X 2.9 cm in size.  It is too deep for the physician to easily feel.  I wouldn't say it is painful, but is is slightly tender to the touch and occaisionally gives me some discomfort when I sit for long periods of time.  I underwent a fine-needle aspiration which came back negative for cancer cells.  My doctor says that he does not know why the lymph node continues to grow, and suggested a follow-up ultrasound in a few months to see it there is any change.  I have three basic questions:   1) What are the chances of a false-negative result when a fine-needle biopsy is performed?  I am so concerned about this possiblity that I almost wish I had insisted on removal of the entire node for testing.  I was told that they took six samples of tissue during the FNA . . . is that enough to be sure of the results?  2) What are the possible causes for this persistently growing lymph node?  I have no fever, fatigue, etc. (nothing indicative of infection, in other words) and am a generally healthy person.  If it's not resulting from cancer or an infection, what could be causing it?  3) How long should I wait to have a follow-up ultrasound to check for continued growth?  It has been two months since the biposy . . . is it time to have it checked out?  If there has been additional growth, what should the next step be?  I apologize for the lengthy, detailed post, but I do appreciate your time.  I am very concerned about this lymph node, and even more concerned at the delay in diagnosis if there ends up being a problem after all.  I would like some direction as to how to handle this situation and come to a final diagnosis.  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm afraid I'm no expert, but as far as FNA goes the possibilities of six FNA's all giving false negatives seem astronomical. A read around suggests that an FNA test has somewhere between a 5-10% false negative rate. When I had an FNA done and it came back negative, the surgeon told me that in cases of false negatives the result is usually somewhat suspicious or reads as \"inconclusive\". SO I wouldn't over worry on that count.   Also it sounds like the growth of this node is extremely so in which case a month or so's wait wouldn't be too much of a big issue. I'm hoping for the best for you :)  G\n\n",

    "content": "A brief update to my original post: I have been experiencing more and more discomfort from this lymph node when in a sitting position, and I often feel that it is pressing on a nerve running down my leg.  I went to see my surgeon again this week, and we took another look at my CT scans.  I was told for the first time that I have a very large cyst on my left ovary (the lymph node that has been giving me trouble is also on the left side) and the cyst, too, has been growing slowly for years.  This cyst was present, though smaller, on my CT scans from two years ago, and is considerably bigger now.  We decided that to be on the safe side (and because of the pain and discomfort I've been experiencing) that surgery to remove the entire lymph node is the best option at this point.  I'm currently waiting to hear back from my surgeon, as he is conferring with a gynecologist as to the cyst situation.  It seems likely that the cyst will be removed for testing at the same time as the lymph node.  Now, of course, I'm concerned about the possibility of ovarian cancer as well as the lymph node situation, and can't help but wonder if there is some correlation between the two.  Anyone had a similar experience?\n\n",

The only one I go to regularly is the gyn as I had a severe cervical pre-cancer removed by leep about 2 years ago. I am not too worried about these glands as I've been reading the site and they are rather small as they are about a finger tip size.  The only reason I'm even monitoring myself is due to BRCA2 gene in my family - so senses are raised a little with stuff like this.  The main one I've always noticed on my neck feels like a raspberry - as if there are multiple bb sized glands together.  Does that discription make sense?  Nevertheless, I've noticed something for several months - but never paid much attention to it.  This  \"something\"  is half way between my right elbow and wrist - on the bottom of my arm.  Say, if I was writing, it would be touching the table.  It is about the size of a finger tip.  It feels as if I have an eraser from a pencil under my skin.  Does this have any relation to anything - or could it just be a cyst of some sort?  It does not hurt - it is just there.  If I push on it, it just goes in deeper - but can still be felt.  My glands have been swollen for 7 months - since I noticed them.  Yes, they are stil inl two places on my neck, my clavical - which is probably the largest at maybe a full  cm to maybe 1.5, and my groin - which is about a figer tip.  My doctor told me this could be from shaving though.  Also, just to remind - the chest x-ray and all the blood work was negative.  The diagnosis was general lymphadenopathy.  If I need to check with a doc soon, I will - but if I just need to monitor it until I see my \"regular\"  ha ha - doc next month - I'd rather do that.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "A quick search on the internet indicates usually 1cm and smaller for a lymph node is considered normal.   1.5 cm is above normal, but not alarmingly so.   One article I found indicated for non-facial areas larger than 2.5 cm is when doctors should be aggressive to find the cause.  I also found that viral infections, can cause a false positive in a biopsy.  So it is not uncommon to wait a month to see if the lymph node reduces on it's own prior to biopsy.  About two weeks ago, I visited a clinic with a lymph node swollen to 3 cm.   The doctor ordered an ultrasound, and after viewing the results told me it is probably an infection caused by diarrhoea and could take 8-9 weeks to go away on it's own.  He also suggested I follow-up with my family doctor.   My family doctor ordered some blood work and chest X-Ray to make sure I don't have other swollen lymph nodes.  The results came back normal.  The lymph node has continued to grow.  I have another appointment to find out if we need to do a biopsy, more tests, or just wait awhile and see if it starts reducing.\n\n",

    "title": "Correct test to determine cause of armpit lump?",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 36 year old female who has been suffering with an intermittent lump just below or on the bottom edge of my left armpit. It is sort of toward my back but is still in the armpit area. In the past 5 years I have had a diagnostic mammogram, 2 ultrasounds which showed an englarged node of 1.3 cm which reduced to 1.1 cm over 6 months. This node would become inflamed on and off for the next 3 years or so, until now. Most recently, about 5 months ago my dr ordered a CT scan of the left chest with contrast and an MRI of the same area without. Nothing was found. I am happy about that, but I still get this swelling and as of 2 weeks ago I got some kind of infection (a red warm tender circle area developed just above the swollen node). A dermatologist prescribed antibiotics which took care of it I guess (they think it could be a very deep cyst or infected node) however, now the original node is big and swollen again. Is there any test that will be able to rule out cancer or tell exactly what this is?  I have a family history of metastatic breast cancer and want to get this resolved as well b/c we want to have another baby soon.  Not to mention I had a night sweat the other night which freaked me out a bit, but then I had my period so it is probably related to hormones.  Any help or input would be appreciated. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  An ultrasound can usually differentiate an inflamed lymph node from a malignant one quite easily. Certain criteria such as preservation of the lymph node hilum as well as the size, border appearance can hint at whether the lymph node is 'risky' or not.  A small lymph node 1-2cm is usually not suggestive of malignancy. After inflammation many times a lymph node may remain palpable. This is what they call a shotty lymph gland. This may enlarge again whenever there is a new infection / inflammation of course.  The gold standard for ruling out malignancy is of course an excisional biopsy. That is probably not necessary in your case. You should report to your physician anything that concerns you. You can also discuss your risk with him. Risk of breast cancer can be assessed using several methods including the Gail model. Depending on your risk score there are certain prophylactic interventions such as Tamoxifen.   In patients with familial genetic mutations more aggressive options include intensive screening (MRI), prophylactic mastectomies.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: reactive hyperplastic axillary nodes",
    "content": "Hello,  Many things are taken into consideration when evaluating an axillary lymph node especially in a female of your age and with a family history of breast cancer.  The size of the lymph nodes may or may not be suggestive of reactive lymphadenopathy versus a malignant process. The ultrasound findings of the lymph nodes may also be suggestive.   A FNA is not always very accurate in the evaluation of a lymph gland, when used in combination with radiological and clinical findings it may be a little more accurate.   I understand that you have suggested lymphoma because you are concerned that this may be a generalized lymphadenopathy. Many diseases such as systemic infections with a mild virus, and various autoimmune diseases can lead to systemic lymphadenopathy among other things.  Again, depending on the severity of your symptoms and the size of the lymph nodes this could warrant further investigation versus observation.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 45 year old woman.  Three months ago I visited my primary physician with a swollen, painful lymph node under right armpit.  He examined and determined that it was most likely an infection.  Three weeks later he had me in for follow-up and the lymph gland was still swollen but no longer painful.  He decided on a wait and see approach, still staying that it was an infection.  I have recently had a mammogram that was clear.  Over time I became less aware of the gland but the swelling never really receeded.  Three weeks ago the lymph gland became large and hard.  There is no pain but it feels like I am walking around with a baseball in my armpit.    Should I be concerned about this and revisit my physician? Is there it likely that this is caused by an infection?    Thanks - Meg\n\n",

Sometimes a recurrent infection is a warning sign for something serious underlying the infection. More commonly, it just means that the infection has not been adequately dealt with.

    "content": "Hello there I am a 43 year old female well soon to be 44 this month and I am new to this site and actually just signed up this evening.  I Would like some advise on this.  For the past few months I have noticed that the lymph nodes on both sides of my neck have been somewhat swollen and noticeable and heat radiats from my neck as well as the back of my neck is always very itchy although there is no rash there it feels like hte itching is coming from deep within my neck and that is it always feeling like it is on fire.  At night I wake up quite frequently soaked and very sweety I have taken my temperature and it usually runs around 100 to 101 my throat has been sore lately and feels like there is a lump there at all times.  My right ear itches very badly inside and I have used a q-tip but my ears are not dirty or anything.  I have gone to my family doctor and she has checked my ears and everything looks fine inside she has felt my lymph nodes and said she wants to keep an eye on them for now, I also mentioned to her about the back of my neck being itchy and she didn't really say to much on that.  in the past 3 weeks I have lost 14 pounds and I am not dieting mind you I am overweight and love the idea of loosing the weight but when I am not really trying or changing what I eat it worries me.   I am always feeling neauseated(sp) and still try to eat ...my father had passed away when he was only 21 years old with Non-Hodgkins Lymphoma and from what I have heard NHL is not what they call hereditary.  There is cancer that runs in our family both breast colon and brain tumors.  I worry about myself as I had blood work done and my SED rate was at 72 which I think is high and my white count was at 35000 I am at work right now but my results are at home so I may have to send them in a later post if you need more information.  I work the overnight shift and usually when I get home at 7am in the morning I go right to bed and sleep right through until 9pm that night and wake up a few times to use the washroom and that is it...but when I do get up I feel like I have not slept at all and I always have to change the bedding as it is always damp once I get up from me sweeting.  I think I should make another appointment with my family doctor and get her to check me out more or sent me for an MRI or CT scan...also I have now noticed a lump in my armpit it is not sore at all but I am getting alot of pain down through the right side of my neck and my ear pains now not like an ear ache but just feels different and very hot.   Thank you for listening to what I have typed and any adivce would be greatly appreciated and if you need more information from y blood wook let me know and I can post that on here to you.  Sincerely irisheyes2006\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are:  White blood cells: 4,500-10,000 /mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   So, your total leukocyte count and lymhocytes count are higher than normal. In adults, absolute lymphocytosis is defined as an absolute lymphocyte count is greater than 4000/mcl, so you have mild lymphocytosis which can be seen in many conditions of chronic disease like arthritis and in infections. Some medications may also cause lymphocytosis.  However, you have other blood elements elevated too (RBCs, and Plateletes). Although it is a mild elevation, in the presence of symptoms like yours which are concerning, more investigations are needed. There are group of symptoms known as B symptoms commonly but not exclusively seen in patients with lymphoma and chronic blood malignancy. B symptoms include Fever greater than 38\u00b0C, drenching sweats, especially at night, unintentional weight loss of >10% of normal body weight over a period of 6 months or less. The presence of these symptoms, with newly developed lymph node enlargement and CBC changes warrants exclusion of malignancy. Investigations would include CBC, LDH, and ESR. Blood culture may be useful to exclude infections if suspected. Biopsy from a significantly enlarged lymph node, CT scans of chest abdomen and pelvis. Bone marrow aspirate and biopsy as indicated.  A thorough history and direct clinical examination are essential to proper diagnosis. I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I will be so glad when I get back in to see my family doctor and go from there to whatever the next step will be for me.  I know the past few times that I have had blood work done my SED rate has been going up higher and higher each time but my family doctor keeps telling me that the ESR rate doesn't pin point exactally what or where the problem is and that it just means there is something going on within my body.  I would say for the past 2 years my ESR has always been elevated but each time it seems to be going higher..I know the normal range should be between 1-20 roughly and mine has been anywhere from 44 on up to the 80's and I have told my doctor on many visits that I do not feel like myself and that I am always tired and I feel sick to my stomach and have had bad pains in through the mid section of my stomach and the small of my back and she always tells me I must be coming down with the flu or something but this never goes away and there are times that the pain is so severe that it brings me to tears.  I have had bleeding in my  bowels and have had 4 colonscopies and had 6 pre-cancerous polyps removed in one of the colonoscopies and the others were because of the constant bleeding that I have gotten but nothing was found and nothing further has been investigated as to if maybe the bleeding was coming from somewhere else in my body.   I just hope and pray with my next visit she will send me for a CT or MRI or ultrasound or something along with more blood work ups.  Thank you again. Irisheyes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Dr. Safaa Mahmoud:  I have been to my family doctor yesterday and she is sending me for more blood work and has put in a request for me to have a PET scan some of the blood work she wants done is different then from the last round.  She also weighed me and I have lost another 7 pounds so all together I have lost 21 pounds in the past 2 months and this is without trying to loose weight.  I am just so tired all the time and feel so run down like I have been hit by a Mac Truck or something, I know it is not the flu because I do not have any symptoms and the sweats that I have when I am sleeping they wake me up because then I get cold from being so drenched.  I have also noticed allot of bruising on my legs and arms and some on my abdomen and I know I didn't bang myself however I even bruise easy when someone pokes my arm or even just touches me.  My legs and the back of my neck are constantly itchy which drives me crazy because I keep scratching until the area is raw and I have also noticed on the back of my left leg I have a hard spot that gets really itchy and does not ever heal I leave it alone and it doesn't change I showed the doctor and she didn't know what to make of it so she has also sent a referral to a skin specialist.  When she took my temp yesterday it was 40.1 she has also noticed a lymph node in my armpit has grown in size since my last visit and has mentioned a needle aspiration(sp) to do a biopsy.  She hasn't said too much or explained much to me so I am still kind of in limbo.  It just worries me as my father had NHL and passed away at the age of 21.  When I was in the doctors office yesterday and while she was talking to me my nose started bleeding for no apparent reason and she had a hard time stopping it finally it did but thought I would have to go to hospital to have it cauterized(sp)  I just feel like I am falling to pieces.  I am now waiting for the hospital to call me for my date for the PET scan.  Will the PET scan show in datail what is going on inside me and view my lymph nodes as well?    Sorry about going on but I am very concerned at this point. Irisheyes\n\n",

    "title": "Inability to gain weight - post sepsis, Guillan-Barre, NHL",
    "content": "Dear Doctor, I am a 35 year old bloke who was diagnosed with NH lymphoma back in the summer of 1993. I was 20 years of age. I was successfully treated through chemo, bone marrow transplant and light radiation treatment.  A month after my final cancer treatment (July 1994) I experienced a dramatic descent into acute guillan-barre syndrome (August 1994), which drove me into a complete vegetative state for 3 months. I had the tracheostomy, the plasma-feresis, the gamma globulin injections, the works. After the GB (December 1994) I weighed 45 kilos. Before the NH Lymphoma I weighed 63 kilos. In 2000 I was diagnosed with Bronchiectasis, or something similar to it. There is chronic colonization of bacteria and aspergillus in my left lung, which is completely non-functioning. I have daily bouts of phlegm drainage, and recently (Oct-Nov 2008) was hospitalized for pneumonia and sepsis. That is where I am today. My query is: I have a very difficult time putting on weight. I find that no matter how much I gorge myself with fat and protein rich foods I can't seem to get beyond 52-53 kilos. I know my best hope for fending off future infections, which I will be less and less able to fight off if I don't bulk up, is to increase my fat and protein consumption. WHY IS IT SO DIFFICULT? WHAT CAN I DO?  Sincerely a scared Shark\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I hope you're feeling better. You have certainly been through a lot! It takes a lot of strength to be where you are today and survive all that.  Chronic sepsis alone can lead to loss of weight, not to mention all the therapy you are taking. Sepsis whether accompanied by fever or not leads to an increased metabolic rate. If you are at the hospital then I imagine the nutritionist should be able to adjust your calories properly. What we want to avoid is protein catabolism, where the body breaks down protein as a source of energy. However, I strongly urge you not to 'gorge' yourself with protein and fat rich foods in the hope of warding off an infection. Eating an unhealthy diet is the worst thing you can do to yourself.   Have you relayed your concern to your doctor. Have you been tested for malabsorption? Hyperthyroidism? I'm not suggesting that you need these tests, like I said chronic sepsis is a good enough cause.  My best to you!\n\n",

I was contacted and told that this was a lipoma or a fatty tumor.  The surgeon I saw was not real axious about removing it because of its location. He did some type of ultrosaound thing in his office and said there was not any fluid to drain from it. He told me to vist once a year and monitor the size.  It has been a year and a half since I have been and people are starting to notice it. It is pretty big. Is there a chance of lymphoma being misdiagnosed as a lipoma.

    "content": "Hi,  Supraclavicular nodes are always alarming because in some cases they indicate an advanced malignancy of the lungs, breasts or abdominal cavity.  It is very unlikely that they missed a lymph node and mistook it for a lipoma given the amount of attention you received.   Although, removal of a lipoma is not necessary from the pathological sense. The fact that it has grown to become noticeable and the fact that this is disturbing in the cosmetic sense is an indication to get it removed. I think you should contact your surgical oncologist again and tell him that although you are not worried about it turning out malignant you do think it's disfiguring. A cosmetic surgeon can also remove it although it will probably cost you more.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "this all started about 3-4 months ago when after a night of heavy drinking an smoking and my throat felt like it was so dry that it was on fire ( my left one was normal ).  over the next month or month and a half it grew slightly larger (to the size of a grape almost) with a white chalkey substance in it and then all the sudden the tonsil shrunk back down to almost normal size again without any medication (possibly over a few nights spand at most if i remember correctly). afterwards, a couple weeks later (2 months ago about) i felt my right jugular lymph node was swollen. I then went to the doctor a month ago and he prescribed a bunch of medication which did not work. After another hard night of drinking and smoking (4 days ago and yeah im taking this as a sign to stop doing what im doing) my right jugular lymph node is huge (about a the size of a dime) and my left submandilar, the one under your chin if i got it right, is huge as well and new i believe. the jugular node is movable and hard feeling and the submandilar, again if its right, feels very squishy. after my neck nodes swelled up 4 days ago my throat has been aching badly and ive been having this chill feeling in it ( when i say aching i don't man soar throat, i mean like an achin muscle almost ) now i cant imagine that my social habits don't have anything to do with this but what is going on, my CT scan showed swollen lymph nodes, i had a camera down my throat twice, which saw nothing except an agitated voice box (only the first camera show it agitated) but ive never heard of anything ( including my resident brother) that would make my tonsil swell as much as it did and make my nodes swell as much as they are without relieve from it for such an extended time, i mean my doctor even gave me anti inflammatory steroid that did nothing. Is all this most likely 100 PCT of my social habits or is it my social habits irritating something else that needs to be taken care of also?\n\n",

As you know the most common cause of lymph gland enlargement is infection. The fact that you had a throat infection supports this assumption. Again, infections of the throat tend to drain to level II lymph nodes which include the superior jugular lymph node group.  All that said, the fact that it keeps recurring is reason enough to keep tracking it. Follow up with your doctor to rule out anything nasty.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  According to the picture you sent this would be a submandibular gland. This is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.   There are many aspects involved in the assessment of lymph node enlargement. First, whether this is in fact the only lymph node that is enlarged. Your doctor needs to check other lymph node areas to make sure. Also, whether you have any systemic symptoms such as fever, drenching night sweats or weight loss.  Second, certain aspects such as the size of the lymph node, whether it's painful, appears inflamed and the site all give clues as to whether the condition is probably benign.   Usually lymph nodes less than 1cm in diameter are not concerning. Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  The submandibular lymph glands drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. They may also be felt in normal individuals, along with axillary and inguinal lymph glands.  Please have it checked and keep us updated.\n\n",

I would like to know if this can cause pain, on both sides at the crease of thigh,and pelvic?   Pain is more on the right and more painful when he bends over.  This is a constant daily pain and he suffers more when he does different things.  Also this has made him  sick, and sometime he will experience pain that will start on the right side and goes around to his lower back. About once a month he will have blood in his urine, (about three,  the size of rice), for about a day. He also indicated that when he passes urine it will burn.  This might not have any thing to do with the adenopathy, he had a blood clot remove in his bladder through his penis about a year ago and this still burns when he urinates.

    "content": "Hi there -  Inguinal adenopathy, as you've surmised, is inflammation of lymph nodes in the groin. This can be due  to any number of causes, but it is probably related to the bloody urine in this case, simply because of the proximity of the inguinal lymph nodes to the bladder. There may be an infection of the bladder, the nearby lymph nodes, or both. There could be a disease process other than simple adenitis (lympadenitis, inflamed lymph glands). The notation on the report of \"left inguinal adenopathy\" merely means  there is something wrong with the lymph nodes in that area, probobably showing up as enlargement. This can  be painful and is often accompanied by fever and other symptoms. A urologist probably should be consulted, although I would think the doctor who ordered the CT would contact your husband regarding any serious findings and make the appropriate referrals.  Best of luck to you both. I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is probably a lymph node enlargement. Lymph nodes in this area get enlarged when inflammation  or infection occurs in the area drained by them like the scalp,the skin of the neck, and the ear.  Pain and tenderness are commonly seen when the lymph nodes are infected or inflamed. This may be the sole cause (primary) of the node enlargement or in association with another underlying primary cause.  Small lymph nodes <1cm that are mobile, soft to firm are usually reactionary to these inflammatory conditions and are not alarming as they regress when inflammation subsides but do not disappear. While nodes that continue to grow are of concern and need to be investigated properly.  In general physician prescribe antibiotics and follow up in a week or two, if they persist in a considerable size or increase, biopsy is recommended to exclude serious causes like malignancy.  Other causes of swelling in this area is follicles, an inflammation in the hair follicles, or lipoma (benign tumor of fat tissue).  I would advise you to seek direct medical consultation.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection), lymphoma, and pelvic malignancy.  In general, inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal. Pain is an indication for the presence of infection (inflammatory changes. This could be the primary cause of the lymph node enlargement or in association with an underlying another cause of lymph node enlargement. Exclusion of malignancy is essential based on the description you provided for these swellings.   The best way to recognize the nature of these swelling is by biopsy. Physicians usually prescribe antibiotics to minimize any associated infection while waiting for the results. CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis may be needed when suspecting diseases that cause generalized lymph node enlargement like lymphoma, some infectious diseases, immune responses or storage diseases.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Hope you find this information useful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I suspect these are enlarged lymph nodes.  The lymph system works constantly to keep infection at bay by producing lymphocytes and monocytes.  It also absorbs and moves fatty acids to the circulatory system, and it removes interstitial fluids from the tissues.  These nodes are numerous in the arm pit and some variation such as you describe can be normal.    I'm glad you have consulted with your doctor because it is always good to keep an eye on changes that occur in your body.  It also gives a baseline for noticeable changes that may occur.  If you have pain or show signs of infection, fever, etc. you should let your doctor know.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I also advise you to observe it carefully and to inform your doctor once they become, more swollen,  painful, tender, hot, or red. These are signs of inflammation that mandate antibiotic therapy.  The fact that these nodes are bilateral and have an intermittent course makes it less likely to be a cancer. If you  are lactating, inflammatory cause is a strong possibility as well.  However, direct clinical examination is essential to better characterize this mass and to determine the need for further investigations.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with any change in this swelling or in the breast.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Chemotherapy-induced neutropenia (<1500 cells per mm3 ) typically occurs 3\u20137 days following administration of chemotherapy. Neutrophil levels return to normal few days before the expected day of the next cycle.   There are different grades (I-IV) of neutropenia. Grade III (<1000 cells per mm3) and IV (<500 cells per mm3) increase the risk of life-threatening infection and/or delay in subsequent cycles. You have very low level of neutrophils that makes you at increase risk of serious infections.   Although infection usually presents with fever and other constitutional symptoms, local pain and/or tenderness are sometimes the sole presenting symptoms. Lower backache is a non specific symptom but is carefully addressed in all neutropenic patients to rule out disease or treatment related serious causes.   Complete history taking, clinical examination are essential to guide further management. I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him quickly with any symptom especially during this neutropenic period.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I went to my PCP on 08/05 for what seems to be a swolen lymph node in the crease between my peg and pelvis...menstrual irregularity, blood tinged vaginal discharge varying from mucous to thick and white to clear, leg discomfort, pelvic pain, and lesions that have appeared and have spread all around the outside of my vagina opening and up to the clitoris.  I had a blueish \"dot\" seven years ago when I had my son.  My OB asked if I had always had it, I didn't know.  Within the past year I have noticed it has been spreading. I have read the A,B,C,D rule...The colors are blue, brown, and almost black in some areas...borders are irregular...etc.  I have been sexually active with my husband for 7 years since my son was born -without any birth control, and no pregnancies.  My PCP on 08/05 gave me a referal to an Oncologist for biopsies. As of today, my appointment is not until Oct. 1st...which will be 2 months after the initial visit.  Since the PCP visit: Platelets are up to 575 which are higher than they were when I had surgery for a surgery in June. White cells are also a little higher than normal. I have a referal to a Hematologist whom I will see next week.   I have also had a pelvic ultrasound done last week which they found bilateral ovarian cysts.  I have been told they look to be functional and small.  My PCP asked me if I had had Melanoma before when she saw the lesions at the 08/05 appt. Of course I said \"No\".  She also ordered the Pelvic ultrasound because she felt my uterus was enlarged.  Why would my Uterus feel enlarged if I have just 2 small functional cysts?  I guess I am wondering what steps I need to take in order to get someone to listen to me.  I am extremely fatigued, have chronic diarrhea, abdominal bloating, chronic leg pressure and leg pain, and ...I have a 7 year old son.    It seems like none of my doctors are talking.  I have to reiterate everything and \"convince\" each one that I do NOT feel well.  Everyone of them is making me feel like I am a hypocondriac, but I really FEEL that there is something wrong with me.  Is there something I can do to expediate this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mucosal Melanoma?",
    "content": "Hello,  Melanoma is a cancer that develops from pigment producing cells that gives the skin (including the vulva) its color. Melanoma of the vulva although is the second most common invasive cancer occurring in the vulva, its occurrence is rare.   Pigmented lesions on the vulva are considered suspicious if they are blue-black in color, have an irregular border or are larger than 1 cm. Changes in characters of an existing mole is considered suspicious too. Melanoma of the vulva is almost always presents with inguinal lymph node metastases. The only way for diagnosis is by biopsy and pathological examination.   Symptoms of irregular vaginal bleeding, discharge, pelvic pain in addition to the US results of ovarian cysts and endometrial thinking could be related to Polycystic Ovary Syndrome PCOS.   PCOS- is a condition in which females may present with: -Irregular menstrual cycle, irregular vaginal bleeding, infertility and uterine wall changes up to cancer. -Excess hormones including insulin production and insulin resistance resulting in type2 diabetes mellitus and abnormal skin pigmentation.  -Excess male hormone (testosterone and androgen) results in (obesity), acne, oily skin, or dandruff and hair loss. -High blood pressure. Although skin pigmentation in these cases occurs in different part of the body, the vulva could be part of it.  Another cause that gives similar clinical picture is endometriosis.  Endometriosis is an often painful disorder of the female reproductive system.  In endometriosis, a specialized type of tissue that normally lines the inside of your uterus (the endometrium) becomes implanted outside your uterus, most commonly on your fallopian tubes, ovaries or the tissue lining your pelvis. It causes: -Painful periods (dysmenorrhea).  -Excessive bleeding. -Pelvic pain. -Infertility.  Endometriosis of the vulva although confusing with other lesions like nevus, melanoma, hemangiomas, it can be easily diagnosed on histology. The condition is also painful and is though to be caused by direct implantation of endometrial tissue after trauma including delivery.  Another cause of pigmented lesions in the vulva is acanthosis nigrans although rare. Areas of chronic inflammation are more prone to be involved with pigmentation in this condition. Pigmentation in the vulva increases after pregnancy due to higher tendency to inflammation in this area. This is a condition that can be benign or associated with malignancy else where in the body.  The results of your blood test are not so clear for me, however platelets mildly increase in number in individuals who frequently lose blood like excess vaginal bleeding (meno/metrorrhagia).  I agree with your physician that biopsy is essential to exclude melanoma even if other causes seems to be also possible. In general all pigmented lesions in the vulva should be biopsied.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "In December I went to my regular gyno appointment and mentioned a non-tender yet movable lump that was in my left groin that was smaller than a pea.  He said that if it didn't go away in a few weeks he would put me on antibiotics.  After 5 weeks he started me on Cipro, yet the lump did not go away (to me it felt a bit smaller, but was still there).  After the Cipro I returned to my Dr. and he felt the area saying he felt quite a few small lumps on both sides of groin.  He had some vaginal cultures performed (most which came back negative, other results pending) and he scheduled me for a pelvic MRI to look at \"clustered lymph nodes\".  I should get the MRI results in a couple of days.  I asked him directly if he thought this could be cancer and his response was no he did not think so, since I had small lumps that were bilateral.  Despite his response I am still VERY worried about lymphoma.  I am a 31 year old African American with no history of cancer.  I'm also very worried because it is hard to find information on out there on the incidence of this amongst young African American women.  So I'm not sure what to think.  How common is this to be non-hodkin's lymphoma in someone like me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to the information you provided, these are small painless mobile bilaterally enlarged inguinal lymph nodes that did not or minimally regressed on antibiotics. Although they sound to be non specific inguinal nodes of no serious etiology, I assume that your doctor found them of concern on clinical examination.  Inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more laterally). They drain the vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal and lower extremities.   Infection or inflammation in these parts result in inguinal lymph node enlargement. During acute conditions, nodes are swollen and painful. Following recovery (usually with adequate antibiotic course) they regress in size but never disappear.  Thus nodes that regress are reassuring and those continue to grow are of concern. This lymph node group are generally considered abnormal when larger than 1.5 cm.  Most physician exclude first infectious causes by cultures and empiric antibiotic course. If no adequate response is achieved in 7-15 days other causes should be looked for. Other causes to be excluded include lymphoma and pelvic malignancies.  Complete history and physical examination are essential to define probable causes and required investigations.   Please follow up with your doctor and keep us updates. Best regards.\n\n",

I have the plasma cell variant of castleman's disease (CD).  I recieved 8 rituxan treatments from 12/04-2/05 and then surgery in 5/05 to remove the effected lymph nodes.  Prior to my diagnosis, I received 8 infusions of ferlecit for anemia of which I've had no problems since.  I've experienced CD type symptoms off and on since my treatment/surgery but the drs say that it's not CD related because my scans show no evidence of tumors.  I've recently began having difficulty with feeling full after only eating small amounts and actually have to lean back to be comfortable or to breathe normally.  I haven't seen my dr but did have lab work about two weeks ago.  My sed rate was normal but my CRP was 14.2 and my white blood cell count was 3,400 (normal for this lab is 5,000-10,000).  My PCP suggested I contact my oncologist. I do have an appt with my onc. the end of March.    My question is even though my wbc isn't that low, could my bout with multiple \"bugs\" over the past couple of months be related?  I've been ill for the past 4 days with a temp between 100-102, chills, sweats, aches, etc.  And, should I be proactive with a sense of urgency in light of my symptoms and test results or just be patient and wait for my end of march appt?

    "title": "Re: Castleman's Disease",
    "content": "Hello,  Castleman's disease, is a benign lymphoproliferative disorder (lymphatic tissue growth in any part throughout the body).   Castleman\u2019s disease can be classified as a) unicentric vs. multicentric, based on clinical and radiological results, b) hyaline vascular vs. plasmacytic vs. mixed cellularity variety based on histopathology  and c) as HIV negative versus HIV positive based on the HIV status of the patient. All three factors are taken into consideration in the management of patients.   Unicentric Castleman\u2019s Disease usually presents as a slow growing solitary mass (LN in mediastinium or mesenteries). The disease is not associated with constitutional symptoms or elevation of acute phase reactants (ESR and CRP). Prognosis is excellent and cure is achieved n 90-95% cases with surgical resection.  To the contrary, multicentric Castleman\u2019s Disease is associated with \u201cB\u201d symptoms (fever, night sweats, weight loss and fatigue) and elevated acute phase reactants.  It requires systemic therapy and progression to lymphoma is not uncommon.  A plasma cell type of Castleman's Disease is characterized by the presence of sheets of plasma cells of plasma cells in the interfollicular spaces. This disease variant commonly presents as multicenteric.  Sometimes steroids and/or rituxan are given before surgery to shrink bulky or inoperable disease. For all cases of localized disease cure is the primary goal and disease progression is quite rare.  Considering your strong family history, your symptoms are concerning and should be properly investigated to exclude disease relapse and progression.   As your doctor advised, consultation of an oncologist is essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You have mentioned that you have been in remission for a year now and the new CT scan showed a lymph node of 1cm. Additional information about the CT scan results after ending chemotherapy one year ago as well as the CT Scan results at presentation will be appreciated.   Remission is defined as complete remission if of all evidence of disease disappeared (regression to normal size on CT) while partial remission is defined as >50% regression in the size of the involved lymph nodes.  Till recently, it was not possible to define whether the residual nodes represent fibrosis or an active disease except by biopsy. PET Scan is utilized now to determine whether this residual is fibrotic mass or possibly an active disease that needs confirmation by biopsy and further treatment.  If these nodes detected by your last CT Scan were PET negative only observation is needed. If these nodes are positive for active disease by biopsy then further therapy is recommended.  If PET is not available, then decision will be taken based on many factors that include the comparative study for CT Scans during and after therapy, the initial stage and other prognostic factors. Occasionally, persistent stable abdominal masses or palpable nodal masses may also occur and only close follow-up is recommended.  Radiotherapy IFRT is recommended to consolidate residual mass after chemotherapy completion in certain areas of the body (e.g. mediastinum) while second line therapy is given if the biopsy is proved to be positive for active disease. Patients who are at high risk of repalse are offered HDT/ASCR.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with the results of the new Scan. Please keep us updated.

    "title": "Re: small hard lump on cheek",
    "content": "Hello, The swelling you have described is probably an enlarged Lymph node LN (probably a preauricular LN) and those felt in your neck are probably enlarged cervical nodes. Nodes larger than 1 cm are considered abnormal and should be approached properly. Being of the same size for a long time is reassuring and makes their benign nature more likely.  Lymph node enlargement usually occurs following infection or inflammation in the area drained by this lymph node group which in your case include the ear, the teeth, the gum and the throat. They regress in size but never disappear when infection or inflammation subsides thus remain palpable, painless, rubbery to firm in consistency and usually less than 1.5 cm in size.  Other causes to be excluded include benign diseases and malignant conditions.  A thorough clinical examination of all lymph node groups in the body in addition to compete history are essential for better characterization of these lymph nodes and determining the need for further investigations.   Please follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 26 year old female/mother of 2 girls. On July 31, 2008 I was taken to the local ER for abdominal pain and a lump in my groin that I found. I found out that I have a hernia, and after having a pelvic exam and culture done, I found out that I had a bacterial infection. I was on the NuvaRing as birth control, which made me gain some weight. I was prescribed Flagyl 500mg twice a day. After I finished the antibiotic, it seems that my lymph node swelled. I don't know the exact name of it. It is located on my left side close to the groin area, above the crease of the leg. I think it might have to do with the infection I had. I'm going back to the doctor to make sure the infection is gone. It doesn't hurt, it goes down in size if I'm up and walking around. Once I sit for long periods of time or when I wake up, since I do sleep on my left side, is when it feels the most swollen. I honestly don't know how to measure it, I don't know what it means when people say it's mobile. If I touch it, you can push in on it and it moves from side to side with my finger. Could this be due to the infection? My mother and father both passed away from cancer, and I just recently lost my aunt to cancer. I am so worried about this because I have kids. It is a very scary thing. My CBC showed my WBC at 13.6 and my Lymph % at 22%, the ER doctor said this was due to the infection. Do I have anything to worry about?  Thank you\n\n",

She said that the lymph node was of normal size and that she didn't see any infection left.   I'm sorry if you misunderstood what I said. I have read that your lymph nodes should be mobile. What that means, I'm not sure. I just know that it is not rock hard and it is not fixed in place. It has gone down tremendously. At the time, it felt swollen when I first woke up or when I was sitting for long periods of time. It may have not been swollen at all.  Thank again\n\n",

It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the pathology of this swelling and or the lymph nodes.   Lymph node metastasis is not uncommon and occurs in about 25% of parotid cancer patients at diagnosis however the level of lymph node involvement is not typical to primary parotid tumors.  Proper pathologic evaluation is very essential to exclude lymphoma or melanoma as a primary tumor with parotid and lymph node metastases. Prognosis is completely different according to the pathology.  It would be also more helpful if you can inform us about any other Scans done for the rest of the body and the treatment plan decided by his doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

About 2 months ago I noticed a swollen node in my neck below the jawline on the right side only, I didnt think much of it at the time. I have felt off and on sick and just not feeling right for a while now and then about 3 weeks ago I noticed an enlarged node in my groin area (Bikini line)  on the right side also.Well it felt pretty large so I went to the doctor last week and he was concered with the neck and groin nodes and told me he felt the large groin nodes were several smaller swollen nodes that had connected together. He sent me in for blood work and a chest x-ray and said if those did not tell him anything that he would set me up to have them biopsy them. My question is what are the reasons for matted nodes and are they  more commenly cancer or something else. He seemed quite concered with my symptoms of weightloss and hot flashes but am not sure what to exspect or make of the situation. I would appreciate any comments or info and or advice on my situation, My husband is deployed at the moment and is concered as well. Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are smaller than 1 cm in diameter; however, for inguinal nodes, those larger than 1.5 cm are generally considered abnormal. When these nodes are felt connected as one unit are named matted.  As for any lymph node enlargement, matted nodes can also be due to benign (e.g.post-infection, granulomas etc) or malignant cause (e.g.lymphoma).   Complete history and thorough physical examination represent the primary step that suggests possible causes and investigations accordingly. Generalized lymphadenopathy is approached differently from localized ones.   The fact that you also have constitutional symptoms especially the recent weight loss made your doctor concerned about the nature of these nodes. I assume that he also found clinically suggestive or unexplained features that mandate further investigations otherwise he would considered only follow up.   I agree with him to further investigate your condition for proper diagnosis and management. Please follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

One of the known undesired effects of steroid intake is fat redistribution and deposition in certain parts of the body like the supracalvicular area. Since she has been on steroids for long period makes this possibility very high. This is supported by the fact that she suffered from other forms of steroid side effects.  It is true that it occurs in a lymph node region however the characters you have described are not typical for a lymph node enlargement.  Thorough clinical examination of all lymph node regions is essential, so I advise you to follow up with her Doctor. Further investigations that may be recommended by her physician include neck US or CT Scan.  I hope this information is useful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am currently taking Fortamet ER (metformin) 500 mg twice a day and a daily dose of vitamin D of 1000 ius recommend by my endroconoligist as my blood test showed low in vitamin D.

    "content": "Hi, I am a 38 year old white male. I have never smoked (although my mother did) and don't really drink. I am + 20 lbs over my target weight but am active.  About a month ago I developed a pain in my upper abdomen just below my rib cage. After this did not go away for a couple of days I went to my doctor and she also discovered that I had some swollen lymph nodes, some white spots on my throat (which was NOT sore), and a low grade fever (~100). I was feeling good enough not to have even noticed those. She told me that the pain was from a swollen spleen but that my stomach seemed fine. (No pain there during examination)  Even though I had mono at 18 she said she thought it was mono and ordered blood tests and told me to take it easy. Also ordered a ultrasound to check for gallstones.   I went home rested and began to feel better.   Well about 8 days ago the \"stitch\" in my side came back, not as bad as before but definitely there. I also can now easily appreciate at least one hard (yet painless) swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck. What makes it worse is that about 4 days ago my night time thermostat went nuts. I don't have the classic symptoms of what I read are \"night sweats\" as I am not \"drenched\" but I don't have a fever, yet am \"hot\" in a cool room without excessive bed covers or clothes. Not drenched in sweat but lightly sweaty and hot enough to be unable to sleep. (Hence why I am writing this at nearly 5AM)  After reading up on the net a bit (I had two premature children, 2 years apart, so I know about the good and the bad of information on the net) it seems that the best fit for the symptoms are lymphoma's.  Frankly, at this point I am really getting scared. I am planning on going to my doctors tomorrow and just wanted anybody here's thoughts on what is going on and what to ask / say to make sure I get the right tests.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  They symptoms you describe are equally applicable to mono and lymphoma. However, since you have a history of past mono you could definitely be having a recurrence, even though these are relatively rare. Epstein-Barr viral infections can lay dormant for decades, and this is statisically the more likely cause of what's happening now. Regardless, you of course should have all the appropriate tests, starting with a mono-spot blood test, which could settle things right off. If that's negative it still doesn't mean you have lymphoma, but that would then need to be ruled out/in and the appropriate action taken.   The white spots in your throat cause me to lean heavily toward E-B virus/mono recurrence, as this is fairly typical for that.   Please do follow up with us once you've been re-evaluated by your doctor. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Here is an update.  Mono tests were negative. So I had a abdominal CT and multiple blood work-ups checking basic blood chemistry and liver, pancreas, and kidney functions.  Also a check of urine and stool for blood.  All of the tests and the scan were normal. So at least, for right now, I have been told that it does not look like any of the \"big nasty\" forms/types of cancer. I am VERY relived for that.  However, I still have symptoms. The \"night sweat\" like symptoms have gone (hurray) but I still have upper abdominal pain and occasionally (2 x week) have light bouts of nausea.  So it has gone from very scary to quite frustrating. I have a GI followup in about 2 weeks (around end of Sept 2008). I assume they are going to be looking for ulcer and will order endoscopy of stomach and probably colonoscopy.   At this point I am happy to do the tests if it leads to an explanation. I am not in terrible pain, but I am quite uncomfortable and really want to know what is going on with me.  Any advice or thoughts that I should be asking the GI would be GREATLY appreciated.  Thanks so much. --\n\n",

    "content": "Well great news about the blood work! Now that the Big Nasties have been ruled out (and the night sweats have stopped) hopefully you can relax a little. Still, there is something going on that needs addressing so you can resume your full enjoyment of life. The GI workup makes sense, since what you are now left with are potential ulcer or gastritis symptoms. The only thing I can think of you might want to mention to the gastroenterologist isn't so much a question as to be sure he/she understands how this all started and what symptoms it began with, which were apparently leading in the wrong direction. Keeping those in mind could well help a doctor connect the not-so-obvious dots.   Best of luck to you with this, and we'll be looking forward to an update.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lindsey  -  While the bump is probably a gland (they so often are except when found on the scalp), it is unlikely you have lymphoma. There are no other symptoms to suggest this. While it is not imossible it is very unlikely. The lump, if it is a gland, could be related to the psoriasis, or it could be that it's a cyst, which is a more common cause of these kinds of lumps and bumps. Have a doctor check it next time you're in the office, but unless other symptoms develop or the lump grows in size I'd leave it alone for now. (And just FYI, lymphoma is usually discovered after having been present for some time, because usually it affects the armpit glands earliest, and these are often missed due to being partially hidden by body fat).   Hope this is helpful to you. Please do follow up with any additional questions, thoughts, ect. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have an enlarged lymp node in the left a little back side of my neck. It is smaller than one cm as my doctor told me. She asked for a blood test. and everything seemed normal except for a little high platelet and a little low ALP. My hemogram results, sedimentation level are normal. My doctor told me that it is nothing to worry about and that no need to go for other controls. However the enlarged lymph did not get normal after a month. I am very much worried that it might be due to lymphoma or leukemia. Is it possible that I have those diseases though I have the blood test below? I do not have any family history of those diseases, I do not have other symptoms either. I have a strange feeling like a twitching that happens in my legs nearly everyday generally at nights. Should I ignore the enlarged lymph node? What do you suggest me to do?

    "title": "Re: What to do with an Enlarged Lymph Node?",
    "content": "Hello -  An enlarged lymph node can often be the sequel to a localized infection or even a systemic one. They almost always turn up with mononucleosis/EBV,  and sometimes become  cystic and stay like a little knot or bump for months. So long as your doctor isn't concerned (and your labs are normal  enough), I would just try and forget about it and just check in another month or so. Oh, and your labs pretty much rule out leukemia. Lymphoma would manifest differently than this,  so that's probably a no also, especially since your doctor would hardly be likely to miss it were it present.   I  think what you have is a very slightly enlarged lymph node in your neck, which is a pretty common finding without  anything serious going on.   The strange twitching in your legs, however, could be restless legg syndrome  (RLS), totally unrelated to the lymph node, but now treatable if it bothers you enough to disturb your sleep. If it doesn't, then I'd leave that  alone as well.  Good luck to you and I hope this eases your mind somewhat.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there i have posted on here before with regards to generalised lymphadenothopy.    my nodes are swollen under jaw under chin uner arms collar bone neck groin on both sides with the right hand side ones being bigger as i have had those longer.  more recently i got 2 more in my throat one sticks out enough to look like a males adams apple and 1 more lump/node on my back just above my tailbone level with my hips, not sure what this one is but it feels like the others quite rubbery.  although i have a few nodes that are hard firm and immobile,  none of them hurt or ever decrease in size, they just slowly get bigger over time. i was wondering if we have nodes in our back? and also what reactive lymph nodes are? and what the treatment is if any? what causes this and what are the symptoms? i am awaiting results from a core biopsy from one of my axillar nodes,  will update when i know. any information would be very helpful as i can't seem to find much about reactives nodes on the net, in humans anyway. all my bloods came back clear for infections and bugs not sure if i was checked for diseases as my Dr thought it was a virus at first. many thanks in advance Geebop\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am alarmed at the binge drinking.  This is definitely detrimental to your health.  It may not be the cause of the sweating but it certainly will take its toll on other systems of your body.  Please stop this destructive behavior.  If the sweats are related, discontinuation should be the acid test.  I don't have enough information to suggest anything else.  If you are female, there is the possibility of hormonal fluctuation, even perimenopause.  Night sweats can also be associated with serious infection such as TB.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Geebop1,  I would recommend you see your doctor about these lymph nodes.  I'm less likely to think that this is cancer given how slowly this is progressing; however, this does not rule it out.  You are correct that the best way to find out why the lymph nodes are swollen is via a lymph node biopsy.  This is actually quite a simple procedure.  Often, a small biopsy needle (one that allows part to be removed with it) is inserted into an enlarged node and removed, bringing a piece of the node with it.  The area is numbed so it is basically a painless procedure.  The risks are fairly minimal.  Your doctor can go through the specifics of how they do the procedure and the risks so you will be fully informed to make a decision about this.  Having a biopsy may be quite helpful for you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As for my voice being hoarse and difficulty swallowing they assume it is something called globus pharyngeas? again no info or treatment.  like yourself i too get asked if i have a sore throat or cold so i know its not all in my head lol.  i can live with most of my lumps if i can hide them but the ones at the front of my throat are visible and my family have noticed them too,  i keep joking that i am turning into a man with my new adams apple and deepening voice lol but it is a genuine concern,  and really not a laughing matter. enough is enough though now and a few answers wouldn't go a miss, but no one seems to know. what are reactive lymph nodes? how are they treated? what is a lymph node specialist called?  good luck in your quest to find out whats wrong i hope you get better listened to and treament than what i have or have not recieved lol best wishes and kind regards Geebop\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 36 y.o. female with an enlarged lymph node in my left axillary region. I had breast augmentation February 2007 and just prior to that, a baseline mammogram was normal. September 2007 I found the swollen node and immediately had a mammogram and ultrasound. The lump was not visible on the mammogram but was described on the ultrasound report as: Left axillary examination reveals only a tubular fluid filled structure measuring about 2 cm long and .3 cm wide. Right at the junction of the skin with the underlying deep axillary tissue. (they noted it to be likely benign, which made me happy at the time). They suggested follow up if it didn't resolve. Febuary 2008 it still had not changed at all, so I had a follow up ultrasound. Results said : ultrasound directed to the patient's area of lump in left axillary region demonstrated a well-defined lymph node measuring approx 1.5 x .6 x 1.0 cm with a hypoechoic periphery and lucent center and hila present in a reniform appearance. Impression: left axillary region lymph node in the area of palpable abnormality. I don't know what all those terms are, but when my dr got the report he referred me to an oncology surgeon for a biopsy. I am very scared, and hoping there is a chance this could be something other than breast cancer or lymphoma? Just a glimmer of hope would get me through to my appointment next week. I haven't had any hopeful encouragement from my dr.'s staff and he hasn't been available to discuss this with me.  I quit smoking in September 2007, also found the lump in September 2007, have history of hypothyroidism (.5mg synthroid daily), 3 - 6 cups coffee daily, and run 3 miles about 3 times weekly. Had cryosurgery a couple of years back for precancerous cells on cervix.  My question: even though the lump is painless and has not changed since September, could there be another explanation other than cancer? Just need some hope while I await my consult with the oncology surgeon, but want to hear the truth, too.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Worriedflmom,  When lymph nodes continue to be enlarged, particularly the axillary lymph nodes.  Doing a biopsy will give much needed information about this.  While cancer is unfortunately a possibility that must be evaluated for there certainly are other possible causes of this enlarged lymph node.  These include a subacute infection of the lymph node or some other cause of inflammation in the area.  While waiting for the biopsy results try to stay positive.  Keep in mind that even if this is cancer, we are getting better and better at treating cancer and the success rates are climbing constantly so a diagnosis of cancer is not necessarily a life ending diagnosis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I had my appointment with the doctor today, and he spent a total of about 5 minutes with me. He said he thought it would be ok to make an appointment to follow up in 4 months and see if we should biopsy it at that time. I wasn't really sure what to say, because I was so relieved that he didn't say the signs point to cancer (of course he didn't ask me any questions really so I don't know how he could draw any conclusions to that end anyway). He left it in my hands and said if I really wanted to have it removed and biopsied, we could do it now, or he thought otherwise to follow-up in 4 months. The thing is, my doctor is the one who thought I should have it biopsied, I didn't even know there was a problem with the follow up ultrasound. So it was a little unnerving to have the ball placed in my court today, as if I was the one who had asked for the appointment. I am not sure whether to just be grateful he didn't sit me down and tell me I probably had cancer, or whether to get a second opinion because he didn't ask me any questions, barely examined me at all. I had to fill out the 2 page medical history form while I was waiting for him, he never even glanced at it to discuss anything on it. Is that normal? I wonder if I should just wait 4 months or get a second opinion now. I am relieved but not totally satisfied that I should wait 4 months.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 year old male and I've had painless swollen axillary lymph nodes for the last two weeks.  I visited the physician a week ago. During the examination, he could not feel the nodes themselves and did not note any distinct swollen masses, but agreed the region appeared \"full\".  I had a CBC test run, but the results were all normal.  I have not had any other symptoms such as fatigue, itchiness, night sweats, or weight loss.  The physician prescribed Amoxicillin, which I have been taking for a week, with no noted effect.  In the last week, I noticed that region around my spleen appears to be slightly swollen, but not painful.  During the last week, I also noticed that the axillary node swelling is diminished, but not gone.  At times, I have noticed slight muscle pains around my arms, armpits, and back.  I was wondering if it is common for lymph node swelling to diminish with lymphoma, or if it is more indicative of an infection or  mononucleosis.  Any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am a 31 yr old woman.  I noticed a lump on the back right hand side of my neck about 6 weeks ago.  My GP sent me for an ultrasound and this confirmed it was a swollen lymph node, and that there was also another swollen node on the left hand side.  I then had a blood test which came back as normal.  However, a couple of days later I noticed a pronouned bump on the back of my scalp and went back to my GP again.  He said it was eczema or psoriasis rash and this probably caused the swollen nodes.  He gave me a cream and antibiotics.  However, I'm concerned because the rash came on weeks after the I first noticed the swollen node so I don't understand how it could have been the cause.  Should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Slsmith,  There are several possibilities.  First, the rash may actually have been a local skin infection or the effects of a virus.  Infections commonly cause lymph node swelling early in their course and have other symptoms that develop later, such as rashes.  The other possibility is that you had some cause of inflammation, such as viral infection, that caused the lymph node to spread and subsequently also triggered the rash to develop (i.e. the rash itself is not an infection but came about because the body was stressed).  Lymph nodes can often be the clue that something is going on because they become swollen quite easily.  The swelling may proceed the event and continue beyond when the cause has resolved.  If your rash is getting better I think you have little to worry about.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "hard cervical lymph nodes increasing in number- suggestions?",
    "content": "I have had a firm painless lump in my neck for several years now. I'm not concerned about this one, but over the last couple of months I have noticed new lumps in the same area. They are on the left side of my neck - 2 or 3 hard lumps in what I believe are called the posterior lateral cervical lymph nodes and one stony hard lump about 1 to 1.5cm in size in the internal jugular nodes. It's difficult to tell what size it is, so this is just my best guess. I can sometimes feel what seems like another lump in the left supraclavicular area, but it's very difficult to feel anything in there so I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid about that one. I have seen my GP who seemed concerned about them and has referred me to an ENT specialist - I don't know how long I will have to wait for an appointment...  I have also been having trouble with my stomach; I am having odd pains in just one spot - about 1 to 1.5 inches above my belly-button and in the mid line. This has been pretty constant for the last couple of months, although it seems to come and go throughout the course of the day. It gets worse when I eat or drink alcohol and I often feel quite sick. I mention this because they have occured at the same time and my GP did wonder if they might be related. She has also arranged for me to have an ultrasound of my stomach. I am posting here in the hope that someone will be able to give me their best guess on what this might be, or what the signs and symptoms seem to suggest. I am not expecting a diagnosis over the internet, I would just like to have the opinion/guess of someone slightly better qualified than a Google search! :)  I know the specialists I am going to see will have a much better idea of what this is, but the waiting is very difficult, especially with Google at my fingertips...  I hope someone can reply soon with some possible suggestions.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lana,  With the internet so readily available it can be difficult to tell what is good information and what is not, as I'm sure you've discovered.  I'm sure you've discovered that if you search for swollen lymph nodes one of the first things that comes up is cancer.  While this is true, it is actually a bit lower on the list of things to think of first.    The posterior cervical lymph node chain of nodes will commonly become swollen some during viral infections.  This is generally the most common cause of enlarged lymph nodes.  A viral infection can also cause some gastritis that may be the source of your stomach pain.  It is a good idea to continue to follow up with your specialist appointments to get a full evaluation.  If there is concern about the nodes, a biopsy can be done (a very simple procedure) to find out for sure what is going on in the lymph nodes.  Seeing a GI specialist may be helpful if your stomach pain continues.    My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on swollen lymph nodes that you may find helpful.  It can be found here.  I hope this helps some.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But just today i was feeling for the supraclavicular lymph nodes, and i found something that seems to be somewhat flat and mobile ATTACHED to the top side my clavicle (kinda like a vein but a little firmer). it does not feel round like the one in my neck, but kinda flat and rubbery. I felt about a fingers width above the clavicle and didnt feel anything else.  Are the lymph nodes attached to the clavicle, or are they mainly away from it closer to the shoulder?   Thanks for any advise you might have\n\n",

    "content": "Hi InThe10s,  There is a chain of lymph nodes that runs basically the entire length of the clavicle, just above it, called the supraclavicular lymph node chain.  It is found on both sides.  What you are feeling may very well be a supraclavicular lymph node.  If it remains mobile and not enlarging it is likely simply a normal lymph node that is a bit scarred causing it to be large enough to feel.  If it begins getting bigger or become immobile you should have it evaluated.  You may also be feeling an are of calcification under the skin from the accident.  If, by chance, there was some bleeding in the area causing a small blood clot under the skin it may have subsequently calcified.  I would suggest you have your doctor take a look at this the next time you are in just to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I really don't know if I should post here, in the oncology forum, or in the breast cancer forum, but I am at my wits end and am very, very frightened and frustrated.  I would so appreciate any information or advice anyone could possibly provide.  My story as briefly as I can manage beginning with symptoms:  7 weeks ago  -  woke to piercing, localized, left-sided breast pain 1\" to left side of nipple.   \"Bull's eye\" type pain.  Centrally located severe burning that radiated outwards from site.  Happened upon waking, touch, sudden movement, and area \"ached\" throughout day as though a piece of metal was lodged beneath the tissue. Also had noticable left breast enlargement, nipple seemed to have dropped 1/4-1/2\" from  original location.  No redness, lump, warmth or nipple inversion. Subsequent Mammogram & Ultrasound are normal.   6 weeks ago - left shoulder began hurting and left arm became heavy due to edema.  Also felt like I had a knot or a stone under my arm. Mild left supraclavicular edema also present.  A bruised area appears near the site of breast pain about size of a nickle.  I also experience piercing, centrally located chest pain lasting 15 minutes and intermittent, constricting-type pain below the left breast.  5 weeks ago - a few more bruises near site of pain, doctor informs me these bruises are enlarged capillaries. Left Supraclavicular edema more pronounced.  Also suffered bouts of drenching night sweats.  Chest X-ray resulted in a CT scan of lungs.  A 5mm nodule in upper right lobe detected, a 3 mo. follow-up scan recommended.  Doctor thinks nodule is scar tissue. CBC-normal other than mildly increased hematocrit and hemoglobin.   4 weeks ago - began to itch all over, sometimes intense, sometimes mild.  Developed a small scattering of tiny pimples on underside of left breast.  A bright red spot, with a yellow-pus filled center.  This itches intensely, then pops and crusts over and redness goes away.   Blue veins more prominent on breast and left arm.  3 weeks ago  - Right breast began to ache just a little bit and itchy pimples appeared on it as well, only 2.  More patches of enlarged capillaries present now on both breasts -- look as though my breasts have been beaten up. Itchy pimples also appearing in small numbers on legs, neck and trunk.  Left supraclavicular edema significant now and expands over the collarbone and above and over the shoulder towards the back.  Nodes are now rising in the neck above the supraclavicular nodes, side & back of the neck, and under the jaw.  Tenderness is also present above the left breast (Chest area) and I feel lumps under the skin here as well.   Sent for a Nuclear Stress Test due to chest pain and increased blood pressure - tests normal.  2 weeks ago - present -  Breast pain has lessened significantly.  Only aches a bit throughout the day and burns mildly when I press in the area.  Supraclavicular edema still significant, tissue light blue/flesh colored.  Edema in left arm flucuates, but I feel mildly tender nodes deep in crook of arm.    Other nodes seem to be popping up all over the place.  I feel them in my chest - right one is larger than left and very hard.  I have them under/in my left arm, right below the collarbone towards the shoulders, and my neck ) both sides.  This past weekend, I felt tenderness and pain in my left inguinal area as well and I think I detect a swelling but it is deep.   Summary and Questions:  It all began with the breast pain which has improved.  Everything else seems to be getting worse, especially the nodes.  The nodes are not gigantic in size (some definitely larger than others) but are easily located due to their increased size or a faint bulge appearing in the skin. The strange thing is that I swear I can feel them enlarging.  I feel a burning/warmth sensation in a specific area, accompanied by tenderness and when I feel the skin in that location, I find an enlarged node.  The warmth/tenderness dissipates but the node stays enlarged and after a day or so, the node starts getting hard and tenderness goes away.  I am now suspecting that I have right supraclavicular edema as well, but not nearly as pronounced as the left supra.  I am having no fevers and I am not sick.   The nodes do not hurt except when they first enlarge.  The supraclavicular and arm edema, however, is very uncomfortable because the skin becomes so tight and causes my neck and arm to ache.   A breast specialist tells me I definitely need the nodes investigated, but she can't do it.  A pulmonologist doesn't suspect the lung nodule, tells me to definitely investigate the nodes, but she also, can't do it.  Well, who can?  My current physicians refuse to give me antibiotics because they don't want to \"mask\" the underlying cause, but they've yet to send me to anyone who can determine the cause.  I'm sitting here thinking: Am I going to sit here and drop dead before anyone decides to do anything significant to get to the bottom of my symptoms?  I have had lower abdominal pain now for 3 years and chronic diarrhea for 1 year.  This has been consistently dismissed as IBS with no testing.  Docs now want me to see a Gastrointerologist as well as a new breast specialist.  I can't help but wonder how bad off I am going to be by the time I get these two appointments and any subsequent tests.  This is ridiculous and very scary.  Isn't there some kind of test that can more quickly determine what's going on in my body, besides sending me to every specialist known to mankind who just refers me to someone else?  Are there more specialized tests that can reveal something amiss other than the CBC or is the CBC all-inclusive?  What should I ask or request of my doctors?  Is this something that can resolve itself on its own?  Its been almost 2 months now, and I've had thousands of dollars in medical bills, but still no diagnosis, and not even a best guess.  Is this appropriate?  Also, I've recently discovered a spot on my back that I've never seen before and have yet to report.  It's longer, but narrower than a quarter and is almost black.  I have another spot that looks suspicious and is scheduled to be removed, but it's rather small.  Could malignant melanoma (if present) cause these symptoms?  Oh, I also seem to get full quicker, have intermittent \"lightheadedness\" and am easily fatigued.  I am 38 years old and a single parent.  Could someone please, please advise me?  I would be eternally grateful!  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "RN:  Thanks so much for responding!  I have heard of IBC and frankly, this is what I suspect might be going on because of the symptoms having originated in my breast, but every time I mention it to a doctor I practically get laughed out of the exam room!  My breast is not bright red and I have no nipple inversion or peau de' orange; erego, they immediately rule it out (4 doctors in all).  The IBC site says that you don't have to have these particular symptoms to have IBC, but my doctors disagree.  Makes me wonder.....? My breast looks normal except the size, the few pimples and the enlarged veins and capillaries.  It's also not warm.  But my supraclavicular edema is not normal nor my swollen arm.  I could cry.  So now I'm concentrating on these lymph nodes, because they are strong evidence that something is definitely wrong somewhere and the doctors at least agree with this but they've as yet to do anything constructive about it.  Who would do a lymph node biopsy?  An oncologist?  Is that who I should tell my doctor to refer me to?  And do oncologists study all kinds of cancer, or just certain types?  Thanks so much again for your input!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Rntdj. Obviously we need to rule out cancer before anything else and an oncologist would be the best person to do that. To answer your question about lab tests: there is a blood test called a 'tumor marker' that is used as an adjunct in the evaluation of potential breast cancer. While the test is not entirely sensitive it does help to weigh the possibilities. The tumor markers that would be appropriate for this case are: CEA, CA 15.3.  A fine needle aspirate is very sensitive when applied to a breast mass as opposed to lymph node enlargement. In the case of lymph node enlargement I would recommend an excisional biopsy.  Although your symptoms are a cause for concern I would also respect the outcome of your clinical evaluation. The mammo and complementary ultrasound can also detect lymph nodes in the axilla and supraclavicular region and give a reasonable assesment as to their malignant potential. Let us know how things go on your next visit. Best regards from all the team here.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you, Dr. Fouad, for your response.  I truly appreciate your having taken the time.  The node involvement and supraclavicular edema did not occur until the end of the second week of my first symptoms.  My mammo & ultrasound were performed in that first week, so I believe that's why the test results were \"normal,\" as it hadn't happened yet.  And only the breast tissue was studied, not my arm or chest area.  Indeed, it was the sudden onset of the supraclavicular involvement that concerned one of my physicians and had them reconsider a breast problem in spite of the test results, erego, my referral to a breast-only clinic.    My nodes literally burn.  I discovered almost all of my nodes in my upper body before I had the slightest medical knowledge of their whereabouts due to this sensation.  The breast pain has intensified again today and this evening, as well as the itching and I have new, angry, itchy pimples on the skin over where I believe my spleen to be.  These pimples just instantly popped up - no kidding.  I felt an intense stab of itching, checked myself in a mirror, and there was one bright red pimple with no head.  1 minute later, I mindlessly scratched it and looked down to see that a head had formed and immediately popped.  Right beside it, another was instantaneously forming as I watched it and came to a full head!  What the heck is this?  I feel as though I'm in the Twilight Zone!  Even stranger I can feel tissue that's lumpy beneath where these pimples appeared, similar to the lumpiness deep in the breast near the breast wall.    I had a benign fibroadenoma removed last year in the right breast and just now noticed a pink, 2 cm flat lump in the scar tissue that resulted from it.  New \"spots\" of capillaries have made a appearance also and I'm now pretty certain that my right supraclavicular tissue is swelling as well.  I feel that I am definitively experiencing a reactive-type process to something wrong in my body.  I pray it isn't IBC or something even worse, but I admit that my concern grows by the day.  Whatever this is, it's not nice.   I will definitely request the lab work that you've mentioned but I do wonder....in the absence of a lump, is a node biopsy the only way to tell what's up?  I'm scared of the node biopsy because it seems that would really whack out my system even further.  Again, I thank you and if you're serious about wanting to know how this all turns out, then I will attempt to keep you all informed.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "New Developments.....",
    "content": "Me again....  Long story short:  symptoms have progressed to include all kinds of pain, nausea, marked fatigue, etc, etc.  Have seen 3 physicians who didn't strike me as all that knowledgeable about the human body or health issues in general.  I just KNOW something is wrong with my breast, but because of the clear mammo and ultrasound, no one is taking me seriously and all refuse to investigate the breast further, even though these tests were performed WAY before these other symptoms came along.  My left breast looks very stange to me, but that's not really why I write this time.  I am having a CT scan of my neck and abdomen later today (thank God), but I am worried they are not looking in the right place.  For the last two days, I've been in a significant amount of pain in my upper chest areas, my left and right arms, my neck and muscles in general.  I've been sleeping a lot (don't want to get out of bed, I'm so tired).  I also had headaches both Saturday and Sunday which felt like there was pressure in my entire skull.  This pain I'm feeling is hard to describe....pressure, burning, and still stabbing sensations in both breasts, and my arms and chest feel super heavy and uncomfortable.  They just ache and hurt.  But what has me most alarmed now is this:  Several weeks ago, I started getting tiny bright red spots on my upper abdomen (the skin over my abdomen/liver/spleen) and on my breasts.  I've researched these now and I know they are petichae, they look exactly like them and do not blanch.  The Oncologist who ordered the CT scans barely glanced at them (from about a foot away) when I attempted to show them to her, and announced they were \"cherry angiomas.\"  I knew they weren't, but wanted to research to be sure, and I'm right.  These look nothing like the angiomas, but EXACTLY like the petichae.  Anyway, she blew this petichae rash off and misdiagnosed it.  Last night, I had a spontaneous occurance of \"purpura\" on my left inner-elbow.  Not there one moment, 4 good-size spots of it the next.  Dark red, wine-purple spots that you know is blood.  My arm suddenly looks as though I've been shooting up and I don't do drugs.  My question is:  What should I do about this?  Should I wait the rest of the week to talk to the doctor about it when my scan results come in, or should I point this out to someone now?  Am I in danger?  This pressure, pain, heavy arms and burning chest, coupled with these blood spots has me thinking I might be, but how do I know?  I'm tired of feeling like I have to continuously attempt to diagnose myself.  Am I getting the appropriate tests?  Right now, I'm having lab work done: an HIV, CEA, ANA, ESR, and a CPK.  Will these tell me why I'm bleeding internally?  And can I afford to wait for these results to come back?  Any help/information is appreciated, bdusk\n\n",

I've been following your story too, Michael, and my heart goes out to you.  Kind of funny when you think of it.  We're both in similar situations (worried sick about ongoing symptoms) and we're getting CT scans on the same day!    That makes us kindred spirits, wouldn't you think?  I just hope your CT is of the area you wanted.  I'm afraid mine might not be.  I've read this purpura/petechiae can be a sign of serious infection and I almost believe that the way I've been hurting this weekend.  Feels like something is in my blood....can a CT scan find that?  Infections can be dangerous if not diagnosed and treated and I don't want to wait another week to find out what's wrong with me.  I'd say the 10 weeks so far have been long enough.  I'm just getting worse, not better.  Geesh, what does it take?    I wish you the best, M.  I hope everything turns out okay for you (and me, too).\n\n",

I won't be posting in two places any more, although I'm still not sure where I should be posting.  My most recent posts are in the oncology/sarcoma forum.  As this was the first place I posted in 2005, I thought I should also offer an update here, and I hope with all my heart that Theresa Jones finds this, as she had been my Angel when my symptoms first struck.  Well, here goes:  I saw 2 Rheumatologists (he and she) today, New Year's Eve, for the first time. After the most comprehensive physical exam I've ever received, and an in-depth review of signs, symptoms and numerous subcutanous nodules and lumps, Rheumatologist immediately diagnosed me with wide-spread/significant lymphadenopathy to include: epitrochlear, cubital, supraclavicular, anterior/posterior cervical, inguinal, occupital, axillary and more. Course of action: 1) extensive blood work (I filled 8 large vials!); 2) an appointment with a surgeon to biopsy lymph node(s); 3) Cat scan of neck; 4) a consultation with a \"Cancer Specialist\" no matter what (I know she meant oncologist).   After discussions and my realization that they, too, were very concerned, and in the face of her/his fears, I assured them that even the worst news would be a great RELIEF because I would finally KNOW that it hasn't been \"all in my head.\" FINALLY someone is helping me whether or not I'm insured. YEAH! A diagnosis is coming.. . .  I will update again when that happens.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Spencer,  The area you are describing does have many lymph nodes in it.  These frequently will become enlarged when fighting off an infection (even if the infection doesn't cause other symptoms).  Often, when they are fighting an infection the may be a bit sore but this is certainly not the case all the time.    Based on the fact that this post is in the lymphoma board I should also mention that with cancer lymph nodes can swell as well.  Generally, cancerous nodes are non painful, fixed in place (not able to be moved around with pressure) and are slowly growing in size.  As with all things in medicine there are exceptions, but this is generally the rule.  Given that your lump is getting bigger quickly and by simple odds your lump is likely to be a swollen lymph node fighting off an infection.  If, however, there is other concern or you would like to have it evaluated, seeing your primary care doctor is actually a very good place to start.  If you prefer a specialist, an Ear, Nose and Throat (also called an otolaryngologist) is the right place.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on lymph nodes that can be found here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Lymph Node Enlargement",
    "content": "I recently posted in the miscellaneous thread, but my second message was erased, because I think i will be more suitable for here.  My name is Matt, I am 19 and I don't smoke or drink. I have been suffering from stomach and bowel problems since christmas time last year. I had black stool and was sent off for a full blood count, but everything came back normal. I was put on lansoprasole to reduce acid levels in my stomach, but I have still been suffering from off colour stool recently, even though my stomach feels much better.  However a couple of saturday's ago in a friends car a headache just came on randomly. It got worse as days progressed and I started getting lower back and neck pains. It seemed some of my nodes were enlarged, but not an awful lot. I also started suffering my very bad nausea and I am completely off my food, having eaten only a couple of bowls of cereal and some crisps since last thursday. My headache has since improved, but something has come up in the last few days that is concerning me.  It is a swelling just above the clavicle on my left side, in the hollow area. I can't really describe whether it is hard or soft, but it's not rock hard and it's not terribly soft. In an annoying twist of fate I only discovered it after I left my appointment at the doctor's surgery the other day. I also have two other swellings near my groin area and  am getting random aches and pains all over the place and I have never been so fatigued in all my life.  I do keep returning to the doctor, but...I always get the impression he doesn't quite take me seriously. I do try to be assertive, but sometimes I feel my complaints fall on deaf ears.  Am I right to be concerned or could this be a simple problem?  Thanks.  Matt.\n\n",

If it begins to enlarge without having a cold it should be re-evaluated by your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Briggscreek,  Occasionally, after lymph nodes have become swollen they do not fully reduce back to normal size.  They may remain about the size you are describing.  These nodes still function normally and are really no different from other lymph nodes except in size.  If the tenderness gets worse would recommend you have them evaluated since they can occasionally become infected.  It may also be that you have a viral infection (that may or may not be causing symptoms).  This would also cause some swelling of the nodes and may make them a bit tender.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good article on lymph nodes.  You can find it here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "'80/80' rule for neck masses - is it true?",
    "content": "Hi,  I am a 36-yr old male, with no real history of illness or surgeries, and little to no family history of cancer. I currently am taking vytorin, fluoxetine, and fish oil capsules.  A few weeks ago I noticed a lump in the left side of my neck, near the carotid I think. I noticed it a few weeks ago but who knows how long it has been there. It is moveable (it can kind of be 'popped' from side to side), probably between 1-2cm (I guess...rough estimate), and I really can't say whether it is hard or soft. It is painless, and I can feel a pulse in it although it may just be because it is near the artery. I haven't been sick for months, although my kids have been trading illnesses constantly for the past year. I became nervous when I could not locate a similar lump on the other side of my neck. After doing some research (which always gets me into trouble), I thought it sounded like a carotid body tumor, although I know that's rare and I really don't know my neck anatomy well.  I went to my doctor last Friday and he felt it and said it was a lymph node, and not all that big, but he also felt another that seemed a bit large (which I can't seem to find), and my thyroid was a little 'big'. I've looked in the mirror and felt and I can't feel or see any lump on my thyroid. My doctor ordered some bloodwork for me...I didn't really get to see all that he ordered but it included some sort of lymph panel or something among other things...he also mentioned sedimentation or something.  Here's what really scared me: when I had done research on this stuff I came upon the '80/80' rule for neck masses, which is that in adults, 80% of neck masses are neoplasms, and 80% of those are malignant! When i mentioned this to my doctor, he didn't say anything, and I asked, \"So what should I think right now\" he said \"You shouldn't think anything\". I asked, \"If it is cancer, would it be treatable?\" and he said \"It depends\".  I left feeling very anxious and have been absolutely terrified out of my mind since. I am so worried that I will be dying soon. I know it sounds ridiculous but now that I have 2 little kids I get so worried about this stuff.  I guess my questions are: 1) does my description of the lump sound particularly ominous to you? 2) how confident should I be that a doctor can differentiate a lymph node from, say, a tumor in my neck? 3) will bloodwork really tell us much? If it comes back abnormal, I'd assume he'll want to biopsy or something. But if it comes back normal, and he says not to worry about it, do you think that is smart? I wasn't under the impression that bloodwork was very useful in this type of case 4) Does the fact that bloodwork was ordered indicate real concern? 5) I had an abdominal CT scan earlier this year, which was normal, as well as a chest x-ray earlier this year to look for heart issues (chest pain), which was normal. Should I take these normal tests as evidence that there is nothing bad going on elsewhere? Would a chest x-ray, for example, pick up something bad even if they were looking at it for heart reasons?  I know that's a lot of questions. Yes, I am an admitted hypochondriac. But I'm just so scared!  Thank you so much for taking the time to answer questions here.  Thanks, Kevin\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  A lymph node on the side of the neck is always a concern and should always be investigated even if it doesn't look ominous.   The blood work helps rule out some of the ominous causes. Obviously a more ominous presentation would have called for a pathologic examination but I am just guessing here.  You asked an interesting question about the 80/80 rule. Yes its a good rough indication when studies were performed on patients sent for biopsy / FNA. Obviously, there was a good reason to send these patients for biopsy in the first place (e.g. night sweats, gets worse after 2 weeks of antibiotics, high risk for disease, etc.). However, in the primary care setting (such as the one you are in) where your primary care provider is the one still examining you, the incidence of malignant disease in neck nodes in several studies (a Dutch as well as a Greek study) was extremely low. What that means is that in these studies, rather than wait for your primary care doctor's opinion on whether a node warrants a biopsy or not, they just went ahead and did it. As I mentioned earlier the number of people who turned out malignant was low.  Studies that were performed at specialized centers such as an oncology service, showed a much higher incidence (hence the 80/80 rule).  Please do not worry your heart out reading about every possibility, you are on the right course and no matter how much you do read you will never be able to make a better opinion than your provider. If at the end you are not satisfied with his opinion you can always seek another opinion.  Good luck and please update this thread after your results come out.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks, Dr.  I received my bloodwork results earlier this week but didn't want to piggy-back on my first post until it was answered. Now that you've answered it, I'll go ahead and post the results and my concerns...but I'm worried I won't like what you'll say.  Most of the values are within normal range, but some are on the definite low end. That concerned me a bit, but then I checked my results from another CBC 9 months ago, and it looks like these low values have clearly dropped since then. I don't know how much variation occurs over time from test to test and how concerned I should be, especially in the context of this lump. Here are the results from February 2007 and Nov 2007:  Feb 2007: Triglycerides 127 Total cholesterol 150 HDL 49 LDL 76 WBC 5.4 RBC 4.66 Hemoglobin 13.9 Hematocrit 40.6 Abs neutrophils 2884   53.4% Abs lymphocytes 1750   32.4% Abs monocytes 690   12.8% Abs eosinophils 49   0.9% Abs basophils 27   0.5%  Nov 2007: Triglycerides 78 Total cholesterol 113 HDL 54 LDL 43 WBC 4.5 RBC 4.36 Hemoglobin 13.4 Hematocrit 38.0 Abs neutrophils 2961   65.8% Abs lymphocytes 1112   24.7% Abs monocytes 396   8.8% Abs eosinophils 27   0.6% Abs basophils 5   0.1%  The ranges for the lab on these indicate that nothing was out of range for Feb. For Nov, total cholesterol is out of range (ref 125-200), as is hematocrit (ref 38.5-50). Lymphocytes are low in Nov but the normal range is listed as 850-3900. Similar with the other -phils and -cytes.  Since Feb a few things have changed: I now run 3miles 4-5 times per week, whereas I did no exercise back in Feb. I also now take psyillium fiber twice a day. I've been on vytorin for a couple of years now, and also take fluoxetine and fish oil.  I'm really worried about the across-the-board drop in lymphocytes, monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils from Feb to Nov is worrisome, especially in the context of my lump. I know they are in normal range but it is the consistent decrease from then to now (almost 50%!) that worries me. I'd also read that really low cholesterol like mine can be due to cancer, so that's what concerns me too.  I should point out that my doctor seemed completely unconcerned after seeing these blood tests. Perhaps I should just trust him but sometimes I feel like just one of a million of his patients, and I've read the stories of missed cancer diagnoses by PCPs. But he felt that the results were normal, period...and basically considered the case closed. He did, however, say he'd refer me to an ENT since I am so worried and won't calm down!  Do you feel these blood results are worrisome, or consistent with possible lymphoma?  As for the 80/80 rule, you are saying that applies to a pre-selected population of high-risk patients, right? i.e. it applies if you pre-screen out the majority of patients which are likely to benign? That's reassuring.  Thanks again for taking the time to answer. I know time is precious!  -Kevin\n\n",

Your tests are normal and there is a good reason why the lab reference offers a range for normal rather than a single number. It's normal for lab results to vary within the normal range.  I should remind you that cancer is a much less subtle disease than that. Cancer can be missed if you were simply not assessed properly.  You should follow the size of the lymph node and report any change in size to your PCP. If you are not confident of your doctor's opinion please consider getting a second opinion. The ENT doctor can help you with that.  Good luck and best regards,\n\n",

I have a couple of quick questions:  1) if I assume that this lump is a lymph node, and is not bigger than 1cm (it may be just about 1cm...reminds me of a small pumpkin seed), how alarming/abnormal is it to have a clearly palpable but not 'enlarged' lymph node in one side of the neck but not the other? Could it be a normal, non-enlarged node that for some reason is palpable, while on the other side I can't find anything like it?  2) if this little thing turned out to be lymphoma, does the small size, mobility, clean CBC results, and lack of other symptoms indicate that I would be catching it early, and can feel more confident about a prognosis?

    "content": "Hi there,  Thanks for updating the thread.  1. Normally a lymph node is not palpable. Please remember, however, that lymph nodes are there to protect against infection. As soon as they are exposed to an infection they swell as the the cells that fight infection multiply inside them. Then they become palpable. That would be the most common cause for lymph node enlargement as it is simply performing its duty. In oncology a lymph node that is 1 cm or less in size is not considered \"clinically significant\". It wouldn't make it to the 80/80 rule in any setting.  2. If this were lymphoma, the size of the node wouldn't matter. The prognosis would depend on the stage and the type (pathology) as well as other factors rather than the size. The stage is determined by the number of lymph node locations affected.  You are on the right track now, I wouldnt worry about it any more.\n\n",

    "content": "Just got back from the ENT. He felt my neck pretty carefully. At first he couldn't find the lump. Then I helped him and he definitely found it, because he could pop it back and forth.  He said it was nothing to worry about. He seemed very convinced in that. He said it was smaller than a cm, and that he feels a lot of necks and these types of 'scarred' nodes are very common, and that it could likely stay palpable for my whole life. He understood my fears but was very firm but reassuring that I should not worry about this.  I certainly feel a lot better now. My attempts at measuring the node had it at 1.0-1.5cm or so, but I never felt like I could get a good measurement. I had thought it was at least a cm, though!  So I guess I should just let it go. There is still a part of me that worries about those cases where something like this turns out to be bad, but I expect those are rare.  Thanks so much for your help, Dr. You've been a real blessing and you should be proud of the help you provide scared patients like myself.  -Kevin\n\n",

    "content": "Past diagnosis/surgeries: I am 18 years old male. I have been diagnosed with scoliosis and kyphosis about 5 years ago. I also had a surgery of appendicitis 2 and a half years ago. My grandmather (form mother's line) died of colon cancer. I also suffer from IBS. I have also been bitten by deer tick about 3-4 times in the last 3 years. The sores from bite didn't heal even now, and they itch from time to time. Oh, and also all of my 4 wisdom teeth strated to grow 2 years ago  Problem: My main problem are 2 big lumps on my neck. They are rock-hard, and i have had them for 2 years, maybe even more. They didn't grow even a little since then. One of them is a little bigger then the other, by 1 or 2mm. They are located in the neck, one is on the left side, the other on the right. They are located in exactly the same place (symmetrically). They are located behind the ears, when the jaw meets the skull, but not when the hair line starts, a little lower (right below the mandibular process).   They are palpable, but only when I hold my head in a specific position. When my neck is straight, i can't palpate them. Their size is about 5-7 cm, and they go deep in my neck/head. They don't get inflamed or sore/itchy. I have noticed them by accident. I was scratching in the back of my neck, and felt one of them (behind the left ear). Then I looked on the right and found another one. Their size was the same as it is now, so they could've been there for longer then 2 years.The one on the left hurts sometimes (like a nerve pain). It hurts about 2-3 times a month, and this pain lasts for 2-5 minutes. This hasn't intensified in 2 years. And they are really hard, I mean like a rock or a bone. Also they can't be seen, only palpated.  I also have petechiae, but only on my hands starting from the elbow. I also had them for 2 years. They get bigger and more bright after excessive running. I have made a blood test a few times, but everything is fine. I don't have night sweats, fever, sweating, loss of appetite or fatigue. Though I do have some unexplained chills from time to tome, about 2 times a month. They didn't intensify in the last 2 years.   I have looked on the internet, and found about lymphoma. Please, could you help me with your opinion. I didn't bother going to a doctor, because they don't bother me at all, and i have a feeling that this is just some bone or muscle. I also thought about Lyme disease, but I don't have any symptoms... Your help would be very appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen nodes for a few years",
    "content": "Dear Dr,  I am a 24 year old female with no relevent medical history, on no medications. About 3 years ago I discovered very swollen lymph nodes in my groin area. About 3/4 were present on both sides, they felt firm/rubbery and they were not sore.They were more marked on the right, where one particularly large node was present (about5x10 mm). I went to see a doctor who made me fell a little silly, told me I had 'shotty' glands and to stop worrying. He suggested that they were associated with shaving/waxing. I have stopped either of these, with no difference.   Since then, the nodes have persisted, if anything are now a little larger and seem to be associated with a general ache. I have a few smaller rubbery glands in my neck that have cropped up more recently.   Other more non-descript things I feel every so often included sometimes painful sex. As well, sometimes a severe, sharp pain shooting up through by vagina/anus, lasts seconds(no constipation). This pain can be so severe that I jump involuntarily if I'm sitting, but it happens only say once every few weeks, that I often forget about it. Very irregular periods. Random itchiness of my skin, every so often.  About 2 years ago I suffered terrible night sweats, every night for a few months.  Sorry about the collection of symptoms, but I feel a bit stupid going back to my GP. I watched him subtly write 'cancer phobic' into his notes, so I'm worried that will taint his, or any other doctor in the practices opinion!  But saying that, I am really worried that I could have lymphoma or something similar! Please help as soon as you can.  Many thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "HI Gizmogizmo,  I think cancer is pretty unlikely.  A cancer presenting with swollen lymph nodes would be very unlikely to remain asymptomatic for several years.    Possible causes include an infection with a bacteria called bartonella (cat scratch fever) or possibly an infection with a fungus such as coccidiodes immitis (valley fever).  I think a fungal infection is less likely.  Other things to consider would be conditions such as histiocytosis.  If you search the web for histiocytosis you'll find a lot of concerning and severe symptoms.  This would not be the type of histiocytosis present for you.  There are actually several types of this condition ranging from mild to severe.  I would also suggest testing for STD's if there is any possibility of this.    In cases such as this sometimes it is necessary to do a biopsy of one of the lymph nodes to find out what is causing the persistent swelling.  Now that you are having some discomfort from them this may be a reasonable thing to do.  A biopsy is a simple procedure.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  I suspect everyone with swollen lymph nodes is at least a little concerned about cancer so I wouldn't be too concerned about this thought.  Just explain your symptoms to your doctor and express your concerns.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "lymph nodes are swollen on both sides on my neck - itchy",
    "content": "Hi I would be so grateful if you could let me know what you think...(doctors only please)  Ok I am 18 years of age and last july I noticed that my lymph nodes were swollen on both sides on my neck.I went to the doctor and he said under my jaw (submandular gland?)on the right side was swollen.On the left side the nodes are smaller then those on the right side.Doctor said I had a viral infection.he came to this conclusion after loads of blood tests.Tried antibiotics and established it wasnt bacterial,my blood tests were perfect,one time my white blood count was either low or high and he asked for a repeat the following month and it had settled to being compeltely normal.So therefore he said I had a virus and it would go away itself.This was in december...   Now the lymph nodes are still there and in july I began to get really itchy,my scalp,everywhere,mainly my arms though and occassionally my legs.When I scratch no scratch makrs are left,but it goes very red then dies down.I have had bright bright pink patches on my hand and arm and feeling of ants crawling on my skin.My arms did get hot and burny at one time so I saw the doctor and he thought it could be allergies as I sneeze alot and nearly always have a sore throat(also got slime in back of my throat) so tried tablets and went back yesterday and he diagnosed me with uticaria(sp?).   Now I just want to be clear do you think I should trust my doctor.I have seen him about 5 times,had hundreds of blood tests and seen 3 other doctors,they all agree that its not serious.But I am still a bit concerned,well my mind is at rest but I don't want to forget about it then it ends up being cancer.   In the past 14 months the lymph nodes have not changed size at all and no new lymph nodes have appeared,all the ones that were there last year are still there.Oh I must say also my nodes are no bigger than 1cm in diameter,not hard and mobile(well the one on my neck is quite flat,but when I turn my head to the side you can see it on my neck,to press it is like when you cut a grape in half,not sure if its immobile and it is soft) doctor has felt it and said there is no signs of it being malignant.The one under my jaw moves about and is soft but not as flat as the one on my neck.   No other symptoms are present and these nodes were first discovered after I got a very nasty virus from an air conditioning unit on holiday last july,since then i have been having throat problems and the nodes have remained large.   Do you think I shoudl stop worrying?  I myself feel fine,but the worry is stressing me out.I asked my doctor to tell me straight if he thoguht it was cancerous,he is a lovely lovely doctor and the best in my surgery and he said that I am completely healthy.  Please reply.  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Its unfortunate that the patient was in need of drainage at a time like this. The effects of the delay however, will vary in the short run, in terms of complete remission rate and will also depend on her response to subsequent mediastinal radiotherapy. In any case a delay may allow for the tumor to grow, treatment to become less effective and in some cases may affect long term survival. In theory, a prolonged delay may even select more malignant clones that are more resistant to chemotherapy.  It really depends on how sensitive the patient is to her therapy which varies from person to person. Please note that her disease burden (large mediastinal lymphoma) alone makes her prognosis less favorable.  Nothing can be done but to wait and see.   Good luck and best wishes to the patient.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 26 year old male and concerned about lymphoma.  I have been having night sweats on/off for over a year, and I am always urinating. The urinating is really annoying and I feel like I am going all the time and I went to urologist and my prostate came back normal.  I am currently taking Paxil 20mg for depression, and Toporl XL 50mg for Mitral Valve Prolapse  When I wake up I have an anxiety feeling and a little lightheaded.  My GP said the night sweats are most likely from the Paxil.  So I didn't worry much until recently I had sore throat and noticed I have a small lymph node by neck and left clavicle. It's moveable, and feels like it's on a muscle.  I can't stop worrying about it, and my GP & ENT doctor said it's too small and not to worry about it. I had a chest x-ray, cbc, which came back normal. I also had an upper GI since I was having issues, probably from worrying so much.  I also get a swollen feeling on the left side of throat which may be due to TMJ.   Any insight would help I can't enjoy daily life due to I worry every minute and my doctors probably think I am have issues.\n\n",

    "content": "Sweating is a known side effect of Paxil.  It is possible that this is the cause.  If you've had other symptoms, such as fever, weight loss, etc. there may be other causes.  With all the tests that you have had coming back normal, it is quite possible that the paxil is the cause.  You may discuss with your doctor about changing to a different type of antidepressant without this side effect if it's bothersome.  Regarding your lymph nodes.  The lymph nodes of the neck and clavicle area drain the throat and head.  So an infection causing a sore throat is very likely to cause enlarged lymph nodes.  It can take a few weeks for them to reduce in size.  If they become painful they may have an infection in them, so you should be evaluated by a doctor.    I would give the lymph nodes a little bit to get better, but if they're not, or if you are concerned you should follow up with your doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

It should feel rubbery and be relatively mobile.  It should not hurt when pressed.  If any of these do not apply you should follow up with your doctor to ensure that there is nothing abnormal going on.  In some instances where there is suspicion a biospy can be done.  Biopsies of lymph nodes are generally relatively harmless, but can have some unpleasant side effects, so talking with your doctor about the need for biopsy is important.\n\n",

Erik,  I just want to say that I empathize; I used to be exactly like you and every tiny lymph node spelled doom to me.  I have noticed that, as I have gotten older, and my children are pretty self-sufficient, I have calmed down considerably and am better able to put things in perspective.  It sounds as if you have done everything you should and your doctor doesn't seem worried, so it's time to relax.  A doctor friend told me something she was taught in med school: \"When you hear hoofbeats, think horses, not zebras.\"  In other words, MOST of the time, the most common reason is actually the cause of your symptoms, e.g., lymoh node = current or past infection.  By all means, know what's going on with your body, but don't stress so much that you cause other problems!  Peace, Marie\n\n",

But my doctor did tell me that he wanted to do a CT Scan again in 3 months due to that I still had Thematic tissue in my chest and that you usually have that when your children and it goes away when your an adult.  They didn't find and abnormal growths or anything, but should I be worried about this thematic tissue.  Could their be anything hidding behind the tissue, and why would he want to run another ct scan if it's nothing.  Any help would be great.  Thanks  Erik\n\n",

    "content": "I think your CT scan probably saw Thymic tissue.  The thymus is a structure that is the center for lymphocyte (white blood cell type) formation in children.  As people age, it tends to shrink down.  I do not know of the standard age at which it is no longer visible.  The scan in 3 months is likely to make sure that nothing is changing.  Rarely, the thymus can give rise to tumors.  Checking again will help ensure this is not happening.  Again, this is very unlikely.  This is most likely an incidental finding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have had small lymphnode by left supraclavicle area for about a year and my doctor said it was small and nothing to worry about he have me a ctscan and chest xray for peace of mind came back good.  Now a year later the last couple of weeks both of my armpits are sore by the rib aread and when I press on the sore area on the left armpit I can feel a small lymphnode it's hard to tell if its soft or hard but mobile.  My shoulder blade area is sore to but don't know if it's related. I also have a small movable lymphnode on my right neck the same side my tmj is reall bad on not sure if its related.  I am scared that this the start of lymphomia.  Everytime I go to the doctor he tells me it's not and I was good untill this armpit thing recently. I am seeking help to overcome my fears of developing cancer it's always on my mind, and you guys are awesome with support.  Sorry for the long post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 32y old healthy female.  Only history:  appedix removal in 1984, 8 idiopathic miscarriages from 2000-2004, 2 normal pregancies, gallblader removal in 2006 (right after childbirth).  My recent symptoms:  Tiredness, Itchy all over but worse in lower legs and face (more specifically along jawline).  Feeling of fullness in groin area for about 9 weeks.  Same feeling in armpits for about 4 weeks and 3 weeks ago acute pain on upper left abdomen witch made me call my doctor.  Since then, early satiety and very nausiated.  My doctor did full examination plus lab work and x-ray + abdominal/pelvic ultrasound.    Chest X-ray: Normal  Blood work:  ESR: Normal, CBC:  Normal WBC, RBC and platelet.  Hgb, MCV low.  Smear review:  presence of microcytes and megathrombocytes.  Presence of few activated cells.  TSH: Normal  Renal profile: Normal  Liver profile:  ALP slightly elevated and LDH moderatly elevated.  Ultrasound:  (Only writting abnormal findings)  Liver:  Diffusely hyperechoic Pancreas:  Increased (diffusely) Spleen: Length: 13.6 cm   Width: 5.2 cm  Depth: 11.0 cm   Volume:  406.9 cc  Pelvis:  Fluid in rigth adnexa and +++ follicles on left ovary.  My question is:  Do I have \"splenomegaly\"?  What, in your opinion, do you think I have based on symptoms and results?    Sorry but another question in mind is that my son is being followed by hemato-oncologist and one of the possibility is that he might have lymphoma.  What are the chances we have the same thing.  Could it be possible for a mother to give the disease to her unborn child if process already started??  My next app't is in a month.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Labtechmom,  Based on these ultrasound measurements I would say your spleen is very mildly enlarged.  Many consider a spleen that measures greater than 11 cm at it's widest point to be enlarged and greater than 20 cm to be severely enlarged.  Your symptoms sound like you may have a diffuse infection such as can occur with ebstein barr virus (mononucleosis).  Your symptoms do not sound particularly concerning for lymphoma.  Regarding your son, lymphoma is not a disease that would be passed on to the unborn child during pregnancy.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My 18yr old son was diagnosed with Nodular Lymphocyte Predominance Lymphoma Hodgkin's Diease. He had 4 lymph nodes removed from the right side of neck just underneath his Jaw line. The Onc. ordered a PET scan and told us that would assist in staging. I am confused however as the PET results showed nothing. Yet the Doctor said he is stage 1 and they want to do radiation. My confusion is why did it not even show uo that area on the PET. The oncolgist said it was because it was early stages and if we were not comfortable with Radiation he would send us to the Mayo Clinic or John Hopkins. We really can't afford that and I wonder if we should seek another opinion. 2 Pathologist have looked at the nodes that were removed, the first path was unsure and it was sent to anther path in another state.  My son does have a node that is not as big as the ones removed but is hard like the others in the same area the first nodes were removed.  We have no family history of Lymphoma, I have an Aunt who had Ovarian Cancer in 85 and was recently diagnosed with a form of Lekumia. My grandfather died of Lung Cancer but was also a smoker.  Any advice is welcomed. Thank you in advance for your thoughts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Concerned Mother,  Unfortunately, my knowledge of Hodgkin's Disease is fairly limited.  I do know that with treatment stage 1 disease has a very good prognosis in almost all cases.  While I can't say for certain for your son because I do not know all the details I think this is most likely the case for your son also.  From my understanding in the reading I have done, radiation for stage 1 HD is the currently accepted standard of care.  There may be other options if you'd prefer not to do radiation.  Regarding the PET scan I am uncertain as to why the nodes did not show up.  Cautiously, you may be able to interpret this as an indication that the cancer was caught very early and has not spread much.  Follow up with the oncologist is very important.  It is very reasonable to get a second opinion.  I'm sure your current oncologist would not be offended by this.  Most physicians understand patients concern and desire for second opinions and welcome the fresh look at the case.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Just to follow up on Dr. Chan's comments. I totally agree with his assessment.  It appears to me that all your son's nodes were removed, hence why would anything show on the PET scan if the initial 4 nodes were the only ones he had. His stage (stage I) would be based on the nodes that were removed in addition to the absence of any other nodes in any other area of the body (as per PET). If the PET had found another area of lymph node involvement then he would be staged as Stage II or more. So the PET was done to EXCLUDE any other stage (other than stage I).  I am a bit confused as to the nature of the new node you mention? Is it a node / scarring? What's your doctor's opinion?  Diagnosis of HD is done by morphology as well as immunophenotyping (staining marker proteins on the cells). I would presume that it shouldn't be a problem in a lab that is equipped with those facilities.  Lymphocyte predominance has an excellent prognosis in most cases. By excellent prognosis I mean cure.  Your oncologist should be able to give you more details.  I think radiation would be a great option as simply removal of the nodes does not cure your son. Nor does it change the stage.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you both very much for your input. We did see the Radiolgy Oncolgist yesterday and he felt that the node we were feeling was from the sugery. They will watch it to be sure. Because of the rarity of Lymphocyte predominance they are sending my son's case to the tumor board. It does not mean the stage has changed just that they wanted the input of the board, which makes me feel very good. My sons Doctor's feel we  will most likely still go with Radiation but want to be sure. I too am confident he will be fine once we make it to the other side of this. I am thankful I have a caring staff of Doctor's to help us through this. And again want to thank the both of you, its nice to know you care. :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I am a 24 yr old female. About a month ago I had a small cold, which went away. Immediately after, I had a slight sore throat, at which point I noticed that the lymph node under my chin on the left side of my neck was swollen. The sore throat went away, but the enlarged node remained. I went to see a doctor, they told me to wait it out. When it didn't go away, they put me on antibiotics, and having just finished the prescription, it doesn't seem to have made a difference.   It has now been about 4 weeks. If I turn my head so as to maximize how much it sticks out and measure along the widest diameter, it measures 4 cm across. I've been measuring it for the last week or so, and the diameter itself seems unchanging, but the funny thing  is that some weeks it looks more bloated (\"taller\") than others. It doesn't hurt when I touch it. I do not have any other symptoms whatsoever or swelling anywhere else. I do not have any past serious diagnoses/surgeries, and am currently just on the pill. There have been cases of cancer in my family.  I was also referred to a general surgeon for a biopsy, who said the only type of biopsy possible was excisional, since the node was too small, and hence suggested waiting until the antibiotics were done. In the meantime, I just had a chest XRay and ultrasound on the node itself done, the results of which I don' t have yet.  My next appointment with the general surgeon is in about 2 weeks. I don't like the thought of an excisional biopsy unless I have reason to believe it's something serious. Should I be asking for a referral to an oncologist or otolaryngologist before I see the surgeon again and have to consider such an option?  Thank you in advance for your time, M. M.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sev,  It sounds like you may have an enlarged lymph node that has remained swollen after the cold had resolved.  This is relatively common.  Given that you were referred to a surgeon your doctor must have felt that it was larger than he would like.  In this case, having it evaluated is reasonable.    If the lump is not changing and is rubbery/mobile feeling it may also be reasonable to wait a few months to see if it improves.  Without evaluating you in person I cannot say for sure this is a good option.  I would suggest discussing this with the surgeon when you see him again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hmmm. Thank you, in response to your post, the node is hard (as opposed to rubbery I believe). The result of the chest XRay came back negative, and the ultrasound on the node itself revealed that the surface of the node was smooth, which apparently is a good thing, but found that the content of the node was heterogeneous (ie there's a mix of things in there, water, etc). They also gave a number of possible explanations for this heterogeneous content, and I've got a CT booked for this Wed in order to further have it investigated.  All this is fine and well, except I'm a little freaked now, because we had monitored the node every day for about a week and it remained constant in size, and this was up till 8-9 days ago, at which point we stopped checking for a few days. When we measured it again earlier this week, it was up from 4 cm to 4.3 cm or so, and i've had symptoms of a sore throat for a few mornings now. Recall that all this started with a cold about 6 weeks ago, so I'm not sure if the same virus is acting up again, or whether I should be wary of something more serious (i.e. apparently slow steady growth may indicate a tumour). As I mentioned, I've got a CT Wed and a followup appointment with the surgeon this coming Mon Nov 12, but I don't know if I should be trying to speed up the process at all, i.e. go to an emergency room or let the surgeon know about my recent symptoms to get an earlier appointment?  Thanks again for your time, M.M.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female with Celiac Disease and kidney stones. I am currently battling with gall stones and have abdominal pain and chest pain with this. I am just waiting for surgery to have my gall bladder removed. This has been going on for over a month, but is not what I am concerned about. Between a year and 6 months I have had a lump on my neck that I thought was a knot in my muscle. I was keeping an eye on it to make sure it wasn't getting bigger, but lately it went from the size of a pencil eraser head to a size of a skittle. I went to my doctor and he said it was a swollen lymph node. I have not had any infections/colds/etc the past few months as he thought it could be because of those. He is sending me for a biopsy to make sure. I had been having frequent night sweats a while back, but they are not happening as much now. I have been fatigued and tired all the time for over a year or more now. I assumed it was because of the Celiac Diseased diagnosed back in December.  My question is could this possibly be lymphoma or something else called lipoma? Can you tell the difference by feeling the lump? I know one is fatty tissue and the other is not. Also, I do not know if I am crazy, but just this morning I have a sore throat (feels like a lump in the back on the same side as my enlarged lymph node). Is sore throat another symptom. I do have quite a family history of cancer in my family. Of the closest relatives, my mother passed away from cervical cancer and grandfather passed from lung cancer. The only medication I am taking is pain meds for the gall stones and birth control. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately, I can't tell you that the lump is not lymphoma.  I can say that given the odds of having lymphoma vs. the odds of having a simple enlarged lymph node greatly favor it being a lymph node.  A lipoma is a small fat cell tumor (not cancer) that is basically harmless although they can get big and cause some pain simply by location and size.  They can be removed if bothersome.  Given the location I think a lipoma is less likely than a lymph node.  Generally lipomas are movable and rubbery feeling (although that is basically what a normal lymph node feels like).  Since the lump is getting bigger the biopsy will help ease everyones mind and tell for sure if it is cancer or not.  (I suspect it is not.)  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  I am a 19 years old student (male), non-smoker and non-drinker. no history of lymphoma in my family, leukemia in one extended member and breast cancer in another. That's about it.  Being the worried 1at year medical student that I am, I choose to study structures on myself etc. I recently ( april 13th came down with a viral infection that was thought to be some sort of allergies since my phlegm was clear. I noticed that I have palpable lymph nodes on both sides of my neck, on my left side I have a string of lymph nodes running down ( size 3-4mm, and mobile and soft). On the right side I have 2 lymph nodes also posterior cervical family, and one jugular lymph node at the base of my neck. ( all of them are <1 cm , soft and mobile). Then i developed a 2nd viral infection ( doctor thought it was viral I still think it was bacterial, nonetheless..it was stronger, sore throat and dry cough at night, with dark yellow phlegm ) that one cleared up, and I decided to probe my supracalvicular nodes (BIG MISTAKE!!) initially if i am performing a normal physical they are not palpable, however when i strain my neck hard enough and move all my muscles above the clavicle ( and take the most awkward position possible) I can feel one on the left side <1 cm softer than all my other nodes combined and extremely mobile ( which is why I questioned if it was indeed a supraclavicular node, might be a lipoma or cyst due to my bag strap)  Now I am very well informed about the supraclavicular nodes, so it freaks me out that I can feel them. I have alot of viral infections throughout the year and i have been like that all my life, and also at the age of 13 had a major infection in one of my leg wounds ( 10 stitches and wound contamination) , so i am assuming that i am generally one of the people that can feel most of their lymph nodes. Of course I can feel my inguinal lymph nodes.  my questions are:  1) Can healthy individuals have palpable supraclavicular lymph nodes after an infection? because I think my infection cleared up at the end of may, but i can still feel most of them ( cervical ones seem smaller but not much of difference) my left supraclavicular seems softer and more mobile.  2) should I have my supraclavicular node checked on?, i recently had an X-ray before i noticed it. may 4th and the X-ray was clear. However i am just paranoid that it might be something serious that managed to metastasize in a month.  The summary:  1) they are all <1cm, soft and mobile ( the groin ones are slightly firmer but this possibly due to my leg infection that I had years back)  2) I am known to have large lymph nodes, when i was a child I had a viral infection and caused 2 lymph nodes to enlarge and they deflated to about 1.5cm in both sides of my jaw and it has been 8 years now with the same size and consistency.  Any other symptoms, I don't have night sweats or weight lose or body fever, however I do feel hot ( possibly attributed to dehydration) I recently literally 4 weeks ago had a blood test ( CBC count, liver and kidney function, TSH, randomized glucose and iron levels) everything turned out perfectly normal.  One thing I might add is that due to the heat, i developed a rash-like-pustule looking dots on my chest and clavicular area, so that might be a reason why.  Anyways, sorry for the long rant..I just need to know if its okay or not. Thanks in advanced =).\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  You may want to check on our cervical lymph node page. Click here! This page has a section about supraclavicular lymph node enlargement.  Following infection, lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.  Another point to take into consideration: In the primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.  However, I strongly recommend being evaluated by your physician. This information does not constitute an assessment of your condition.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Tamer,  Thanks for the fast reply, I did consult my doctor regarding feeling hot, she ran all tests and didn't find anything abnormal. All doctors feel my neck and never find any nodes, so going for another visit to tell them about lymph nodes that are only felt by me will only warrant a referral to a psychiatrist for being an obsessive hypochondriac.  I do of course know the omen behind virchow's node, however due to the structure/mobility/ and feel of this lymph node I am not 100% worried. its <1cm, soft and mobile ( could it still be cancerous even with those properties?)  Also are nodes that are <1cm in supraclavicular area normal in general ?  will viral infections make these node swell like other nodes?  is there anything that is worrisome in my situation?  cheers! dave\n\n",

    "content": "Hello--  I am a 24 yr. old female and I have had what I'm assuming is a swollen lymph node under my jawbone, directly beneath the right ear for about a week.  It is hard to the touch and about 1-2 inches long and about 1 inch wide.  It doesn't stick out much, but my neck is stiff and sore, especially in the morning and at the end of the day.  I guess I would say that it moves very little if I push on either side, but it makes it sore and hurts to move it.     My left side is slightly swollen in the same place, but not anywhere near the size of my right side.  I've had very slight symptoms of a cold (little stuffiness, very tired, some dizziness/disorientation and headaches almost daily).  Could this be something malignant or should I just keep an eye on it?  I don't have insurance until the end of next month, so I could go to the doctor then....   Also, I just noticed today a small nodule on my right breast that looks like a pimple to me.  It is sensitive and bright red.  Could this be related to my other issue?   I have a history of breast, lung, and uterine cancer in my family.  I've had my tonsils out and a UTI surgery when I was younger.  I am currently on Wellbutrin, but have never had any problems.  I'm freaking myself out thinking this is cancer--please help me!! Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kkb5,  Most likely, the lump under your jaw is an inflamed lymph node from an infection.  The lymph nodes in this area frequently will become enlarged when fighting off an infection such as a cold.  The area on your breast is likely not related.  This may simply be an inflamed skin pore.  I think the chances of cancer are very low based on this description.  If both these issues do not improve in the next few days I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.

    "content": "I am a 37 year old male. I recently had a CBC after complaining of a one-off pain in my neck/chest region to my doctor and she felt a blood test should be done. A few of the CBC results were out of range and I am really concerned and I would like to know the significance of the numbers. I've been asked to come back 4 weeks after the initial test to have a repeat test but  am going beserk just waiting to redo the test as I fear this might be non-Hodgkin's lymphoma from all I read so far.  On the CBC test the 3 items out of range are as follows:  Neutrophils -        Low  2          (3.5 - 7.5) Lymphocytes -     High  5.3       (1.5 - 4) Eosinophile -        High  0.9       (0.04 -0.4)       I must add that I'm usually a very fit and active guy, never going to see the doctor or hospital for minor stuffs however I was quite sick with flu recently which only began to get better around the 3rd week of September 2007 and I had the CBC test done around middle October 2007. I am hoping the flu to be the explanation of the abnormal range of my CBC but I am really worried.   I also must add that I have a little lump the size of half a coin just on the crevix between my neck and ear. The little lump moves about when you put your finger on it. As far as I can remember, I've had this little lump for as long as 4 years and never thought nothing of it as it not painfull at all and I thought it was just part of my head make-up.  I cant say i'm a guy that eats alot so cant really say i've lost appetite. I also don't sweat at nite but I don't sleep well. I manage just about 4 or 5 hours sleep every night as I am self employed and tend to work late into the morning.   I would be grateful for any professional input\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lesly1,  Most commonly abnormalities such as these on a CBC are due to a viral infection that can cause the white blood cells to shift to more lymphocytes and less neutrophils to help fight the virus.  The eosinophil count is actually not that high.  The lump you are feeling may be a lymph node associated with the infection.  You may want to have the CBC repeated in several weeks to see if the abnormalities have resolved.  Alternatively, if your doctor believes this is from a virus there may not need to be a repeat done.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - I am a 27 year old female. I have a lump in my upper chest - a little below my collar bone - on the right side of my body. I found it about 3 weeks ago and it doesn't seem to be going away. It is painless & I think I noticed it when I was changing one day. I haven't been sick & don't know how long it's been there. I am also getting these tiny red spots on my arm & chest. Also I am really itchy everywhere! Some nights it's hard to fall asleep because I am so itchy. I'm sure it's nothing, but should I go to the doctor to get these symptoms checked out? Could it be lymphoma? As for my family history - my aunt is the only one who has lymphoma (at the age of 38). My mother had breast cancer & my father had bladder cancer. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Robyncole22,  While lymphoma is on the list it is probably fairly far down in the possibilities.  It may be that you have a viral infection causing all these symptoms.  I would suggest you have this evaluated by your doctor.  The other possibility that should be considered is breast cancer.  A significant number of breast cancers will start in the \"tail\" of the breast that is more up on the chest.  Again, this is less likely but should be considered.  A direct physical exam will help figure this out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I went to a doctor about 6 years ago and he told me that some people have larger than normal lymph nodes. They do not hurt. The ones I have noticed before only get larger when I'm sick, but now I'm finding new lumps on the side of my neck that I did not notice before. I'm not sure if they where there before or not. They are small. Most just slightly bigger than a grain of puffed rice. Again, none of them hurt.   I grow more and more concerned about them. I want to know what they could be or if its just what the last doctor said, larger than average but harmless.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 24 years old female with a question about the lump on my neck. I noticed this bump around 6 months ago because the skin above it constantly itches. I have also been experiencing similar  itching around my anus for the last 1(+) years. I don't know if that is relevant.. Ive asked my gynecologist about the itching and she didnt really see any redness, just suggested I take baths with baking soda. I am now living in Germany and visited a doctor here about the bump on my neck. He said it is an ingrown hair and gave me some cream for it. The bump is hard, seems to be getting slowly bigger (although I honestly don't know), and doesnt hurt. In the last month or so it seems to slide from side to side a bit. After the Dr. said it was an ingrown, I felt much better. But on a trip to America I spent a day with my uncle (a radiologist) who seemed to think that the ingrown diagnosis unlikely/ridiculous. He did not suggest that I have cancer, but did suggest that I have it looked at..(unfortunately, I left america again the day after he examined it). At the time, he said it was fixed and was most likely my lymph node -I believe the occipital. Now it seems to move around a bit more.. but I am still a bit concerned.. and the itchiness is annoying. As much as I don't want to get worked up about it, I don't know if its worth going to another doctor who looks at me for 3 minutes, charges me 100 euros, and tells me its an ingrown hair! sorry if this was too long.. thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Studentin,  It may be that you have a lymph node that has become scarred.  Occasionally after a lymph node has become enlarged due to infection it will shrink but not down fully and remains large enough to feel.  Typically it is painless and can be moved around some.  When these lymph nodes seem to be getting bigger it is time to find out why.  Even though lymphoma occurs it is still relatively uncommon so odds are that this is not lymphoma.  However, uncommon things do happen so it is worth having this evaluated.  You may need to have a biopsy of the lymph node done.  This is a very simple procedure and will give a definitive answer to the cancer question.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written a very good summary of lymph nodes that you may be interested in reading for more information.  It can be found here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I recently had had what I think is a pretty bad sinus infection pain around cheeks, nose, forehead and some pressure behind/around ears (although when I went to the Doctor recently the NP said my nose didn't look that bad). I have one swollen lymph node (that I know of).  I am not sure how long it has been there.  I noticed it about 3weeks to a month ago.  She felt the lymph node and said that she didn't think it was anything serious. She said that it moves, feels rubbery etc. gave me allegra and 7 days of Augmentin. She told me to check it every week for a month and come back to see her then.  I am very worried about this. It is on the left side of my neck by that big neck muscle (but about 3 inches (maybe) under my ear.  I can't tell if it is getting bigger or smaller. It feels bigger when I lay down and not as big when I am standing up.  It is approximately1cm long and maybe .5 cm wide . It seems \"taller\" in the middle  Since I have started taking the medicine I have had more drainage/coughing in my throat.  I am worried about Lymphoma.  I have not had any other symptoms,but I keep reading these things about people finding out they have stage 3 and 4 with no symptoms and it has spread all over their body.  How does she know that it is not something serious? Would it feel different or be larger (how large are lymph nodes that people have who have Lymphoma)?  I am trying not to worry about it or mess with it.\n\n",

However, if they are getting bigger and have been present for a prolonged period of time it is reasonable to consider a biopsy.

Two years ago i had a swelling between the base of my penis and my anus. A lump, It came out of the blue and it swelled to the size of a golf ball. It was extremely painful and made it difficult to walk. Eventually, after two days, it burst emphatically with a lot of brownish and foul-smelling liquid coming out. Since then i've had the same problem in the same area although never as big since.  The real problem/s i have now is that two more have appeared on my inner thigh and they swell up occasionally but never release much liquid. A few of the same currently reside in my left armpit, one which recently swelled until it released more of this foul smelling liquid.  As of yesterday all my lumps seemed dormant until i found one directly below my chin which since has grown and become harder and a lot more painful, to whit, all of the lumps have become slightly active since.  I do not have any medical issues other than this. There is very little history of anything in my family and i have rarely in my life been medicated.   I'm relatively anxious to know if any of you professionals can help me because i don't have insurance and in the US healthcare can be very expensive so i want to make sure that there is a problem not just some over-imaginative and adventurous acne or something.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Frogmatt,  I think it is highly unlikely for this to be a cancer such as lymphoma based on what you are describing.  More likely, you are having spontaneous skin infections.  This is commonly due to a bacteria known as MRSA (methicillin resistant staph aureus).    This bacteria normally lives on the skin in about 15-30% of people depending on the local prevalence.  When the staph aureus becomes more resistant to the antibiotics (hence becoming resistance to methicillin) it also picks up a gene that makes it more able to cause skin abscesses.  I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Often, antibiotics can help the current infections resolve and lessen further events.  If finances are an issue, there are often clinics in town that can see patients for free or reduced fees based on income.  Your local health department can help you find these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

All doctors I have talked to say it is nothing to worry about.  I have some questions.  As far as I know I have had this for two months. If it was lymphoma would I have any symptoms now?  I have had some mild itching, nothing severe and I don\u00b4t need to scratch for relief.   There is no infection, so what could it be.  How is the node measured, can I do it myself?  The right swelling is 'longer' than the left. Is that worrisome?  Both of the swellings especially the right one is more palpable when I kinda stretch my leg.  Is it possible that the right nodes are normal but just a bit larger than the other ones?\n\n",

Please help ,  worried with a nagging feeling i cant get rid off Thankyou in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kmair,  Having a negative analysis of the tonsillar tissue is reassuring but not necessarily 100%.   Overall, it does bring the chances of a cancer down significantly.   There are several other possibilities in addition to cancer that could be causing her symptoms.  Some viruses, notably EBV and CMV, can do things like this.  Also, some fungal infections, such as valley fever, histoplasmosis or tuberculosis can also produce these symptoms.  I would recommend your daughter be evaluated by her doctor and worked up further to find the cause of these symptoms.  If no diagnosis can be made it may be necessary to do a small biopsy of one of her swollen lymph nodes to see what is going on there.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "worried about lymphoma",
    "content": "Hi I'm a 23 year old female and I have had problems for 3 years now.  I have fixed hard lymph nodes on the left side of my neck, along with one on the back of my neck(this one is about 3-4cm big).  I can't tell how big the other ones are because they're all stuck to each other so it's hard to tell them apart. They don't move, are painless, and the big one seems deep and very attached to the neck.  I also have one under my under arm, one in the left cervical area, and recently I found a quarter sized lump in my right breast tissue(I know its possible its fibrocystic tissue, but again this lump is hard and fixed). The first symptom was just the one swollen lymph node on the back of my neck that appeared out of nowhere(I never had a cold or infection of any kind; in fact back when I was 18 and had mono I never had any swollen lymph nodes!)  And then I had gotten a few more.  And then my other symptoms began.  I have had unrelentless fatigue for 2 years, chest tightness/pressure and pain, sweatiness, chronic infections with fevers(this year so far I've had 5), chronic yeast infections(I had 8 in one year)upper back pain, dizziness, headaches and sinus pressure, itchy legs and a red itchy rash below my stomach(maybe a yeast infection that just doesn't go away?) a dry cough(it could or could not be related to smoking) sharp stomach pains that radiate into my chest as well as upper right stomach pain, and occasional pain down my arm.  And these past few weeks I have been very weak.  I've been to a cardiologist who did a number of tests to rule out heart problems.  I've been to a neurologist(no neurological finds) and reumatologist( I never followed up with him though) as well.  So the first PCP I had said I probably have chronic fatigue syndrome. (key word probably; that's not a definite diagnosis) She never thought my lymph nodes were anything.  She seemed annoyed by me. Very careless.  So recently I switched doctors.  My new PCP ordered chest and neck ct's as well as an ultrasound of the right breast.  She did feel the big lymph node on the back of my neck.  Anyway all in all I've had countless CBC's, ANA, reumatoid factor, HIV, hep., thyroid, lyme(three times), and a chest x-ray all of which are negative. I've been to the ER two weeks ago(they did a bunch of blood tests, all fine) because of high blood pressure(145/104) and weakness in the legs(I could barely walk).  No history of high bp.  I had the ct scans done 6 days ago and I am anxiously waiting for results.  I am just afraid that the tests are going to come back and I am just going to hear those terrible words that everything is fine(because it definetly isn't) I know that sounds odd but I don't care what I have I want an answer and fast.  I know my condition progressively is getting worse and I feel like no one has been listening to me.  I know that I either have cancer or an autoimmune disorder.  But because my symptoms first started with the enlarged lymph nodes and then the fatigue and then the chest tightness, and then followed by the rest,  my question is this:  Do I have legitimate reasons for thinking I have cancer?   And if my tests come back inconclusive, should I still have a lymph node biopsy anyway? And if so, how would I ask my doctor without sounding crazy? I appreciate any help.  Thankyou.\n\n",

Most cancers that are showing signs in lymph nodes will progress faster than this.  I would recommend you discuss with your doctor about having a lymph node biopsy done.  This is generally a very simple procedure and can give a wealth of information about what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Long term Skin Rashes, could it be Lymphoma?",
    "content": "Dear All,  About me: 31 yr Male No Past Diagonosis or Surgeries. Any recent diagnosis and medication is below.  Below is the list of symptoms. I would appreciate if you could please advise me with regard to my questions at the end (and any other suggestion is most welcome): 1. I have skin \"rashes\". Not sure how to describe them. But they are NOT itchy, they ARE DARK RED to BLACK, skin is DRY, ROUGH and SCALY.  2. It does NOT pain there (at least so far). 3. One of the rashes is on right thigh (almost in the middle of the thigh)..has been there for almost 10-15 years now. It started out due to bad weather, extreme dryness or cold. But it stayed on and has been like this for 10-15 years 4. The other one developed more recently about a year or two back near elbow on the RHS. It would come and go but it has stayed on now.  (this rash got bigger and freaked me out to go to the doctor). 5. A third one is near the ACL on right leg a few inches below the first rash above. This one has also developed in the last couple of  years. 6. All the above rashes are spread out over a few square inches. 7. My recent blood test shows relative lymphocytes count of 41.9% (reference range 15-49).  I don't have any other past blood test report to compare with. 8. my dermatalogist gave me some version of corticosteroid (external application) for the above rashes and nothing has changed so far.(4 weeks)  9. In my last visit my doctor raised the possibility of lymphoma and suggested biopsy (taking some skin tissue) using local anesthesia.  my questions: 1. Could the above symptoms be lymphoma? 2. Is the relative lymphocytes count too high? and indicative of a problem? 3. I am not very keen on a biopsy: any other tests not involving any cut or bruise that could clear the situation? 4. If at all biopsy is the only way out--is it safe? can it trigger the cancer and make it spread? what are the side effects? Can i get back to work right away after biopsy, literally the next moment as we could after a simple blood test?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pleaseadvise,  Regarding your questions: 1) It could be lymphoma although I think this is highly unlikely.  There are some lymphoma-like conditions that can cause rashes although I think it is unlikely for it to go 10 years without progressive symptoms.  2) Your relative lymphocyte count is normal.  I would not consider this an indication of any specific disease.  3&4) I think a biopsy would actually be quite helpful.  Persistent skin rashes that are not able to be diagnosed often can be determined by a biopsy.  A simple punch biopsy is generally all that is needed.  This biopsy involves numbing the skin with a local anesthetic and using a \"punch\" to remove a small piece of skin (often about 3-5mm in size).  The biopsy site often doesn't even need a bandaid it is so small.  It should be painless.  The biopsies do not increase the risk of developing cancer or causing what ever this is to spread.  The biopsy can be done in the office generally and should not impact your ability to work at all.  Results take a day or two, generally.  The skin needs to be analyzed under a microscope and may need some specialized staining done.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Also my doctor mentioned something like Cutaneous(?) T cell lymphoma and said that it develops as a rash where as in fact it is a sign of lymphoma.

    "content": "Please help... should I worry ?? Doc seems stumpted. Im a seemingly healthy 33 year old woman 5'2 135.  Past surgeries include 2 orthopedic on left ankle and left hand and 4 C-sections last being 11 yrs ago.   Family history Heart Disease is HUGE, Cancer, High Blood pressure and asthma. Currently on Allergra for allergies.  Otherwise very healthy. ~~~~~~~~~ Problem began aprox 3 MONTHS ago when I noticed out of the blue swelling on my right ankle.. it started on the inside portion.  It would be worse in the afternoon/night and would disapate over night being much less in the morning only to reappear when the day progressed.  As time went on the swelling took over more of my ankle and now will occasionally include my calf as well.   About 3 weeks ago I started to notice a funny something not right feeling in my right groin area, not really a pain.  But very noticable when I would move my leg to walk.  Oddly enough after that first day of irritation in my groin, the next day, swelling in my ankle was almost GONE... it was the closest to normal it had looked in months...  Unfortunatly it was short lived and did return.  SOOO somehow I realized that the feelings in my groin were no doubt related to this unexplained swelling.  When I had no irritation in my groin, the swelling was bad... when I did have that irritation in the groin, swelling was better.  ODD... SOO...   Tests done include MRI of ankle only showed significant swelling nothing more. Ultrasound of thigh looking for clots was normal. Finally convinced Doc to ultrasound my pelvis and they saw 3 Enlarged Nodes, the largest measuring 2.5 cm CBC looked normal, he also ordered some thyroid tests that are not back yet.   Im wondering if The enlarged nodes can cause this unexplained swelling, and if so they must have been there all along.  Does this sound like something that should worry me.?  The problem has gone on for so long and all I kept getting was, lets wait another month and see if it will improve.. well obviously time is not going to take this away.   PLEASE HELP !!  Any info would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sharpeiluv,  It would be a bit difficult for pelvic lymph nodes to cause swelling in the ankle only.  The nodes could potentially compress the nerves and lymphatic vessels that drain the leg through the pelvis and cause some swelling.  This would tend to give some swelling of all the leg, though.  If the lymph nodes have been enlarged for an extended period of time it may be wise to have one of them biopsied to see what is going on with them.  If there is suspicion of a blockage, nuclear medicine scans can be used to trace the lymphatic drainage and CT contrast scans can be used to trace the venous drainage of the leg to see if there is any congestion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much Doctor for your reply.  Here is an update. I feel so helpless and at my wits end with this problem.  My Family Doc referred me to a surgeon due to the enlarged nodes.  Surgeon said they are more than likely Reactive and he ordered a CT of my pelvis and abdomen.  All normal except for the nodes which had gotten smaller.   He then ordered a venous doppler which they said was normal.   The swelling still is in my ankle but is much less and is now more prominent in my calf which initially led me to believe that I was getting better because the ankle didnt seem as swollen anymore.  Then the other night my son was sitting by me on the couch and grabbed my calf and squeezed for the heck of it I guess and it left his hand print in my leg... He about flipped.. Thats when I realized that it was now my calf that was very swollen when pressure is applied it will leave a HUGE Dent that will remain for about 15 seconds or so then disappear.   All these tests, all negative What in the world could this be....?? I still have the pain in my lower right side/groin/crease where your leg bends, worse with bending/walking motion etc.  and of course the swelling which seems to be moving up my leg now.   Are there any other tests I should be requesting?? Anything else you might recommend or any additional thoughts on what this may be ??  Im at a loss and feel like Im going to be swollen for the rest of my life... Im only 33.\n\n",

It's been sore for a couple of days now.  I feel pain with it without even touching it, just to turn head, talk, etc... it's so sore. Doesn't seem swollen though, if it is, it's not visible.  Many surgeries in past for female issues, but no surgeries for approx 9 yrs.  Meds are premarin, hydrochlorathozide, atenalol, lisinopril, zoloft, baby aspirin, and lunesta.

It may also be that you have a viral infection that is not causing symptoms because the immune system is fighting it off.  When the immune system becomes active it can cause the lymph nodes to be sore.  I would recommend you have your doctor take a look at this to see if you need antibiotics since this is the second episode.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Specific questions about lymph nodes",
    "content": "I'm a healthy 21 year old female who has recently experienced some swollen lymph nodes on the side of my neck. After thoroughly perusing previous forum posts and Dr. Fouad's help guide to lymph node enlargement, I still have a couple of questions. I should say first that I discovered a swollen posterior cervical lymph node back in May, when I had three itchy bug bites on my neck.  The node measured about 1 cm then, could be felt but not seen, was rubbery, and painless. In July, it was still there, exactly the same.  I saw my doctor about it and he said we should keep an eye on it, though he didn't seem overly concerned.  He also pointed out that the bug bites could have caused it to swell like this and not go down yet. Now it's September and that lymph node is still there, the same as it ever was.  Recently, I've experienced allergies and sinus issues and noticed two new similar swollen nodes above the original one. Just as many others with swollen lymph nodes do, I fear this could mean lymphoma (no fam. history), especially because of the rubbery nature of the nodes and their locations.  Here is where my questions come in: - Do rubbery nodes always mean lymphoma? - What does fixed vs. moveable mean in terms of lymph nodes (I'm not sure how to describe mine)? - Is it normal for sinus issues/bug bites to cause the posterior cervical lymph nodes to swell in particular?  Thank you so much for your help.  I find Doctors Lounge to be a great service and appreciate very much the effort that all of the doctors and nurses on the site put in.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Scooter5052,  I'm glad you find our site helpful.  For those that may find your post, here is the link to Dr. Fouad's cervical node article.  You ask some very good questions.  First, rubbery is actually a good feeling.  Rubbery generally does not indicate lymphoma but, instead, indicates it is a properly functioning lymph node.  Lymph nodes that are cancerous are often described as very hard, like rocks.  Movable lymph nodes are nodes that can be moved around (even just a little bit) by the hand when feeling them.  Fixed lymph nodes give the impression that they are glued to the underlying structures and cannot be moved.  Anything that causes some inflammation can trigger lymph node swelling.  Bug bites can certainly cause some inflammation of the lymph nodes in the surrounding areas.  The posterior cervical chain can be affected by bug bites.  This particular chain is also quite sensitive to viral infections and can become swollen when a virus is in the body (such as with a common cold).  Also, it is relatively common for lymph nodes to remain about a centimeter in size after they have enlarged and never go back down to their original size.  These are termed \"shotty\" lymph ndoes because they often feel like buckshot or BB's under the skin.  These are still normal, functioning lymph nodes just as if they were before they became enlarged.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 yr. old healthy female.  I should start out by saying that I have ocd.  I have always been really afraid of cancer since an acquaintance died of lymphoma when she was around 30.  About four months ago I had a cold and lost my voice.  Right after that I noticed a slightly enlarged lymph node.  It is around 1-1.25 cm in size and Seems to sometimes go down to a little smaller.  I went to the doctor and they said it was mildly inflammed.  Since then two different nurses have felt of it and said that it was nothing to be worried about.  It is soft and very mobile.  It is not always tender but has been some when My allergies were bothering me.  Should this be something that I worry about?  By the way, they said that touching them could keep them inflammed.  I have poked mine to death since I found it cause I am so paranoid.  I have no other symptoms.  No fatigue at all, no night sweats.  I feel perfectly fine.  Please help me!  SO far no medical person is concerned And I just want to make sure.  I am almost positive that it is not growing. Just wanted and oppinion.  thanks\n\n",

It is definitely not hard(100% sure) but it is definite enough to feel.  Like I said earlier it is extremely mobile.  Also, it is not visible through the skin and probobly never would have found it if I didn't stress so much over cancer.  The measurement is mine so it is no exact but the doctor said mildly inflammed, so I am sure it is not huge.  What I want to know is would it have grown enough that I would know for sure that it is growing over a 4 month period and would I expierienced some type of symptom by now.  Please, someone respond.

I have never had a night sweat, no fever or itching.  I am never sick and have only taken antibiotics about 3 times since I was 17.  I did have alot of tonsil problems as a young child but have not had in years.  Please help me as I think that I may loose my mind.  Would my node have enlarged some by this point if it was cancer, would I have other symptoms by now?  Please someone respond and try to help me.  I had it checked in march, May, and asked my kids ped. in july.  the first two felt of it on said only mildly inflammed and the other just said it was nothing to be concerned about.  The ped. based on size and consistancy was not alarmed.  NO one has wanted further testing.  Do you think I need to have a biopsy even it is not growing.  I do not have medical insurance so I hate to do something that is not nesa sary.  Thanks\n\n",

I run every morning 50-60 minutes and I am thin so I am assuming you are thin also since you work out so much. We are able to feel nodes more than others who may be heavier. Also, the node would be growing if it was cancerous.You would also progress in the disease with symptoms. Fatigue is usually one of the 1st ones to realize. Night sweats are another - not just being hot at night either but drenching sweats where you have to change your bed clothes. Don't manipulate the node like it sounds you are doing. This will irritate it and actually make it bigger. Touch it lightly like the docs do. You are fine and I am too. If you start to get symptoms and/or your node grows then be worried. 7 months without any other problems, you are fine!\n\n",

    "content": "31 y/o male. For the past two or three months I have experienced generalized itching and neck pain. I went to the doctor for the itching and was given an antihistamine which helps to some degree. I mentioned what i had been reading about causes of generalized it hing to her and my concern over lymphoma. She felt my glands and said they all felt normal and ordered a blood test to check liver function and other things including sedimentation rate. I was told that all blood work was normal. After about a week I went back and saw my regular doctor (same office as the other doc) for the neck pain. She felt my neck and felt like I had a strained muscle. Besides pain in the back of my neck I had been feeling pain directly under my ear is the node area. I motioned this to her and asked her directly about these nodes which she felt and said they feel normal. I'm curios / worried that something is being missed and wonder if the things that have been done are correct and / or do I need to ask for further testing? I also have had two or three night sweats in the past couple of months although none recently. Is the generalized itching associated with lymphoma more describable (intensity, constant?) thank you for any info you can give me.\n\n",

I have felt \"hot\" at times but when I've checked my temp its mostly been normal except for a couple of times it was 99.8 with a ear scan and normal in the ear can be as much as 99.7 so I guess that ok.  As far as the night sweats go the three episoded I had were drenching in nature but she said that If the were due to lymphoma they would be more consant and I would be experiancing this all the time.

If I don't touch them for some days they shrink but once I start they get irritated. For this long now I have been concerned, more concerned at times than others. When I come back to reality I think, I run 5 miles a day, I lift weights 2X per week, I go to work come home and am busy cleaning, laundry, dinner until bed time. If I had lymphoma I would not have this kind of energy, would have large lumps in my neck by now and be sick. But the little voice in my head still haunts me and makes me scared.

My extreme HA started after my son was born with a cleft lip and pallet.  I have one single enlarged node for the past seven months.  In all actuality it could have been there for years and I would never have known.  IT is around 1-1.3 cm and the first doctor I saw said it was only mildly enflammed.  Noone has ever been worried about it and I have felt very similar nodes in 1/2 the people I know.  I have no fever, have never had a night sweat,(except right after my daughter was born and that was due to changing hormones and was 4 years ago). NO fatigue or weight loss.  I also due vigorous exercise for about 60 min a day 5 days a week, clean cook and run after a 4 year old and a 2 year old all day.  ALso, I am usually tired at night when I go to bed but not extremely and I never can go to bed before eleven o'clock.  I am 23 and extremely healthy and have no family history of lymphoma at all and almost no family history of cancer period.  Mine also seems to worsen after poking and prodding it for days on end.  Do you think that I have cancer? would I know by now.  The only person that I really know that has had lymphoma had lymph nodes the size of an orange.  Also, I might add that I am not expieriencing itching unless I sit and think about itching cause I know that is a symptom of lymphoma.  Then it is not severe itching and a  simple scratch clears it right up.   Cancer seems to be everywhere but in all reality the chances of lymphoma before 40 is only 0.4%.  Help would definitly be appreciated but at this point I am not even sure if a neg. biopsy would calm my nerves.( noone has ever wanted to do a biopsy they all just say I'm fine)  Would I be sick by now or would my node have grown or would I feel tired and run down it this was cancer?

    "content": "I\u00b4m 18 year old male. About a month ago I felt an enlarged lymph node in my groin area. My doctor told me not to worry and said this was common in young people. He said it was soft and mobile, but he did send me to an ultra sound.  There it was revealed that the node was 0,4 cm (0.2 in) in size and the doctor said everything looked normal. Two weeks later I went back to my doctor who said there was no change.  I have a few questions. He said it was mobile. What does that mean? When I feel the node it seems that the skin is only moving but not the lump itself.  Even before the ultrasound the lump felt larger than it really is, why is that? Does 'soft and mobile' mean it is nothing to worry about.  I don\u00b4t have any cancer like symptoms such as night sweats and fever.  There is no history of cancer in my family. I\u00b4m on medications called Cipralex, is that relevant?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Akb,  Generally lymph nodes are called soft when they feel rubbery as opposed to hard like a marble.  Mobility refers to the ability to move the lymph node around.  It should be the lymph node that is moving not just the skin.  Sometimes after a lymph node has become enlarged due to fighting off an infection it may not return to its previous size.  Often these nodes will stay about a centimeter in size.  They subsequently can feel a bit hard but are typically still mobile.  If you're lymph node is not getting any bigger it is likely normal.  My colleague, Dr. Fouad, has written an extensive article on lymph nodes.  The first part is focused on lymph nodes in the neck but the rest is applicable to your situation as well.  The article can be found here: http://www.doctorslounge.com/oncology/d ... rvical.htm  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 32 year old male. Around four months ago, I developed a non-specific skin irritation involving both of my outer ears and cheekbones which lasted for around three weeks, marked by itchy, red, swollen skin.    Around this time I also noticed a lump just behind my right ear on the mastoid process.  At the time, I had two doctors tell me that it was likely an enlarged lymph node due to the skin irritation and that I shouldn't worry about it - was given a topical cream for the rash and no antibiotics.  Now, four months later, the skin irritation is gone (except for the occasional tingling), but the lump remains.  It hasn't gotten bigger, but it hasn't gotten smaller.  The lump is about a centimetre across, kind of flat, and is most noticible when I turn my head to the left.  It is not painful (unless I poke and prod at it awhile, of course), and is somewhat soft to the touch, feeling a little sinewy.  Any idea what this might be?  How concerned should I be?  Thanks.\n\n",

Occasionally, after lymph nodes become swollen they don't fully reduce in size and can remain around a centimeter or so.  The area you describe is appropriate for a lymph node.  If it begins to get larger I would recommend you have it evaluated again.  Otherwise it is probably fine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Around mid June this lymph node became swollen, as a matter of a fact it was quite large. However, the node got smaller and is now around 1cm large give or take. I have had two doctors examine the node, and also had blood work done. The blood test and urinalysis came up normal. Why is this node still enlarged? I have heard that it is very normal for nodes to do this, but I think about it very often and I am constantly messing around with it. Could it be removed? Sometimes I want to rip it out of my neck. By the way I am an 18 year old male.\n\n",

These lymph nodes can take several weeks to return to their previous size.  Some never quite get back to their previous size and remain large enough to feel.  They still work as they should and are not concerning as long as it is not getting bigger.  I would not be concerned.  It is probably a good idea to have your doctor evaluate this lymph node periodically (with your periodic health check ups) to be sure it is not getting bigger.  If it does begin to get bigger you should have it evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "About Febuary 06 I started to get an itchy area around my shins with no apparent rash. This would come and go in intensity but would never completely go away. In March 07 this itching started to spread to my whole body (Legs, arms, torso, back, groin area including scrotum area) and I eventually went to the doctor who prescribed antihistamine tablets(Telfast 180mg) which has eased the itching almost completely, but as soon as I try to come off these tablets the itching will return within a couple of days. The doctor also did blood test which all came back normal(CBC including differential, ESR, LFT & serum tests). I have since been searching the internet to try and find out what could be causing the itching and have started to panic myself into beleiving I may have a Lymphoma. I have just recently spent 3 weeks on holiday away from anything at home that may be causing an allergic reaction with no easing up of the itching, I also do not appear to have any swollen lymph nodes under my arm, on my collerbone, around the groin area or on the neck. Does anyone have any idea what this might be as I am now worried sick that it may be serious.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I am a 30 yr old female and I have a Lump right under my ear between the jaw bone and neck bone i think, where it goes into a triangular shape. I would say it is definantly over 1 cm and is hard to the touch . It is on the left side , I also have a smaller rubbery node on the left side of neck though that has been there for at least 10 yrs. I get frequent headaches on the left side and have also noticed vision in only the left eye when used on its own is becoming more blurred . I also have a pain in my upper back it almost feels like theres a lump which comes and goes. I have developed a cough which is productive but only happens 4 or 5 times per day .Does this mean anything , i feel some pain going into the ear as if the lump is pressing on the bone or something. Thanks in advance  May i also ask rather than posting a second time , my 5 yr old daughter has an enlarged tonsil on the left , it goes half way across the throat , she has had tonsilitis twice in 2 yrs . But one tonsil has remained enlarged and a funny shape with veinish type streaks on it . She has lost 2 kilos in weight , has slight anemia (although doc said its dietry) and her bloods slightly elevated to suggest infection . She has had meds etc no infection found. No GF etc. She has night sweats which make her nightwear damp. We have been to ENT and she is waiting on an appointment to have her adenoids(they are enlarged) and the tonsils removed , the left tonsil will be sent to pathology.They are going to test for lymphoma etc what is the likelyhood of this and how long should we wait on the waiting list for? Bit worried it could take months for an inpatient appointment to become available  sorry I forgot to add my daughter has swollen glands , small size running down the back of her neck either side and a bigger lump under chin/upper neck area  Thankyou again  Kelly\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kelly,  Regarding your lump, most likely you have a scarred lymph node that will not get smaller.  If it is not getting any larger it is unlikely to be concerning.  It is worth monitoring, however, occasionally to see if there is any change.    With your other symptoms it is a good idea to see your doctor and discuss all your symptoms to see if you need any other work up.  Your daughter may have simple enlarged lymph nodes, or may be fighting off an infection currently.  The tonsils are really a variation of lymph nodes and can get bigger with infection.  When one tonsil is larger than the other and the child is sick, an abscess must always be considered.  With her night sweats, etc. testing for lymphoma is reaonable.  By statistical odds, lymphoma is less likely than other things; however, because of its severity it warrants evaluation for.  Another consideration would be infections such as valley fever or histoplasmosis (depending on where you live) that can cause essentially all these symptoms.    I would recommend you continue to follow up with your pediatrician to have her properly evaluated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have posted before but I still need some questions answered.  I am a 23 yr. old female although i was 22 when I found the node.  It is on the right side of my neck about 2 in. below ear on the sternomastoid muscle.   I have no medical history really and no family history of cancer to speak of.  I have always been really healthy for the most part since I was young.  I did have alot of problems with my tonsils when I was pretty young, but have only had to go to the doctor about 4 times since I was 12.  I have no symptoms at all, no night sweats or fever, no itching or fatigue.  I have two young children who neither one sleep all night and I still have no trouble staying up from around 8 a.m. to 11 p.m.   The node has been there to my knowledge for over 6 months.  Early on I went to the doctor because it was sore, not sure if this was infection or from poking on it though but I just gotten over something that had caused me to lose my voice but I did not have to take medication.  The antibiotics did make the pain in it go away, it also may have shrunken it alittle but it did not go away.  It is currently the size of the end of my finger maybe just a little smaller.  The measurement that I get on my finger is 1.2 cm  so I would say that it is around 1 cm and not larger than 1.3.  Definitly to the smaller size of this measurement though.  It is very mobile and soft( I say soft as in I can push into it easily and it is def. no hard. )  Also, according to the doctor it is the only swollen node they could find in my neck.  I have felt under my arms and in my breast and also in groin area and can not feel anything.  I have also asked a nurse practioner that I know and she felt of it and was not concerned and I also described it to my kids pediatrician that I see pretty often, told him size and consistentcy and he said to quit worrying about it.  I know that 1 cm is considered  normal but could 1.2 or so that has been present for at least 6 months with no noticable change be normal also.  Also,  Could my  constant and I mean constant poking be keeping it from going down.  Should I have noticed other symptoms by now or would it have grown if it was Cancer.  I have felt very similar nodes in several people adult and children included and my neice has one the same size and location  in her neck this whole time. I know that you cannot diagnose me over the internet, I just want to know your oppinion, what you would think if it was you or someone you loved.   Please help,  I have ocd and HA that developed after my son was born with a cleft lip and pallet so more than like I would have never found the node if I hadn't been looking, you cannot feel it without knowing where it is.  I actually had to find it and put the doctors hand on it before she could find it.  Your oppinion would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks\n\n",

If you can consciously try to avoid touching it or even thinking about it, there is a chance it will resolve without intervention but if not and it doesn't change, cause pain or show other signs of infection, chances it is something you just have to live with.  So, again, getting used to it and not stressing over it is the best plan.  I would not be concerned that it is cancer and yes, if that was the case, you would likely have other things going on as well.  Also, your doctors would be more concerned if this was a risk.  Try to find distractions whenever you feel compelled to touch it, such as with alternative activities or thought processes, meditation or relaxation exercises.   Take care\n\n",

I noticed when I went to my ENT that he did not poke and \"look for\" any nodes he just touched my neck and pushed in softly. He never did feel anything.  I do know that these nodes are super sensitive and reactive to our poking and proding.  Also, not having the \"B\" symptoms by now really means that we are okay. At the least we would be feeling very fatigued. Let me know how you do. When you feel like you need to touch it, GENTLY press on your neck with your fingers. You will get to where you don't feel it and then start to forget about it. This is what I did. Another thing to think of is if you stop touching it and it does not grow - you do not have lymphoma.   God Bless You Also! Keep those hands off!\n\n",

    "content": "Just to let you know how I was doing.  My HA is totally out of control.  I am now obsessing over my description was accurate enough.  I told everything as truthfull as I know how.  I am just mainly stressing over saying that you cant feel it if you don't know where it is.  I did have to find it for the doctor and almost everyone else that I have made feel of it but I have no trouble putting my hand right on it.  To be truthfull I really figure that it has been there alot longer than I realize.  I have checked my neck for nodes  before but I have never felt of that area.   I am taking comfort in the fact that I remember what it felt like the first time I really felt of it and what position I was in and I can recreate that exact moment and It does not feel any different that it did 6 months ago.  I know that if it was cancer I would have noticed some progression in size or more symptoms.  I know a man that had lymphoma and beat it once.  A few years later he knew it was coming back and just didn;t go to the doctor for a year and a half.  By that time his nodes were the size of an orange.  And it was not just one node but they were everywhere.  These things help but the thing that helps the most is my neice who has an almost identical node in the same location.  I know that I sound crazy since everyone says that I am fine but you have to understand HA to understand how I feel.  After my son was born I went from thinking nothing could happen to me to thinking everything would happen to me.  I know my real problem is my mind and that I just need to give my burdens to GOD.  THanks again for all your help.  Also,  To DEBBIE,  just pressing very lightly on my neck you cannot feel my node you have to push in fairly far,  not hard but not soft and also I know where to look.  My husbands great aunt is currently being treated for breast cancer that did spread into her neck nodes and she says when he examines her, he just uses a very light touch and doesn't press in hardly at all.  PRay for me.    Thanks again, lmbd\n\n",

    "title": "Lymph nodes in neck - very worried.",
    "content": "First, I'm sorry this is so long! I am a 31 yo female with moderate psoriasis and mild psoriatic arthritis. I took methotrexate for about 2 years, stopped about 4 yrs ago.   I have been having problems with fatigue for about 4 months, started with a week of feeling very dizzy and sick in April. Since then, I have had several episodes where I feel terrible for a few days, run very low fever (around 100) and then get better for a while. In June I had severe back/flank pain. I had a bladder infection and possible kidney infection. I took a 1 week course of antibiotics, pain didn't go away. Had a chest x-ray and ct of abdomen to look for kidney stones. No evidence of any problems on my scan, no stones. Also said no enlarged nodes in abdomen/groin, no problems noticed with spleen or liver. Blood work showed wbc count of about 3000 after course of antibiotics, rest normal, SED rate 7. The pain has come and gone to a lesser degree since.   3 weeks ago I noticed a painless enlarged node in my right neck and saw the NP at my GP's office last week. She said that it was smaller than 1 cm, and felt normal to her. She also thought she could feel a few other smaller ones. She thinks that my scalp psoriasis is causing the enlarged nodes and to come back in 2 weeks. Also did blood work, all said to be normal including wbc, sed rate and liver enzymes. I have found several nodes on both sides since, all seem to be in posterior cervical chain all the way down to the bottom of my neck. Most are very small, but definitely there.  I can also feel a small one in my left clavicle. The largest one has not decreased in size at all, not sure if it is bigger (my husband says no).   I have anxiety issues and am extremely afraid of lymphoma as I know that risk is increased for those with autoimmune disorders. I also know that a definitive diagnosis can't be made without biopsy, but I'm wondering what else I should do. The NP said that biospy would only be recommended if the nodes get bigger than 1 cm, is that ok? I called my dermatologists office, and they've never heard of enlarged nodes from psoriasis. Still feeling extremely fatigued, which I know could also be attributed to arthritis and anxiety. At this point, I'm terrified that it might be lymphoma and I am going to be misdiagnosed until it's too late. What should be my next course of action (besides trying to relax lol)? Thank you so much for your time, this is a great service!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Briggscreek,  I think your chances of having lymphoma are very low based on what you have described.  I suspect it is more likely that the nodes you are feeling are reactive lymph nodes that after being enlarged didn't fully return to their non-detectable size.  We call these shotty nodes because they kind of feel like buckshot.    The lymph nodes in the posterior cervical chain very commonly react to viruses.  With your history of prolonged fatigue and ill symptoms you may want to consider being tested for an infection caused by a fungus such as valley fever (coccidiomycosis) or histoblastosis.  These two are quite common depending on where you live.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "8 y/o with swollen lymph node?",
    "content": "About 3 weeks ago my son said he had a bump on the side of his neck (1/2 inch under the left ear, next to the jawbone).  Concerned but with no insurance I looked up online to find that it was probably just a swollen lymph node so I decided not to worry but to keep an eye on it.  Well since then it's grown from about 1/2 inch to just over an inch.  He says it hurts him when you touch it so I have been very gentle when trying to feel it for texture.  From what I can tell it seems unmovable and while not hard like a rock, it's not mushy and rubbery.  He has only complained about a very slight sore throat, so minor he says he barely notices it.  His only complaint is when someone/thing touches it.  Something I've also noticed which may be completely unrelated is he has a bug bit or pimple of some sort above his collarbone that has been there for at least two week but maybe longer.  I've only noticed it the last two weeks because I've wondered why it was still there.  Up until last week we had a kitten that loved to bite and scratch the kids.  Needless to say we got rid of her but now I'm wondering if she scratched him and he got cat-scratch fever which may have caused the swollen node.  Because we do not have insurance or money for that matter I am very reluctant to bring him in without knowing for sure that this warrents a visit to the doc.  How long should this be swollen?  How big is too big?  Because it's grown over the last couple of weeks, should that be concern enough to bring him in?  Other than a very, very minor sore throat he seems perfectly fine so???  I know you can't diagnose something online but I would like to know if this sounds normal or not.  Thanks for any information you can offer!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 20 year old female and about a month and a half ago I got pretty sick, as in my tonsils were swollen and my throat was killing me. I went to a clinic and my temperature was 104. they did a rapid strep test, tested for mono and ran a CBC. My white count was elevated to 15. No strep and no mono. gave me antibiotics and sent me home. I got to feeling better about a week later, then I noticed 3 lymph nodes in my neck (posterior chain) were slightly enlarged. Finally went to my family doctor. He wasn't too concerned, found no other swollen lymph nodes in neither armpit nor groin, but noticed that my tonsils were still swollen, however they weren't red and didn't hurt. Gave me some more antibiotics, ran a cultured strep test, and ran another CBC. Strep came back negative and the CBC was a normal 7.4. He said to not worry about or mess with the lymph nodes and they should clear up.   Well, they are still there, I guess I'm a little paranoid and found single slightly enlarged lymph nodes on various places on my neck, more towards the posterior side. They are small, but definitely not normal... I noticed today that in the original swollen chain of 3 nodes, the 2nd lymph node got really circular, definitely bigger but not huge, and it feels kinda hard.. maybe rubbery? .. Also slightly immobile.  What could be happening here? Should I have it biopsied? Could it by Lymphoma or something else? Or is it really nothing to worry about??  Any help or insight would be really appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Many times after the lymph glands have enlarged due to an infection they remain slightly enlarged. These are known as 'shotty' lymph nodes and do not represent any danger.  Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections.  If your doctor has already examined these lymph nodes and if there aren't any new lymph node enlargement or any new symptoms then you should be safe. If you notice any change from the last time you presented to your doctor you should inform him right away.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  From what you describe you seem to have a submandibular lymph node enlargement. This is located along the underside of the jaw on either side.  These are responsible for the lymphatic drainage of the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae.  Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx.  Given the fact that you are complaining of other symptoms as well and that I am unable to assess the severity of these symptoms I must urge you to seek direct clinical assessment.  Regarding your question about lymphoma and the duration of disease progression: it differs significantly depending on the type of lymphoma. Follicular lymphomas for example can take years to progress. Aggressive lymphomas and leukemias can progress in weeks.  As to the likelihood that you do have a lymphoma it seems unlikely from your description that the submandibular enlargment is due to lymphoma. The question that you need to find out is why they are enlarged and this requires a direct clinical examination.  Please see your doctor as soon as you can.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 41 year old woman, and over the past two months, I have noticed that every other week or so, I get a painful swollen lump behind my ear, back of my neck and now, one on the back of my head. All have been tender and fairly hard to the touch.    I had mono when I was young and had mulitple swollen glands on the back of my neck, which were larger and softer than these seem to be (and I had a lot of them all at once.)    Now I seem to get one at a time and  each will last a few days. I have also had a recurring swollen gland on the lower part of my pelvis, where the leg meets the pelvis bone.  At first I thought that they were associated with having a cold or the flu -- but, despite the sore throat and fatigue  these symptoms have not fully developed.   Tonight I discovered  a new lump on the back of my head. The last one was on a lower part of my neck.  I have had a migraine all day, my throat hurts and I feel somewhat dizzy and weak.  so I know that most likely that I am fighting an infection -- and that this will go away on its own.....  However, I am a little worried because this now seems to be a recurring thing -- and it has never has happened in the past when I had a cold or flu -- PLUS-- I was recently diagnosed  with \"severe anemia\" and was told it was \"chronic\" due to the small size of the blood cells, low blood count and the low amount of blood in my body. I have been taking multi-vitamins with iron but have not yet had additional tests.   ALSO -- I  am taking a lot of meds right now. I read that seratonin can affect the body -- so you should also know that and I am taking Zoloft, Wellbutrin AND Ritalin (for depression and ADD)   Plus I  just started  Lamictal about 2 weeks ago and since then have been waking up with bad headaches. Todays was really bad plus today I have had a stiff sore neck and shoulders.   (however, the swollen glands began  beforeI started  the lamictal.)  Other issues are as follows:  I have endometriosis (so heavy menstrual bleeding) I have a thryoid cyst -- about the size of a nickel.  This was discovered about 4 years ago. At that time,  and again last month, I  had a complete thyroid  blood  work- up -- and  all thyroid levels were normal. However, I  have not a thyroid biopsy...  I bruise VERY easily.  And, also have had frequent bouts of diarrhea for the past few months.  So...considering this cluster of symptoms and issues (which may or may not be related) do you feel that I should consult a specialist? Do you think the swollen glands are connected to the anemia -- or are they a symptom of something else entirely?  Thank you in advance  for your thoughts.   Warm Regards,  Rebecca\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Rebecca,  I hope you are feeling better. From what you said I feel you need to be evaluated by a physician.  The picture you have explained regarding the lymph node enlargement does not see too alarming. However, I am concerned about your anemia and the fact that you bruise easily.  If all of your complaints are taken seriously, I think it would be wise to exclude anything serious first.  You should consult your primary care physician, he may or may not refer you to a hematologist/oncologist based on his evaluation.  Good luck and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Seemingly generalized painful lymphadenopathy",
    "content": "Hello,  For the past month and a half, I have had several slightly swollen but tender lymph nodes in different places on the left side of the body, and I am very concerned.  I am a 32 year old female with a history of hypothyroidism and depression/anxiety (taking Wellbutrin and sertraline). I first began noticing painful left side cervical lymph nodes that were swollen - moveable and squishy and a few days later noticed a swollen inguinal lymph node on the left side that was also moveable and soft. Additionally, I have history of fibrocystic breasts, frequently with pain on the left side of my left breast which radiates to my left armpit. I have palpated this region and I do not feel any enlargement but there is a pressure there.   After discovering these swollen nodes, I went to the doctor, who palpated these nodes and did not seem overly concerned. I had a CBC which was \"normal\", Because these symptoms did not go away, I again went to the doctor (different one) who was not overly concerned either and had another CBC done which was also normal. At that time, my TSH was tested and it was normal as well. I have also seen my gynecologist who did a pelvic exam which seemed normal. My last pap was in Novermber which was also normal. My only history of recent infectious illness was in March in which I had a terrible sore throat/fatigue and swollen nodes in these areas (including inguinal) on the left side. I had also had a mole (described below) removed the same week of that infection. I recently had two cavities filled on the left side, but the swelling/pain in my neck still has not disappeared nor has my inguinal node. At this time, the inguinal node pain is radiating to my left pelvic bone area. I had had no fever, night sweats, or weight loss.  I have already had mono and a TB skin test which was negative. The only other injury that I have had is a mole that was removed on my stomach adjacent (left side) to the belly button. This mole has a history of being atypical and has grown back twice but pathology always says that we have gotten it all.  I am making myself sick with worry, particularly because I can feel the pain/pressure constantly. Is it possible that these are two seperate issues (different causes for different regions) or related? Should I go to the doctor *again*? Thank you for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Generalized lymphadenopathy is always a puzzling entity. The presence of fever may suggest an infectious cause or lymphoma. The presence of rash may suggest an infectious or autoimmune process. We tend to request a full blood count to exclude hematological causes. A lymph node biopsy is needed if the picture is suggestive of lymphoma.  Essentially 5 broad etiologic categories lead to lymph node enlargement (Ghirardelli, 1999).   An immune response to infective agents (eg, bacteria, virus, fungus)  Inflammatory cells in infections involving the lymph node  Infiltration of neoplastic cells carried to the node by lymphatic or blood circulation (metastasis)  Localized neoplastic proliferation of lymphocytes or macrophages (eg, leukemia, lymphoma)  Infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders)   Infections Infectious mononucleosis.  Cytomegalovirus may cause a syndrome similar to infectious mononucleosis.  TB: In a child with tuberculosis, generalized lymphadenopathy may indicate hematogenous spread of tubercle bacilli.  Brucellosis may accompany chronic or intermittent lymphadenopathy.  Salmonella infection can correspond to generalized adenopathy.  Tularemia may be accompanied by regional or generalized adenopathy, most commonly cervical, with local tenderness, pain, and fever.  Bubonic plague is caused by Y pestis. The list goes on and on. You may want to look at a more exhaustive list here. The thing to remember is that in many instances the immune system can overcome the infection and what is left is a number of small lymph nodes that tend to remain more or less the same size.   Naturally I am unable to help you reach a diagnosis through the internet but what I can do is answer your last question. It would be safe if you were examined by a doctor he was not concerned. As to when you should consult your doctor again: if there is an increase in the number or size of the enlarged lymph nodes or if any new symptoms arise.  References: 1.

It has not changed at all in the six months that I have known that it was there(it could have been there longer as I just recently became obsessed with lymphoma so I never felt before.  I have had no other symptoms, no night sweats,no fever, no fatigue, no weight loss, nothing.   Ijust want to know if this is normal to have one lymph node that is larger than the others.  By the way the doctor did say that it was only mildly inflammed if that tells you anything.  I would really appreciate your help as this is driving me crazy.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I am a 29 year old female.  I am concerned about swollen lymph nodes in my right groin area, between pelvis and right thigh.  I have had some symptoms over the last 4-6 weeks:  Bowel movement changes: urgent need to have a bowel movement, cramping, water stools Mild tender abdominal twinges  This lasted for about 4 weeks. Has eased up now.  Went to my doctor as had a pressure type feel in pelvic area (exactly where lymph nodes are swollen now). Not painful, just pressure and slight burning feeling. Just concerned. She had me lay down and she felt my belly.  It was rather tender on the right side of my belly when she pushed in it, and also in the middle, not much on the left side.  She considered Irritable Bowel Syndrome and said to watch it for the next few weeks to see if it keeps up. Tender belly could be due to IBS or possibly a viral infection. (I had a urine test to test for UTI, came back normal. Also had basic blood profile done & everything fine.  Had a few other symptoms: no appetite, tired, feeling of \"burning\" in belly, hip, down thigh. Not painful, just there.  Bowel movements seemed to get better, still come on occasionally, but overall better.  For about 1 week now I've had a burning type sensation in my tailbone area. Again, not painful but just present. Tingling in my arms & legs.  Now, I'm freaking out because I found what I think is a swollen lymph node in my groin. (In exactly the area I felt pressure, burnng feeling before) It is long and hard, a LITTLE tender but not too much. Maybe because I keep pushing on itt. It's firm and long. (When I say long, it seems like a few bunch together in a thin line).  I'm freaking out thinking it's something cancerous. I know that lymph nodes tend to swell if you're fighting an infection, but why am I getting one in my groin?   Is this normal?  Please tell me your opinion asap. Thanks so much. Sally\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The swellings you have described in the right groin region are probably lymph nodes as they occur in a lymph node region.  The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, i.e., laterally) almost as you described.   Since your doctor has examined you, I assume they are just shotty nodes due to previous or recent infection in the area drained by this group of lymph nodes.  The inguinal lymph nodes drain the foot, leg, thigh, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, and lower anal canal.   Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, genital infections including STDs and cancer. In any of them the lymph node enlargement can occur on one side.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.  If it is painful or tender this indicate infection or inflammation which will subside after recovery.  Regarding the GI symptoms, I agree with your doctor it could be due to GI infection (mostly viral).  Other possible causes to be considered include: - IBS if the symptoms are recurrent and stress related. - Ovarian and other gynecological causes - Appendicitis especially if there is fever and increase in the white blood cells seen by Blood tests (which your doctor excluded) - Urinary tract infection (which was excluded too).  During the period of GI disturbance, the intake of plenty of fluids, and light meals will help.  Follow up with your doctor and serial examination of the lymph nodes are essential . Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The fact that this swelling is painful makes the possibility of infection and inflammation very high.   According to your and your doctor description (the lump is behind the ear but more close to the hair follicle, mobile and soft to firm) makes two possible causes very considerable.  - Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection. Follicultis is commonly seen in this area of skin where hair follicles get infected and may result in a secondary lymph node swelling behind the ear.  - A lipoma is also possible as your doctor told you and when infected it gets bigger in size and painful.  A course of antibiotic prescribed by your doctor will help in alleviating your symptoms and in making the diagnoses more clear.  Exclusion of other causes like cancer is essential especially if the lesion doesn\u2019t subside on treatment or others appear .  Serial clinical examination and follow up of the lesion size is essential.   Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

There are 2 main mucles on the back of my neck going under my skull the left muscle is swollen and sore and there is a lump under my skull and the swelling is just under the scalp over my skull.  The pain strecthes about 2 inches and the lump I can feel throbbing or pulsing.  The lump is nickel sized.  I did not have a head injury lately. I had 1 person said it appeared red another said no. I Just noticed this last night and it has not gone down but I do keep checking it - I am worried. Today I did have a headache and dizziness.  I was lightheaded after I blew dry my hair upside down like I normally do but don't get lightheaded from.\n\n",

Two of my enlarged nodes are along the \"tendons\" on each side of my neck, and when I push one, the other moves.  I can freely move the skin around each of them, but they are affixed to the tendons.  Is this \"immobile?\"  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 19 year old male living in the US. I have been having throbbing tightness/soreness in my shoulder and neck and sometimes wraps around to my throat for about three days. This is only on the right side. I figured it was just a pulled muscle or something from lifting weights or sleeping in a strange position, but when I felt around my neck and shoulder trying to find a knot, I found a small movable lump on the right side of my throat about an inch above my collar bone.   I'm in good shape and have no history of cancer, although there was a mass found in my right tibia via x-ray a couple months ago that was diagnosed by an orthopedic surgeon as nothing more than a bone island.   I am guessing this is just a swollen lymph node and has nothing to do with the soreness, but I just want to run it by others before making a big deal of it or going to see my GM. I have no other symptoms. My appetite is fine, my weight hasn't changed, and I feel no fatigue, nausea, dizziness, or pain in other areas.   I suppose I should also note that I have always had a fear of cancer and have suspected cysts and swollen lymph nodes as tumors on several other occasions. I apologize if this seems like a waste of anyone's time.\n\n",

    "content": "The area you are describing is packed full of lymph nodes.  It is very likely that the lump you are feeling is a slightly enlarged lymph node.  This may be due to a recent infection, or possibly that the lymph node had been swollen with a past infection and never quite shrank back down to undetectable size.  Lymph nodes like this are termed shotty lymph nodes due to their resemblance of buckshot or BB's.  If it is swollen from an infection it may actually be a little tender and could be contributing to your neck pain some, although your pain sounds a bit more extensive than would likely be caused by a single swollen lymph node.  Occasionally lymph nodes can become infected with a bacteria as well.  These nodes tend to become fairly large and painful and often require antibiotics to resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

None are wider than my pinky finger, with the smallest one the size of a BB. I have perfect health and never felt better.  I just have a few questions about Lymphoma:  1. If you have had swollen lymph nodes for a year and they have not changed, nor have you developed any other symptoms, is that a good sign that they are not cancer?   2. On average how long does it take to start developing symptoms of lymphome once enlarged nodes are found?  Thanks, Tanner\n\n",

Lymph nodes that are cancerous are classically described as hard, immobile and changing (enlarging).  Symptoms of lymphoma can vary dramatically in terms of timing.

Infections can definitly cause these and they say that sometimes they take months to go away, and may never return to normal size.  Normal is considered up to 1 cm.  mine is just slightly over.  It should be soft( not hard) moveable, tender(most of the time but not always) not a matted group of lymph nodes( a smooth surface) and not growing.  If it fits in this category your probobly ok but check back with your doctor if it continues to worry you.\n\n",

I had to be placed on a low hormone birth control because it made my breast ache all the time.  I would think that at 20 your chances of breast cancer would be low but I am currently terrified of lymphoma and I can tell you that your chance of getting it is 0.4% yes thats right 0.4%.  Do you have any other symptoms, Night sweats, fatigue, weight loss.  Try not to stress.  I would think there is a reasonable explanation for this.  Try getting off the birth control for a while.  it just took about 3-4 weeks for mine to improve after changing.  But mine was both breast so just to be safe, ask your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "28yo female with drenching night sweats, petechiae, fatigue, and alcohol sensitivity (feeling of pressure at base of neck and in groin within seconds of consuming alcohol).  I was referred to an oncologist who ordered CT scans of neck, chest, and abdomen along with a battery of blood tests (including autoimmune, mono, Lyme), all of which have come back within normal limits. I am scheduled for a PET scan on Saturday. When I asked the Dr. why she is still pursuing this dx, she replied that CT scans and blood work are not definitive for a dx of Hodgkins lymphoma, which is what she suspects.  My questions are: 1)is it possible to have HD and not have it show up on ANY test besides a PET scan, and if so, why not just PET scan first (besides cost, since I have full insurance coverage)?  2)can I assume that because all the other testing is normal so far that if the PET scan shows some cancerous activity that it is being caught early...or can HD be in an advanced state and the testing can still read normal?  3)are there any other conditions besides the ones that have already been ruled out that could cause the symptoms I'm experiencing? Dr. has R/O lupus, hemol. anemia, RA, etc.\n\n",

    "content": "Update-not long after I posted this question, I received word that my insurance company won't approve a PET as a diagnostic tool--they consider it \"exploratory\" and won't approve it without a tissue diagnosis (biopsy). Of course, my oncologist can't biopsy something she can't see on a CT scan, so I'm forced to wait.  The scary part is I have an oncologist, my primary care physician who referred me to an oncologist, and the doctor at the insurance company (who told my oncologist (who told me), \"Yup...sounds like lymphoma to me.) all saying my condition reeks of lymphoma. As of yesterday, my oncologist maintains we should wait 4-6 weeks for me to be re-evaluated, and in her words, \"I'm going to do everything I can to find something we can use to get this test.\" The only other option is for me to pay $6000 out of pocket for the test, and the oncologist suggested that since all the other tests suggest that if I do have lymphoma that it's in the early stages, if I wait I can avoid the financial hardship of paying cash and there's a better chance of something showing up on it.  Like I mentioned above, it's particularly disconcerting to have three different doctors suspecting lymphoma and having my fate be in the hands of the insurance company, who obviously isn't up on the use of PET as a tool for the diagnosis of lymphoma. I suppose the upside is that my oncologist has assured me that she can treat the symptoms in the meantime, so that's helpful.  So my new questions are: 1) Let's say I do have lymphoma but it's super-early. How quickly can it spread and am I risking my chances of effective treatment if I wait even 6 weeks? 2) Would it be reasonable at this time to compile all my blood test, CT scan results, etc. and forward them to another oncologist for a second opinion--perhaps in an effort to appeal the insurance company's decision? 3) Are there any other suggestions you (as a doctor) or other members (as people in the same situation) can make?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I apologize for the delay in responding to your posts.  I understand your concerns.  I'll try to give you some answers as best I can but keep in mind I am not an oncologist.  PET scans are an excellent tool for following lymphoma.  Most of the data I was able to find on them show their use in assessing for complete remission after the diangosis has been made and treatment has been given.  There was less information about using it for diagnosis.  It does seem to makes sense that it would be a valuable tool in finding any cancer spots.  However, it may be the reason the insurance is not willing to pay for the test since it does not appear to routinely be used for diagnosis.  I would agree with your doctor that if you do have lymphoma it is in the very early stages.  I suspect waiting a few weeks will not be a harm, although it is always best to make the diagnosis as soon as possible.  Your oncologist can continue to talk to the insurance company to try to get them to approve the PET scan.  Best wishes.  I hope you are able to resolve this issue soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply, Dr. Lowe. I hope I'm not being presumptuous by asking one other thing, if you have time to answer--and that question relates to whether or not it would be jumping the gun to solicit a second opinion at this point in the game.  Perhaps it's my way of feeling \"useful\" for the next few weeks while I await my next appointment, but I was considering compiling all of my lab reports, CT scans, doctor notes, etc. and forwarding it to another doctor. I think my hope would be that maybe the opinion of another physician might tip the scales and my insurance company might approve the scan.   At this point I'm probably walking a fine line. I want my oncologist to believe that I trust her jurgement, since if this is HD, we're going to be working together for a while. I do like her and I don't question her at all.  I know she wants the PET scan for diagnosis. But I know her hands are tied by the policies of my insurance company (I got the sense from talking to her that she really advocated for me when she dealt with them). But by the same token, if another physician who wasn't personally vested in my outcome (read: liability, financially, etc.) came up with the same recommendation--that a PET scan is needed for diagnosis--perhaps the insurance company might be more willing. I know Dana Farber has a reasonably-priced ($750) online consult service.  So I guess the question is whether it's better to sit on my hands for the next few weeks or if my cause would be better served by really advocating for myself; after all, if my oncologists believes a PET scan is necessary to diagnose what she believes to be HD, then shouldn't I do anything I can to make that happen?\n\n",

I just did another xray yesterday since it has been 6 months since the first xray and the lymph was still enlarged.

    "content": "Hi, sorry about the delay in responding.  Our board is quite busy.  Regarding your lymph node, your original description is very consistent a reactive lymph node that increased in size after an infection then subsequently never shrank back to its original unnoticable size.  This is termed shotty adenopathy.  I suspect given your recent illnesses that produced some sores in the mouth, that the enlargement you now have may be due to this.  However, with a lymph node that is progressively getting bigger a biopsy is a wise thing to do just to be sure.  I don't think you have much to worry about but the biopsy will help settle the issue so you will know you have nothing to worry about.  Best wishes.  Please note, your previous post was removed just to help keep the board neat since this is the same question.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  I had a surgical biospy for suspected lymphoma and the results are somewhat confusing.  My Doc told me \"don't owrry, you're fine,\" but he couldnt really explain what the results emant.  Hopefully I am summarizing the \"important\" parts below!   Findings were:  - an expanded population (~11%) of immunophenotypically aberrant CD2+ CD5+ CD7+ T cells that are *double negative* CD4 - CD 8 - abd CD 3 -, but are \"mature\" (CD45(bright)+ TdT- CD1a-, CD34- and do not express CD16 CD 56 or CD 57.   - there is eveidence of polyclonia rearrangement only, without any evidence of a dominant clone  - the significane of this abnormal t-cell expansion is uncertain and it reamins enigmatic.  While it may represent a reactive proliferation of atypical NK/T cells, the cells appartnly lack significant expression of cd16, cd56 cd 57.  - Although the lack of cd3 cd4 and cd8 may suggest a presursor t-cell expansion, the bright cd45 and lack of cd1a cd10 cd34 tdt expession mitigate against this consideration.  Should I seek a second opinion on the biopsy material?  The end result seems very \"conditional,\" with many \"odd things\" in the biospy.  My bone marrow biopsy showed \"mildly hypercellular bone marrow with trilineage hematopoiesis.  Prior symptoms were a single swollen node for 9 months, followed by an overnight swelling of two more nodes, fever for 16 days, bone pain, fatige, and 12 pound weight loss.  It's been two months since the biopsy and I still have the swollen nodes and the bone pain, but the fever has resolved.  Thank you for any suggestions ... I am terrified that they are missing something or that I need to pursue this further.  Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "I suspect that most of your findings are consistent with an immune reaction to a viral infection, especially given that you had new nodes that appeared \"overnight\".  I would recommend that you discuss your biopsy results with a hematologist/oncologist.  The heme/onc specialist will have the expertise necessary to properly interpret these results.  From what I can tell, they did not see anything definitive of lymphoma but there was evidence of a \"ramped up\" bone marrow which may be due to your recent illness.  The thing that makes me a little suspicious is that the fever lasting 16 days is unusual for a viral infection.  Also, they generally do not cause weight loss.    Follow up with your doctor is very important becuase your symptoms are not typical of a common cold and your biopsy does have some atypical cells in it (though not overtly cancerous).  Please keep in mind that my knowledge in this area is quite limited so none of what I am saying should be considered expert opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am female and 27.  Early last June 2006 I noticed two enlarged, pea sized left supraclavicular bumps that my doctor told me were lymph nodes.  They were somewhat soft and movable.  My doctor took a CBC, which turned out to be normal.  They didn't go away though, so I had them excised and biopsied in August and was told they normal.  I didn't think anything more of it, but in December I felt about 3 or 4 more enlarged lymph nodes in the same place.  I was worried since the other ones were removed and whatever caused the others to enlarge had spread to more lymph nodes.  I don't have any other symptoms of anything.  No fever, or night sweats.  So, all together now, I have had enlarged nodes for almost a year.  My medications include Zoloft for 4 years for panic attacks and I never had any side effects from it.  Also, I have been taking Allegra-D for allergies in the spring and summer for about 2 years.  There is no history of cancer in my family.  I am wondering if maybe the biopsy could have been wrong though and could have lymphoma.  What are the chances my biopsy could have been misread?  Thank you very much. Brie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Everyone,   I'm posting for some advice. My mini story is:   I'm a 28 yr old mum of 2, and have been having some problems since before christmas. The first thing was a little lump which came up in my left armpit (no pain, just slight discomfort).  I was given some antibiotics to clear it up, but the following day i can down with a kidney infection and was given some excellent antibiotics for it (thus forgetting about the lump which went down anyway). I also had a blood count done mid Nov, and was told i have low white cell count (no treatment neccessary).   Around the same time, i also developed a sore throat and now still have a more husky voice, with a difficulty swallowing (it feels like i am holding my throat tightly) - not terrible, but uncomfortable.  I have also had an absolute tiredness which i just cannot shake and have been having breathlessness for about 6 months (i had astma as a child and assumed that it had returned).   My G.P referred me to ENT clinic in jan. I saw Dr there who arranged for bloods and a thyroid ultrasound (am due to go back in 3 weeks for result but am assuming nowt serious as it's been a few weeks since i had it done).   The only thing thats really bothering me is that i have a swollen lymph node above my right collarbone (it's been the same size since jan) - i think it's the supraclavicular. It feels about the size of a malteser and i think it might be pressing on a nerve of something because my right arm often feels like i've been given a 'dead arm'.   I can feel a couple of much smaller bumps around the same area (but i'm not sure that they are abnormal). Also, i now have a dull aching in both armpits.  I have also recently (last 2 weeks) developed a lump in my mouth, on the gum behind my bottom front teeth. This is only size of a small pea, but is quite hard, no pain though, the same goes for a lump behind my right ear.   I have read about Hodgkins and NHL and am a bit of a hypochondriac who assumes the worst, but was wondering if anyone can give me their opinion. I feel really embarrassed going back to my G.P (again) but do feel rather anxious about it. Obviously, because i have now read up a bit on HL/NHL, i'm prepared to accept that some of the symptoms could be in my head, but the lymph node definately isnt (i've made everyone i know confirm this!!)  Many thanks in advance x  P.S, just read the stuff i should include;  28 year old female, no previous illnesses. No significant family history of cancers.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 33 year old female.  I recently discovered a hard, non-painful, mobile lump above left clavicle that is slightly larger than 1cm.  I have no other enlarged lymph nodes and have not recently been sick.  I went to the doctor and had bloodwork done (CBC).  My white blood cell count was good but my red cells showed that I am anemic (level was 10.2).   I did have a miscarriage in Sept. 2006.  Following the miscarriage, my doctor said I was \"borderline anemic, but not iron deficient.\"  Now I am \"officially\" anemic.  Because of the location and characteristics of the lump on my neck, I am of course concerned about lymphoma.  I am also concerned about the anemia.  Could the two symptoms be related and if so what does this mean?? I am scheduled for a CT of the neck next week and my doctor also wants to investigate what could be causing the anemia.    Thanks for your help!!\n\n",

Couple of weeks ago, I told my husband that I feel as if things are on me, feels like a bug has landing on me and light prickling sensations. Keeps me awake sometimes because as I am about to drift off, along comes the sensation. Anywhere on the body, face, hands, feet or head. This I thought was a good explanation of feeling exhusted. I take Adderall for ADD which (surprisingly) helps me feel better! And live with a headache most of the time. Rangeing from dull ache to full blind migraine. He poo-poohed it and said I was being silly. I also have night sweats (didnt think anything of this either). And feeling nausea (put this down to Adderall) Then last week I found a small pea sized lump at the base of my neck and collar bone. I have had no illnesses. But I have lost 30 lbs over last 18 months! (Adderall??) I am not a sweet tooth person (rather have cheese and biscuits than dessert.\\) but I have had a NEED for sugary things.\n\n",

I thought maybe it could be heartburn since I had eaten just a couple of hours prior. The pain worsened and it became painful to swallow food and became tender to the touch around my sternum. The pain is no longer there but it still hurts to swallow food. Just this evening I noticed that the lymph node in my underarm on the left side was inflammed and painful to the touch. I am concerned that there may be something more serious going on here, as I have never had any health issues or problems in the past. If anyone has any suggestions that would be great. I just wanted to know if there was cause for concern and whether or not I should contact my health care provider.   Thanks.\n\n",

I am now 19 years old and have only seen growth as my head itself has grown with my age. The majority of the lump is hard, almost feeling like bone or hard muscle. However i have always had this little circular part at the top of the lump that i am able to move around back and forth. My doctor has never seen it as an issue so I have not worried about it at all. However, I am a bit of a hypercondriac so i worry from time to time. Is this somthing that could be dangerous to me now or somewhere down the line.  Oh also it feels as if the muscle attached to it on my neck is thicker on the side of the lump toward the top.  Thank You.\n\n",

It is larger in the evening and morning and then seems to get smaller or disappear after I am up and around .   My ear was also quite sore and ringing so I went to my primary care doctor in Feb. .  She removed some impacted wax but told me there was no infection. Immediately after the wax removal , the ear pain,  ringing and  node went away for a couple of weeks.  The ear pain  (although to a lesser extent) and the node returned.  My doctor looked at the ear again and says she sees no infection or wax .  She says the node is so tiny she can barely feel it and she does'nt seem to believe me when I tell her it fluctuates.  I read that touching the node can inflame it so I did not touch it for 2 weeks and it is still the same.  I am still having ear pain and the area around the node is so sore.  If  I press on the node there is a lot of pain in my ear.  Can there be an infection further down where she cannot see?  Can a node take this long to resolve? Can this be something else?\n\n",

For the past month I have had a hard, immobile lump on  the back of my neck on the right side just at the hair line.  It is about 1/2 inch in size.  Just recently I felt 3 smaller lumps in a linear pattern  about 1/2 inch apart and 1/2 inch below this lump.   Also, I have what feels like a pea (assuming its a lymph node) on the front of my neck on the right side about an inch away from my adams apple and up a little bit that i can move around.  Also, for the past year I have had an enlargened lymph node about an inch diagonally down on the left side of my neck just under my jaw  that is immobile, and about half the size of a pea.  My symptoms:  When I bend over to pick something up or tie my shoes, I get a headache.  When I stare at my computer, or leave my head turned to watch the tv, or stare at the chalkboard in class my neck gets a little stiff on the right, back side where I have that larger, immobile swollen lymph node.  My jaw makes a cracking sound, not painful whatsoever, when I open my mouth.    Also, every now and then when I swallow my saliva, it feels stragne.  Not painful like when I have a sore throat, but it grinds near my adams apple sometimes.  I take creatine, glutamine, and R-Alpha Lipoic Acid for when I work out.\n\n",

I dunno what is it, but I tried to pull it out, and when I got some of it with the tweezers it was mushy and it smelled really bad. Odd how that worked because like I said it is prickly and fells like fishing line with the touch of my tounge. And suggestion, I went to the doctor but they did not seem to care, neither did the e.r. If it is not a big concern how come I can not find any info on this?\n\n",

    "title": "long standing enlarged neck lymph node",
    "content": "Dear doctor,    I am very worried of a palpable lymph node on the lateral side of my neck. It has been present for >5 years. It is of rubbery consistency, not fixed to underlying structures and movable, non-tender (unless during the period of sore -throat, it become tender and larger). It is of around 1cm in diameter, sometimes smaller. My family physician said it didn't warrant any investigation but performed blood test of EBC screening for NPC for me (which is negative), I have no family history of NPC.    May I ask what could it be? It is belonged to the posterior triangle of the neck lymph node chain, seems one smaller also on left side, but not often palpable. I am afraid if it could be a low-grade lymphoma or other carcinoma. Would you please kindly give me some advice? I have a history of tonsillitis during my childhood as well. CBC has been performed annually and no abnormality detected. Thanks for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "If it has been present for nearly 5 years it almost certainly is not lymphoma.  Lymph nodes that have lymphoma are generally hard, often immobile and would tend to continue to enlarge.  What you are describing is more likely consistent with a normal lymph node.  Probably, at some point in the past, you had an infection that caused the node to swell.  Occasionally swollen lymph nodes don't shrink back down to unnoticeable size.  They may end up staying slightly enlarged and palpable (referred to as shotty lymph nodes).    If infections occur, the node may swell larger for a period of time then return to its previous size.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Mystified in Wyoming--Normal CBC negate Lymphoma/Leukemia??",
    "content": "I am a 41 year old, very fit male residing in Wyoming.  In January of this year I began to experience testicular swelling (rt side only) and associated pain.  The urologist concluded epidemyitits and prescribed antibiotics.  Within a couple of weeks, the swelling did not resolve and an ultra sound was ordered.  The test was negative as far as testicular mass but positive for for a hernia.  Two years ago, I had bilateral hernia repair.  So, back to the surgeon I go.  The surgeon orders an abdominal and pelvic ct which was normal other than some degenerative back issues in the lumbar area . The surgoen does not believe that there is a hernia.  The testicular swelling has since disappeared but the pain has not.  For the last month, the lymph nodes on my right side, specifically, the superficial subinguinal glands are swelling and continuing to grow,  The largest is about 5 cm and another is 3 cm.  They are painless, not moveable and have a rubbery texture, but are not hard.  My Gp ran a CBC (with diff) last week that showed elevated AST and ALT, but the blood counts were within normal limits.  A subsequent hepatitis test was negative.  At the beginiing of the week, I began developing bruising (about the size of a checkbook) on the inside of both thighs with the bruise on the right side being much darker and defined.  I have had no trauma in this area whatsoever (or on the legs or feet).  For the last several months, I have experienced drenching night sweats at least once a week (sometimes more often).  I have not had a cold or respiratory infection for six months or better.  In the last 30 days, I have experienced groin pain (feels like tugging) and pain in the right flank, both right above the hip and below the rib cage.  The testicular pain continues but is intermittant.  I am fatigued and tired, although I am very active physically so fatigue is not all that uncommon for me.  I have not had multiple sex partners for at least three years (I am newly married) and a s a result, STD seems highly unlikely.  An internet search with these symptons identifies lymphoma and leukemia as possibilities, but with the normal blood counts, doesn't this rule out these conditions?  The physicains here are stumped and any assistance you could offer would be most appreciated.  Right now, the advice is to wait three weeks and see if there is improvement, call immediately if the symptoms are worse and come back if they stay the same.  I have also been advised to stay off any pain medication whatsoever as well as other items that may elevate the liver enzymes.  What are your thoughts and where do I go from here.  Do the blood tests rule out leukemia and lymphoma?\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms are interesting.  Initially, they are quite consistent with an epididymitis or orchitis (inflammation of the testis).  Viruses are well known to cause these issues (more so with orchitis than epididymitis) so this may explain why the antibiotics did not help.  A viral infection may also explain the elevated liver enzymes.  A normal CBC does not rule out lymphoma or leukemia but it does make it much less likely.  Often, by the time symptoms begin to appear the bone marrow is affected sufficiently to cause changes in the CBC.  It is difficult to tie the bruising together with the scrotum pain.  The flank pain may be an indication of a kidney stone.  A CT scan of the abdomen is the most sensitive test for this.  One other uncommon possibility (and you would have an atypical presentation if it is this) is a vasculitis that could tie all your symptoms together.  I cannot think of a specific vasculitis that could explain all your symptoms.  I hope this helps a little.  I would recommend you continue to follow up with your urologist and primary care physician.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities for what you are describing.  As you suggest, it may be a lymph node.   The area that you\u2019re describing does have lymph nodes present.  Even though you are not currently experiencing cold symptoms it is possible that you are fighting off a cold.  In this area is likely that a reactive lymph node will be irritated by the jaw moving.  Secondly, you may have a stone that is blocking your salivary gland.  In this case, eating may be painful because the saliva was unable to pass through the duct.  One important consideration is the possibility of an infected lymph node.  In this case, the skin above the lymph node often will become slightly red.  The lymph node will remain tender and may get bigger.    If the node continues to worsen, I would recommend you have it evaluated.  Often, if it is due to fighting off a cold, the node improves and becomes less painful in two or three days.    If it is a blocked salivary gland duct eating sour things that induce saliva will help \"push\" the stone out of the duct.  If this does not work it needs to be removed by an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My moms side are still alive at 96- and 95.    My worry is a lump alittle smaller than a marlble on my hairline about 1 inch behind my right ear. Its a hard bump and is not painful i know for a fact that i have had it for over 2 years it has not grown.   In 1999 i was sick my entire senior year of highschool, cause was chronic sinus infections, and severe tonsilitis, my lymph nodes in my neck swelled up and after i got my tonsils out my ENT monitored them for about 3-4 months. He they ran me through all the tests and did a biopsy on one in my neck. Everything was fine.  My GP has done a Complete blood count every year since then and everything has been fine.   I am stressing out.. i am almost certain that i had this lump back then but i am not sure.  Is it possible to have a hard lymph node of this size and have nothing serious wrong with me. All the websites ive checked point to this being secondary cancer or lymphoma and i am now freaking out\n\n",

Without getting into details, I got a second opinion from my wife's pcp and had brain surgery two weeks later to remove a tumor.  Your body was designed to let you know when something is not right.  Don't get me wrong,  I think all Doctors have your best interest at heart but sometimes you might present them with something they have not had much experience with.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities for your lump.  It may be a lymph node, though as you say, lymph nodes typically are mobile and rubbery feeling.    Other possibilities include past trauma to the area with a resulting small bleed (bruising) to the area that subsequently calcified, or a small chip in the bone that calcified over (less likely).  It may also be a lipoma (a small, harmless fat cell tumor) although the location would be quite unusual.  Hard lymph nodes do sometimes result from cancers such as lymphoma or metastatic disease, but the area you are describing would be a little unusual for this.  Most likely this will be nothing dangerous but it is a good idea to have it checked out.  Best wishes.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I have been diagnosed with three lesions of the liver, one on the right kidney, one in the C7 vertebra, three in the skull, and an angioma of the right temporal lobe.  The lesions of the bone are hemangioma as well as two of the lesions in the liver.  The remaining lesion in the liver and the one on the kidney have no dx as of yet.  I will mri with contrast the 2nd of March to make that picture clearer.  My symptoms include drenching night sweats once or twice a week, constant headaches, some low grade fever, sore tongue and gums and the above mentioned abdominal pain.  The abdominal pain has been with me for about 3 months.  The night sweats for about 6 weeks and the headaches for about a year. Both my hands will go to sleep as well as my right shoulder. I have had a craniectomy to remove a large skull hemangioma and had a lymph node in my neck resected and biopsied. The lymph node came back clear.  My younger sister is in remission of Hodgkin's Lymphoma.  She is 42.  My question is, will removing a lymphnode at random show lymphoma if it is present?  My bloodwork showed slightly elevated liver enzymes. WBC was 9.3.   I will be seeing an infectious disease Doctor in early March.  I don't drink, use drugs and am monogamous.  I just feel like we ought to look a little closer at the possibility of lymphoma of some sort.  I had never been sick a day in my life before all this mess.  Thanks for all your help.\n\n",

I suspect that your doctors had a reason to biopsy the node that they did.  A negative biopsy is reassuring and makes lymphoma less likely.  There is a small possibility that the node simply did not have any cancerous cells in it, so follow up is important.  Your symptoms also fit for several infectious diseases.  Your visit with the ID specialist will be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I'm a smoker for about 5 years, but not steady and only smoke about 1/2 pack a day. I also just recently had a leep procedure done for highgrade cervical dysplacia and I am due for a colposcopy in three months.     About a year ago I started to feel ill, mostly just weak and sore muscels and joints. I also had a swollen, soft, movable lymph node under my left jaw. Being a hypocondriact, I was convinced I had HIV and took myself to several doctors for blood work and physicals. They all told me I was fine, blood work negative, yada yada. About 3 months ago I took myself for the doctors AGAIN for extreme fatigue and muscel aches/weakness(it's been coming and going for the last year) and she told me I seemed fine (I swear she hates me because I'm such a worry wart.) and did some bloodwork. After a week she told me my bloodwork was good, lymphocytes were good, etc but told me I should think about seeing a Rhematoid Specialist.      Now here's my problem. About a month ago what I call a \"smokers cold\" .. just a little cough, a little post nasal drip, only really hurts in the mornings and when I smoke. I've had it for a month though. About two weeks ago I had a 4 day period of night sweats which have since disapeared. Then about a week ago a lymph node on the top right back part of my neck (practically right below the skull) seemed to swell. I figured it was alright until I noticed yesterday that within a day a lymph node in the back left part of my neck (I'd say midway ) swelled up to the size of a large jelly bean. Like I said, I'm a hypocondriact for I would have noticed it that happened gradually.. I practically palpitate my neck on an hourly basis. Anyway, it doesn't hurt, and doesn't seem movable. It's firm but not rock hard. You can see it just by looking at my neck. I have a small ingrown hair at the hairline that I have been picking at for a few weeks, could it be from that? I'm freaking out.\n\n",

    "content": "From your description, I am assuming that there may be exposure to STD's (forgive me if I am incorrect).  As such, testing for HIV is very warranted.  If HIV has been excluded your on going fatigue, etc. may be due to countless other problems.  A rheumatologist is a specialist in autoimmune diseases.  Many of these present with fatigue and muscle pain.  This is likely the reason that your doctor suggested you visit one.  Regarding your lymph nodes it sounds as if you are fighting off a cold.  In this situation, lymph nodes very commonly swell very quickly.  Cancers do not typically cause lymph node enlargement overnight.  Given that you have been checking, I suspect the lymph node enlargement was rapid making infection much more likely than lymphoma or other cancer.  If the lymph node does not begin to reduce in size a week or two after you are all better you should be evaluated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

It was not tender, or painfiul, and was movable, not fixed or hard.   My family doctor told me not to worry, but i felt something was wrong, about a week ago i developed another swollen lymphnode under my right arm, at the time i found it, it was painful and my entire shoulder actually hurt, not sure if the shoulder pain was related or not.  It was about the size of the top of an egg.(obviously larger then normal) I went for a second opinion at another drs. he told me he didnt no, but wanted to run an extensive blood test and do  a chest xray.  I completed those items and in four days have a follow up with the doctor.  Im very concerned that it may be a form of lymphoma, mainly NHL,(non hodgkins Lymphoma)- and as i understand it chest xrays are where the cancers usually show up.  At twenty i don't think i should be having these types of issues.  Any information or ideas would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few factors to consider for your case.  Cancer in a relatively young, healthy individual is not that common but should be considered when the symptoms fit.  It is very possible that your lymph nodes are swollen in response to an exposure to a viral infection that may not have made you sick (I.e the immune system did its job).  This is very likely for the lymph node in your neck.  When lymph nodes become painful, it is possible that they have become infected with a bacteria and may require antibiotics.  The classic description of a lymph node that is swollen from cancer is a hard, immobile, nontender node.    Given all this, it is most likely that you do not have cancer; however, when one has multiple lymph nodes in multiple places, the better part of wisdom is to make sure that it isn't cancer.  Screening labs are very appropriate.  I recommend that you follow up with your doctor.  If there is still concern, a biopsy of the node can be performed to look for sure.\n\n",

In addition to having pain in the lymph nodes after alcohol, I also have hypertension, which neither a doctor nor a cardiologist could figure out the cause.  I also have profuse sweating in the armpits and hands which I am currently using Drysol to treat.  I'm not sure if any of these conditions may be related, but I wanted to get an opinion on here before getting it checked out because I'm currently in between jobs and without medical insurance.

Even my scalp itches with no flakes , rashes of anything. My skin looks normal.  I have had a CBC, med. panel, liver test, urine tests, ESR, ANA,  LAP blood smears, LDH, and a chest x-ray. ALL normal. I also recently saw a oncologist to help rule out lymphomabecause of the itching. She checked the lymph nodes, found nothing alarming. I do have one swollen for 5 weeks now that is soft and moveable, it is attach to the skin, but can be pinched and picked up. It is 1cm or less. She did a cat scan of neck and it came back normal, said there was nothing to even biopsy. I can feel it and she has too in the lower neck, not superclacicle though.  Ever once in a while i have a burning sensation on my scalp and skin too. It moves around. This made the oncologist think it may be neurological. Would the soft tissue cat scan of the neck show lymphoma? Does a normal LDH , cat scan of neck, chest x-ray , and LAP smears rule out the likelihood of lymphoma.  I have had night sweats and chills that seem to be going away now. I am worried that this may still be lymphoma. What should I do? What is your opinion? Thank you so much. I am so tired of itching. Oh, I have also seen an allergist. Found nothing. Thank you.\n\n",

I am not sure if the oncologist did any other test other than the LAP stain smears and LDH and CBC which were all normal. I have had my thyroid checked and it is normal too.  I do not know of a blood culture. I was having stomach problems in August and was given a colonoscopy, upper GI, and an upper endoscopy, and abdominal ultrasound and they were all normal too. I don't know if that is any help since it was 5 months ago. I have been tested for trees, mold, and pollen by an allergist and found nothing. There is no change in my skin at all. It looks normal. No dryness,etc. Only occasionally will I scatch and a small welp area will come up. Zytec 10mg does stop the itching. I have not consulted a dermatologist but am being referred to a neurologist because I only occasionally have a light burning sensation that moves around my skin and scalp.When this occurs it actually is irritating to brush my hair. The itching is my main symptom that is leaving me puzzled and miserable.  I am concerned because I am scared that we have missed something. I have 4 small children and am very scared that this is serious.  __ would a catscan of the neck have told if their was lymphoma? I can still feel the lymph node, moveable and non tender for 5 weeks and the oncologist nurse said the scan was normal. __Can blood work LDH, LAP smears, etc be normal and still have lymphoma? __If it was lymphoma, would Zyrtec stop the itching like it does? __Should I ask for a biopsy of the lymph node? __ I am continually feeling the node daily, hoping it is gone!! Will that make it stay big?? I really value your opinion on this health matter. _ also, would lymphoma itching go away for 51/2 months and come back like that?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I recently went back to the onconlogist because I am concerned because the lymph node in my lower neck is still their after 2 months. It is still in the lower front neck. It is still moveable, soft,  is attached to the skin but will roll when touched. It is not hard, fixed or matted. It is no larger but does get smaller and then goes back to its regular size. The doctor is not concerned. She says that  lymphoma lymph nodes do not have to be looked for, their are lots of them. Is this always correct? I do have another node in front of my ear that has been their for the same length of time. It is a little larger but still small and more fixed but soft.  She said that my CBC showed luekopenia, which she has been monitoring for a couple of months. It is lower now at 3.6 and I was mildly anemic. She said that this was probably because I had just finished my menstrual period. She did decide to do a bone marrow biopsy which came back normal. She said that this was the only way to rule out leukemia for sure. My bone marrow showed no signs of leukemia or lymphoma.  My past medical records show leukopenia as far back as 5 years.  I am only concerned about the lymph nodes. Should I still be worried about lymphoma? She did not want to biopsy a lymph node. Said a bone marrow biopsy was easier.  My itching is still there. It has days that are better occasionally. My night sweats have been much better. I have not had a real soaking night sweat in two months. I do have the chills alot. I have been fatigued the last four days. Could this be due to mild anemia? I do check the lymph node daily. Can this cause it to stay enlarged permanently? Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "bone marrow biopsy",
    "content": "Hi. I recently went back to the onconlogist because I am concerned because the lymph node in my lower neck is still their after 2 months. It is still in the lower front neck. It is still moveable, soft,  is attached to the skin but will roll when touched. It is not hard, fixed or matted. It is no larger but does get smaller and then goes back to its regular size. The doctor is not concerned. She says that  lymphoma lymph nodes do not have to be looked for, their are lots of them. Is this always correct? I do have another node in front of my ear that has been their for the same length of time. It is a little larger but still small and more fixed but soft.  She said that my CBC showed luekopenia, which she has been monitoring for a couple of months. It is lower now at 3.6 and I was mildly anemic. She said that this was probably because I had just finished my menstrual period. She did decide to do a bone marrow biopsy which came back normal. She said that this was the only way to rule out leukemia for sure. My bone marrow showed no signs of leukemia or lymphoma.  My past medical records show leukopenia as far back as 5 years.  I am only concerned about the lymph nodes. Should I still be worried about lymphoma? She did not want to biopsy a lymph node. Said a bone marrow biopsy was easier.  My itching is still there. It has days that are better occasionally. My night sweats have been much better. I have not had a real soaking night sweat in two months. I do have the chills alot. I have been fatigued the last four days. Could this be due to mild anemia? I do check the lymph node daily. Can this cause it to stay enlarged permanently? Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "PAINFUL Lump on Arm",
    "content": "I am a 28 yera old female. I am unsure as to what this is on my arm. I have had 2 doctors look at it over the years and they both referred me to a surgeon. However, neither felt the need to do any tests. They merely pushed around on it which I might add was almost imbareable because of the pain. I have had this lump on my arm for about 20 years. I can remember having a painful lump on my arm when I was 8 or 9 years old, then the pain went away but the lump remained, just smaller then. It started out being abount the size of an eraser on the end of a pencil and now it has grew to approx. the size of a quarter. About 10 years ago, it began to feel sensitive to the touch. Sensitivity has become very painful to the simpliest touch. I catch myself making quick and unplanned guarding of the lump to try and prevent the lump from being bumped. If ever the lump is disturbed, SHARP, THROBBING, bolts of pain shoot down my arm to my finger tips and my arm becomes limp. I am worried that this lump has grown so big that it has affected nerves in my arm. There has been occurances that have happened without any contact to the lump. Tingling and Dull throbbing is almost a daily symptom. I do not know where to start. I have not taken any prescriptions for any of the symptoms. I do not recall any family members having any same problems. Family doctors are referring me to surgeons. I am not satisfied with seeing another doctor that is merely going to dip into my pocket to refer me to another one that maybe  or miight know of another doctor. Can someone point me into the right direction of expertise or at least explain what this lump might be on my arm so I can try to find the right doctor for myself...........Signed ( n_pain )\n\n",

    "content": "There are not many things that can produce a lump on the arm.  A few possibilities include a swollen lymph node or more likely a lipoma.  A lipoma is a small, benign fat cell tumor.  Generally they are harmless but can continue to become larger or painful.  I would tend to agree with your doctor.  Probably the best person to see would be a surgeon.  If they agree that it is a lipoma it can be removed (sometimes in the office depending on size/location).  If it does not appear to be a lipoma they may be able to biopsy the mass to determine what it actually is.  Where on your arm is the mass?  Thanks, keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm a 20yr old female, and ever since I had mumps 2 years ago (which affected the left side submandibular and parotid gland only) and although both got better within the time the doc said they would, the submandibular gland (i think) has stayed slightly bigger. It swells more when I eat, or when I wake up in the morning, and settles back down to it's just-bigger-than-usual size within 15 mins or so. It's never painful. I went to see the doctor and she said to see my dentist first, and if they couldnt find a cause to go back for a biopsy (which scares me to death). Anyway, I went to see my dentist last week, and she sadi she didnt think it was anything to worry about, but has referred me to an ENT (no idea when though- could be as long as after the summer) I do have a hard lump on one side of the floor of my mouth right at the very front, but she said it was a tendon or something (?!) and another kind of lump thing in the very top corner of my cheek on the left, which can be felt but not seen, which she said was just coz my wisdom tooth has grown at a diferent angle (?!) I also have a slightly blocked sinus on the left side at night... I just don't know what all this means, and I'm really really worried... does anyone know anything? please help! : (\n\n",

    "content": "I have a few thoughts for you.  The parotid gland empties into the mouth via a duct on the inside of the cheek just above the middle of the cheek and about half way back.  This may be the bump you are feeling.  If so, this is normal.  The bump on the bottom of your mouth may be the opening of the submadibular gland duct.  If you are experiencing swelling of the gland with eating it is quite possible that you have a stone or other blockage in the duct.  You can try to encourage passage of the stone by eating things that cause the glands to release their contents (known as sialogogues)-such as lemons or other things that make your mouth water.  From your description I suspect that this is what is going on but I cannot be sure with examining you.  Seeing the ENT is a good idea to help confirm the idea.  You can try the sialogogues in the mean time.  If you begin to have fevers and tenderness in the area of one of your glands you should see a doctor as it is possible to get an infection in the gland.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ... I'm a healthy 30 year old female, I've had a swollen lymph node for 10 months, then a second node swelled up overnight in Jan.  I also ran a fever of above 100 degrees for 16 days and started having night sweats (I've posted on here before).   Saw an ENT and oncologist, they did a fine needle biopsy which was inconclusive, then a general biopsy whcih showed negative for Hodgkins, still waiting for the non-Hodgkins results.  My LDH is now 1200 and my ESR is 45, liver functions are slightly elevated.  Both have been increasing in the last month.  All blood cultures are negative, and a round of antibiotics did nothing.  PET/CT scan showed a slightly enlarged spleen and liver, three \"active\" nodes in my neck, and a small amount of uptake in my bone.  There were definetly abnormal lymphocites in the biopsy, and  my oncologist was very surprised when the Hodgkins came back negative.  He was sure that was what it was!    ** Question1: ** Should I push for a second opinion on the biopsy?  I'm at UPenn, and I am very confident in them, but I also understand it can be a tricky thing to do.  ** Question 2: ** If non-Hodgkins comes back negative (keep your fingers crossed!) where do i go from there?  Auto immune disorder?  Infectious disease?  ** Question3: ** Is it normal for a lymph node to swell substnatially after a biopsy is done?  My ENT removed am \"M&M sized piece\" of the node, and 8 days later, the node is HUGE.  Much larger than before.  My Docs agree \"something\" is wrong, they just can't put there finger on it.  Who might be a good specialist to see next?  Thank you ...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi lucky, When Lymph nodes enlarge as a result of an infectious process it is the bodies mechanism of defense to fight infection. Lymph node enlargement in the location that you state is a little  more disconcerting. Clinical features of lymph nodes: Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Consistency: Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant ( enlarge then recede). Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Diagnostics such as CT Scan can assist in identification of \"suspicious areas\". Lymph nodes drain in a certain order in both benign and malignant conditions. Essentially, what I am saying is that lymph nodes are in chains and when enlargement occurs it begins in a particular area of the chain and proceeds to the next one down the line. (Hopefully that makes sense) If the recommendation is to have a biopsy I would strongly suggest that you do so. Best wishes and if your time permits an update would be appreciated. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! Ok, so I am a healthy male, 14, and about 3 days ago, I noticed a lump on the left side of my neck, searching around, I've located the lump to be from the Posterior Cervical node, its about the size of a pea, not visiblely raised from my neck when its upright or titlted to the right, but titlted to the left and you can see the lump, again, its not very big, but it is still there. I'd say the lump is around 90mm, give or take 10, its warm to the touch, but then again, that could've been because I've been poking and prodding it for the last few days. Its not rock hard, I can move it up and down a little bit, but it goes back to its original place, I can squish and prod into it, but again, it does seem to have a point where I either start hurting or it gets harder.  The closest thing I can think of that might've been related to this is about a week ago, I had a tick bite on the back my scalp, I had it removed about two days later once it was discovered.  I looked up further what an enlarged Posterior Cervical node might mean, and so far, I have not experianced any symptoms that might mean Lymphoma or anything else. I have suspisions it might be a harmless infection because of the tick bite, but again, I don't have the qualifications to make that judgement.  If anyone can, please help me diagnose what I might have, its killing me not knowing and the dread keeps building up.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sarrk, The posterior cervical lymph nodes extend in a line posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscles but in front of the trapezius, from the level of the mastoid bone to the clavicle (on the side of the neck near the back). They drain the scalp and neck, skin of arms and pectorals, thorax, cervical and axillary nodes. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. A group of nodes that feels connected and seems to move as a unit is said to be \"matted.\" Nodes that are matted can be either benign (e.g., tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or lymphogranuloma venereum) or malignant (e.g., metastatic carcinoma or lymphomas). Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. In essence, infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened. I would be more inclined to consider the causative factor related to your symptoms to be a direct result of the tick bite. I would however, suggest an evaluation by your physician due to the fact that other illnesses may also arise from ticks. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Or Firm as in fixed?  \"In essence, infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm.\" Yes, that seems to relate best to what I have, the lump is definitally warm, tender and enlarged.  Do you think you could come up with a risk analysis for Lymphoma given my age, description of the lump and (lack of) symptoms?  Thanks for taking the time to reply to me.\n\n",

    "content": "Have you been ill recently, with a respiratory or other infection?  Given your age, the most common cause of lymph nodes as you describe will be infection. Lymphoma, while not incredibly rare, would be much less likely for you.  Additionally, the size you describe could be considered within normal limits for a lymph node in the anterior or posterior chain.  I would give it a few weeks to go down.  If the node becomes larger and more painful I would recommend having it checked out.  Occasionally the anterior cervical nodes, and much more rarely the posterior cervical nodes, can become infected with a bacteria and need antibiotics.  However, the nodes tend to be significantly enlarged, tender, warm and occasionally the overlying skin may be red.  If the node is not resolving, or if you are still concerned I'd recommend evaluation by a doctor.  There is nothing like a hands on evaluation to put the mind at ease.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Regarding your questions as to the \"cure\" time for lymphoma, there is a significant variability in treatment length and cure rates because lymphoma is a general term.  There are many types of lymphoma, each carrying its own specific treatment regimen and outcomes.  In general, for leukemias and lymphomas in pediatric groups the out comes are quite good.  With enlarged lymph nodes due to colds, it can take several weeks for lymph nodes to reduce in size.  Some may never fully reduce to the size they were before.  Lymph nodes that feel rubbery are NOT always a sign of lymphoma.  In fact, that would still be much, much less common than enlargement due to infection. Lymph nodes that are hard and do not move are more suspicious.  Also, they tend to be painless with cancer.  I suspect the bad cancer data that you find frequently while searching the web is generally related to adult lymphoma that tends to have a less favorable outcome than in pediatrics.  The best thing for you would be to have the nodes examined by your doctor.  If there is any suspicion of a lymphoma, your doctor will order the appropriate tests.  Again, simply by your description and statistics, you have an incredibly low chance of having lymphoma.  In medicine, we never say zero but you are very close to that.  Hope this helps you a bit.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 16 and for over a year now, i have had upper abdominal pain in 'the GI area' (doctors have referred to it as this). The pain is always present. Never goes away, and it seems that when i'm active (doing sport, walking around, carring my school bag) the abdominal pain ceases slightly. However when i stop, the pain seems worse. Though sometimes the increased pain afterwards doesn't become unbearable until an hour or so later sometimes more. This made me think it was muscular for months but i've been told if it was muscular it shouldn't still be causing problems. Sometimes the pain is more of a discomfort and other times it becomes more of a neaeus feeling. When the pain becomes unbearable i use a hot water bottle and i've found that it gives me some relief.   I've had an endoscopy and had biopsy's done and they came back 'normal'. I've had multiple blood tests and have just recently had yet another one and a urine sample taken. I recieved a form from my current specialist (being muscle and bone specialist) to go have another urine sample taken [i haven;t been back to him since the last one was done just over 2 weeks ago. wether this is a good sign that he's seen soemthign or not i don't know?  Anyway i also had a CT scan done since my last appointment. And the report i got back with that mentioned that i have mesenteris nodes in my large bowel. As well, as bilateral ovarian cysts. Now the ovarian cysts i know can be phisiological so i'm not to worried about that but i don't know much about the mesenteric nodes. So any info would be appreciated.  However i have been browsing the internet for any information that i can get on upper abdominal pain and these findings from the CT scan and i came across \"Mesenteric Lymphadenopathy \" and from what i've read of that. it seems to make sense of my symptoms. However there isn;t alot of 'relevant' information about it on the internet (not that i have found anyway) and i woudl liek a bit of information about it (if possible).  Also, it does mention chemo theropy??? and somethign about this Mesenteric Lymphadenopathy which mentions that it's actually tumors ???? I'm aconfused and am impatiently wait to go back to my specialist but was just wanting some info (mainly to put my mind at rest).  if anyone can give me any information on this: Mesenteric Lymphadenopathy  then i woudl really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "HI Bindy,  Mesenteric lymphadenopathy can be a source of abdominal pain.  In fact, many people have gone to the operating room for appendicitis only to find that the appendix was normal and they had inflamed mesenteric nodes (known as mesenteric adenitis).  It would be unusual for mesenteric adenitis to last a year.  Typically it is only a few days to weeks in course.  The mesenteric lymph nodes function in essentially the same way that the rest of the body's lymph nodes do.  They are the watchmen of the immune system, constantly sampling things to see if there are any foreign invaders.  I suppose that if there was chronic exposure to an offending agent the nodes could remain enlarged and cause continuing pain.  Abdominal pain is quite difficult to work up and it appears that all the right things are being done.  An endoscopy and biopsy would have discovered H. pylori (a bacteria that can cause ulcers and gastritis).  Have you had your pancreatic enzymes checked (amylase and lipase)?  Chronic low level pancreatitis can cause pain (again, typically not for a year but possible).    Have you lost any weight?  Also, a very common cause of ongoing abdominal pain is an undiagnosed food allergy.  Unfortunately, however, typical allergy testing is NOT helpful-despite many physicians continued use of them- in determining food allergies as the allergic reaction is not IgE mediated (which the skin prick tests look for).  Really, the best way to determine food allergies is to do an elimination diet.  The foods which cause the far majority of food allergies include: dairy, wheat, peanuts, tree nuts, fish, shell fish, soy, and eggs.  If you are able to avoid these foods for 2-4 weeks and the pain gets better it is almost certainly a food allergy to one of these things.  At that point, you can add them back one at a time to see which one causes the pain to return.  Then avoid that food.  I recommend continuing to follow up with your GI specialist to work this out.  Also, while often incidental, ovarian cysts can cause pain.  Gynecologists will often recommend waiting for 3-6 months to see if the cysts resolve on their own.  They may also consider using 3-6 months of oral contraceptives to better regulate the hormones and \"help\" the cysts resolve.  This may be something you can pursue to see if you can get a little relief from it.  Hope this helps.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  I have a story about my situation and then my question.  Any comments or help would be much appreciated.  I am a 34-year old female who discovered several enlarged lymph nodes in my upper neck last January.  I went to my family doc and she was not concerned, after going back with no change a month later, she still seemed unconcerned since they were mobile and not hard.  She did ultimately send me for a neck ultrasound and referred me to an ENT who is a Fellow at our Cancer Centre and also a professer teaches ENT interns through the Univeristy Medical Centre.  The largest lymph node is 1.5 x 1.4 with a depth of about .3 I think.  I have now had two ultrasounds 6 months apart and the radiologist said they were \"relatively unchanged\" only \"mildly enlarged\" and seemed \"begnin in appearance\".  The ENT said that since they were not larger than 2cm and bilateral that he didn't think it warranted biopsy.  They have been there a year now that I can tell.  I also had a clear chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound last year, no other symptoms and my blood tests a regularly fine (except I have EXTREMELY high thyroid antibodies).  I am still very concerned and have now gone back to my family doc. She is still unconcerned but has ordered a repeat chest x-ray and a CT of my head and neck.  I hear so many stories of missed lymphoma diagnosis and hearing that people have nodes that are neither huge nor hard at the time of diagnosis.  There is very little cancer in my family and none in my immediate family.  My Question: With no change after a year, should I stop worrying or push for a FNA or biopsy?  I did have Mono as a young teenager.   Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "It appears that you have had very good follow up and evaluation of your lymph nodes.  With persistently enlarged lymph nodes, one does begin to wonder about a lymphoma or other process.  However, in your case, it appears that at this point there is an abundance of reassuring data to suggest that what you are experiencing is not a lymphoma.  Often, lymph nodes will remain enlarged after they have initially been increasing in size due to infection.  They may remain enlarged even after the infection goes away.  Often these are referred to as \"shotty\" nodes.  While it's probably a good idea to have the nodes checked by your regular doctor with your yearly exams or if you think that a node is beginning to change, you can be reassured that at this point it seems everything is alright.  Lymph nodes that are \"going bad\" tend to become very hard and immobile.  While this is not 100% it gives a good starting place.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Firsty, let me say that this site is a great idea.  Those with minor problems receive assurance and those that have more serious symptoms are given information and promptly sent to a doctor.  Secondly, my problem:  Approximately 2-3 months ago I awoke to a painful pea-sized lump just under my chin.  After scanning the internet I was realized that it was a swollen lymph node.  It was painful and firm and when I moved my neck to stretch it almost felt as if a was stretching a muscle in that area.  The lump went away completely in 3 days.  2 weeks after that I had a sore throat and noticed that my right tonsil was swollen and had a tiny white dot on it, bigger than the tiny white dot on my left, non-swollen tonsil.  Within a few days of discovering this the gland near my right jaw, at the point where the neck begins to slope down also began swelling.  With this all I had ear 'sensations', not pain per se but low level discomfort.  Gargling with salt water helped just a little.  I went to see my GP and he said that I probably have some kind of infection and he prescibed an anitbiotic which I was to take 3 times a day for 10 days.  I have just finished the regimen and while the swelling has gone down the gland in my neck is still a little tender, feeling more like 'strain' then anything else.  It is more longish than round and is more or less firm and painless when i touch it directly.  No fever, somewhat of a sore thorat, the ear 'sensations' , 30 yrs old and a smoker for 13 though that is going to be a thing of the past very soon.  Any thoughts; this has me worrying all the time.  Thank you for any thoughts and/or suggestions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The swelling you have described that is felt on the Right upper side of the neck  is probably enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.  Following infection Lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender.   A history of throat infection or upper respiratory tract infection is usually present ,(as in your case) and this lymph node could be a reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group.   After treatment of infection with adequate course of antibiotics,  they should regress in size but never to normal size.   Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are significant and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   The fact that you still have this pain and neck soreness means that they are still inflamed and the course of antibiotic may need to be prolonged to complete 14 days. But it may  resolve slowly in few days after finishing the course of the antibiotic with good supportive care of plenty fluid and rest.  Direct clinical examination is essential.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor, and to update him.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

It feels pretty symmetrical as well.  I find it like a big bite or bump when you hit your head off something...feels more like that than a hard mass.  I am very scared though as we just lost his mother to breast cancer.  Thank you for your help, Sally  I should also mention that it has not grown in size....it has been around the same size for a few years.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi All, I am a 44 year old male. About 5 months ago went to see my GP for an uncomforable feeling in my throat and night sweats. He ordered CT Scan. although there was nothing in my throat but they noticed about 3-4 swoolen lymph nodes in my chest. One of them about 3 CM-all clustered at the same place. I had large  lymph nodes in my groin (left and right) At first i was told that i have a lymphoma. and to make sure what type is it they did a needle biopsy. Result came out negative. Then my doctor ordered a second needle biopsy for lymphoma, TB(i previously had Abdomen TB treated 25 Years ago), Blood tests. All were Negative. Now i have sevral Lymph Nodes in my body. 2x Groin, 2x Back of my hands, 2x on my arms, and about 3 in my chest. My doctors say that it is nothing serious. But i am still worried becouse i feel very tired, no energy, want to lie down all the time. loosing my eysight, pain in the bones(light). i just want to know if its not Lymphoma, TB, or any other serious condition then What is it? and what should i do to investigate it further.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.   The pattern of these enlarged nodes suggest a systemic disease which will include TB as your past history refers to, and to lymphoma , so both should be investigated properly.  There is a list of routine investigations that are done as initial step for diagnosis. It would be helpful if you can inform us about the results of the blood tests that have been done to you.  I also advise you to discus with your Doctor the possibility of going to biopsy from one of these significant enlarged lymph nodes. Lymphoma for example is not diagnosed unless biopsy is done and FNAC is not recommendedby many , the same for TB.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  ESR test (the sedimentation rate) blood test is used to measure the rate by which the red blood cells settle in a test tube in one hour.  The normal ESR level is 0\u201315 millimeters per hour (mm/hr) in males younger than 50.  The faster the red cells settle to the bottom, the higher the sed rate. The higher rate commonly occur when there is inflammation in the body such as an infection, an autoimmune disease, or cancer.  However, in cancer and in some severe infections the ESR is extremely high sed rate (greater than 100 mm/hr).  Diagnosis of cancer is not based on elevated ESR, but as I mentioned before an extremely high ESR (which is not your case) direct doctors to investigate there patients for causes like cancer.  Follow up with your Doctor is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Old Lump Back of Neck",
    "content": "I am a 40 year old female.  I can't remember exactly how long I have had this lump but I know it has been more than 5 years, probably closer to 7 or 8.  I initially went to the doctor and he had an MRI done on my neck.  When the results came back, he said it was nothing to worry about, probably a lymph node that was no longer working.  He said he could remove it if I wanted but that it wasn't necessary.  I opted not to have it removed due to the fact that it was close to my spine.  It is on the left side, back of my neck.  Sometimes it feels larger and then seems to get smaller but I really can't tell.  I have noticed that it seems to be growing up and over where my spine would be.  I may just be paranoid.  My history includes detection and diagnosis of non-malignant liver tumors in 2001 which have been followed up on since then.  They have gotten smaller.  The doctors believe they were due to taking birth control.  A liver biopsy was never done.  Just CT's and MRI's by several doctors.  I have no history of cancer in my family except my maternal grandfather who is 86 and has colon cancer.  I am relatively healthy.  I am 5'7\" and weigh 160 lbs.  I am a smoker (less than one pack a day) though I am perpetually trying to quit. :)  I do not take any prescription drugs.  Surgeries include tonsillectomy at age 16, exploratory surgery in my wrist at age 21, appendectomy at 35 and a removal of a benign breast lump at age 39.  I still currently have pain and tingling in my arms especially at night and after exertion but have never followed up on finding out why.  I saw a neurologist many years ago and he did a test and found out I had nerve damage and told me to try wearing elbow pads but he left the practice before my next appointment and I never followed up with a new doctor.  Now I am wondering if the lump on my neck is causing the pain in my arms.  I am mostly concerned that the growth may be cancer.  It seemed illogical that the lump on my neck is cancer when I've had it for so long and haven't been sick.  I haven't lost any weight without trying and I function as any other 40 year old.  I am currently living in Japan with my husband who is in the military and stationed here.  I don't have the highest regard for the medical doctors here and am hesitant about anyone cutting open my neck and possibly causing something like paralysis!  What do you think?  I realize its hard to provide a diagnosis over the internet but would appreciate your input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A swelling can be easier diagnosed if any associated symptoms exist. Direct clinical examination is very essential to define properly the characters of this swelling like  its consistency, mobility, etc  It could be a lymph node, or small lipomas that tends to occur in some people in certain body areas. The nature of this swelling can be known only when it is removed and pathologically studied.  It is unlikely (although possible) for this swelling to be the cause of numbness in both arms but another MRI over the cervical spine would exclude Disc prolapse which may be the cause and would allow identification of any changes in this swelling.  In any case clinical examination and investigations are essential for differential diagnosis.  If your symptoms are progressing I advise you to seek direct medical consultation, do the required investigation, and find out what would the Doctor recommend for management.  If surgery is recommended and you do not prefer to do it over there at least you will know the cause of your problems and once you back you can go for surgery if your condition allows waiting.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 21 year old male. I am in good health but I do have Hypertension due to polycistic kidney disease. There is no history of Lymphoma or cancer in my family and I have not had any surgeries in the past. I am very scared because about a month ago I noticed a very large and easily distinguashable mass in my right neck. The mass started decreasing but I saw a ent doctor because I was still very worried. The ent gave me an Antibiotic and did a ct scan which revealed 7 mildly enlarged nodes in the middle portion of the right side of my neck. I also noticed that were a few enlarged nodes a little bit lower on my right neck (not supracavicular however). It has been about 25 days and the neck mass is almost gone. However, the enlarged nodes that are a lilttle bit below where the neck mass is are still there and have not decreased. I saw my general doctor and he said it is just an infection but I still do not feel reasured since these nodes have not gone away. I am really really afraid of Lymphoma. Why do you think those bottom nodes havent gone away yet? I feel a little bit better that the neck mass is almost gone but even it isnt 100% gone. Could this be one of the slow indolent lymphomas? Is it common in an infection for the neck mass to regress very slowly and for at least 3 or 4 more nodes a little bit underneath to persistently be swollen? Or do you think that the fact that the neck mass has almostly dissapeared means its unlikely to be lymphoma?  Would it be possilbe in an infection to see as many as 4 or 5 nodes enlarged for a long time(they are not so enlarged as to you can see them but when I pres down on the skin I can feel them and they are larger than a pea size) Please help me, I am soo afraid.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer.   Sometimes, following infection, Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Individuals with history of recurrent upper respiratory, ear, throat dental, etc tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes in their neck.   So, the probability that the lymph node you have noticed is due to previous infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is high. In fact this is supported by the history you gave as the main big lymph node swelling almost disappeared after treatment with antibiotic.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring.   Hope this information is useful.  Keep us updated.

    "title": "Malignant Lymph Node Characteristics",
    "content": "I did not receive a reply regarding this on the Head and Neck Cancer forum, so I am crossposting it here in hopes of receiving a reply regarding either Lymphoma, or Head and Neck Cancer.  I have read up about swollen Lymph nodes, and have noticed that most of the replies on the Lymphoma area, and this area are all the same posts. They all say the exact same thing, and some of the \"symptoms\" contradict themselves. A malignant Lymph node should be hard, fixed, irregularly shaped, non-tender, and firm, while it is also said that some of these things can constitute a Lymph node fighting infection so it is difficult to differentiate which is which. I know it is impossible for a complete diagnosis online, however it is possible for someone to retain information to speak to their doctor about, specific questions to ask, etc. The purpose of this post is to ask a few questions regarding a swollen Lymph node in the neck. A swollen node fighting infection would constitute rubbery, firm, and mobile correct? I have heard of different sizes, even some up to 2 inches big that can be normal. I would appreciate if the same information is not said to me yet again, as I would like to retain new information.   I am over 50 years old (would prefer not to state the exact age), and I have a swollen Lymph node in my neck. It is not extremely large, and is only visible when tilting my head completely to the right. I have an autistic son who is prone to colds and respiratory illnesses which passes along to the rest of my family, so we all encounter approximately 4 colds per year, while some may have only one a year. As of now, I do have a cold that is beginning to subside which was caught from my grandson. I do not have any night sweats, no difficulty swallowing, no feeling of fullness in the throat, or anything of the sort. The Lymph node in my neck is approximately 1. 3 cm in height, and 1. 9 cm in width. It is not painful unless pressed on, does not restrict the movement in my neck, and has not been bothersome other than its presence being there. It is not hard as a rock, it is not fixed to the skin or any underlying tissue, but is mobile when moved from side to side, up and down. It is not overly soft, but it is not hard either. It is firm, but not overly firm. Definitely not rock hard, and freely moves underneath the skin and is not stuck down to anything. What I am asking here is, are malignant Lymph nodes hard or soft? Are they mobile or fixed in place? Are they irregularly shaped as stated before? General size of a malignant Lymph node? Any information would be of great help.   I would also like to note that the lump is oval in shape, has not gotten any larger or any smaller. I did measure it upon first seeing it a couple of weeks ago and it proved to be one inch in width. It now measures 3/4 inch, however I could have measured it wrong in the beginning, although I do believe I did. I have been taking Ibuprofen to bring down the swelling, and I am not sure if it has done anything, but I am watching it consistently. I would also like to note that currently I do have bursitis of the elbow. It was fairly large to begin with, however it has been going down, and is now very loose and baggy. I am not sure if this could have any effect on a Lymph node and making it swell. There are no other swollen nodes if the lump I am seeing it indeed a node which it looks and feels as though it is and is in the correct spot constituting a Lymph node. I was recently at the doctor because of difficulty breathing, with cold symptoms. I had a chest x-ray and was diagnosed with pneumonia, and they also stated that I was \"on the road\" to Emphysema. The pneumonia has not cleared up with a round of antibiotics and an inhaler, and I have not encountered any problems since. My daughter also had a cold that escalated to pneumonia, with a nasty cough. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Malignant tumors in lymph nodes are typically firm, fixed, and painless. They do not corrospond with other illnesses, and do not shrink in size.

    "content": "Thank you for your reply. I have been doing quite a bit of research on what can cause lymphadenopathy, and many state all the same things which makes it difficult to retain any kind of information regarding what it could be. It has not grown in size at all, is not rock hard, nor fixed to the skin or any underlying tissue, it's painless unless pressed on firmly, no other swollen nodes, etc. It's somewhat firm, but is also slightly squishy. It's not overly soft, yet not overly hard. It's in between. Also, based on specific studies in the United States, it stated that 3 of 238 lymph nodes were malignant, while 0 of 80 were. It also stated that in people over the age of 30 have a 4% chance of it being malignant, as opposed to a 0.4 percent chance if you are under the age of 30. Of course, if this does not regress after close watching, I will have it checked out, and see what a doctor has to say. The consistency of it and the fact that it's mobile gives me some sort of reassurance, but there is nothing like a hands on doctors visit to clear your mind. I also had one other question. What exactly constitutes a stony-hard node? Does that mean as hard as a rock? I appreciate your input. I also wish you the best of luck with the removal and biopsy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  MRI gives a good idea about the character of this swelling being a soft tissue mass, as I could get from your description.  MRI also gives detailed anatomical information that tell if this swelling is well defined and can be completely removed by surgery or not.  I guess that your doctor has enough information that made him decide to go for surgical removal.  The nature of any swelling can not be defined unless it is examined by a pathologist after it is completely removed or a biopsy is taken from it.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to keep us updated.  Further management will be decided according to the results of the pathological examination for the removed mass.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Armpit lump and pain",
    "content": "29 year old male no history of cancer in family.  I have had a small lump (slightly smaller than a M&M) under one of my armpit that has been there for maybe 10 years.  It showed up one day and stayed (I had mono at 18 which may be of relevance).  I have had it looked at four times.  Three doctors said it was not on a node and one said it was.  They all thought it was a cyst. They all advised against removal but lately I have had throbbing coming from that area that goes down the arm to the wrist.  This happens in both arms and wrists.    After the throbbing started I decided to have the lump removed just because it has always concerned me despite the doctors' diagnosis.  When the dermatologist was cutting it out, after feeling it an circling it with a marker, he all the sudden could not find the lump.  He said it must have been a \"blood sack\" that just deflated when he punctured it because no fatty tissue was found.  The next day it was back.  Did he get and it came back or did he actual miss it the first time...i don't know.  Anyway this lump along with the throbbing has me concerned.  i don't even know f they are related.  I do not have any other lumps or swollen nodes not even under my other arm where I also have throbbing.  The throbbing is not constant.  Does anyone have any thoughts...i just want to know if something is wrong with me.  any help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although it occurs in a lymph node region, the history you mentioned is not a typical one for lymph node enlargement.  Again the bilateral symptoms make this swelling less likely to be the cause for your current complaints as it does not occur in the other side. A surgical consultation and an US examination for this swelling may be very helpful for identifying the nature of this swelling.  Your symptoms could be related to skeletal problems like cervical disc or arthritis. MRI for cervical region may be helpful.  I advise you to seek neurological consultation.   Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello!  I'm a 30 year old healthy female, have had a swollen lymph node of 1.1 by 1.8 cm in the submandicular region for 9 months with on and off ear pain and pressure and occasional hot flashes at night (no sweating at all during them).    One week ago I had another node swell, this one on a direct line out and down from my ear.  I've also now had a constant low grade fever since then, between 99.5 and 101.4, with bone pain.  Not joint pain, but bone pain in the middle of my arm, leg, etc.  My family Dr sent me in for a head/neck MRI and bloodwork (awaiting results) but was not ready to refer me to a surgeon for a  biopsy.  My concern is that this is an ongoing issue, and now the new symptoms have appeared.   Do you think I should push to be evaluated by an ENT surgeon for a biopsy?    Thanks, Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I'm a healthy 30 year old female, have had a swollen lypmh node in the \"right submandibular region measuring 1.8 x 1.1 cm\" since Apr 06 (per a CT scan).  My ENT said since I had no other symptoms, he was unconcerned.  I now have another swollen node, about an inch below that one, and much larger.  I've called my Dr and am waiting a call back, but I am sick to my stomache with worry.  Could it be that I had lymphoma back in Apr and the Dr missed it?  Maybe slow growing lymphoma that is now growing faster?  Why would I now have a very large second node with no apparant reason for it? No infection, no virus, etc?  I realize these are general questions that only my ENT can fully answer, but I'm wondering if you could share any insight into what else could be causing this long term swelling and now a new, larger swelling.

    "content": "Hi, I am 25yo M in good health.  Have always been the type of person with the \"strong immune system\" until just before this XMas.  12/24 Admitted to ER, with swollen face and fever of 104.  Dx was Systemic Infection of unknown origin.  Only symptoms before and during at that time were fever, malaise, and the severe swelling of my face..  1/2 Mild ear ache.  Dx was Middle Ear Infection.  1/5 Flu like symptoms lasting less than 24 hours, no Dx, nor Rx  1/9 Fever of 101-102, malaise, and very slight swelling around my nose.  No other symptoms or pain, Dx Sinusitis.  Since that date I have malaise and low grade fever on occasion (temp of about 100).  Starting about a month before XMas I began and am continuing an unusual pattern of very excessive night sweats.  I will have 3-4 nights a week of sweating every OTHER week.  Typically these drenching sweats occur from my head only and will drench thru two thick pillows.  Occasionally the sweating extends to about the waistline.  This has not been previously mentioned to a Dr as I kept expecting the pattern to cease.  For the last month as well I have had a very hard node(s?) in my left posterior cervical node.  The node seems to slightly change firmess from very firm to rock hard.  Occasionally there is some swelling around it that is visible.  There isn't pain when it is pressed on, but I do notice that when I \"play\" with it it will not move, but the skin above moves freely.  Other background info, is TB negative, HIV negative, tobacco smoker, mild/moderate drinker (2 drinks with dinner on occasion, maybe 3, night sweating pattern does not follow alcohol consumption), no regular Rx, or OTC meds, Rx in last 30 days has been Levaquin, Erytho, and Cipro.  6'1, 153,  which is down from 159 two months ago, but I always maintain a very strong appetite.  I know these symptoms warrant a visit to my Dr, however I am changing health insurance companies, and am perhaps seeking advice as to the criticallity of going now or being able to wait a month.  Thank you kindly,\n\n",

I have never consulted a dr. due to fear but I would appreciate any input and guidance.\n\n",

Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1  cm in diameter, nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.  Thus the size you have described is of concern. Of significance, an increase in size on serial examinations.   - A swelling in this area could be also an enlarged breast tissue that would be located at the axillary tail.  Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 24 male, and I have a swollen lymph node on the lower right side of my neck, about 3 inches below my ear.  This lymph node has been swollen for about 6 weeks, and it is currently about 1cm in diameter.    In mid December, I was diagnosed with tonsillitis, and this is when I noticed my swollen lymph node.  My doctor gave me a 10 day course of penicillin.  I completed it, and it cured my infection about 3 weeks ago.  My lymph node seemed to have shrunk a little after I finished my antibiotic, but it hasn't changed much in the last 2 weeks.  It is fairly tender and mobile.  I do touch it several times a day just because I am concerned about it, and after I touch it a couple of times, it seems to be a little painful.  Should I be concerned over this?  Should the lymph node return back to normal and within what normal  time frame?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 21 year old male.  I am in good health but I do have hypertension due to polycistic kidney disease.  There is no history of lymphoma in my family and I have not had any surgeries in the past.  I am very scared because about a month ago I noticed a very large and easily distinguashable mass in my right neck.  The mass started decreasing but I saw a ent doctor because I was still very worried.  The ent gave me an antibiotic and did a ct scan which revealed 7 mildly enlarged nodes in the middle portion of the right side of my neck.  I also noticed that were a few enlarged nodes a little bit lower on my right neck (not supracavicular however).  It has been about 25 days and the neck mass is almost gone.  However, the enlarged nodes that are a lilttle bit lower than where the neck mass is are still there and have not decreased.  I saw my general doctor and he said it is just an infection but I still do not feel reasured since these nodes have not gone away.  I am really really afraid of lymphoma.  Why do you think those bottom nodes havent gone away?  I feel a little bit better that the neck mass is almost gone but even it isnt 100% gone.  Could this be one of the slow indolent lymphomas? Is it common in an infection for the neck mass to regress very slowly and for at least 3 or 4 more nodes a little bit underneath to persistently be swollen?  Or is it possible to rule out lymphoma since the neck mass is getting smaller and not bigger?  Please help me, I am soo afraid.  Thanks.\n\n",

Do you have any form of upper respiratory tract infection or throat infection or any other illness? Is it only this node or other nodes are felt and enlarge but in a different rate and severity?  By far the most common cause of lymph node enlargment is infection. And the description you give is more likely to be due to infection (viral or bacterial) .   Allergic reaction to some drugs or any allergen can give similar picture.  This is not a typical course for malignancies however it should be excluded too.

    "content": "Hi, I am a healthy 23 year old female. I have only a history of past TMJ which was treated with surgery 5 years ago and migranes. I have recently noticed swollen lymph nodes in my neck. They seem to flare up but never actually go away. I am an ultrasound technologist in a radiology department. I have been following the size of the lymph nodes and there are multiple that stay over a cm in AP dimension. The actual length is up to 5 cm from anterior to posterior portion of my neck. The doctor told me not to be concerned about these so I wasnt.  About two months after I noticed the lymph nodes I started having severe night sweats. I started having up to three in one night. I wasn't sleeping and had no appetite so I went back to the Dr who did blood work only to find it was all normal. That was 3 months ago.  I still have the swollen glads and had a CT of my neck done per a Radiologist in my department. It showed several enlarged nodes, with some excreting more contrast than he liked. I am to see a ENT this week. I'm still having the night sweats but only about 2 a week and the glads are still swollen. Is it possible to have lymphoma with completely normal blood work?   My family doctor doesnt think I need to do anything else about it but the radiologist wants me to just incase. I guess I was just wondering if there was anything else that could be causing the night sweats and swollen lymph nodes. The mono test was negative. I would just like to know if anything else could be behind this. I am always tired too. Lately I can't make it a full day at work without completely wearing myself out and needing a 3 hr nap!   Thanks-\n\n",

    "content": "Those are some large lymph nodes for a long period of time.  Now that you are having other symptoms, I would absolutely agree that you should have a work up done.    Are the lymph nodes all on one side and in the same place?  Where are the lymph nodes located in the neck-behind the major strap muscle (sternocleidomastoid) or in front of it.  The posterior nodes tend to become enlarged much more commonly as a result of a virus.  The anterior nodes can also become infected with a bacteria.  Given the night sweats and fatigue I would be concerned about a fungal type infection such as tuberculosis or coccidiodomycosis (Valley Fever).  The particular fungus around depends on where you live.    Cat scratch disease is a possibility also if the nodes are all on one side.  I would recommend a ppd test for TB, and blood serologies for cocci.  Also, if the nodes have been swollen for that long you may need to have  a biopsy done to look at the node.  The best test for lymphoma is going to be a biopsy of the nodes to look for abnormal cells.  A blood test may or may not reveal lymphoma.  I encourage you to keep pursuing this.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

There were a couple above the roof of my mouth that I obviously can't feel, some under my clavicle and some in the posterior portion of my neck that I can't feel.

With a recent negative ppd it's pretty unlikely to be TB.  Your symptoms are also unlikely to be West Nile Virus.   I would discuss your symptoms with the ENT doctor.  He may recommend a biopsy given the length of time that this has been going on.    Any chance you were scratched by a kitten in the several months before you started noticing the nodes?  If so, cat scratch disease is also a possibility.  Let us know how things are going.\n\n",

I know these are benign and nothing to worry about but I know for certain that it was not there in June or before that. As an ultrasound student I was scanned almost every class because my anatomy shows up very well.  I guess I was wondering if these can just show up out of no where or if it should be further investigated to make sure it's not a mass. The echogenicity of it is very close to that of the cortex of my kidney. Thanks again.\n\n",

It may also be that the scanning probe was not quite in the right plane to have picked it up previously.  The echogenicity you describe is consistent with a column of Bertin.  I suspect that this is unrelated to your symptoms.\n\n",

After I waited for 45 mins in the room he finially came in and quickly asked how long this was goin on and felt around then left the room. A minute later a Fellow came in and felt my neck. He then left and they were talking in the hall. Next thing ya know the nurse came in with a prescription for an antibiotic and said to come back in two weeks.  I'll take the antibiotic but I won't be going back to him.  I already took antibiotics once for this and it didn't go away (and I told him that!). I am upset I spent my time and money today to just go through another round of this. My family doctor already tried this route.  Seems like quite a waste of money to me. I guess I'll take the medicine and deal with the night sweats and fatigue.\n\n",

    "content": "I recently wrote about a lump on my neck...   About 2 months ago, I noticed a large lymphnode in my neck. I went to the doctor about it, who gave me a round of antibiotics, and said it would go away. It didn't. Then she sent me to an ENT, who scheduled a CT scan. After the CT scan, I was told the results were \"perfectly normal\".   I then saw two other doctors, including my GP about the results and the \"lump\" again. Both told me that I was worrying excessively (even suggested antidepressants) and that it was my submandibular gland (salivary gland?) that is larger than the other side... nothing to worry about. Again, the CT scan showed NO abnomalities, and everything was within \"normal\" size ranges.   Then the lump began to get very sore, on and off. No other symptoms really, except fatigue. But I have 3 small children, and again, I am overweight. Therefore I contributed my fatigue to this.   The lump remains large, and sore. Then last night my husband and I were out at a birthday party, and I drank about 1/2 of my husbands drink. Almost immediately after I drank it, my lump became sore. And, within an hour, I had a piercing pain in my chest. Right where I would describe my heart to be, but I'm sure it wasn't a problem with my heart. I felt like maybe it was heartburn, but it was a very distinct spot in my chest, and the pain didn't go away for hours.  It was very painful... the pain was gone when I woke up this morning.  Now my question is... I've read that this could be a symptom of Lymphoma. I am of course worried... should I continue to see doctors about this, or should I just trust the 3 that have told me not to worry anymore?  What else can I do for reassurance?  This chest pain when I drank alcohol really bothers me.  Please let me know what you think?   Thank you for reading this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jen32, When the CT Scan was completed, what area was evaluated, ie., head/neck, chest/abdomen/pelvis? A CT Scan of the chest/abdomen/pelvis, would be  areas recommended for study. Pet scans and lab studies are also useful diagnostic tools. Did you have any labwork completed, ie., Complete blood count, electrolyte panel with liver function study, calcium level, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, (LDH) lactate dehydrogenase, etc.? Alcohol induced pain at certain lymph node sites is specific for Hodgkin disease occurring in approx 10% of people. This of course is not to imply that you have this disorder but in my opinion further investigation would be warranted. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I have a scheduled physical next Friday with my GP.  I am kind of embarrassed to ask for more than just the normal tests... is there anything in particular that I should ask for?  If I mention only the pain in my chest with alcohol, will this be enough information for her to move forward with another CT scan, or should I just ask for one?  Because I have no other symptoms, I don't know if she'll take my concerns seriously or not.  I really would like some peace of mind.  Ever since I found the lump (what they think is just an enlarged submandibular gland) in my neck, all I can think about is the possibility of lymphoma.  Now with the pain in my chest with alcohol... do I just tell her my fears, and let her do the appropriate testing?  Is there any \"for sure\" tests that will set my mind at ease, or let me know either way what I'm dealing with??  Thank you so much for taking the time to read this.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 yo healthy male. I am a smoker and slightly overweight. No family history of cancer. A couple of days ago I awoken with a stiff neck. I am very sure it was just the way I slept since it went away very quickly. However, while feeling my neck, I noticed what felt like two small bumps on the right side just above the collar bone. I should note that these are not noticible unless I press down on my neck in the normal position or if I lean my neck all the way to the left. Of course when I checked the net, anything in that area is cause for concern, so that is why I am inquiring. When I grab deep into my neck, I feel only one, it feels like a jellybeen, not sure if it is a CM or not as it is hard to measure. I cannot feel it on the other side. It is non tender, solid, but not rock hard (I think, it is hard to tell). Could it just be a lymph node I can feel if I really look for it. I would have never found if I didn't go poking at my neck. One other note: I can say with reasonable certainty that I felt something similar about 6 years ago, but never thinking anything of it.  I have not had any colds recently, other than maybe a mild one two months ago. I haven't been to a doctor in about 4 years however I have an appointment in a couple months. Should I make an appointment sooner? Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to your description, they could be lymph nodes but this should be confirmed by direct clinical examination by your doctor.  If we assumed they are lymph node, then the history you gave is reassuring since you have felt them years ago and there is no significant or apparent increase in size.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   There is a probability that the lymph node (if so) you have noticed is reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is possible.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring.   Direct clinical examination is essential for diagnosis.   Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Mononucleosis typically is an infection of teenage and early twenties; however, this does not rule it out.  To diagnose mono, one should have a monospot test done.  If it is negative, it almost certainly is not mono.  Your ESR is not actually that high.  Most inflammatory states will push ESR's higher than that.

In the last 2 months it seems to have doubled in size.  It's now approx 5cmx5cm (2x2 inches).  I went to an ENT approx 6 mos ago when the lump was rather small 1x1 inches.  He scheduled me to have it aspirated and the patholigist said it was just bacteria buildup and would probably never go away.  I was fine with that answer until it started growing.  It's now very hard and doesn't move around as easily as it used to.  I was able to shift it around and now I cannot do that.  I have scheduled a follow up appt with my ENT but he can't see me until Jan 8, 2006.  Was hoping you could put my mind at ease so that I can enjoy my Holidays!!   Thanks, Tobi\n\n",

I have had 2 small marble-sized swollen bumps underneath my right armpit for some time now.  At first, I thought it was an ingrown hair or something from shaving.  However, they have never been red or irritated and have grown overtime.  At first they were really small, now they are getting bigger.  I do occasionally have night sweats, but was assuming that had to do with me getting hot under the covers at night.  I've also had some muscle/joint pain, tiredness. The other day I had a random fever that spiked to 103.8 and then went back to normal after 24 hours, stays normal for several days and then goes back up and then comes down.  I thought that the joint pain was because it was getting colder and that the tiredness was from stress.  I've of course been to Web Md and now I am freaking myself out thinking I have Hodgkin's and/or some other form of cancer.  The lumps are painful to the touch and feel hard.  I was on antibiotics awhile back (Z-pack) when I was sick but that was weeks ago (approximately 6) and they were there long before I got sick.   The other problem is insurance.  My insurance just went out b/c I left my job for an internship at school.  Do you have any advice or ideas as to what this could be?  Thanks!! -JR\n\n",

    "content": "There is a chain of lymph nodes under the arm pits known as the axillary nodes.  Given your description, I suspect you are feeling enlarged lymph nodes.  There are several reasons that they can become enlarged.  Most commonly, they are enlarged due to a recent infection.  Lymph nodes are sort of like the screening centers for the immune system.  When they sense infection, they begin signaling and become enlarged.  During this time they can be tender.  They can take several weeks to reduce in size and occasionally never get back to their normal size.  Occasionally, they can become infected themselves and may need antibiotics to clear.  As you mention, lymph nodes can also become enlarged due to cancers.  The cancer cells traveling through the lymphatic channels are grabbed by the lymph node then begin to expand in the node.  These types of nodes tend to be hard feeling, often are immobile, and generally are NOT painful.  However, the presence of pain does not necessarily rule this out.  A common cancer in that presents with axillary nodes is breast cancer, so self breast exams are important.  As a statistical chance, infection is much more common than cancer.  If the lumps continue to be present or are continuing to get larger I would recommend evaluation by a doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "title": "Painful, extremely swollen lymph node in groin.",
    "content": "Hello, my name is Heather. I am 20, and have never had any major diagnosis other than chronic sinusitus, which I had successful surgery for. I have also had LASIK and all four of my wisdom teeth removed. On the 12th of December, I was lying in bed, adjusting the covers, when I brushed against my right groin area. I noticed a very strong sensation of pain, which I thought was odd. I checked the area, and noticed that it was very swollen, with a hard, almost fibrous lump (like muscle) nestled in between the crese between my pelvis and my right leg. Over the next five days, the extreme pain and swelling seemed to subside. Then, on my birthday, the 19th, I was in yoga and I brushed that area again. The pain was much worse this time, I fell over and started crying. I went to my internist the next day, and she sent me for a surgical consult, deciding that I either had a hernia or a lymph node problem. (The lymph node was seemingly the least concerning of the two.) I went to a surgeon the next Wednesday, and he recommended non-laproscopic surgery for the next morning. He also thought it was a hernia, but was worried that the hernia was possibly covering a lymph node with a problem. When I went into surgery, it turned out that there was no hernia, but my lymph node was about the size of two walnuts. It was removed, and sent for testing. The pathologist said he had trouble determining exactly what was going on inside of there, so it was sent out for further testing. I am extremely worried that I may have lymphoma. Over the past four months, I have been completely exhausted, and have simply not felt very well, almost as though I am constantly in the midst of getting over a cold. Any advice anyone could give on the subject would be phenomenal. Thank you very much, Heather.\n\n",

A history of scalp infected lesions, or Ear infection may be present, as this lymph node could be a reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group.   - The other possibility is an infected hair follicle (follicultis) which may involve with it the sebaceous glands and may form an abscess.

    "title": "Swollen lymph gland - infection?",
    "content": "Hi,   I'm in pretty good health; I'm 30, pretty fit and active, and have two small, swollen lymph glands, very close together on the left side of my neck.  This in itself is, as I know, no cause for concern, and is likely to be caused by an infection of some sort.  However, i've had this problem for the best part of a year, and I've convinced myself that they're getting bigger, albeit very slowly.    I went to see my doctor the other day, who's put me in for a blood test some time next week (something about a white blood cell count?), and he agreed with me that it's probably just an infection and nothing to worry about.  But as the swelling is painless (if a little uncomfortable at times), and as I've had it for such a long period of time - and as I'm in good health and have no reason to think that I've got an infection of any sort - I can't help but get a little alarmed when reading all this stuff about cancer on the internet.  So my question is essentialy as to whether or not the swelling could be due to an infection if there are immediate signs of any illness and if the swelling has persisted for such a long period of time.    I'm not sure if this is likely to have anything to do with it, but one of my wisdom teeth on the same side of my jaw has not yet come through (all the rest have), and I can sometimes notice an unpleasant smell when cleaning my teeth in the mornings (worse than general morning breath) - could these issues be symptomatic of an infection significant enough to cause the swelling?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer.   Sometimes, following infection, Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Individuals with history of recurrent upper respiratory, ear, throat dental, and scalp infections tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes.   So, the probability that the lymph node you have noticed is due to previous infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is highly possible.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring.   Hope this information is useful. Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank's very much for the reply - much appreciated.  But to re-phrase the question (as from looking at my original post it seems I mangled it slightly), is it not uncommon for a node to be pronounced due to infection over a long period of time, and without any immediately obvious symptoms of infection?    I understand that they may well be swollen as a result of prior infections (which would make sense, as I'm extremely susceptible to tonsilitis and have had it many times in the past), but as the nodes are hard rather than 'rubbery' I can't help but think that the swelling is due to an existing problem rather than to a previous infection - hence my question as to whether an infection caused swelling could be present for a long period of time.      I think the thing might be blocked slightly, or at least not operating as well as it should; the veins above it in my neck seem a little more pronounced than those on the other side.  ...is that in any way relevant?  (I'd imagine not - if the thing is swollen it's not going to be draining as well as it should do, regardless of the cause).    One last question: I'm due for a blood test, and the doctor mentioned something about a white blood cell count.  What would be established by measuring my white blood cell count?  If the count is high I'm producing cells to combat an infection - and if the count is low I've got problems with producing the cells?   Thankyou once again for your time.  I really do feel fine, I'm in good health, and if I'm being sensible I'm sure this is absolutely nothing to worry about - but I can't help but find it a little disconcerting.\n\n",

Thus if you and your Doctor could not find any ocal source for the enlargement, then other causes should  be investigated.  Part of the routine work up in such condition is complete blood picture CBC. It gives very important information about your immune system and whether infection else where in the body or blood disorders are there or suspicious.  A thorough clinical examination is essential.  ESR and Blood sugar level should be assessed too.  Radiological neck and chest examination may be required too.  I advise you to go for blood tests soon and to follow up with your doctor.

The numbness and tingling have pretty much subsided.  Over the past few months, the lymph glands in my neck and under my arms have become enlarged.  They are not sore or painful but are tender. I have had an enlarged lymph gland in my groin area for a while now. I am extremely tired and my temperature has held steady around 95.7 - 96.8.

I have lost my appetite and have lost weight without trying (approximately 2 lbs/ week)  I saw my PCP a week ago and he felt my neck and underarms.  He said that they were \"lumpy and tender\".

    "content": "Hello,  There are two types of Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) as regards outcome: 1. Aggressive where the disease course progresses more rapidly (months) and are more responsive to curative therapy. 2. Inodlent NHL where the time course is prolonged (years) and are paradoxically less responsive to curative therapy.  Diffuse large cell Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma is an aggressive type of lymphoma which means it belongs to the group that responds better to treatment.  His overall prognosis will depend on many factors which include the stage of his disease as judged by investigations (CT scan, bone marrow biopsy, LDH, etc). His age, any co-morbid conditions and his performance status (a measure of his physical activity). The age limit here is 60 years, so it could be tricky since he is 59 years old. A general evaluation of his physical activity and general health will play a role in deciding how he should be cagegorized.  Toxicity depends what therapy he will receive. The gold standard is CHOP vs. CHOP-Rituximab in those with CD20+ B-cell NHL. Radiotherapy is an option in early cases. Alternative regimens may be tailored according to the patient's condition.  CHOP chemotherapy does lead to loss of hair.  Please have a more in-depth look at NHL on our website at this page: Click here!  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the detailed pathological study of the lymph node,(the full report) and if any other studies have been done on the slide (immunophenotyping if it was not totally necrotic) or any other blood tests or radiological assessment for systemic disease.  According to your description it sounds like an infracted lymph node (lymph node infaction or necrosis). A relatively uncommon condition. Although it does not mean malignancy it has been reported to precede, or occur simultaneously with, malignant lymphoma.   The  pathological diagnosis of necrotic lymph node is very confusing for pathologist as to relate it to infectious, traumatic causes, or to malignancy.  Of importance in these patients who could not be proved to be of malignant disease, is either  close follow up, or to do another biopsy from a relevant suspicious lymph node.  Hope this information is useful.\n\n",

I have had changes in my bowel habits including mud like stool for about 2 yrs.  I have been told it is Ibs but do not feel this is what is causing all my problems.  Should I seek out a biopsy on these lumps.  It is ruining my life and I don't know what I should do. Thank you for any help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pumpkin,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal.  If you have noticed any new symptoms or increase in size then you should consult your doctor right away. I hope this has made you feel better somehow.\n\n",

    "title": "Cervical or Suboccipital Lump?  Related to dry/itchy scalp?",
    "content": "Hello,  I have recently been reading some of these threads and I thought I would post.  I am a 29 year old male, in generally good health.    In the last 2 months or so, I have experienced dry/itchy/flaky scalp with dandruff, along with raised bumps or calluses that could be pimples or swollen follicles.  Along with this, my hair has been thinning locally around the top of my head.  To this point in my life I have had excessively thick hair, and that remains the case in all but this one spot.  I talked to my doctor about the itching and dryness, and he recommended just using anti-dandruff shampoos.  Just 2 days ago, I found a round lump approximately 1 inch in diameter, about halfway up the back of my skull, just above where the neck meets the head.  It is on the right side of the back of my head and just above ear height.  It is painful to the touch/tender.    I have read about Cervical and Suboccipital lymph node problems, but am not sure which this is. Given the difference in severity I imagine it's an important distinction.  I am also not sure if the dry scalp/thinning hair/pimples or infected follicles are related or not, either.    Can you please provide some insight on 1) which this is, most likely and 2) if the scalp issues and hair thinning are/could be related in any way?  I have no history that is related, and am not on any medications. I just take B-vitamins and some minerals.  Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 27 year old female. I noticed some swollen lymph nodes in my neck about a year ago. They are small, about the size of a pea or smaller. They don't move around too much, and are firm, but not rock hard. Although I do have one tiny bump the size of tiny pebble that is hard. I only have one large one ( a little over a centimeter) on the right side of my neck near my jaw. I believe that I have had that one for years (at least 5), because I just remember that side of my neck being larger than the other.  I also have several small (pea size or a bit larger) lumps that move around behind both my knees, and a few \"shotty\" nodes in my groin. Anyway...I have seen several Doctors, including a Hematologist (although she only examined my neck) who do not seem concerned about the nodes. I have also had numerous CBCs done. I do not have any other symptoms, other than tinea versicolor from time to time, and gallstones.  My Doctors seem to not be concerned, because they are so small and my blood work keeps coming up normal, and I don't want to annoy them with my persistent fears. I  was just wondering if I should be concerned and seek out new Doctors or if I should just accept that I may be able to feel those nodes forever. Is it possible that some people can simply feel their lymph nodes? I'd appreciate any advice! Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "It is not uncommon for people to have lymph nodes that can be felt.  Often, they will swell with an infection, then reduce in size again.  Occasionally they may not return to their previous size, but remain a bit larger.  The reassuring thing is that your lymph nodes have not changed over several years.  This would be very uncommon for a lymphoma.  With normal CBC's, more reassurance is possible.    The areas you describe are very common sites for lymph nodes.  Most generally, they are noticed in the neck area, but the back of the knee and groin are also common areas.  I would suggest that you continue to monitor your lymph nodes for changes on a regular (but not daily) basis.  Doing a once a month exam will help you notice if any nodes are changing.  Keep in mind that with infections lymph nodes swell.  Also, regular routine follow up with your doctor is important.  And as always, if you are concerned about anything that may be changing or alarming to you, you should see your doctor.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

More blood work - fine, normal exam, etc.  He feels that there may have been some mild pneumonia (left lung had shown a little fluid on an x-ray) and that once the antibiotic kicked in, it cleared up and his original symptom (slight pressure from the inside out, left side) went away. Also said that he, in my husband's place, would continue the Humira because of the great relief it has given him.  Thank you so much - you really eased my mind and made for a more peaceful week.

    "content": "Hello,     I have read a lot of information about lymph nodes online and haven't seen this come up too often. I should also say that I just got health insurance a few days ago and plan to see a dr. as soon as they can see me, so this is just to ease my mind a little.  About 3 months ago (august), I noticed a swollen painful lump behind my ear and one in the middle of my neck on the right side. I had just had an ear infection, so I assumed it was just a reaction to that. The one behind my ear went down, but the one on my neck stayed swollen (not huge, maybe a cm. and a half). The lump was firm but not rock hard, and was not fixed to the skin. Then about a month later (end of september), a wisdom tooth came in and became infected. I tried and tried not to touch this lump but I did anyways, don't know if that makes a difference. Well, about two weeks ago, the lump started getting smaller, about the size of a pea, and now I can barely feel it at all. I have to stretch my neck up, but I can still feel a small, lentil-sized lump.   Thanks for any light you can shed on this, I've been making myself crazy with anxiety.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer.   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Individuals with history of recurrent upper respiratory, ear, throat infections tend to have clinically palpable lymph nodes. So, the probability that the lymph node you have noticed is due to previous infection in the area drained by this lymph node group is highly possible.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   According to your description , these nodes are more likely to be enlarged as a reaction to previous infections and they behave in a normal physiological reassuring way.  Direct clinical examination is essential.   Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your doctor would be better at answering that question than me. If there is even a slim possiblity that you may have lymphoma then its always best to get a biopsy.  This should be conducted on any significantly enlarged lymph node. However, lymph nodes of the head and neck are a bit more tricky. First they are usually more difficult to excise than the axillary lymph nodes. Second I would personally recommend a CT scan of the head and neck first before going on to doing a biopsy from the neck.  Sometimes lymph nodes of the head and neck are not lymphoma but could be due to a head and neck cancer. By performing a biopsy of neck lymph node some say you may compromise the efficiency of head and neck radiotherapy by distortion of the muscular planes.  Just because your doctor referred you to a surgeon for a biopsy doesn't mean your surgoen will do it right away. He will evaluate your condition and whether or not a biopsy is performed will depend on his assessment.  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is difficult to tell without direct clinical examination if this is really a tonsil swelling or you just have a pharyngitis and sore throat.  Tonsils: - Tonsils are located on each side of the back of the throat, directly behind and above the base of the tongue.   Recurrent tonsillitis after tonsillectomy is extremely rare and  is usually due to regrowth of tonsillar tissue.  A possibilty of tonsil remnants is to be considered and it is a known problem in some  patients who  underwent  tonsillectomy.  Pharyngitis: - Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e. g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.   Lymph nodes on the other hand are swellings that have certain anatomical and clinical characteristics that do not fully meet with your description.  I advise you to follow with your Doctor. Direct clinical examination is eseential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My 54 year old husband has had ankylosing spondylitis for decades and has been treated with Celebrex and is now in a trial  of Humira. It has helped him greatly, but the possible side effects scare me. He recently saw his physician because of a sensation of something \"pressing out from the inside\" on his left side.  His doctor did a thorough abdominal exam, felt nothing unusual, and ordered blood tests, chest x-ray and an abdominal ultrasound.    Blood tests (I don't know exactly what ones were done, but three vials!) apparently were good, according to the Dr.'s nurse, but there was a small amount of fluid in his left lung, for which the Dr. prescribed an antibiotic.  The ultrasound also showed a \"slightly\" enlarged spleen, which didn't seem to concern his Dr., (\"I don't think it's anything for you to worry about\") but he did decide to send him to a hematologist/oncologist for a second opinion. That appt. is next week. In the meantime, the odd sensation he first went to the Dr. for has lessened considerably to the point of not bothering him (following his beginning the Z-pac antibiotic.)    I am scared of the possibility of lymphoma, knowing the possible link with Humira and the higher incidence among RA patients. My husband, as usual, is totally unconcerned, as he feels so well and there was no sign of anything else - no fever, sweats, enlarged nodes, etc., evidently good blood tests (he also has periodic checkups and blood tests from the rheumatologist connected with the Humira study - all always fine.)  Any insight will be welcome.  Thanks.  Marie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  You are correct. Both TNF blockers such as Humira and rheumatoid arthritis do increase the incidence of lymphoma about 4 folds.  That is probably why your doctor is referring him to an oncologist, just in case. However, there are many other causes of splenomegaly. The most common reason is when the anlarged spleen is performing its normal defense activities against infection. Humira does increase the risk of infection and it may be that your husband's spleen is simply a consequence of his body's defense mechanisms.   I think his doctor has taken the right course of reassuring you (since the chances are unlikely - given he does not have the full blown picture of lymphoma and his tests were normal), while at the same time referring you to an oncologist just to be sure.  Please keep us updated.  Best regards,\n\n",

I looked up anatomy pictures and I can not tell if it is the Supraclavicular region (it is not in hollow of collarbone but above it) or if it is posterior cervical node.  Anyway, i went to the doctor who felt it and said it was mobile but was still concerned.  I also had swollen glands and sinus infection. I was put on antibiotics for sinus infection and blood work was done.  Blood work came back normal but I don't know what tests he ran.  Swollen glands are now gone, but lump is still there but I think, (not positive) that is it now smaller.  I also feel a bit of a lump in my throat when I swallow.  I am 36 mom of two young kids.  He said monitor the lump to see what it does.  Is that all I should do at this point?  This was my general practicioner, when should i go see an oncologist.  What area do you think my node is if an inch above collar bone but behind that ststernomastoid and in front of Trapezius. ( i think) Also, it seems to be exactly about 1 cm.  What is my next step?  Should I be worried?  Other sympoms I have had last two months are dizziness, vision problems, insomnia and hot flashes.  Thank you.\n\n",

In addition they could be due to lymphoma, lung, head  and neck, esophageal, laryngeal cancer as well as lung infections and TB. Sometimes interstitial lung disease may be associated with paratracheal lymph node enlargement.  2 cm is significant, however the long duration is in favor of more benign causes.

    "content": "Hi lucky5, The right supraclavicular lymph node is located on the right side in the hollow above the clavicle, just lateral to where it joins the sternum. It drains the mediastinum, lungs, esophagus. Common causes of enlargement include lung, retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal cancer. The left supraclavicular lymph node is located on the left side in the hollow above the clavicle, just lateral to where it joins the sternum. It drains the thorax, abdomen via thoracic duct. Common causes of enlargement include lymphoma, thoracic or retroperitoneal cancer, bacterial or fungal infection.Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Certain areas of lymph node enlargement are more disconcerting than others. This would be the reasoning for your physician wanting an evaluation with diagnostic studies. The results should provide direction into the causative factor for your symptoms. We hope all is well and best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN   References: =========== 1. Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58.  2. Morland B. Lymphadenopathy.

    "content": "Hello everyone  I will try and be as brief as I can be on my ongoing troubles and leading to my question.   For over 2 years I have suffered from high fevers and swollen nodes on my neck. Also found out my gallbladder was bad due to attacks. Apon a PET scan they seen enlraged lymph nodes in my pelvic area on the scan. Both sides. I believe they were measured 1MM in size?  I went to have my gallbladder removed and when they went in they found lots of scar tissue inside me. ( never any other surgeries previously) this tissue had my appendix a mess and it was attached to everything so they removed gallbladder and appendix. Another scan showed lymph nodes still enlarged same size same area.  My neck node has went down, but now I have a very sharp constant pain where it was swollen at. On my left side of my neck near my ear. Also on my left side in my armpit I have very tender pain, but nothing swollen.  They also found out I am very anemic and ordered pills to take. I had a CRP test done and was told I was off the charts with inflamation around my heart at 54.1. Now an asprin a day for that.  I feel great since my gall bladder was removed,except this constant pain in my neck and tender armpit. They want to do a biopsy of the lymph nodes that are still showing on the scans. Is this something I should allow or just wait it out and see how I feel?  I am so tired of being poked at and I am feeling better with the gall bladder out. All the testing for that is how they stumbled apon these nodes and blood work stuff.  I am thinking since the gall bladder was thickend and inflammed and only pumping out at 30% that is what may have caused all my infections and lymph nodes to swell. Not sure on that scar tissue stuff though.  So could someone please give a little advice and maybe some insight on all this?  So sorry to be so long winded. Thank you in advance for your time in reading this and any and all replies.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear papercut71,  Well, It is very weird those adhesions(scars) with no previous surgeries done to you before! The lymph nodes are not worrying when they're 1mm in diameter,are you sure about the size? because it's very dificult to get them biopsied...they will have to do an excisional one...to open up and not with a needle. And it's not alaraming to have multiple 1mm lymph nodes.  How did they diagnose inflammation around your heart ? from CRP? well, it could be elevated from the inflammed gall bladder you had...wheich caused subminimal generalized peritonitis that caused the adhesions inside your abdomen.  As for the armpit and neck pain...it can be a referred pain from the heart since they've diagnosed you with a heart condition and you're on aspirin now.  My advice for you is to repeat the CT-scan after 3-6 months ...if the nodes got bigger in size then they should be biopsied...if not...then don't get them biopsied...UNLESS your doctors think otherwise that find it necessary to do a biopsy...I cannot give you a 100% advice as I don't have your investigations and I cannot examine u ofcourse.  I am glad you're feeling better now,Keep me updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello my friend,   Many thanks for your replies and help. I appreciate it very much.   I am not sure on the size of the nodes to be exact. I wasnt to concerned with them at the time. My gall bladder attacks as my main problem at the time the nodes was found. I go back to my doctor today and i will ask him the size of them again. I do remember them saying that they where there on both scans, but they had not increased in size nor shrunk.   Now yes, my heart ( which was discriped as Non specific heart diesase ) was diagnosed by a CRP protien blood test. He said it was off the charts at 54.1 when normal range is between 1 and 3.   Today for my revisit to the doctor is the swelling of my neck node again. It reduces in size, but never really goes completly away. Always on my left side and now the tender pain in my left armpit, but no swelling there. The node in my neck doesnt hurt, I just am getting very sharp sudden shooting pains in both sides of my neck. Also I am so wipped out and tired. Which they say is from being severly anemic.  They gave me iron pills to take, but they don't seem to be helping those symptoms of being tired, weak, and very dizzy.   So I will post back what my doctor decides today and where we go with these nodes and such. Last time I went to him, he said that we would do another scan in Jan. In hopes that the nodes would be gone after the surgery and all that inflammed organs was removed, But he said that anymore neck swelling he wanted to do a biopsy of it because it just keeps happening and those nodes in my pelvic shouldnt be there. Plus he was concerned about all the scar tissue inside me. That kinda has baffled both the surgen and my doc. My surgeon almost stopped the surgery because of it. He wasnt expecting it, but when he seen that it had my appendix in such a mess and that could have became very serious if it ruptured he went on with the gall bladder removal.   I have put off going to the doctor with my neck node. Because I knew he said if it flared up again, he wanted to do that biopsy.But feeling pretty badly with the sharp pains and dizziness. So broke down and going back today.  So I will post back what we find. Thank you again for replying, your time, and helping.\n\n",

    "content": "Just an update and questions. Its been a long time dealing with this all. Since I last posted ... I have found out I have noduals on both sides of my thyroid. my last neck CT showed: multiple small lymph nodes seen throughout neck primarily deep to the sternocleidomastoid region and perivascular space. largest measuring 1cm. not abnormal by size but by numbers. (biopsy done yesterday of 2 nodes on right side near clavical.  Chest CT scan shows: patchy parenchymal density posterior right lower lung likely repersenting atelectasis. no nodual infiltration. Lymph adenopathy seen in upper right hilum measuring 1.5 cm and subcarnial space. Some calcification subcarnial region as well. Structure noted anterior to the ascending aorta is present. the possibility of lymphatic neoplasm needs to be concidered. (whats that all mean ) LOL my doctor isnt saying anything to me other than we need a biopsy. well yesterday they got one ... 2 neck node taken in surgery. How long does results take and usually if they see something negative isnt it right away?  Also thyroid ultra sound: Inferior aspect of the right lobe has a hypoechoic nodule measuring 7x9 mm. 7x9 hypoechoic solid nodule in posterior-inferior right thyroid lobe. This could represent a thyroid adenoma. A parathyroid adenoma is also a consideration.  They havent biopsied by thyroid only neck nodes. Should they look at my thyroid also? I also have lymph nodes in pelvic area smalll sub-cm seen centrally in the retroperitoneal region of the adomen. I was told on last scans I light up like a christmas tree and my neck was loaded with chains or clusters of them.  Just wondering if I should start to worry. Its been a very long time dealing with this all since they were found and I seem to be keeping them. They are not large but from what I am told I am riddled with them throughout my whole body.  Any input or ideas would be most appreciated. Thank you and sorry for my long delay in posting.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34 yr. old female who for more than a year have had drenching night sweats,weight loss in 6 months of 14% of body weight,extreme fatigue,painless lymphadenopathy in groin,neck,back of head,supraclavicular,under arms,itching all over,constipation,numbness and tingling in hands,bone pain with bruised feeling,lower back pain,low-grade fever at night only,chills,pain in left side under rib cage.I have been tested for TB,thyroid problems,infection(been on antibiotics),STD's,HIV,Hepititis-all negative.I did test positive for a past Epstein-Barr infection,but I don't have it now.I have had a right inguinal node biopsy that came back benign but reactive.I requested that the dr. biopsy a supraclavicular node instead,and he wouldn't.After the biopsy,I requested it again,but the dr. refused,saying a second biopsy was 'unethical'?I know that sometimes inguinal nodes can show reactive hyperplasia,and the best results come from the supraclavicular location.These symptoms are not caused by infection,and they are not going away,but worsening.The drs. have pretty much left me like this,and I don't know where else to go,or what to do.I also have a vague feeling that something is really wrong,and even the dr. who refused to do the second biopsy told he that he thought I have a very serious illness,but he doesn't want to look any further to find the cause.Can someone please answer this question and take me very seriously.What could I tell my drs. to make them investigate further into this?also,I don't know if this is relevant,but I have a strange symptom that has me really confused.Part of my skull has begun to indent.I've never seen anything like it,and my husband was pretty freaked out when I showed it to him.It is an indentation that I can actually lay my finger in,on the left side of my head,behind my ear,under my hair.It has never been there before,and has come up in the last 3 months.I can't find anything anywhere about what would cause this,and don't know if it is related to all these other things or not.Thank in advance for any replies.   kds\n\n",

    "content": "had HD in 1998 (neck only) relapsed in 2002 stage IIIB. all nodes approx. 1-1.5 cm. (never bulky) Felt great up until a few months ago. fatigue, fevers, little weight loss. Recent ct of neck showed numerous small nodes in the internal jugular, anterior carotid, posterior neck. increased since scan of 9/05. all approx. 7-10 mm. Now my question, my onc.saids they are too small to biopsy, but my pri.dr wants me to go to a new onc. all other blood tests for other diseases and infections are negative. He said I should get a petscan (last one was done in May 2005). I was told last year that I would need a stemcell transplant, but that was put off because the nodes didnt grow(only had 1 small posterior neck lymph node then.. In 2002 I went throught the same thing, the lymphoma spread into my chest, ab, and pelvis. Can a petscan detect cancer in these small lymph nodes? I also have the same pain by my left kidney (spleen removed have acessory one that has changed) have severe back pain and right leg pain. Get fevers of 100. Im afraid they will not grow like last time and spread into my chest and ab. Recent ctscan of chest revealed no major lymphadenopathy but some pleural thickening and scarring. can small nodes like these in the neck be biopsied? thank you for you help.\n\n",

    "content": "okay. I still havent heard from my original onc. or the new one yet. I faxed my ctscan report to her last Thurs. She has not called me and my pri.dr has called a new one (havent heard anything yet) Should I call my treating onc. today and she what she suggests? Sometimes she gets mad if you bother her and if she finds out my pri.dr contacted another onc. (which I know she will find out because they all communicate) she is going to get angry at me. She is the one that saids a petscan will not diagnose hd in these small nodes, but my pri.dr wants it done and biopsied. I know you have told me that a petscan would be helpful, but before I call her (and get reprimanded) I want to make sure Im doing the right thing. Just reading the other post, looks like shotty nodes might not give a diagnosis. I have a few of them on my left side of neck and posterior, I get headaches from them by the oppicital area of my neck, like before. To me honest with you, I feel Im bothering my dr.and wasting everyones time, thats how they make me feel. Been there before and don't want to go there again and have stage III. My question, if I get a petscan now will it be helpful in detecting disease in these small nodes or wait, since ins. will not allow me to keep having them Im sure. Thank you kindly for your help, it is much appreciated. About my ld..its 190.  Mary Beth\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mary Beth, My apologies for the delayed reply. Here is my opinion on the matter. You, above anyone, know your own body. The experience that you have had with cancer in the past, the symptoms that presented, would make you more alert and aware when something is array. Sometimes people (any profession) are straight or closed minded, not willing to LISTEN, accept, or be receptive to intervention or what they would consider \"interference\" by another. This is not to say they are right or wrong, just narrow minded (if that makes sense). Now to my view, your primary physician seems concerned about your health and in all honesty, also seems to be listening to you. If a PET Scan is warranted in his/her opinion based on symptoms you are experiencing, then there should not be a matter regarding a professional becoming angry, it's a matter of what's best for the patient. I do not see anything wrong with concern for a patient, a physician ordering what he or she deems medically necessary, nor anything wrong with a second opinion. As for the Lactate Dehydrogenase levels, elevations are seen in conditions aside from, for example lymphoma, therefore they may be nonspecific in the initial diagnosis, however, this test is used monitoring diagnosed disease and elevations may give an indication of suspected recurrence. I hope you will consider posting updates as your time permits. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I feel no-one will help if Im in early disease and the nodes do not qualify for \"medically\" biopsy. My onc. \"Dr.H\" nurse said this to me \"when the disease progresses, Dr. H will be on top of it with diagnosing you and doing the needed scans, you are to say NO to any dr.who wants to do anything right now..do you understand?..if a dr.has a problem with that and doesnt listen to your NO , then they can call Dr.H\"... Dr. H. works in a satillite office of a major cancer center, I went to a onc. in 2002 (her boss) who diagnosed me then, if I call the main office they will tell Dr.H. and I will be back to where I am now, she calls the shots. However she works at this treatment center not at the main center. I will have to switch centers. I am having headaches is the back of my head (same as before) and my husband rubs my neck, yesterday he said there is a lump at the bottome of my skull, I said no kidding. In Sept. it was 11 mm, but the new report didnt indicate what it is now. The occiptal area gives me headaches. I shoud be hearing from my pri.dr today he is good so Im sure things will work out. Also, every test you can imagine has been run on my blood for numerous diseases and all are negative. No infection, no arthristis, no virus, no lyme etc. I'll let you know how things go.thank you so much, so very much. Mary Beth\n\n",

On my past petscan it reported no activity, the ones from 2002 stated mild uptake in chest, but hyper activity in abdomen and pelvis, they included suv #.  this report does not. So, I am thinking that maybe my onc. will be looking into the suv # and see where the mild uptake is? I guess the lymphoma (as before) is in a indolent state and not declared itself again. which I know is better than aggressive with high suv #. My onc. was sure that the nodes he felt in my neck would show up. they are bothering me and the pain runs into my left shoulder. Im still get the night sweats, but have not lost anymore weight, after loosing 6 lbs. which I didnt or should not have lost. My blood was good, esr normal, cooper on the high end, and albumin proteins a little elevated and the mch/mcv elevated. low lymphocyctes (don't have a spleen) and low monocytes. So no big problems there. any thoughts? thank you so much. Mary Beth\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   There are three distinct clinicopathologic entities of marginal zone B cell lymphomas:  1. Extranodal lymphomas of mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT). They most commonly involve the GI tract, salivary glands, thyroid, orbit, or lung. 2. Node-based monocytoid B-cell lymphomas.  3. A third involves the spleen (splenic marginal zone lymphomas).   Marginal zone lymphomas usually have a slow indolent course. You would want to ask about the type of treatment that is suitable for your liver condition given the fact that many anti-cancer drugs are hepatotoxic.  What are the manifestations of your autoimmune disease? Are you taking any medications for it?  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope your wheezing is better. Please call your doctors and inform them of your breathing problem as they will be better at assessing the situation than I am.  I wouldn't expect your lymph nodes to change, your disease is actually an indolent one (slowly progressive). Some physicians advocate the use of a watch and wait policy. Which essentially means that you will not need to receive any treatment, just observation.  I am sure you will be referred to the oncologist in time.  You should discuss the link between HCV and marginal zone lymphomas with your doctor. Let him tell you could benefit from the treatment plan I briefly mentioned above (interferon alfa with or without ribavirin). It may or may not apply to your case. It is for him to decide.  On the other hand, to answer your question about autoimmune disease and lymphoma treatment: many of the drugs used to treat your condition may actually benefit your autoimmune disease as well. Your doctor will want to look at your liver profile and make sure that you are in good shape before initiating any form of treatment.  I know the lack of knowledge can be scary but let me reassure you that according to your description things look like they will turn out very well for you.  Best regards.\n\n",

Its one of the basic requirements for disease staging.   Only when your doctor knows accurately the extent of your disease can he consider the appropriate treatment plan. Its also a chance for you to know about the extent of your disease.  Like I said before, your disease commonly takes a very indolent course. If it were a problem, don't you think I would have rushed you off for a second opinion? Is the node size stable? When is the CT scan scheduled for?  Best regards.\n\n",

Then I went and was tested for mono which I didn't have. This was in June. I was given RX and took all of that. I must say I had no throat problems except my mouth felt cottoney.  The problem and the part I am scared of is that the lymph node in my neck area has never went down. Also I have one lymph node on the base of my skull that swells up large, causes me to be so tired and can't sleep because my whole head and neck is in pain. I have no fevor. Just severe fatigue, stiff and painful neck, headache, and the node goes back down in 1 day but I feel miseaable for days. This is happening every month and twice in 2 weeks. I don't know what is happening and I am scared. Should I go back to the doctor or what?  HELP!!\n\n",

Lymph node enlargement that persists or does not decrease in size over a short period of time, despite a course of antibiotic therapy would of course raise concern about the pathology or causative factor regarding enlargement. Regardless, notify your physician that you are continuing to experience symptoms. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi reggietoga, The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx.  Pain/Tenderness. When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of tenderness does not reliably differentiate benign from malignant nodes.[1]  Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses.  Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections.  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened. The fact that the area enlarges and then decreases in size even though it has been repeated in the same area would be more indicative of an underlying infection in one of the above stated areas of \"common causes of enlargemnent\". I am glad however that further diagnostics have been completed and I hope that all has turned out well. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN    References: ========= 1. Fijten GH, Blijham GH.

    "content": "Hi katmouse, There are many causes of generalized lymphadenopathy of which the mononucleosis type syndromes are the most common. They usually present with fatigue, malaise, fever and atypical lymphocytosis on examination of the blood picture. Splenomegaly may be present in 50% of patients due to Epstein-Barr virus infection. These cases can be diagnosed using the monospot test, IgM EA or VCA. There would be reason for concern if excessive intensity and duration of the following constitutional symptoms are present such as,fatigue, malaise, fever, abdominal pain (especially on the left side), \"flu-like\" illness, rash, nausea, vomiting, jaundice, arthritis, renal, neurologic, hematologic disorders, bruising, conjunctivitis, sweat, shortness of breath and cough. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If your physician is unwilling to evaluate these areas by physical exam so that a period of 3-4 weeks of observation is done to evaluate whether these areas are continuing to enlarge then I would suggest a second opinion to identify the causative factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

The superior vena cava is the large vein that carries blood to the heart. When compression of this vessel exists, regardless of whether it is caused by a benign or malignant origin, it produces symptoms of face and neck swelling, possibly including the arm. Persistent shortness of breath, cough, etc., may also be present. Treatment of course depends on the etiology. As I stated previously, benign (nonmalignant) conditions may cause this syndrome but without doubt a malignant disease process needs ruled out. I hope this is somewhat helpful.

    "content": "Hello,  l am sorry to hear about your complaints.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].   Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.  In children, lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter (along with an abnormal chest radiograph and the absence of ear, nose and throat symptoms) were predictive of granulomatous diseases (ie, tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease or sarcoidosis) or cancer (predominantly lymphomas) [4].  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses.   PET scans are very helpful in the diagnosis of cancer. I suggest you discuss the above information with your doctor. He is the best judge of the situation.  References: ========== 1. Libman H.

    "content": "Hi deb, There has been documented research on the correlation of Fibromyalgia and enlarged lymph nodes. The enlarged lymph node may wax and wane during flare ups. However there are other causes of lymph node enlargement related to bacterial/viral etiologies and well as malignancies. The purpose for the antibiotic is if the enlargement is related to an infectious origin then the lymph node will decrease in size. Lymph nodes that continue to enlarge upon serial examinations, despite antibiotic treatment warrants some diagnostic studies, ie., labwork, CT Scan etc., Taking into consideration the location of involvement, a referral to a specialist (ENT) would be suggested.

    "content": "I am a 41 white female. I have been under a doctor's care since 10/05 for bladder urgency, had 1 staph infection in 10/05 and blood in urine. I have had several visits due to bloon in urine and had a cat scan and scope and all was good just a simple cyst on ovary. I go in 6/29/06 for another urine sample to see if still have blood in urine. I am not worried about it though. But recently my lymph node on the left side of my head towards the lower part of the head enlarged. It hurts and makes sleeping difficult and swells up fast. One day it was there and hurts and after about 4 days the pain went away and the swelling is almost gone. It is hard and swelling covers a large area about 2 inches. I was talking to my husband and he said that this was becoming a habit. I got to thinking and he was right. I have had this same lymph node swell suddenly and hurts bad and it occurs about every 3-4 months probably for 1 year. The longest was 2 weeks. It is a large swelling and always in the same spot. I never mentioned it to my doctor because I was there for my bladder and every time I go it is not bothering me. I realize now that maybe there is a problem. Do I need to mention this to my urologist on 6/29/06 or not since the node has quit hurting and the swelling is almost gone? I am on a bladder urgency RX and a bladder/stomach acid overthe counter RX the urologist put me on. Or should I go to a different type of doctor? Thanks for you assistance in this matter.  Thanks PJ\n\n",

I noticed that I was still tender from my swollen node on the left back side of head  even with my ear and was having headaches and just felt yucky. My right node on the back of head straight across from my left was swollen and then I developed a swollen lymph node behind my right ear right behind the ear lobe. It didn't hurt just a small olive size node. I took some advil and laid down since I was not feeling good. I woke up 2 hours later and the node behind right ear was gone and my right side was not swollen but today I fell like I have the flu. Do I still need to mention this to my urologist on Thursday or go see my family doctor or do nothing since the swelling on all 3 have went away.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am frightened to death about what may be happening to me.  I hope someone can give me some advice.  I am a 29 year old mother of 3 (5, 2 and 5 months).  Almost 2 weeks ago I had a tiny little knot in my hair that I was using my fingernails to undo, and I realized a hard spot kind of right where the top of my neck and base of my skull meet right along the hairline on the left toward my left ear.  Upon further self exam I realized that it was a lump, about the size of a large marble just under my skin, not painful or tender, and not moveable at all.  I went to the doctor and they told me to wait a week to see if it changed and come back, which I did.  They said we needed to have it looked at so they wrote me an order for an ultrasound.  I went to the ultrasound yesterday and they found and measured the lump but also found another area on the screen right next to the lump which was also circular in shape, they measured that one also.  I cannot feel the 2nd thing that they measured from the outside.  After she measured the 2nd area she asked me if I had been feeling ill at all, I said not, just exhausted and she said it was a good thing that I had not been feeling sick.  So I don't know if she saw something that prompted her to feel that I shouldn't be feeling well or was just asking out of context.  She told me that she would have the radiologist look at the picutres and if it's anything urgent they will call my doctor but if not it will be at least 5 business days until my doctor gets the results in the mail.  I am freaking out and crying every day thinking that I have lymphoma or another tumor of some sort.  I have not had any other infections that I am aware of that could be causing swelling in my lymphnodes and know that the fact that my lumps are not painful or tender could point to cancer.  I am just wondering if a nurse or doctor could give me their opinion (not a diagnosis I realize, just a personal opinion) or if anyone else has gone through an ultrasound for something like this if you could share what the outcome would be that would be nice to hear since I'm really in the dark and have no idea what could be awaiting me and my family.  Thank you sooooo very much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, I'm sure that you are already aware that lymph nodes may enlarge during a bacterial/viral infection (even seemingly mild ones) because the lymphatic system is the defense system of the body. Generally speaking, lymph node enlargement located at the base of the skull (occipital) or behind the ear (post auricular) are often commonly related to inflammatory/infectious disorders of the scalp. This is not to imply that other disorders don't ever present in these locations. There are different forms of Lymphoma, but when symptoms arise, they may present with unexplainable fevers, fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, persistent lymph node enlargement generally located in the neck, axilla, etc., itching etc.  I am glad to hear that your physician is being cautious. Did you have labwork as well? Are the areas continuing to enlarge? I hope that when your time permits that you will consider posting a follow up. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rntdj,  Thank you so very mucy for replying, it's like an answer to my prayers.  It's nice to have a place to be able to seek additional comfort if nothing else.  I believe that the lump is definitely in the occipital area as you had mentioned, I have done some research and that is the area that seems to match the most closely.    The lump is seeming to grow a little bit, in two weeks I would say it's increased in size perhaps an 8th of an inch or so.  I am hoping you are right in that it could be from an infection.  My doctor seems to think because there is no pain or tenderness that it isn't from an infection though which is why he ordered the ultrasound, but hopefully you are right and he is just being extra cautious (which is a good thing I suppose)!  My doctor actually kind of blew off my question about if it could be from an infection, instead just opting right away for the ultrasound.....the reason I knew about the infection relationship to swollen nodes is because a few of our good friends have had swollen nodes from infections, one had a swollen node in his shoulder from a sinus infection and my best friend had 3 swollen nodes in her underarm area due to a cold also.  I haven't had any colds or sinus infections but what you mentioned about a scalp infection sounds intriguing, only because I do have naturally curly hair and my scalp gets very dry and sometimes irritated especially after swimming which I did do a few weeks ago.  I didn't notice any kind of infection or anything but maybe it could be related (right now of course I would rather have it be that than anything else)!    The main thing that concerns me now after the ultrasound is the 2nd area that they found and measured, it's not something I can feel from the outside but it's almost right next to the lump that I can feel.  They measured both areas (which onscreen just look like two huge black ovals) and now I'm worried that it may indeed be two swollen nodes rather than just one tissue growth or one lymph node as I was thinking it was before I had the ultrasound done.  Is it common to have 2 swollen lymph nodes from an infection?   And also, no, the doctor did not have any blood work ordered which I found a little odd, but then I read that lymphoma itself cannot be detected by a blood test alone, so am wondering if that's why he went with the ultrasound first to just see what the lump is, he couldn't even tell me if he thought it was a node or a growth.  The ultrasound technician did ask me if I had been feeling unwell, so am not sure why she did.  The only other symptoms of lymphoma that I possibly could be having would be fatigue but I have a 5 month old who keeps me up all night in addition to my 2 and 5 year olds who have kept me awake since they were both born so it's hard to tell if I'm tired purely from lack of good sleep or from something else.  Also I have been having night sweats but I just stopped breastfeeding and know my hormones are changing from that so again, hard to know what it's from.  Sorry this is so long!!  Thank you so much again for your concern and help.  I will be curious to see what you think after reading this and look forward to hearing from you.  Take care!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, Attempting to keep up with 3 children would certainly cause an abundance of fatigue in itself  The lymph nodes, I already know are nontender. The description of \"fixed\" or not \"movable\" is more concerning. Can you describe the texture, when you say \"hard\" do you mean rock hard/ rubbery, or would you describe them as something else? Although labwork alone, is certainly not definative in diagnosing lymphoma, it is an indicator of how the body is functioning and I would certainly inquire about this being completed. It is common for more than one lymph node to enlarge even in an infection or inflammatory disorder. I am  concerned over the fact that you are having night sweats (drenching?) and I would be somewhat hesitant to relate this symptom to discontinuation of breast feeding. When lymph nodes enlarge related to an infectious disorder they generally decrease in size over a period of time even though often they may not return to their pre-infectious state. It is somewhat disconcerting that these areas are enlarging rather than decreasing in size. Have you had any fever? My best wishes to you and I will keep you in my thoughts and prayers. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again!    Thank you for your kind reply, it means so much!  All of my children are up and running around so I only have a few moments but to answer your questions about the hardness and the night sweats I would say that the hardness is very hard, I would describe it feeling like a stone or marble under the skin.....maybe a tiny bit rubbery because when I push down on top of it, it seems to go down a tiny little bit but that's all, if I try to move it from side to side or up and down it doesn't budge which worries me as this seems to fit the description of being unmoveable.  And as for the night sweats, no, not drenching, more just around my neck area it's getting a little bit damp, we live in AZ though and it's still around 100 during the day and at night it's cooler but when the air goes off and if I'm under the covers it gets quite warm.  Sorry to cut this short, the baby is crying but thank you again for your continued advice and support and prayers!!  Do you think I should call my doctor Monday and ask for lab work or just wait for the ultrasound results first?  Thanks again!  Have a nice Sat evening!\n\n",

Sometimes the worst thing about any illness or contemplation of, is waiting and wondering.....actually this is sometimes worse than the actual illness. When one knows exactly what they are dealing with, the situation can be confronted head on. You should have a report of the ultrasound by midweek and that would be an acceptable time to inquire about labwork. I would very much appreciate an update.

The lump is indeed an enlarged lymph node.  So now the doctor wants me to do a Complete Blood Count which I will have done tomorrow.  From there I assume (and he suggested) I would need a biopsy of the lymph node if my blood counts are low at all.  So I have a few new questions now which are 1) even if my blood counts are normal could the enlarged lymph node still be caused by a lymphoma and 2) do you think that the lymph node could be enlarged from an extremely mild infection that isn't causing fever or pain in the lump area or showing any other symptoms at all?  And also, the lump doesn't seem to be growing anymore but isn't shrinking either, and I'm wondering if that points to one or the other (infection or lymphoma).  Boy, I was hoping that I wouldn't have to ask you for any more words of advice, sorry, I hope you don't mind!!  I can't wait to hear back from you to hear your opinion.

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, Thank you for updating your post. Please don't apologize for asking questions. Generally speaking, when lymph nodes enlarge due to an infection, after the infection subsides there is usually a consistent decrease in size even though they may not return to their pre-infectious state. Although the areas of enlargement you are experiencing are not increasing in size at this time, they aren't decreasing either which is a reason for concern......The CBC should indicate how your body is generally functioning and if there is an indication if an infection, etc., present. Although CBC is a useful diagnostic tool, and is a good indicator of disease states, and can indicate that \"something is wrong\" it is not definative in diagnosing or ruling out lymphoma. I would suggest also inquiring about a  LDH level, as well as a CT Scan. If a biopsy of the areas is suggested, please do no hesitate in having this completed. It is my hope that you will continue updating with your results. Keeping you in my thoughts and prayers....... Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I will definitely keep in touch and post all my results and will probably have even more questions as time goes on...for example I forgot to ask you something yesterday which I just remembered!    My doctor said that after blood work, if all comes back normal, that we should wait for 3 months without doing anything and then do another ultrasound if the lump is still there.  So after reading your suggestion of asking for an LDH level test and a CT Scan I am wondering if I should still go ahead and ask him for these things or wait the 3 months as he suggested.  Three months seems like a long time to wait to check it again if it's still there in my opinion.  Also, if this were from an infection, how quickly should it decrease in size? I guess I can worry about that after the blood work is done, since we don't know if I even have an infection or something else.  Thanks again for your support!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Well, the doctor called me first things this morning to my surprise and he already had the blood test results back that I just did yesterday morning.  The good news is that my blood cell counts seem to be normal so I'm hoping that that means no cancer!!  The bad news is that he says my liver enzyme levels are very high which means my liver isn't breaking things down and he mentioned something about the kidneys (also my triclycerides are up, etc so I think the \"new mom diet\" probably isn't helping there)!  He said something about gout but I don't even know what gout is, I have heard of it but he says I'm probably too young for that.  He now wants me to take more blood tests to test for Hepatitis of any kind as we aren't sure what is causing the liver to act strangely as I don't drink at all and never have and he asked me if I take a lot of pain killer (Tylenol, etc) which I take occasionally but not a ton of....he was thinking one of those would be the main culprit but since I don't have either in my system we will do the testing for hepatitis and go from there, he also said it could be from a fatty liver which I guess could be from my poor diet, I don't eat a lot of fried food or anything but do drink a lot of Coke which I know is not good for me.  So, back to the lymph node, I asked him if he thinks that it could be swollen from the liver and he said he wasn't quite sure but possibly, or that it could be swollen from a problem going on within that individual lymph node and said we may just want to biopsy it after a while anyway if it's still swollen.  I'm very curious to see your opinion if you think the lymph node could be swollen from this liver problem or if not, what steps you think I should take for further investigation into the lymph node since my blood coutns were ok.  Do you think I should have a CT scan for the node or maybe just take his suggestion and wait a few weeks to see if it goes down and if not then to a biopsy?  I feel thankful that it isn't looking like lymphoma, but am still scared about the cause of the swelling and now about what's causing a problem with my liver.  It seems like my body is falling apart!  Thanks again for your constant support and help, it means the world to me.  Look forward to hearing your views on these results!!  Take care!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, I am glad to hear that at least part of your labwork came back normal. A hepatits screen should identify if this is the culprit of the elevated liver enzymes. Nonalcoholic fatty liver disease may be caused by a number of reasons. For example, Hepatitis, certain medications, high triglicerides, obesity, diabetes, etc. Triglycerides are also elevated by a number of reasons, diet related, diabetes, heredity, etc. Gout is a form of arthritis usually characterized by sudden severe attacks of pain, redness and tenderness in the joints, typically the great toe. Uric acid levels aren't excreted properly and essentially uric crystals deposit in the joints causing the pain. If the hepatits screen results are negative, an abdominal ultrasound should help to identify if you indeed have a fatty liver. Have the labwork, inquire about the ultrasound. If there is no reduction in size of the lymph nodes over the next couple of weeks I would certainly be inclined to still suggest the CT scan and biopsy because there may be connection to the elevated levels........

    "content": "Hi again Rtndj- Thanks for your advice, things seem clearer after reading your words.  I am starting to wonder if this is all diet related.  I don't eat horribly but not wonderfully either although avoid fried foods, however like mentioned yesterday drink way too much coca cola which is so full of sugar that i'm sure that's why my triglycerides are so high, and I'm hoping that is what is causing the liver to act up.  The doctor also gave me a purine restricted diet sheet so will try to avoid the foods listed on that.  Today I am going for the hepatitis test so I hope to know the results tomorrow.  I feel that it isn't hepatitis, but one never knows!  Thanks for your opinion on what to do for the lymph node as I still seem to be mostly concerned about that as it's still the same size.  It will be interesting to see in the end how this plays out, to learn if my lymph node is being affected by the liver, or vice versa or if there are two completely different problems going on here.  I will let you know what the hepatitis test results are and what the doctor says from there, I have an appointment set up with him for next week to go over everthing.  Take care and talk to you soon!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I finally got the hepatitis results back, and I don't have hepatitis for sure which is good news! The bad news is that the liver cannot be producing extra enzymes from that.  And I still have the swollen lymph node on my neck, not growing, but not reducing in size either.....it's been 3 weeks since I discovered it.  I am now wondering (and wanted your opinon) about a Paragard copper IUD that I had implanted at the beginning of July.  I am wondering if I could possibly have some kind of infection from that.  My general practice doctor (who has been the one treating me for the lymph node/liver, etc) never asked me about an IUD and I never told him that I have one but my best friend asked me if we had discussed it.  I guess it could be a possibility that it's causing an infection that is causing the node to swell, but not sure it would have an affect on the liver enzymes.  I have an appointment Friday with the doctor to see what we need to do next, unless they call me before that with any concerns.  I also have an appointment with my obgyn to check out the IUD (haven't had it checked since insertion so need to have it checked anyway and can ask her opinion about all this at the same time).  Also, I was wondering if my liver enzymes could be elevated now from taking a lot of pain killers more than a  year ago?  My son was born via c-section in Jan 2003 and I had a horrible recovery, lots of pain for way more than a year so once the tylenol with codene ran out I switched to normal extra strength tylenol and probably took at least 4 a day for a year.  Could it have done the damage then?  Also if you have any further suggestions for me to ask the doctor on Friday I would love to hear them.  Thanks again so much for your help and support!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, Good news about the hepatitis screen! I am happy to hear this information. Lymph nodes - If the enlarged lymph nodes were located in your pelvis or groin region then it would be possible to attribute it to the IUD. However, given the location, I would be more inclined to consider that this is not related. Now in regards to it affecting your liver......I have not accessed any literature or research that link a Paragard copper IUD to elevated liver enzymes. This is not to say that it doesn't exist but again, I have not found any research linking one to the other. The amount of Tylenol did not exceed the recommended dosage so unless liver disease was present before, this probably could not be the culprit either. Inquire about the scans, the ultrasound of the liver and the CT scan as well. I will watch for your updates. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "update and some results- finally!  :-)",
    "content": "Hi!   I finally have some new results and new things to ask a few questions about; it took a long time to get to this point.  After the hepatitis results came back ok we scheduled an abdominal ultrasound to look at the liver.  They called me with the results last week and there was more trouble than I thought there would be, the ultrasound showed 3 things.  1) a fatty liver 2) gallstones and 3) a swollen spleen.  The doctor said my fatty liver wasn't too bad, but that it has a layer of \"gunk\" which she feels is due to me not breaking down/processing anything I eat.  So now I am waiting for my normal doctor to schedule an appointment with the GI specialist, who is currently booked until the end of Jan so am not sure when exactly I will be in.  I was shocked to hear that so much was wrong in there and I do have a few things I am wondering about.  In your opinion, could the lymphnode swelling be related to any of the things they discovered in the ultrasound?   It's been almost 8 weeks since discovering the swollen lymph node, it seems to be going down a little bit.  My other question is about the liver- will the fatty liver cause the gallstones and the spleen swelling or will the other things cause the liver problems?  It's just hard to know what or how to pinpoint what is causing what, but am hoping it's all related.  Also, what can cause a fatty liver?  They don't seem to think it's related to my diet, since I eat rather healthily, however I have had some extra pounds on me since having my baby in April and can't seem to lose them no matter how hard I've been trying.  I haven't had any pain related to the gallstones.  I guess my last question is if you think I should still have a CT scan due to the swollen lymph node, my doctor didn't seem to think I need one but can always get a 2nd opinion and a different doctor to perhaps order one for me.  Thanks for your continued support and advice, it means so much!  Looking forward to your response when you have the time.  Take care!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hilyanne, My apologies in the delay in answering your post. In my opinion I still think the lymph node needs evaluated. Sometimes it's difficult to determine the exact cause of a fatty liver. Numerous things may contribute to a fatty liver, obesity, elevated triglycerides, diabetes, insulin resistance, etc. Eating fatty foods alone would most likely not cause a fatty liver. It may be to your benefit to also be evaluated by an Endocrinologist, to evaluate for any metabolic disorders......As for your weight and pregnancy, it may take the same amount of time to reduce it as it did to acquire it, and that amount of time has not yet been exceeded. The liver problems may be connected to the enlarged spleen. Some disorders that may cause spleen enlargement are certain infections, autoimmune disorders, blood disorders, myeloproliferative disorders, hemolytic anemia's, etc. Now, I have a question for you, have you had any problems with low blood sugar that you are aware of? Symptoms of nausea, tremors, sweating, etc., that improve with intake of food? If so then I would have to be inclined to consider for example, a glycogen storage disease.....My opinion, have the evaluation by the Gastroenterologist, inquire about an Endocrinologist, and have the CT Scan. I will await a follow up post from you. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I finally saw the GI specialist.  She is not too worried about the gallbladder/stones.  She is having me do more blood tests for more liver diseases just to rule all of them out, if they all come back OK then she said that we should be able to improve my liver fatty infiltration with diet and excercise/weight loss.  She is however extremely worried about the spleen, saying that it should not be enlarged to 15cm at my age.  She feels it is unrelated to the liver, the only thing she said that could enlarge the spleen where the liver is concerned would be cirrohsis of the liver which they do not believe I have.  So she is sending me to a Hemotologist.  I am hoping that they will be able to test for some of the things you mentioned previously, like storage disorders, etc.  However, she's worried because of the lymphnode in my neck still being swollen that it could be leukemia, etc.  I forgot to answer your question about if I get nauseous, etc if I don't eat for a while, sometimes I do, but nothing major, I got more weak than anything but again, nothing major so am not sure if it's related to blood sugar, etc.  Did I ever mention that my uric acid levls were high before?  Is that (along with the other things like high triglycerides, etc) indicative of some kind of lipid or glygen storage disorder?  I will let you know what I hear from the Hemotologist on Wed, in the meantime, if you feel there are any specifics I should ask him about I would love it if you could let me know what you think.  Take care, and thanks again for all you do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I saw the Hemotologist today, and like the GI Specialist he's mostly concerned about the spleen also.  He also examined me and thinks that I may have a swollen area on my left side (toward the underarm area).  He said it's not really a lump but feels swollen as opposed to the other side.  He feels the good things are that my blood counts were normal in Oct and that I am not feeling sick.  He feels if it is anything though that it will be lymphoma as opposed to glycogen storage problem or any other disorders, mainly because he thinks I would have had those at a younger age.  So we are going to do a Cat Scan hopefully next week to see if there are any other swollen lymph nodes deep inside that we can't feel, and also to get a closer look at the spleen.  After that we will determine if we will have to do any biopsies.  I hope that posting all this will be able to help others!  Thank you again for the help you've given me via this wonderful website!  I will of course post my Cat Scan results, fingers crossed that it's nothing (however wishful  that thinking  may be)!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I completed the catscan and luckily no other swollen lymphnodes were found, just the one on the base of my skull and my spleen is still enlarged.  Now all of my doctors are not quite sure what to think, they are not even sure if the bump at the base of my skull is a lymphnode afterall and are now thinking it could be a cyst, tumor, etc (even though the previous ultrasound indicated a swollen lymphnode).  My question is do you think I should have a biopsy on the lump?  My insurance won't pay for it so it's something I am not sure about unless it's very neccessary, my doctor is leaving it up to me.  Also, given the fact that there are no other swollen lymphnodes, can you think of any other reason my spleen would be enlarged?  Do you think I should go see someone about a sugar storage problem (although my other doctors don't seem to think that could be a problem and my blood tests are all ok)?  Thanks for any further advice you can offer me.  Take care.\n\n",

This is information that I would consider basis for a biopsy. If there is enlargement of either, in my opinion, would be enough of a reason to have this procedure. What is the reason your insurance provider stated that this procedure would not be covered?

I have already had a cat scan, and they did not notice any thing, he said he saw possibly something on the right side, where I appear to feel another one now. Last time I had some blood tests done, nothing apparent came out. The next step I can have done discussed with my doctor is a needle aspiration test which I have been putting off because it can be painfull, and isnt 100 percent accurate. Plus nothing came up in my cat scan. But I am wondering if I should just forget about this, cause its just weird that this wont go away. I know im kind of parenoid now, but for the last week or so, its painfull for me to turn my head to the left to look over my left shoulder. Just wondering if I should go back in again, cause isnt the cat scan kind of the all mighty...Also i noticed the comment about the nausea if you don't eat, and I was curious about more information about that, because if i don't eat often enough or if i wait to long alot of times I get really nauseaus. Thank you so much again, your guys information has been very helpul, and I wish you both the best.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi A77angel, It's perfectly fine that you added your post here :) A CT Scan is a very useful diagnostic tool but not the only tool used in assessment or evaluation of lymph nodes. Can you tell me when you had this test completed? Have you had a referral to a Surgeon for a 2nd opinion regarding whether or not the lymph nodes appear suspicious? An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. The jugular lymph nodes lie both on top of and beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) on either side of the neck, from the angle of the jaw to the top of the clavicle. They drain the tongue, tonsil, pinna, parotid. Common causes of enlargement include pharyngitis organisms, rubella. Consistency of nodes are important findings. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin. Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. If constitutional symptoms are present this would also raise concerns.  If lymph node enlargement persists after a period of observation (generally 3-4 weeks) increases in size rather than decreases despite treatment, you should seek medical attention for further investigations using ultrasonography and FNAC or an excisional biopsy. Ultrasound is a useful imaging modality in assessment of cervical lymph nodes. Distribution of nodes, grey scale and power Doppler sonographic features are useful to identify the cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. Useful grey scale features include size, shape, status of echogenic hilus, echogenicity, micronodular appearance, intranodal necrosis and calcification. Adjacent soft tissue edema and matting are particularly useful to identify tuberculosis. Useful power Doppler features include vascular pattern and displacement of vascularity. Ultrasonography can be combined with fine needle aspiration cytology in which a sample of cells from the lymph node is aspirated using a needle and examined under the microscope.  Ultrasound is a useful imaging modality in evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy because of its high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (95%) when combined with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).[3] I would strongly suggest discussing the above with your physician. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: =========== 1. Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58.  2. Morland B. Lymphadenopathy.

    "content": "Hi, Thank you so much for all the information, I had the CT scan back in May/June of last year. The doctor i am seeing is a Otolaryngology doctor/surgeon. And after my CT scan, because he didnt see anything, he gave me the option of having the needle aspiration, or to wait and see. I cant remember what size he said it was, but he recognized that it was there, but because he didnt see anything in the CT scan, we thought maybe I should wait to see if it gets any worse. I was originally debating, not going back, but the information you gave me was helpfull, because I thought since it didnt really show up in the CT scan that I shouldnt worry about it. Before I had the CT scan I tried two different antibiodicts and neither changed the size. I don't think i have a fever, and  im never sick. The only thing I have that bothers me is that I get really nauseuas a lot of times in between meals. Sometimes as soon, as two hours after I eat, but usually about 3 or 4. I usually have to eat right away. I also have more pain in my neck area, and i get more headaches.   I really appreaciate the information given, sometimes its hard to tell, we can get ourselves worked up over nothing. take care sincerely, A77angel\n\n",

    "title": "Enlarged lymph nodes in neck PLEASE HELP ME",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 28 year old female, no past surgeries. Diagnosed with fibromyalgia last year, and recently had a baby 6 months ago not on any medication and not much on family history other then Empazyma and I do beleive there was some kind of \"womanly cancer\" on my father's side somewhere.  Here is my problem, About 2 weeks ago I started having pain in both shoulders, fatique and general achy joints which I beleived was due to the fibro. Well 1 night last week I was rubbing my shoulders and I noticed a lump right near my left collar bone.. I looked it up on the net and of course I see nothing but CANCER.. Apparently this is one of the worst places to have a swollen lymph? I went to GP, who felt this was nothing to be concerned about I requested blood work anyway and I referral to a specialist, he sent me to an ENT.. who felt the same way he did.. no concern.. but because I was so upset he agreed to send me for an MRI with contrast...  Doc said blood work came back fine, and the report of the scan says...... 2 small lesions were found in the supraclavical area, these lesion are totally non-specific most likely 2 tiny lymph nodes, they measure 4-5 mm and he had also said that simiulair nodes were found on the other side as well as in my neck. Now these other nodes I can not feel. (ont he right side) The one I can feel is only felt when I rub it, it rolls up on top of the collar bone and then once I move my finger it will roll right back down.  I am confused as to whether I should seek another opinion on this? Of course I am scared out of my mind on what I have read on here. I am still having pain in my shoulders more on the left then right, it gets worse with movement and it does hurt when I press on that certain spot?  With lymphnoma are these nodes bigger then 4-5mm? or do they start small like this? Is it a good sign the blood work was normal? Please help me.. I am very scared, I have a small baby and a 9 year old and this has gotten me so worked up it is hard for me to focus.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jaime4297, I can certainly understand your concern. Keep in mind that lymph node enlargement has also been associated with Fibromyalgia.  Size: An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. Clinical features:  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Location: although the area that you have indicated is disconcerting, lymph node enlargement may also be due to infection related causes as stated above. The left supraclavicular lymph node is located on the left side in the hollow above the clavicle, just lateral to where it joins the sternum. It drains the thorax, abdomen via thoracic duct. Common causes of enlargement include lymphoma, thoracic or retroperitoneal cancer, bacterial or fungal infection.  Again, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If your diagnostic studies and evaluations have not been alarming to your physicians at this point I would not be overly concerned.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: =========== 1. Libman H.

    "content": "thank you for responding on my enlarged nodes near my collar bone, On my MRI report it stated there were 2 tiny lesion must likely very small lymph nodes 4-5mm in size. When I orginally found the lump I only felt one, now I feel the other one they were talking about. My doctors are doing the wait and see if they get bigger approach right now.  Since I have found these I do not \"think\" they are getting bigger but I am feeling little bumps all around the area. So my questions are .. How long do you general wait to see if they gte bigger.. meaning if they are cancerous.. how quickly do they generaly grow? And what does a typical cancerous node feel like? Can repeated touching make them worse or make others enlarged?  As you can tell this is really stressing me out, I am a very nervous person.. I have 2 small children and I am finding it really hard to think of anything other then these damn lymph nodes. I have consulted my family doc, an ENT and my fibromyalgia doctor as well all of them seem to agree on this.. I still feel uncomfortable especaily after reading up on this.. it seems there is nothing other then cancer to make these nodes swell in this area. I have not been sick at all.. the only thing that had happened was I had severe shoulder pain for about a week. Please help me by answering my questions.. thank you somuch for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Persistent enlarged lymph node",
    "content": "I am a 36 year old female, fit, althletic and otherwise in perfect health. I have an enlarged lymph node in my armpit which has been present for approximately 3 1/2 years. Probably significantly, it arose while I was breastfeeding a child.  It is non-tender, rubbery, and extremely moveable. While it has never been tender to the touch, I do occasionally experience generalized achiness in my armpit. While the node  has never dissappeared it seems to fluctuate in size. It has never been bigger than 2 cm max (which was about how it started) and probably no smaller than .5-1cm. About a month ago, another one appeared next to the \"old\" one. THis new one is probably only 1cm at most. My GP has been following tjhe first one over the years at annual visits and states she is not at all concerned about it. I am thin, and she feels this is one of the reasons it is even palpable. I too have not been concerned about it over the years as it has not grown, and in fact has receded in size at times. However, I have recently become aware of a diagnosis called  low-grade lymphoma, which as I understand, can take a long time to grow, and can cause nodes to grow and shrink over time. Now, of course, I am worried about this.  My doctor would be willing to send me for a biospy or an ultrasoundfor my peace of mind but my insurance would not pay for it, so I am currently debating what the best course of action would be.  My questions are: could this possibly be a low grade lymohoma, or would even that have grown over the course of several years?  What could an ultrasound tell me that I don't already know? (ie its size, that it is an enlarged lymph node, etc...)  No family history. No current meds. No current or past illnesses.   Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The axillary lymph nodes are located in the axillae (arm pits). They drain the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.[1]  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  In primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer (whether indolent or not) versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[2]  Low grade lymphoma is a disease of the older population.  All in all it seems that clinical suspicion that you have low grade lymphoma is rather low.  Ultrasound is a useful imaging modality in assessment of lymph nodes. Distribution of nodes, grey scale and power doppler sonographic features are useful to identify the cause of lymphadenopathy.   Useful grey scale features include size, shape, status of echogenic hilus, echogenicity, micronodular appearance, intranodal necrosis and calcification. Adjacent soft tissue edema and matting are particularly useful to identify tuberculosis. Useful power doppler features include vascular pattern and displacement of vascularity.  Best regards.

    "title": "question about how lymphoma spreads",
    "content": "thank you so much for your response. I actually met with an oncologist to have him take a look at the persistent node descibed in my original post. He stated that he saw nothing suspicious at all and saw no reason for any further testing. I was indeed reassured for awhile. However, while the original node does indeed now seem to be a bit smaller (1 cm or less) i now of course am concerned about the one(s) that arose next to it. The oncologist felt it/ them too and said they were small and not to worry about them either. It seems to me that one of them has gotten a bit bigger  though since i have seen him. I also have one in my groin which seems to be about 1.5 cm long, kidney bean shaped/ sized. My groin has always been \"shotty\" and i have never given it too much concern until recently, so im not even sure if this is a new node in my groin or not. I noticed it about 1 week ago and am keeping an eye one it to check for growth. So, my question is, if i have been reassurred by several doctors now that the original persisitent node  did not appear worrisome (it has been there 3.5 years with no growth and with some waxing and waning), what are the chances now that these additional nodes could be cancerous? Does lymphoma tend to  \"grow\" within the same node, producing a consistent enlargement of one node, or does it spread to other nodes without any one node becoming excessively large? Furthermore, are some people jsut more prone to chronic enlarged nodes?   I am also wondering if aluminun chloride anti perspirant can cause enlargement of axillary nodes. I have hyperhydrosis (excessive sweating) and in the last few months started using an over the counter product containing aluminum chloride. It was very successful with my sweating but i now wonder if it might have anything to do with these additional axiillary nodes that have popped up. I stopped using it about 2 weeks ago to see if it would make a difference.   thank you again for your time and thoughtful responses.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Congratulations! It seems that after being examined by several doctors and an oncologist that your current risk of have cancerous lymph nodes is likely zero!  Cancer (or lymphoma) of the lymph nodes is actually quite a rare event when compared with inflammation.  To answer your question concerning the mode of progression of lymphoma it tends to do both. It progresses within a lymph node and spreads to neighboring lymph nodes.  Regarding the use of antiperspirants they are not linked with cancer according to the literature and will not cause enlargement of the lymph nodes on their own. They may be irritant if there is an infection of the skin in the arm pits due to another cause (such as from shaving), this may help cause an enlarged benign lymph node.  The normal size of enlarged lymph nodes in the inguinal region can reach 1.5 cm (as opposed to 1cm in most other regions). So there is nothing to worry about there either.  Just keep an eye on your lymph node size and number. Be patient and wait until you are sure there is a significant increase in size or number. Should you witness a definite progression or new symptoms arise you should contact your physician for follow up.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again. Since my last post I had continued to worry about my nodes. I finally went in for an ultrasound, and i thought for a FNA. The doc who did the ultrasound looked at all of my enlarged nodes (several in my armpit, one small one on the side of my neclk, one in my groin) and said they all looked completely normal. He said he had never seen any that looked like mine did that ended up being lymphoma. Further, he did not recommend even doing a needle biopsy and said if i were his wife he'd tell her the same thing. He also made the comment that if i gained 50lbs i wouldnt have this problem. (im thin). So, i was reassured by that. However, yesterday, i happened to notice a new node right under my jaw, immediately next to the jawbone. As i had never \"inspected\" this area before i have no way of knowing if it is new or now. Id like to think i somehow would have stumbled upon it previously  (as i did yesterday) if it had been there for awhile.  It seems large to me, slightly oblong, maybe 1cm X 1.5.cm, non tender, and pretty firm. It is moveable, but less so than the ones in my armpit but i think this is becasue it is rather bound by the jawbone. I do currently have a canker (not cold) sore in my mouth, on  the same side as the node. Im hoping that this might be the cause. My plan is to watch it for a couple weeks and hope it subsides (although it may very well not  as nodes seem to like to stick around on me).  I hate to keep going back to the doctors when ive basically already  been told that my nodes show now signs of being malignant.   So, can you offer any reassurances? is the canker sore a likely cause of this? any statistics on how accurate ultrasound is in predicting malignancy/ benignity?  thank you for your time.   sarah\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jypsy_rose_lee, The essential difference between Autologous bone marrow transplantation and Allogeneic bone marrow transplantation is Autologous involves hematopoietic stem cells from your own body which may be treated to remove any lingering cancer cells, and frozen for storage until after the chemotherapy/radiation treatments are complete and then returned to the body.  Allogeneic transplant are healthy cells from a suitably matched donor that are introduced into the body after chemotherapy/radiation treatments are completed. As a general rule autologous transplant may be associated with fewer serious side effects than an allogenic transplant because the cells come from your own body. The physician makes the determination of which type of transplant to use based on many factors, ie, age, overall health, availability of a suitable donor, and cancer type. However, it's important to keep in mind that in some cases an autologous transplant may be less effective than an allogeneic transplant in treating certain kinds of cancer and again is based on the determination of the physician and above factors. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi katsusand, Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes, but only those in the submandibular, axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people [3]. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" again, refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Night sweats, the description I can give, is waking up in the middle of the night with your clothes or bedding soaked. Of course an evaluation by your physician is warranted if you are still experiencing symptoms. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is a significant finding.

    "title": "Tonsils & Lypmh node removal a year ago, but its back!",
    "content": "I originally posted about a year ago. I'm 25 year old female &  I had my tonsils out & a node removed & biopsied about a year ago.  The diagnosis on the lymph node was a \"hardened salivary gland\".  It was about 3 X 4 cm.  I have many more of them  in my neck.  And, I have seemed to \"regrow\"  the one he removed.  It is even bigger than before.  Should I go back to the dr. or am I maybe some sort of freak that just grows really large lymph nodes?  Has there ever been a case of having a negative biopsy, then having it grow back or turn into cancer?!?  Or what else could be going on?  Blood tests last year were all fine, tried weeks of antibiotics, etc.  Here's the other thing that I'm not sure has anything to do with my lymph nodes:  i'm noticed I have a lot of muscle cramping lately.  My legs, feet, back,etc.  I've been drinking tons of water thinking at first I might just be dehydrated.  Its been going on for about a month.  Maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know.....  Any ideas or advice?!?\n\n",

Do you have lypmh nodes in the back of your neck.  Or I guess I mean, do the lymph nodes in the back of your neck get lymphoma?  I'm not jumping to conclusions saying I have lymphoma, but I've noticed some nodes in the back part of my neck ( like I said, before they were on the sides or the front part of my neck).  I didn't know if lymphoma tended to stick to one part of the neck or if it was common to go to the back part of my neck.  The ones in the back part of my neck are new.  They weren't here a year ago when I had my tonsillectomy & lymph node removal.    I truly appreciate all you advice.  It really helps to calm my nerves.\n\n",

You may see round opacities in the center of the midline of the x-ray which could be due to hilar lymph node enlargement or a mediastinal mass.  It can also cause patches in the periphery of the lung fields which would be due to infiltration.   Some cases have bright white patches in the lower lung fields tapering upwards and this denotes fluid in the pleural sac (pleural effusion).  There may be other more rare presentations.

I just keep gitting meds after meds.This is awful I can't breath,my chest hurts,fever,nuasea and I sweat alot.Do youu think I should have them do another CBC and a LDH or will the LDH test be enough to show if it's cancer for sure?

Another radiological procedure is a PET scan although that is not usually available. PET scans can tell if you have an underlying malignancy or not.  Sorry, I know it seems a little late to ask this but could you provide your age and if you have any details on your previous illness (NHL), such as pathology report? stage?

My exrays that I had two months ago didn't show anything but puemonia.Are pet scans very exspensive?I trust your advice and knowlege,Thank you    Mary\n\n",

Please understand that it isn't impossible that your pneumonia is not responding because you aren't taking sufficient medication. This is a viable possibility.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 26 year old man who has been unwell since feb of 05. It all started with a bad cold and fever I was not getting better so they sent me to be admitted with fuo low grade for 2 months plus. Etiology unknown. I did multiple blood cultures all negitive.  MRI which was normal. Pelvic scan, checked for endocarditis, HIV, hepatitis. Whites were a little high and IgG was a little low -  600. CRP was a little high at 14 everything else normal was treated with doxcycycline and felt a little better for two weeks then the symptoms came back with low grade fever the did egd and colon I had multiple ulcers in the post bulbar duodenum. No H. pylori was negative many times no anti-inflammatory abuse. They were puzzled I still was feeling bad. Doctors just keeping their fingers crossed when bowel trouble got worse 10 bm a day stomach pain they did a pelvic scan - acute acalculas gallbladder with hemorrhage.  It was removed I was released hoping this was the end. All I have lost is fever but still feel terrible. Postive hemocult current heavy chest fatigue headaches. I was sent to John Hopkins in Baltimore and they did a cystic fibrosis test which was eq pos and tb was neg and refered me to GI dept. This is where I am now.  Then my neck swelled all along the right side, hence the question: My submanbular has been swollen for years but never the whole neck down to the color bone and seems to radiate to my right arm could this be lymphoma which has to do with the GI tract..  Please help, CBC normal, sed rate normal and going for biospy or removal next week...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello BUSCHCLUB, I am sorry to hear that you have been through so much. Sometimes cases are like that, though. They present with significant symptoms, you do all the tests and they come back normal. The policy in such cases is to wait and see. To put the patient under observation so that as soon as the underlying disease presents itself with a clinically significant finding you can catch and treat it. In your case that means your lymph node swelling. If it is indeed as large as you describe it to be that is clinically significant. A lymph node biopsy may give us a definitive diagnosis which will enable your doctors to treat you.  It is difficult to tell for sure what the possible diagnosis is. Your question is if this could be a lymphoma. Its possible but not so likely. You do not present with any other lymph node enlargements (although this is more common in Hodgkin's disease). You also do not have constitutional symptoms such fever, night sweats and weight loss. It is still possible that it may turn out to be lymphoma. Apart from lymphomas some cancers of GI tract may spread to the supraclavicular lymph node (above the collar bone). Based on the pathology obtained from your lymph node your doctors may request further evaluation of the GI tract or another CT scan, tumor markers or repeat the colonoscopy. Its even difficult to tell for sure if this is a malignancy or not. Being of young age certainly decreases the likelihood of malignant disease. It could turn out to be a condition that is unrelated to your GI problems such as an infection or granulomatous diseases (ie, tuberculosis or sarcoidosis). You have waited long enough, I think its best not to jump to any conclusions and wait a little longer to find out what this really is. Please keep us posted. Best regards,\n\n",

Mononucleosis in itself produces symptoms which may include fatigue, fever, sore throat, enlarged lymph nodes, enlarged spleen, etc. etc. The \"bumps\" in your earlobe most likely would not be related to neither strep or mono and from your description, in my opinion, may indicate a nodule from scar tissue, keloid etc. I would strongly suggest that you have a follow up with your physician and please keep in mind that replies are made to posts by volunteers on this site and patience is very appreciated.

    "title": "Three swollen lymph nodes on neck.",
    "content": "Ok, I don't think this necessarily pertains to lymphoma because I really don't think I have that, but this seemed to be the closest fit to what is going on with me.  Alright, I am a 20 year old male, in relatively good health and shape, at least I think.  About two weeks ago, I noticed my left submental lymph node was swollen to about the size of a centimeter.  It was moveable, and mildly tender, but to ease my mind, I went to the doctor.  He said not to worry and I seemed healthy.  A few days ago, this lymph node has begun to decrease in size, and now it is pretty small.  About a week ago, I noticed one of my left posterior cervical lymph nodes on the back of my neck had swelled up.  It was not tender, but it is moveable.  It grew over a few days and stopped growing.  Today, I noticed one of my right posterior cervical lymph nodes is beginning to swell up.  It is not tender, and much smaller than the other two.   I'm just wondering, is it normal to feel completely healthy and have all these lymph nodes swell up all over my neck?  Should I go see my doctor again?  He always acts like I'm overreacting when I go in.  Should I not be worried?    Sorry about this, I'm just moderately paranoid about this stuff.  I'm a molecular biology minor in university, and learning about all this stuff has caused me to be paranoid.   Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi altinure, When you state submental are you referring to under the chin? The submental lymph node is located just below the chin. It drains the lower lip, floor of mouth, teeth, submental salivary gland, tip of tongue, skin of cheek. Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis. The posterior cervical lymph nodes extend in a line posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscles but in front of the trapezius, from the level of the mastoid bone to the clavicle (on the side of the neck near the back). They drain the scalp and neck, skin of arms and pectorals, thorax, cervical and axillary nodes. Common causes of enlargement include tuberculosis, lymphoma, head and neck malignancy. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Regarding your wisdom teeth, your orthodontist would be in the best position to identify if there was available space for your teeth to come in without difficulty. As you can see from the above information, yes, lymph node enlargement may be associated with dental disorders etc.  If in a period of observation (3-4 weeks) including treatment with a course of antibiotics is ineffective and lymph nodes continue to enlarge, this would warrant other diagnostic studies. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. I hope you find this information helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Any info or advice  I can get would be greatly appreciated.   This is in regards to my 5 year old son.    About 4 months ago I noticed a swollen lymph node on my son's neck, one down by the jugular area not under chin.  Doctors examined and treated with ABX.  No change so he went to see the ENT.  ENT described it as slightly larger than 1cm, non-tender, moveable, soft.  He also said tonsils were large, about a 3-3 1/2 on the 1-4 scale.  The ENT also tried another round of stronger antibiotics.  No effect either.  Did CBC and got normal results except for slightly elevated eosiniphils.  Doctor decided to follow up again in 6 months, citing we were waiting to see if he would get any sore throats to decide if tonsils needed to come out.  We had a sudden change of plans and are supposed to be moving March 2.  So we scheduled the appointment to check up on it early.  At the time he went he was ill (tonsils very large with white spots on them) and doctor scheduled surgery for 7 days before moving.  He ordered another CBC to be done 7 days after he started his ABX to treat the tonsil infection (Omnicef).  The past weekend (4 days before surgery) he came down with a high fever 104.0 , upset stomach, slight cough and clear runny nose and his sister had similar symptoms two days prior.  Surgery was cancelled.  A few days ago I noticed that he had another enlarged gland on the opposite side of his neck, near his ear.  We got the CBC done, and docs office called to say the doc wanted to discuss the results.  I panicked and told them I could not wait the whole weekend to find out if something serious was going on, and that I needed to know if he has labs that warrented further investigation because we were supposed to be moving 2 days after his next doc appointment and if we had to rearrange plans, I needed to know in advance.  She assured me that if the labs showed anything serious that she would tell me, and that she would call back if the doctor thought it was anything that needed us to stay in town for following.  I didn't get a call back but that really hasn't set my heart at ease.  Some other symptoms I've noticed is a fever occasionally at night (only after this last sickness though, not prior---noticed a fever two days after the fever from being sick was gone) and for three days after he fell ill, he was extremely sleepy.  Would go to bed 10pm, wake 7am, nap 10:30am wake 1pm nap 4pm, wake 6pm back to bed at 10pm.  Sleepiness has since ceased for last 3 days.  He has had a nighttime cough as well, since being sick, and than for about 3 weeks prior to falling ill.  He is constantly getting colds, URI.  I am scared to death, and honestly upset that the doctor wouldn't give me the lab results so I didn't have to sit and speculate all weekend.  What kind of follow up would typically be advised with such symptoms?? Should he be getting these biopsied??  And what type of elevated labs raise suspicion of something more serious than typical illnesses kids get???    Medical history is: Left Hydronephrosis, has gotten 4 surgeries for that : Pyeloplasty, drain placement for complications, double j stent for conplications, than complete pyeloplasty, retrograde, stent, and drain for last surgery due to the complications from scar tissue and subsequent worsening of the blockage in his kidney. Family history:  Mother-Gilbert's syndrome Father-sleep apnea On father's side of family are multiple cancers: Grandfather has possible lung CA, Great-GF died of lung CA, asbestosis?, had melenoma as well.  Uncle also has Lung CA, great aunt Lung CA.  Currently on OMNICEF.  Please give any information or advice you can, I would appreciate it greatly and thank you in advance.\n\n",

I have had no health problems since until last month I developed Shingles.  It has been about 5 weeks and I now have a painful swollen lymph node under my right armpit.  I don't have any other sickness symptoms.  Could this be the shingles infection still lingering or could it be something more, and could the Shingles been the indicator something else is going wrong.  I did have blood drawn at the time I was diagnosed with Shingles and believe everything was fine.  I have read articles that a painful swollen Node indicates infection.  But with the past blood disorder and a father and grandfather who have passed because of blood disorders it has me a little concerned.  My wife called my PCP (primary care physician) and they said to come in as planned on 3/22 (my next appointment) and mention it to the doctor.  Just looking for some optimistic answers and hopefully it is just the infection from shingles lingering.  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

I've been healthy until 11 mos ago. I've had blood work showing my white blood cells where slightly enlarged but that doctor said it was nothing. Recently had a ct scan of neck and it showed a thickening between t1 and t4 where I complained my symptons started. Symptoms started as a feeling of infection in that same area. I'm extrememly fatiqued and feel a slight pressure there. It started as a pea size and now feels like about 1 inch in diameter. A gasterologist biopsyed the area and results where negative for infection and cancer. My prior ct scan showed the thickening and multiple reactive lypnoids on both sides of my neck. I'm still sick and extremely fatiqued. The doctor suggested I return to my primary care physician which I stopped going to because he wouldnt get aggressive with my problem. I never felt my lympnoids and didn't know they where reactive but now the are very swallen and are bothering me and putting pressure on the bottom of my ear. I'm so worried and sick and am tired of going to multiple doctors. Do you have any information on what could be wrong or where I can go and what test I should ask for so I can get this resolved? I've been to 2 md's, 1 pulmonary, 2 neck and throat specialist and 1 gasternologist. I need this resolved. Like I said I was a healthy person with no allergies and not problems until this and now I'm sick every single day. Please please help. I'm also on no medications and was check for reflux and that was negative also. lungs are clear. breathing test normal. thyroid normal.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  Thanks to all who provide information on this great site.  I am a 37 year old, very physically active (marathon runner) male with no known illnesses or past surgeries.  I noticed the other day two small lumps near my mastoid on the right. ( I am writing this with the assumption that the mastoid is the large bony bump behind the ear at the base of the skull). To be more specific, if the mastoid was the face of a clock, the largest of the two would be just off its face at around 7 o'clock.  It is probably the size of a pea and seems to be movable (slightly) and non-tender.  The other one would be on the clock face at about 7 o'clock.  It is also movable but seems about half the size of the other.  I have not been sick for the last month or so but did have a sinus infection (self diagnosed) about two months ago and am always stuffy and have some degree of sinus drainage.  I also have what was a pimple on the right side of my neck that I have messed with and it is now a scab. I suspect however that the lumps predated that.  Again, I just \"noticed\" the lumps but know they were there for at least a couple of weeks if not longer.  In other words, though I know they were there before the other day, it was only then that I noticed that these might be something to be concerned about as they do not exist at all (at least through palpation) on the left side in the same area.  My father has an indolent form of lymphoma in his stomach.  I am, of course concerned about cancer.  Are these actually swollen lymph nodes? Is this an area where swollen lymph nodes are typically related to an infection or other more scary things?  Any feedback would be helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a enlarged node on the posterior cervical chain area, near the bottom.  I have had it for approximately 6 weeks and I don't know that it has gotten larger at all.  At times I think it may be smaller but sometimes not.  I went to the ENT, and he put me on a zpack which I finished and it doensn't seem as if the node is smaller.  It measures around 8mm X 6 mm (diameter).  The ENT said he could tell by feeling it if it was cancer, but from everything I have read I am still uneasy.  He felt as if it is soft and mobile.  I asked him what \"rubbery\" was and he said he doesn't know what a rubbery node is.  In my opinion, the node is not hard, but I don't know if I would call it soft either- and I can't figure out what rubbery would feel like.  He felt as if I had a scalp infection, and I do have some pimples at the base of my scalp that are itchy- but the zpack didn't resolve that.  I go for f/u tomorrow and when I initially asked him what he would do if the zpack didn't work he said maybe a ct but since he felt it was only slightly enlarged maybe not. If it was lymphoma, how rapidly would the node enalrge?  What is the puropse of the CT?  Wouldn't it just be better to get the biopsy out of the way?  I had a ton of blood work done in Sept which was all normal and have  no symptoms.  My neck is a little tender at times.  I do touch the node a lot, could that have prevented it from going down? Thanks in advance, I am so worried about this!\n\n",

He said it could be a shotty node and when I asked how large it was he said around 1/2 a centimeter.  To me it feels larger than that, but he is the doctor!!  I again told him I was worried about lymphoma and he assured me it was not but to come back in 1 month so he could check the size. I feel a little better but am still concerned.  How rapidly does lymphoma grow that I would notice a change in size.  It has been the same size for almost 2 months.  In your opinion would the size be changing if it was lymphoma?  Thanks for your help.  This website is wonderful!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello jenny2, Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.   To answer your question about the rate of growth in lymphoma is difficult. This is because there are indolent (slowly growing) lymphomas and aggressive (rapidly growing) lymphomas. The point is that in your case the lymph nodes do not seem to be growing at all. You do not seem to be complaining of any other symptoms either. My impression is that you do not have to worry about a thing. Have a great Xmas!  References: =========== 1. Libman H.

    "title": "node sze after FNA",
    "content": "I saw a different ENT for the same  node and at first he felt as if it were shotty.  When I went for F/U he felt like it was bigger (although I do check it often and it does not feel any larger to me) so he suggested FNA and CT scan.  Unfortunately due to scheduling difficulties I had the FNA approximately 4 hours before the CT scan.  The area definitely was very swollen and the node (to me) felt about double the size it normally does.  My question is, could the node reading of 1.2 cm on the CT scan actually be larger than the node is normally?  The preliminary FNA came back as \"benign lymphoid tissue, no cells diagnostic for malignancy\"  I guess my concern is that the node is measured as more than 1 cm. (the 1.2 cm measurement is length and diameter is around 0.8 cm) What would the next step be?  The physician has not returned my phone call as to what to do next.  Is the FNA adequate for this?  I have 2 small children and possibly want another but am reluctant until this issue is resolved.  Any opinion would be greatly appreciated.  Thanls for your help Jennifer\n\n",

    "content": "I just have 1 more quick question :) The pathology report stated benign lymphoid tissue, is this a different finding than reactive hyperplasia?  I guess my concern is that the FNAC would have not been adequate to diagnose a lymphoma or low grade lymphoma.  The node really has not enlarged in the past 4 months and definitely does seem smaller at times, so I would imagine a high grade lymphoma would be evident ny now, so I am concerned about indolent types and have read about the difficulty distinguishing indolent lymphomas from reactive hyperplasia.    Thanks in advane for your help, I did finally hear back from the ENT who said that the CT only showed the node as being 1.2 cm and that could have been larger as a result of the FNAC and he did not recommend removing the node.  I have concerns only b/c some say that FNAC is not definitive in dx lymphoma.  In your opinion, is FNAC definitve in ruling out lymphoma?  Again, thank you- you guys provide a great service!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. Node size is used as a clinical alert that more accurate investigations need to be performed. In your case they were performed.   A FNAC is not definitive and a CT scan is not definitive for lymphoma; a biopsy is. However, the combination of both a CT and FNAC are very accurate. CT does not only report the size of the lymph nodes there are other characteristics that would help define a benign from a malignant lymph node.  Benign lymph tissue is not the same as reactive hyperplasia. Benign lymph tissue means what it says, that there is nothing abnormal seen. This would be the case after benign hyperplasia has had a chance to resolve for example.  At this stage, I would advise you not to worry. Keep an eye on your lymph node and if anything new should arise inform your doctor. Nothing more needs to be done.  Best regards.\n\n",

It is hard to the touch and does not move around when pushed.  The presence of this swollen lymp node worries that perhaps my symptoms are all connected.

    "content": "Hi stacylin, Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a lymph node enalrgement, followed by ultrasonography and CT scan. PET scans have been reported in some studies to yield better results than CT scan but they are very expensive and not always available. The postauricular lymph nodes are located behind the ears. They drain the external auditory meatus, pinna, scalp. Common causes of enlargement include local infection. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).

Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician. He/she may elect to observe the area in question over a three to four week period. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations would be a significant finding. If after a period of observation, the area remains questionable, other diagnostics are warranted.

    "content": "Theresa, Thank you so much for taking the time to answer my question!  I took your advice and actually went to the doctor today. She felt around and said that it was indeed a swollen lymp node behind my ear. She checked the other side and my ears. She found no ear infection or any type of other infection. She put me on 300mg of Omnicef twice daily for 10 days, and also told me to apply a warm compress to swollen lymph node at night. She scheduled me an appointment to come back in two weeks to check it. If the node has not gone down she said she will refer me to an ENT to have it snipped out. I mentioned to her that I wanted to be sure of what the node is since I have such a family history of lymphoma and she did mention that my age falls into the age range of most lymphoma cases (25 years old). However, she did not seemed concerned that it could even be cancer. My question is this: why did she put me on Omnicef if I have no infection? I feel fine and she said I had no ear infection or anything, plus the node is NOT sore or red looking. Is the Omnicef given just to cover the bases in case some kind of infection could be lurking? What does a hot compress do? I always think of these questions AFTER I leave and never mention them while I am there. Is there anything else I need to be concerned about? Thanks in advance for taking your time to answer this!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi stacylin, I am glad to hear you went in for an evaluation :) The purpose for the antibiotic therapy is, if there happens to be an underlying or unidentified infection causing the lymph node enlargement the course of antibiotics should decrease th size of the lymph node. The purpose for the follow up in two weeks is to evaluate the effectiveness of the antibiotics and to also evaluate for any changes, appearance, size, consistency, etc. of the lymph node (serial examinations). The application of warmth if the enlargement is due to an inflammatory process may decrease the current size. I hope this makes some sense and is somewhat helpful.

    "content": "Hi stacylin, Bloodwork is certainly a useful study but it can't actually diagnose Lymphoma, but essentially reveals that \"something\" is abnormal. A standard CBC will identify if there are abnormal cells or unusual counts present. Also a test, LDH (Lactate Dehydrogenase) may also become elevated with cancer activity but is elevated for other reasons as well. The true way to diagnose lymphoma is by performing a biopsy. This will be examined by a pathologist. When you go in to the office for a follow up, just ask your physician what lab tests are done for indications for abnormalities. If you let her know that you would like to make informed decisions and would appreciate any information she can provide, I'm sure that will be tactful enough not to cause any offense. In my opinion, if there is enough concern by her to refer you to an ENT, I am sure that she will provide you with the requested information as well as most likely order standard lab tests. I hope you continue to post updates as your time permits. Thank you by the way for the very kind comments. They are very sincerely appreciated. Oddly enough we are nearly neighbors! Best wishes.

It reveals abnormalities that may indicate an infectious origin, some disease states, abnormalities in red blood cells or levels of hemoglobin, indicating anemia, iron deficiency, etc. An ENT is a specialist of the ears, nose and throat. Taking into consideration, where the lymph node enlargement is located, and conditons they are familiar with (both benign and malignant) if a surgical procedure is indicated for removal that would be the specialist you would want to do a procedure in that area (if that makes sense) simply because it's their specialty area.

    "content": "Hi mleydeck, Generally speaking, lymph nodes that fluctuate in size typically indicate an inflammatory or infections process. The jugular lymph nodes lie both on top of and beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) on either side of the neck, from the angle of the jaw to the top of the clavicle. They drain the tongue, tonsil, pinna, parotid. Common causes of enlargement include pharyngitis organisms, rubella. The postauricular lymph nodes are located behind the ears. They drain the external auditory meatus, pinna, scalp. Common causes of enlargement include local infection. The suboccipital lymph node is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. It drains the scalp and head. Common causes of enlargement also include local infection. Consistency of lymph nodes are important. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Again suppurant nodes may be fluctuant (waver in size). The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Essentially, if lymph nodes continue to enlarge despite treatment with antibiotic therapy or present with continued enlargement upon serial examinations this would be a significant finding. The cardiologist should be able to determine chest pressure, shortness of breath, and dizziness are of a cardiac origin or related to the use of the birth control medication. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

It went on for two days and finally I had someone take me to the ER.  They did a cat-scan a urin analysis and a blood work up.  They only found a little bit of protein in my urine and stated there was nothing unusual in my blood work.  The doctor then stated that he found lymp-nodes on my right side where the pain was coming from right by my appedix.  He didn't explain what it was! Only that it was inflamed.  He said that there was no infection so if I got sick or developed a fever I should come back.  I am confused..the nurse said that lymp-nodes are the dumpsters for the body to get rid of the trash. So should I be concerned about what he found?  I just am sitting here in pain and not sure what to do.  I am supposed to follow up with the doctor in a week and they gave me pain medication.  But does this mean I have something else going on?   Ashley\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be highly unlikely if your doctor suspected something serious that he would leave you without further investigations.   As far as I could tell you were describing the inguinal lymph nodes.   The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].  I don't think there's any reason for concern.  Best regards.  References: ========== 1. Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58. 2. Morland B. Lymphadenopathy.

    "title": "persistent, slightly swollen neck glands, nearly 2 years",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 29 year old male.  About 2 years ago, a couple of weeks after returning from a trip overseas (not sure if that's relevant), I noticed the glands on the side of my neck  (under jaw) were swollen.  I could not see them when holding my head in a normal positions, but I could see them when I turned my head to the side and especially when I cocked my head to the side and back (first noticed them while shaving my neck one day).  They pulsate with my heartbeat, visibly.  I had absolutely no other symptoms or ailments (and still haven't).  No other nodes in my body are swollen.  They are completely painless, firm, moveable, and seem to cause me very little problem other than I am so worried because I don't know what it could be.  About 1 month after noticing them, I went to a general practicioner.  He basically said it was nothing to worry about, noting that they were only slightly enlarged (he said the size of a \"pea\" but to me it seems more like the size of a marble), and he said he could move them.  He guessed it was a localized infection and prescribed amoxicillin (spelling?) antibiotic.  They did not help at all - no change.  About two months later (about 3.5 months after I first noticed them), I went back again.  Again he told me not to worry, but I talked him into doing blood count test.  The count was normal across the board, nothing unordinary.  Since then, I've tried not to worry, but the lumps have remained unchanged.   I did not go back to the GP after that because I had dental work that I had been putting off, and I thought perhaps that may have been the cause.  I had a root canal performed and a temporary filling put in about 3 or 4 months before noticing the lumps.  I was supposed to go back to get a permant crown, but I put it off until 1.5 months ago.  They had to redo the filling (they said it had cracks in it) and then they put on the crown.  After that, I did notice the lumps go down just a tiny fraction for about a week, but they've since returned to the previous size...thus, I ruled out that this tooth had caused the lumps.  I smoke, and the doctor told me that this may cause the nodes to swell, but I smoked a long time before and never had enlarged nodes.  My concern is also one of timing, because I noticed them after returning from overseas.  So, to my way of thinking, it seemed I may have contracted something overseas...or maybe the timing is coincidental.  The only other thing I did not note is that I recently checked my blood pressure and it was high )aroudn 144 over 92).  Please help.  I desperately need some direction.  Thanks. Les\n\n",

    "content": "Hi fxtrader, In your post you stated the enlarged lymph nodes were located under the jaw. Did you mean directly under the jaw or located farther down the neck? Here are two of the locations and some information regarding each of them. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. The jugular lymph nodes lie both on top of and beneath the sternocleidomastoid muscles (SCM) on either side of the neck, from the angle of the jaw to the top of the clavicle. They drain the tongue, tonsil, pinna, parotid. Common causes of enlargement include pharyngitis organisms, rubella. There are particular causes of enlargement of lymph nodes related to traveling to specific areas but typically there are other symptoms related as well. Consistency of a lymph node is also important. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant (wavering). The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. It is also important to remember that sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Taking into consideration that there has been minimal changes over an extended amount of time and the areas in question have not consistently shown enlargement and continued doing so would be much less cause for concern and indicate most likely a benign nature. I hope you find this information helpful. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and thank you for the information.  I believe the glands must be the jugular glands you mention.  I recall a coupld of times over the years when I've had a cold and large very soft glands underneathe the jaw become very swollen but are large and soft and gone after a few days.  But these are different.  They are a bit further down the neck. I would describe them as rubbery, though firm...only slightly swollen...and they are located either right next to a jugular vein or attached to it because when I turn my head (in order to see it), the gland pulsates with my heartbeat, visibly.  As for the size, I would say 2 cm, but that's from my view...if you take away skin and other tissue surrounding the gland, it could be that perhaps the gland itself is only about 1 cm.  Also, maybe of note, is the shape.  It isn't really round...it's more of an oval shape.  If you take an egg and stand it on its end, that's about what it's like shapewise.  I appreciate the info.  It's just so difficult because I don't have any other symptoms (at least not noticeable to me).  From what I've been told in the past, it could be 100 things causing it...I'm just trying to at least narrow it down a bit.  Thank you for pointing out to me the different glands to me...I've known that these are different from the swollen glands I've gotten with a common cold...thanks to you I know a little more about it now.  I appreciate your help and if you can offer anything further then feel free to ask any questions you wish.  Thanks again. Les\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: I have a 2 1/2 year old son. He has a dime sized lump on his right side of the neck with a few other smaller pea sized ones. A ENT doc. checked them a  few wks ago and claims they are benign. Nothing to worry about. He just had his tonsils and adenoids removed on feb. 17th.2006 The dime sized lump on his neck seems to be larger now. Back then it was the size of a small bean when the doctor checked it but now its the size (to me) of a dime. It doesnt seem to be painful, or red. I am very concerned because his doctor keeps telling me its due to his cold/coogh. To me its like if he has a cough every other weekend or few weeks. No fevers with the cols just congestion and ear infection right after the surgery. Can some one pls help to define what this may be. I am very concerned and worried!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Madeepooh, A physician can evaluate the texture or consistency of a lymph node and discern whether it feels related to a benign or malignant process. Lymph nodes related to an infectious or inflammatory process may wax and wane and not return to the size of a pre-infectious state. Essentially, sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Lymph nodes that do not decrease in size and continue to enlarge despite treatment with anitbiotics etc., are more suspicious in nature. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If your child has had evaluations, no constitutional symptoms, ie, significant weight loss, night sweats, fatigue, etc., are present, with the above mentioned waxing and waning in size, verses consistent enlargement, in my opinion, I would be inclined to consider that the symptom is most likely related to the recurrent infections and is a benign process. Keep in mind that the lymphatic system is designed as a filter for bacterial/viral infections and mild enlargement typically means that the body is functioning appropriately. If you remain concerned however, have a physician's evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Andilous, As for the cream you are using for eczema, there are  preparations which you should be using for this condition, not an anti-fungal preparation since it apparently is not caused by a fungus or this symptoms would have disappeared long before now. The back pain and neck stiffness may be related to the weight lifting and you should decrease the weight as it appears to be too strenuous. Sometimes people make the error of lifting to much to soon causing muscle strains. Re-injury occurs because the weight isn't reduced to a more tolerable level. Now for the \"lump\". Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The posterior cervical lymph nodes extend in a line posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscles but in front of the trapezius, from the level of the mastoid bone to the clavicle (on the side of the neck near the back). They drain the scalp and neck, skin of arms and pectorals, thorax, cervical and axillary nodes. Common causes of enlargement include tuberculosis, lymphoma, head and neck malignancy. Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time. However, keep in mind that sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If you have had a recent infection, treated with antibiotic therapy, and the \"lump\" has not decreased in size, and continues to enlarge, I would suggest that you have a re-evaluation by your physician to rule out any disorder aside from infection.

    "content": "Hello, I am a 25 year old female with a few problems.  In November 2004 I went to see my P.A., due to a enlarged node in my neck.  She ordered CBC w/Diff, and Z-pack.  When I went back I had 3 additional nodes,(Right side of neck there are 2 nodes \"stuck\" together, feels like a peanut shell) no change to first (1 behind ear,3 on neck).  Blood work was fine.  Referred to ENT.  ENT confirmed nodes, and I also have Vocal cord nodules.  I also was experiencing extreme fatige, weakness, and shortness of breath.  11 months later she scheduled a CT w/ Contrast.  Results:  I have multiple enlarged nodes.  Wanted to perform biopsy, but after a thorough review of my sypmtoms she wants me to go to a new doctor for a physical.  I now have another enlarged node supraclavical area.  (I don't have medical and I cannot find any doctor which will work off payment plans.)  My S.O.B. is growing worse.  I cannot walk 10 feet w/o becoming short of breath, and I have to yawn to feel as though I am getting enough oxygen.  After all this I picked up my medical records and compared my blood work form 2002, and 2004 and the change was my lymphocyte count.  21.7% 2002, 47.3% 2004.  That seems like a pretty big difference.  I am getting extremely worried, as I know something is definitely wrong.  Any help or information would be greatly appreciated.  (All nodes are fixed, non tender.  This has now been going on for 15 months.)  If this were only a reuslt of a past infection would I  be developing more for no apparent reason?  And wouldn't the antibiotics stop the swelling of the other 3 before the developed if they were due to an infection?\n\n",

I will forward this to my colleagues for any suggestions they may have.  You could discuss this problem your P.A. and insist on getting the biopsy done since any other options are not available at the moment.  Regarding your lymphocyte count I wouldn't worry too much about that if your absolute lymphocyte count is not elevated. According to your results there is a minor increase in your current lymphocyte percentage. This condition could be what is known as relative lymphocytosis.   Absolute lymphocytosis may be defined as an increase in blood lymphocytes above 4,000/mm3. Relative lymphocytosis occurs when there is an increased percentage of circulating lymphocytes, but the absolute number does not exceed 4,000/mm3.   Relative, rather than absolute, leukocytosis occurs in a number of clinical situations, such as infancy, viral infections, connective tissue diseases, thyrotoxicosis and Addison's disease. Splenomegaly causes relative lymphocytosis as a result of splenic sequestration of granulocytes.   Best regards.\n\n",

Therefore I am still self pay, and I cannot get insurance because this can be labled a pre-existing condition.  (If I ever find out) Again, thank you both for all your help thus far.  I will keep you posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi yellowflame, We appreciate your updates and hopefully you will continue to do so as your time permits. Sometimes the worst thing about an illness or condition is wondering, waiting, worrying about what's next. Of course the actual diagnosis is scary indeed, but you will have an idea of what you are dealing with and what treatment options are available. Now the link I posted previously is not for health insurance. It is an info line that essentially connects you to financial assistance in order to receive medical care without worrying over many medical bills and how to pay for them. Use the call number to find out what assistance you are eligible for or what you have to do to apply for assistance. People whom have high medical expenses qualify for many programs. Another link I found yesterday had information regarding Connecticut Social Services among other things in which I will place in this post. (Please give them a call) Click here! Our best wishes, and your in my thoughts and prayers. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "I am 38 yrs old and have found a small lump in my right groin.  It feels a little harder than rubber and seems to be attached to something, like maybe a vien.  I have been having pain in my joints, especially my hips and knees.  My family doc seems to think I have degenerative joint disease.  I have also been running a low-grade fever for about 9 mos. that never usaully gets higher than 100, but just high enough to keep me constantly tired .  It stays around 99.6 on most days.  I can always tell when it's coming on because I always get a headache.  Sometimes they turn into migranes. I can usually get my temp down to 99.0 when I take something for my headaches.  I have also been having night sweats, but not real bad ones.  Just enough to make my skin moist and sticky and keep me from sleeping real good. Thought maybe I might be going through perimenopause.  My skin is a little more itchy than normal and seems to be more itchy on my chest, neck and arms but may be due to winter weather.    Lymphoma has of course crossed my mind, but also lupus.  I have had a ANA test come back borderline lupus but the doc could not tell me what that means.  Can you give me some guideance?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].  Concerning your night sweats, they are clinically significant when they are drenching in nature.  A borderline ANA test is of little significance alone.   To diagnose lupus the American College of Rheumatology (ACR) has issued a list of 11 criteria for the diagnosis of this disease. These include malar rash (rash over the cheeks),\u00a0discoid rash (red raised patches), photosensitivity, oral ulcers, nonerosive arthritis (two or more peripheral joints), serositis (pleuritis or pericarditis), renal disorder, neurologic disorder (seizures (convulsions) and/or psychosis), hematologic\u00a0disorder (hemolytic anemia or leukopenia or lymphopenia or thrombocytopenia), antinuclear\u00a0antibody positivity, immunologic disorder (positive anti-double stranded anti-DNA test, positive anti-Sm test, positive antiphospholipid antibody such as anticardiolipin, or false positive VDRL syphilis test).  A person should have four or more of these symptoms to suspect lupus. The symptoms do not all have to occur at the same time.  Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, I urge you to refer to your doctor for a proper clinical evaluation.  Best regards.  References: ========== 1. Libman H.

    "content": "Thank you for responding.  I have since had some tests run by my dermatologist because my hair has also been falling out.  I had him check the lump in my groin thinking it might just  be a cyst and he said that it was definately an enlarged lymph node. He did a ANA test that came back negative, a CBC that came back with a WBC of 4.2 K/ul, RBC of 3.83 M/ul, HGB of 11.4 g/dl and HCT of 34.1 %.  He also did a TSH test that came back 0.28 ulU/ml.  I of course don't know what this all means but he did say that the thyroid test could show the reason for my hair falling out.  I still have a low grade temp, very fatigued, headaches, joint pain, etc. and now have found another small lump in my right armpit.  Should I go to my gynocologist for further evaluation?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, my 8 yr old has baffled 21 drs. I'd love some help!!! In April this year she developed a LARGE (size of tennis ball) under rt axilla. Antibiotics didn't help but it eventually disappeared. It was painful. Then in August similar sized ones appeared under rt axilla and left mandible. Slightly tender. She was running a low grade pyrexia for a couple of weeks. Again massive doses of antibiotics didn't make much difference. Eventually they subsided after a couple of weeks. Then at the star of Sept. she developed small lymph nodes in groin, axilla neck and below ear. Then a 2cm one appeared on the clavicle. On top of all this she developed a severe night-time only earache which is ongoing. Two weeks later her speech is affected and her tongue deviates to the rt .. same side as earache. CT scan, bloods and CXR all essentially normal. ENT detected nothnig. One node removed for analysis. Initial report normal but waitng further tests. If it was lymphoma should they know at this stage? I don't want to ask the dr because my daughter is always present. Thay haven't a clue as to what's going on. She has a bit less energy and her appetite is not as good but only subtle changes. This earache is really bothering me. She is on painkillers every night for the past 5 weeks. I'd love to hear any opinion. Thanks.\n\n",

I've had this bump on my lower right back for several (maybe 6-8) months.  Should I be pushing harder to have a biopsy?  Should I worried at all about this reactive lymph node diagnosis?  Why won't the swelling go down?    Thanks for your help in calming my nerves!\n\n",

    "content": "Chemotherapy has become curative for many patients with advanced stages of Hodgkin\u2019s disease.  A doxorubicin-containing regimen, such as ABVD or ABVD alternating with MOPP, is the treatment of choice for patients presenting with stage III or IV disease, as demonstrated by a randomized phase III trial undertaken by the Cancer and Leukemia Group B (CALGB).  ABVD: doxorubicin + bleomycin + vinblastine + dacarbazine.  MOPP: mechlorethamine + vincristine + procarbazine + prednisone.  This trial showed higher complete response rates with ABVD and ABVD/MOPP (82% and 83%, respectively) than with MOPP alone (65%).  Up to one-third of patients with stage III or IV disease will relapse, usually within the first 3 years after therapy.  For patients who experience a relapse after initial combination chemotherapy, prognosis is determined more by the duration of the first remission than by the specific induction or salvage combination chemotherapy regimen.    Patients whose initial remission after chemotherapy was longer than 1 year (late relapse) have long-term survivals with salvage chemotherapy of 22% to 71%.   Patients whose initial remission after chemotherapy was shorter than 1 year (early relapse) do much worse and have long-term survivals of 11% to 46%.  In addition to duration after remission, resistant disease (see below), the presence B symptoms at relapse and extranodal disease are significant prognostic factors.  A variety of treatment regimens have been used for patients with relapsed Hodgkin\u2019s disease. In addition to MOPP or ABVD in patients who received the opposite regimen initially, a number of other treatments have been used:   BEACOPP: bleomycin + etoposide + doxorubicin + cyclophosphamide + vincristine + procarbazine + prednisone.  COPP/ABVD: cyclophosphamide + vincristine + procarbazine + prednisone/doxorubicin + bleomycin + vinblastine + dacarbazine.  Stanford V: doxorubicin + vinblastine + mechlorethamine + etoposide + vincristine + bleomycin + prednisone.  MINE: mitoxantrone + ifosfamide + etoposide.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Small lump under jaw",
    "content": "For the past several months, I've had a small lump under my neck.  It is located the soft spot, just behind the chin, just beneath the skin.  Several months ago, I had an ingrown hair in this location and as a bad habit, I picked at it.  It felt like a boil underneath the skin, and hurt just the same.  Since then, it has healed completely, but the lump is still there. I haven't thought much of it, thinking it was probably a swollen lymph node (I had a break out of canker sores, and the ingrown hair got infected too).  It's right about the place for the submental lymph node. The lump is fairly hard, moves around slightly (connected to something), and kind of feels like a ganglion cyst I had on my wrist.  I've had this for at least two months and am starting to wonder what I should do, either wait it out or see my campus doctor.  Thanks  Mike 22, Male,  Mediactions: Adderall\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The submental lymph node is located just below the chin. It drains the lower lip, floor of mouth, teeth, submental salivary gland, tip of tongue, skin of cheek. Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  If your nodes remain less than 1cm in size and no other symptoms arise you are safe. If you are concerned or anything new should arise you should contact your physician.  Best regards.\n\n",

While I was sitting down just this recent Friday, I noticed an uncomfort in my groin area, and it's still here today, Wednesday (front right of groin, under abs by private area). It feels like it's starting to go away, but I guess I'm still not sure. It doesn't look swollen, it's normal colored, I fealt for lumps, and there are no lumps that I can tell. Every once in awhile, it feels like the top back of my leg is pulled too, so does it sound like it's very possible this is just a pulled groin?  Also, when I sit down, the uncomfort/pressure feels worse than when I stand up (Meaning I notice it less when I stand up then when I'm sitting)... Also, it didn't feel like my lymph nodes were inflamed, but I guess I'm not an expert, so I couldn't tell.  I'm thinking if it doesn't go away by Friday, I'll be setting up an appointment with my doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi... I'm a 37yo male, don't drink or smoke and with the exception of a ruptured appendix 2 years ago... have always been healthy. About 2 months ago I had a terrible flu (I guess that's what it was... dr. just called it a virus). Even though the coughing, etc has vanished, I still get a low-grade fever every evening.. around 99 or 100 tops. Then, 2 weeks ago I started getting terrible cramping in my right shoulder.. which then moved down to my right arm. I realized the pain was actually coming from my neck and radiating down the arm.. so my doctor sent me to a neurologist who drew some blood (to test for lymes and sed rate ?) and scheduled an MRI for next week.. cerical spine. He said it's probably just a pinched nerve. Well, yesterday I discovered a lump.. about the size of a pea.. seems hard, doesn't move.. on the back of my neck on the left.. maybe an inch and a half off center.. inch and a half south of the base of my skull. He prescribed pain medication but the neck/shoulder pain is now brutal, and now this lump.  Could any of this be related? I'm really trying to over react but unexplained fevers, pain, and mysterious lumps are just not normal for me so I'm concerned. On top of that, I can't explain this, but I just don't feel \"right\" or at 100% which bothers me. Do I even tell my Doc or neurologist about the lump... of wait and see if it goes away?\n\n",

    "content": "HI!  I am a 22 year old and have had an enlarged lymph node or gland (about 3 x 5 cm) so I thought, for almost a year now.  It is located on my neck about an inch below my jaw, is hard, painless, and I can move it around from side to side by about an inch.  I sort of got it checked out when I got tonsilitis this last summer and the ER doctor said I should probably have my tonsills removed because of it.  Another doctor I saw later about it put me on heavy anti-biotics for 10 days to try and get rid of it and I think but am not sure that it may have gotten smaller, but then it just came back to its normal size and never went away.  A few weeks ago I went on anti-biotics again for a kidney infection and nothing with the node changed.  Should I be worried that it is something else?  I have had a couple episodes of hyper-active thyroid in the past and know that thyroid nodes can also exist but it seems a little high on the neck for that.  Is this correct?  It is really important to me because I worry about it a lot but I don't have insurance.  I need to know whether it is serious enough that I need to see a doctor again about it or whether I should just let it be becaue it is benign.  Thanks for your time, ceeyay\n\n",

I went to the doctor regarding the node about 2 months after I first felt it, and he performed blood tests and everthing came back normal. The lymph node has gone up and down in size and I have noticed that when I obsess about it and touch it ( sometimes 30 times a day) it will increase to the 1cm and when I leave it alone it decreases down to 5mm (this takes months).  I have no other symtoms ( no nightsweats, no fevers, no fatigue, no weight loss) and feel generally very well. I have read that touching lymph nodes can cause them to enlarge and would like to know if you think I should just leave it alone or be concerned and go to the doctor about this?  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lucy24, The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, i.e. laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague. Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant (meaning enlarge then decrease in size). The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. Lymph nodes that continue to enlarge upon serial examinations would be significant, or enlargement that would persist despite antibiotic therapy. Taking into consideration that the areas are 1 cm or less in size and have decreased in size over a period of time rather than continuing to enlarge in size, would in my opinion most likely be related to a nonmalignant process. Since these areas have been evaluated by your physician, labwork has been normal, and you are experiencing no constitutional symptoms, I would not be overly concerned at this point. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I'm a 42 yo male in otherwise good health, but am anxious about what I think may be an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node on the left side of my neck.  About 2.5 weeks ago, I had a very serious bout of vomiting/diarrhea (lost 6 lbs on one night).  Went to my physician several days later because I by chance was rubbing my neck and found what I thought was the node.  While I can't give the exact dimensions, it is about 60% the width of my index fingernail, is mildly firm, moveable, with intermittent tenderness (the whole area's becoming tender because I palpate the darn thing 70 times a day!).  No dysphagia, no weakness (though I haven't been exercising much b/c of the anxiety), no night sweats, no change in phonation, etc.  No other discernible l.n. enlargements.  Should I be concerned?  My family doc says \"not to worry\" unless it \"blossoms.\"  He thought it could be a \"calcified node.\"  Is it possible it's a variation of normal?  Or that it's been there a while and I just noticed it?  I've read that the supraclavicular nodes tend to be a little scarier when they're enlarged, but I don't want to panic.  What I want is a chest x-ray and the darn thing removed/examined.  As you can tell, I'm \"concerned alot.\"  Thanks for any help you can give.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 17 years old, about 5'9 225 lbs and am rarely sick. However I noticed a few weeks ago an englarged lymph node on the right side of my jaw. A few inches under my earlobe right along my jawline. I have heard that enlarged lymph nodes are usually caused by infection but have had no symptoms of any infection or sickness. The one thing I think that it could be due to is a small cut or possible a sore that I had on the inside of  my lower lip. I thought the sore was probably caused by me cutting myself with my tooth. It didn't go away for about 5 days to a week. I thought it might have been a kankner (sp?) sore, but wouldnt know because I have never had before. The sore in my mouth was rather painful and annoying for its size, why was probably about the size of the head of a pen or so.  I only have one swollen node about the size of my fingernail.  Which doesnt seem to be either growing or shrinking (though it could be just at a slow rate). I noticed it being swollen about a week or so after my lip got better, but it could have been swollen before or during, I just might not have noticed.  It is kind of tender when I push on it with my finger. It is somewhat firm I guess, but not rock hard. It can also be moved with my finger.  I am mainly concerned with ruling out anything really serious such as lymphoma. Though I am not sure how common that is at my age, and since I just kind of noticed the node being swollen about the same time as my lip was bothering me. Any ideas as to what could be the cause of my swollen node? Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

There has been debate about whether it should be categorized as a malignancy or not since it does not have the potential to spread and can undergo spontaneous resolution (cure).  The only thing that should be of concern is that there have been reports of a rare association between Lymphomatoid Papulosis and lymphoma. Again its a sufficiently rare disease that no conclusions about this association can be confirmed.  Very few people if any have died as a result of this disease.  Best regards.\n\n",

I wasn't too concerned and figured it had to do with my menstrual cycle that I was no longer experiencing due to the lining being burned so I ignored it.  Then last week I notice another lump on the back of my neck just above my hairline(not sure what these nodes are called).  I became concerned and went to the doctors an the next morning they gave me a mammogram but I have to wait a week for results.  They are scheduling biopsies after the report comes in.  Does it sound like it can be linked to cancer?  My doctor didn't want to discuss it with me yet.  She checked my body for any scratches and cuts but didn't find any.  I don't feel like I have an infection anywhere.  I do feel very tired all the time and within a 2 week period I lost 7 lbs about a month ago.  My weight continues to fluctuate which worries me.

The axillary lymph nodes are located in the axillae (arm pits). They drain the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma. Due to the possibility of an infectious etiology (and to rule this possibility out) is most likely the reason for assessing for scratches, cuts, etc.  Consistency-Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. The fact that you are having constitutional symptoms, weight loss and fatigue are reasons for concern and would raise suspicion and certainly warrant further diagnostic studies. I hope that when your time permits you will consider posting an update. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ontariogirl, Lymph nodes that decrease in size are typically related to an infectious process. A lymph node that continues to enlarge, is fixed, and stone hard are suspicious and that is most likely the reason a biopsy is suggested as this should provide a definitive answer to the causative factor. The constitutional symptoms that are present are certainly concerning. You may want to call your physicians office back and if no sooner appointment for the biopsy is currently available then request that if there is a cancellation you would appreciate being moved into there slot. A period of 3-4 weeks of observation of a lymph node to identify if there is enlargement upon serial examinations is a general practice so keep in mind that this is the same amount of time until your currently schedule biopsy. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I've had this painful lump about the size of a golfball under my arm for about a week and a half now, and I haven't been able to figure out what it is.  I've searched on the internet, and I've seen references to anything from cancer to a swollen lymph node, or an abcess.  It's very tender to the touch, and very firm.  I'm not sure how large a swollen lymph node can be, but it seems, to me at least, to be a bit too big for a lymph node.  I've been putting Neosporin (ointment) on it for the past four days, which provides a little pain relief, but I haven't noticed any change in the lump.  I realize that it's impossible to diagnose something without actually seeing it, but wondering if I should go to a walk-in clinic or if I can wait for my medical benefits to kick in about a week or so from now.\n\n",

However, I think from your description it could represent an enlarged axillary lymph node.   Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  I think you should get it checked as soon as possible and not wait for a whole week if it is indeed as inflammed as you describe. Hopefully it will not turn out to be an abscess.

    "content": "Hi, I am 33 years old, generally healthy except for asthma and recurring sinus/bronchitis infections (3-4 times a year). For the past several  months (since May 2005), I have been under follow-up for persistently enlarged lymph nodes in my neck and underarms. The largest neck node is currently 2 cm x 1 cm (upper Left anterior triangle, right under the jaw towards the back) and in may was 19 x .8 cm, i.e. not much smaller. The largest axillary nodes are 1.4x.6 on the left side and 1.4x.6 on the right side, and while they haven't significantly increased in size since may, there do seem to be more enlarged ones than there were previously. I also have a few palpable supraclavicular nodes on both sides, which have not changed in size over the months, and are still no greater than .9 cm. I have had repeat blood tests, including c reactive protein and esr (all normal)  as well as repeat ultrasounds to follow the nodes, all of which stated they appeared non-malignant. I also had an abdominal ultrasound which was normal.  I am supposed to go back to the surgeon on tuesday with my recent ultrasound results, and am really really scared. I don't know whether I should push for biopsy, and I don't know what to think.   I have read all the stuff on the net, and my understanding is that palpable supraclavicular nodes are suspect and should be biopsied, even if they are less than 1 cm.   Please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi littlebugs, An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes' and feel much like \"buckshot\" under the skin. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy has the highest risk of malignancy, estimated as 90 percent in patients older than 40 years and 25 percent in those younger than age 40 [1]. This refers to a clinically significant lymph node enlargement. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size.  However, nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter [2,3].  It's good to hear that to present your lab studies have been normal and the ultrasound report does not indicate malignancy. The surgeon, based on your symptoms, and the information provided in the reports will decide if a biopsy is warranted.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: ========= 1. Fijten GH, Blijham GH.

During my annual physical in late August, my GP (his second year in practice) said my blood work indicated anemia and he felt what he thought was a swollen lymph node in my groin.  The CT scan was negative (unremarkable).  He sent me to a Hematologist/Oncologist who said everything was negative and all was okay including the slightly low red count and low hematocrit because of the athletics.  He said the he felt a \"shotty\" mass in my left groin but felt it was actually the inguinal ligament.  The oncologist was puzzled by my GP's referral.  That was August/Sept/ Oct. This is probably totally unrelated ( I hope) In November, I began hearing a pop in my right ear, behind the drum quite frequently.  In late December I presented with slight sinus drainage, slight pain on right side of jaw and ear and swollen gland under right side of chin.  GP said that although he could not see anything,  its an infection and prescribed Augmentin for seven days.  He said the entire lymph chain on the right side is enlarged.   The seven days have passed.  Nothing has changed or improved. The gland is still swollen and slightly tender.  There is still some slight pain on right side of jaw and ear and ear still pops.  There is slightly more pain when I press in the area of the ramus of the mandible.  I have an ever so slight sore throat on the right side, and some very mild pain on occasion up the right side of my face to the front of the ear. The symptoms seem to become more noticable as the day progresses.  I feel wonderful when I wake up in the morning.  As I think about it, I begin to notice the smptoms.    I have called my GP twice in the past two days for an appointment, but he, on both occasions said I should not see him, that it can take up to a month of the swelling to go down after an infection.  He said on both occasions that if, after a month, it is still swollen, he will CT and send me to an ENT.  I have no loss of weight or appetite.  No night sweats, no pallor, no fever or chills.  There is absolutely no history of cancer in any member of my family on either side.  Not even a suspicious mole.  I have never had my wisdom teeth removed.  A dentist told me several years ago that, \"someday, you may have a problem.\"  Man oh man, I hate to wait a month.  This is really bothering me, physiologically, specially after the first scare.  To be honest, I am fearful because of his reaction back in August.  Any thoughts, PLEASE.  I know this is complicated but would really appreciate some additional medical thinking.  JL\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John, I see no reason for concern at all. What doctors are concerned about is unexplained lymph node enlargement as opposed to a lymph node enlargement that appears to have a clear clinical cause.  The lymph node you described is called the submandibular lymph node. It is responsible for draining the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae and is commonly enlarged as a result of infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx (much more commonly than cancer).  Regarding size: An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].   Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be:  Firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (I. e. stuck to each other), fixed (I. e. not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.   Following infection, however, Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  I understand your anxiety about your doctor, but if anything he was being over-cautious and not negligents. My impression, like his impression is that there is nothing to to it; however, given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool and your anxiety about the efficiency of your doctor you may want to get checked out by another doctor.

    "content": "Dr. I'm sorry to be a bother, but I need your guidance again.  I had a head and neck CT scan last week for the swollen lymph node described above.  The results were completely negative.  There were no abnormalities.  The gland is still swollen, but slightly smaller.   My doctors nurse called with the results and said not to worry, that I am \"completely healthy.\" I asked her if leukemia was a possibility.  She said, \"NO\" there are lots of other things we see for leukemia.  My doctor, yesterday closed his office for a month and I am without a physician. I still have concerns.  The subcutaneous bleeding I described above is still present, on occasion. (not always).  My mother bruised and bled very easily.   I also  experience some occasional itching on the surface of my skin.  It is never deep and it happens only occasionally and is relieved with slight scratching or rubbing.  I have no loss of weight or appetite.  No gum bleeding and I sleep well.  I am not fatigued.  I exercise every day and golf frequently.  Two months ago, as described above, a hematologist/oncologist studied a blood sample and found that I was slightly anemic.  My question to you is, would leukemia have been obvious to the hematologist when he looked at my blood results?  I would like to re-visit the hematologist, but am concerned that without my physician to refer me, I will not be able to see him.   What are the markers for leukemia that you see.   There is no history of cancer in my family on either side.  I'm sorry to be such a worry wart, but I am restless about continuing symptoms.  Thanks in advance  John L.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear John L, First of all congratulations! The CT results and the fact that the swelling is decreasing in size rules out anything serious in the lymph nodes.  I understand your concern about the subcutaneous bleeding. I am in no position to estimate the severity of this but if it is increasing in intesity and frequency you should have someone check it out. As for your question regarding leukemia. As I am sure you know leukemia is a disease of the blood and it manifests itself by producing various changes in the blood film. So a CBC that does not show any of the criteria for leukemia is definitive. I would suggest that you do a follow up CBC and consult your hematologist again. When you do meet your hematologist focus on only one problem which is the subcutaneous bleeding, ask him for an explanation and his assessment of the situation.  Keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Doctor, I can see how physicians can sometimes become frustrated with patients.  From time to time,  we do no think clearly and and do not convey complete information, or maybe forget things that are symptomatic.   The reason I posted to you yesterday was because of a sudden bleeding under the skin on my lip after I scratched it with my fingernail.  A second scratch produced the same result.   It was not until this morning did I realize that I am taking ibuprofen for tendinitis in my left arm.  600 Mg 3X per day.   I did not take the ibuprofen last night or this morning and when I scratch at my lip this morning, nothing happened.  About 10 years ago, my physician, at that time, had prescribed one prophylactic baby aspirin a day.  I had to stop after several weeks because of excessive bleeding from small wounds.  In August of this year, I was taking ibuprofen for another exercise induced tendinitis, but had to stop because of severe widespread gastritis.  I think that ibuprofen and I do not get along.   I am still going to try to get an appointment with the hematologist to be sure.  I want you to know how much I appreciate the service you offer here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.   Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.   Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes', which is probably what you are experiencing.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].   An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  Given that your condition does not progress and you do not develop new symptoms, have it looked at by your doctor during your next visit.  References: ========== 1. Libman H.

    "title": "swollen lymph nodes under ears",
    "content": "Hello,  In July, I went to Venezuela and my third day there I noticed that I had some swollen glands in my neck. They didn't hurt. After a week, they didn't change so I went to see a doctor, who told me I had a throat infection, and she gave me antibiotics telling me the glands would disappear in about two weeks. I took the antibiotics (aument\u00edn, in Spanish), but the nodes didn't go away. About a month later (middle of August), I was back home in Montreal, so I went to see my physician there. She said my lymph nodes were still a bit swollen and my throat infection wasn't completely gone. So she prescribed me another kind of antibiotics.  A week later, I moved to Los Angeles (for school), I noticed my glands were a but smaller, but still not gone,  so I went to consult a physician who referred me to an Ear Nose Throat specialist. He said I have a thyroglossal duct cyst under my chin, and the other nodes were caused by a cat scratch, and that I shouldn't worry about them, they will go away, and it didn't look at all like cancer or anything else, that blood tests weren't necessary, neither was a biopsy.  The nodes disappeared during fall, but now, since about two weeks, they came back but this time they hurt, and I have had other symptoms such as lightheadedness and slight nosebleeding. I also think I might have anemia, because I was diagnosed with low iron in my blood last year.  What should I do? The three doctors I've consulted didn't seem too worried, so I didn't do much about it. Should I go see a doctor soon? Or should I wait and see if it goes away?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Hard lump in the back of the neck, biopsied today",
    "content": "About two weeks ago I found a hard lump on the back of my neck, directly above C7.  I went to my physician who measured it to be about 2cm.  He recommended a CT Scan and a needle aspiration biopsy.  I had both of those procedures done today.  The radiologist said he \"didn't see much\" on the CT scan.  He then proceeded to do the biopsy.  As he was doing it he said he was having \"a lot of trouble getting anything out of it\" as the mass was a lot harder than he initially thought. He had to do the biopsy twice.  He said he would send what he got to pathology, but thought I would probably have to have the lump removed for it to be fully biopsied.  Now I wait.  I am hoping someone has some insight into what this could possibly be.  I don't have any other symptoms that I'm aware of.    I should also say that I had papillary thyroid carcinoma about 20 years ago.  I had a subtotal thyroidectomy followed by radioactive iodine treatment.    The cancer was only diagnosed after it had spread to a local lymph node.  Nothing was ever palpable in the thyroid because the tumor was behind it.   I don't know if this is a recurrence of that, something else sinister or just an innocuous bump.  Any insight, whether you think it's nothing or something bad (I won't freak out)  would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Let me first say that at the C7 the normal bony protuberance of the vertebra is more pronounced than its neighbouring vertebrae. I would assume that your doctors would easily be able to identify with that by examination and certainly by radiography. It does not appear to be the site of lymph node enlargement, the suboccipital lymph node being a little higher than the area you described.  I understand that you are concerned about your past history of thryoid cancer and that is probably why your doctors are proceeding with more investigations. Please let us know the results of your investigation if a definitive decision has been made. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Christie321, Although very rare, there is a clinical entity called vertebral pseudotumor. Its not a real tumor but appears to be so in both the clinical and radiological settings.  Vertebral pseudotumors may be classified into those of vertebral origin and those of disk-space origin. Those of vertebral origin, as cited in the literature, include those related to spinal tuberculosis; synovitis, hyperostosis, and osteitis (SAPHO) syndrome; fibrous dysplasia; and osteoporotic vertebral collapse [1].  Tuberculous pseudotumors can present as destructive vertebral masses that may not radiographically appear to be of infectious origin.  The SAPHO syndrome may mimic vertebral tumors (eg, sclerotic bone tumors) because of the erosive changes with adjacent sclerosis and the hyperostosis that can appear similar to blastic vertebral metastasis [1]. In cases of SAPHO, additional lesions can be identified with conventional radiography, bone scintigraphy, CT, or MR imaging. Again, the findings may be suggestive of metastatic disease when this disease process is actually benign.  Space-occupying masses are seen in fibrous dysplasia. In such cases, T1-weighted MR images may show decreased signal intensity, and T2-weighted images may show variable signal intensity, depending on the degree of lesion ossification. Chordoma, a mass that arises from a remnant of the notochord, can also appear as a disk-space mass. These tumors occur chiefly in the occipital-cervical and sacrococcygeal regions, and they less frequently appear in the lumbar, cervical, and thoracic regions [2].   References: =========== 1.

    "content": "Hi christie321, Thank you for your kind words. Its more than likely that its not related to the thyroid cancer. That's my impression. First, although papillary cancer of the thyroid is an indolent disease it commonly spreads to the lymph nodes and distant spread (to lungs or bones) is very uncommon.  If suspicious the doctor could order a thyroglobulin test, although I do not really see the merit in doing this.  Second this is not a common site of metastasis in the vertebra whether be it from thyroid cancer or any other cancer. The cervical spine is the least often involved by spinal metastases (10%), followed by the lumbar spine (20%), and the thoracic spine (70%).[1] I think the excisional biopsy will be more definitive and I strongly suspect one of the pseudotumors above (including chordoma).

I don't think it should return and if it does you just need to follow up with an MRI to make sure that everything is alright.  You will need nothing more than follow up for this case should it recur.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen lymph nodes in lower back",
    "content": "18 months ago I started getting an isolated pain on the back of thigh. It came and went for 6 months. I then had an ultrasound and x-ray of the area which didn't show anything and CBC. The pain came back a month ago with pain in my hip area. The pain in my hip area became constant and I noticed that I had 3-4 swollen lymph nodes in my lower back near the pain. They are about 2-3 cm and move easily. 10 days ago I had an MRI of both areas which didn't show anything unusual. The only other symptom I have is that I have occasional drenching nights sweats which I have also had for over a year.   I can't determine if the lymph are causing my back pain because I noticed them after my back started to hurt.    Even though my test so far came back alright I am still worried. I can't find any information on what could cause swollen lymph nodes in that area.   What do you think? What should I do next?  Thank you!\n\n",

The nature of any swelling in that area would have shown up quite easily in the MRI.   As for the drenching night sweats, you could seek medical attention specifically for them. They could be related to many disorders. They are unlikely to be related to lymphoma when you do not present with lymph node enlargement. However, that is also a possibility your doctor would exclude on evaluating night sweats.  Best regards.\n\n",

However, the impression I got is that you did and MRI over the region concerned and the results came back normal (ie, no lymph nodes).   If however, these swellings are palpable and the MRI has not provided any help, then maybe you should suggest a biopsy from the palpable swellings. If indeed they are readily palpable it shouldn't be very difficult have them sampled.  Regarding the night sweats, please inform your doctor if they are increasing in severity or frequency.

    "title": "Non-painful hard lymph node side of neck",
    "content": "First off, my current state.  23 years old, healthy, but I caught a cold a few days ago - runny nose, etc.  This lead to my sore throat that I now have (second day with it now).  However, what does bother me enough to send this message is that I randomly touched my neck and found this lump at the back of my neck (midarea, only on the left hand side of the neck).  From what I've read, it's a swollen lymph gland.  It's pretty hard - circular, but not painful.   I'm not sure what it means for it to be mobile, but when I press down it, it does shift a little (when my neck is relaxed).     However, I wasn't too worried because when I was a kid I've had something fairly hard and swollen which felt the same, and by x-ray and doctors it was just a normal neck gland thing.  Right now, I'm thinking it's just a regular swollen gland that came with the cold I got.  But since I checked the internet (foolishly), it said that I have to be careful with swollen lymph nodes that are painless and hard.  There is certainly no pain when I touch the node, and it does feel hard.   But from what I read, what defines a normal lymph node to be OK?  Is a normal one supposed to be sponge or jello soft?  I want to clarify this cause I'm not sure how \"hard\" they mean (especially if swollen) and to know what it means for a lymph node to \"feel\" normal.      Anyway, should I be immediately concerned and tell the doctor?  I've been visiting the doc for a while (as in, in the past 5 months, I think 9-10 visits) and I'm beginning to think this is annoying him (I think they've all been for legitimate reason up til now, although a big part was cause II worried myself stupid from looking up these thingson the net).   My most recent was just last week on Thursday (but for something completely unrelated to this lump), so if possible I want to avoid visiting the doc right away, but I will if you guys recommend I do so.  Or should I just wait for the sore throat to subside and see if the node shrinks any afterwards?  Thank you for your time,  Hydragon  P.S. I did the foolish thing and tried looking up a symptom like this lump thing on the internet to know what it was.  I know all that does in the end is freak out and worry a person who knows nothing about this stuff (like me, for example, or else I wouldn't have written this message).    Thankfully, I've learned my lesson and I'll only be using google only for topics that I like.  To people out there who know what I'm talking about - spread the word: DON'T USE THE NET TO DIAGNOSE YOURSELF!  Don't replace your own common sense with google search!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello HydragonWarrior, Sometimes a lymph node enlargement is considered normal, while at other times it is not. The basis of differentiation between what is considered normal and what is not, rests on the clinical significance of the finding. Let me review a few points to clarify what is considered a clinically significant lymph node enlargement.   An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].   Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy.[4]  In primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[4]  Given the limitations of the internet in clinical evaluation, you are advised to seek medical attention. In your case the most probable outcome of your evaluation would be to put you under observation for 3 to 4 weeks and then re-evaluate these nodes. The doctor may also recommend a course of antibiotics based on his evaluation.  If it persists after a period of observation then the patient should seek medical attention for further investigations using ultrasonography and FNAC or an excisional biopsy.

The lump on my neck I've had since childhood, and my doc verified it's nothing to be concerned about.  Since i've had x-rays and the like previously on that area as a kid, that conclusion was already drawn that my gland was just like that.  I'm guessing it might have been since I removed my tonsils - I dunno.   But that was several years ago, and I guess I forgot what it was - I suppose it wasn't important to me cause I was a kid.  But I'm told I'm completely healthy and OK, and I feel much better mentally!  And the sore throat was just a sore throat, and after some antibiotics it's pretty much gone.    Anyway, thanks for the fast reply,  Doctor.   Talking to my family doc eased my mind a lot.  Cheers!  -Hydragon\n\n",

    "content": "Hi lsmith0517, Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician.Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a lymph node enalrgement, followed by ultrasonography and CT scan. PET scans have been reported in some studies to yield better results than CT scan but they are very expensive and not always available. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. Constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. Your physician may want to evaluate and observe the area over a period of 3-4 weeks or prescribe a course of antibiotics if he/she feels this enlargement iis related to an infection. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Have an evaluation by your physician to identify the causative factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Enlarged R supraclavicular lymph node",
    "content": "Hi, I would appreciate some reassurance about my condition.  Many months (maybe even over a year) I noticed that I slightly enlarged node in my right supraclavicular area.  I believe I had a cold at the time, but I'm not sure.  In any case, I figured if it did not enlarge any further it was no big deal.  It is about 1cm, painless, movable, rubbery, and feels like it may have a smaller node or a bump attached on the interior side.  It has not enlarged or changed as long as I can remember (though I've only been paying extremely close attention to it for two months or so).  However, I've had some other recent medical problems (a pituitary adenoma that is being successfully treated with medication) that prompted me to ask my doctor about the node.  Both my GP and endocrinologist suggested that if it does not grow and I have no other symptoms, it is almost surely benign.  Are they right about this?  If the node were cancerous, how rapidly or slowly could it grow?  What else could cause a painless, long-term enlarged node other than cancer?  My GP said that it felt normal and maybe was just more noticable because I am a thin person.  Is this possible?  I'm a little nervous about it at the moment because I have a cold, and the node is a little more enlarged and sore (so are my other neck nodes).  I can feel other nodes in the supraclavicular area, but they are very small and I couldn't feel them until I got this cold.  I imagine my constant touching of them does not help...  So my question is: does this sound suspicious?  Should I just keep monitoring it or push for an ultrasound or biopsy?   Just wanted to add for clarification - I am 29, female, and otherwise healthy I think... Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello copper_blue, Thank you for using The Doctors Lounge. Let me discuss a few points related to your question.  The right supraclavicular node drains the area of the mediastinum, lungs, esophagus and are a cause of concern since they may harbor cells from lung, retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal cancer.  Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy has the highest risk of malignancy, estimated as 90 percent in patients older than 40 years and 25 percent in those younger than age 40. [1]  Regarding size: Size: An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [2, 3]. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [4] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 (1 cm 3 1 cm) had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 (1 cm 3 1 cm to 1.5 cm 3 1.5 cm) in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2 (1.5 cm 3 1.5 cm). These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (I. e. stuck to each other), fixed (I. e. not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.   Infected Lymph nodes, however, tend to be:  Firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.   Following infection, however, Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  This last condition is probably what your doctor suspects you have.  Given your discription of further lymph node enlargement and the appearance of new suspected lymph nodes, I recommend that you contact your physician as soon as possible. The picture you describe is consistent with a shotty lymph nodes however, to rule out more serious disease a clinical examination should be repeated.  References: 1- Fijten GH, Blijham GH.

    "content": "Hi Dr. Fouad:  Thanks for your prompt reply.  I have a few follow-up questions.  Can the right supraclavicular nodes enlarge in response to a cold if it affects the lungs?  Other than the original single node that I noticed months ago, I did not notice any other ones until I came down with a cold.  My second question is about the timecourse of the lymphadenopathy.  If this original node has not enlarged noticeably for several months, am I in the clear?  A 25% cancer risk sounds very frightening.  Is cancer of a specific organ more likely in this case than lymphoma?  What other symptoms should I be on the lookout for?  I have an appointment with my GP today and will post again.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Please let me emphasize that the 25% risk of cancer is associated with a clinically significant lymph node enlargement. That's really what you should focus on. The enlargement you describe (which I haven't seen) seems to be in the range of 1 cm. It  also seems that your doctor is not worried by any of its features on examination. If this is the case none of these statistics apply to you. I was only discussing the age factor with you earlier.  What your doctor is presuming and what I have also noted above is these nodes are probably a result of a previous viral infection. A viral infection can be accompanied by flu-like symptoms.  The fact that the lymph node has not changed in size is a good sign (again given the size of your node). For example, a supraclavicular lymph node of 2.5 cm that does not grow in size is still worriesome.   The appearance of several other lymph nodes and the absence of any other symptoms are also in favor of a benign condition.   As I said earlier, the right supraclavicular lymph node is more commonly involved in the following cancers : lung cancer, retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal cancer.   I'm sure everything will be alright. Please let me know what your doctor says.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks again for your reply!  It is very easy to overreact with all the information available online.  :)  My doctor examined the node again this morning, and did not think it had changed in size at all since my last appointment (about 2.5 weeks ago).  It is still about 1 cm, rubbery, and movable.  She did not feel any other nodes in my supraclavicular area (apparently I was feeling other structures).  She noted that a few of my neck nodes were enlarged due to the cold virus I have right now, but none of them seemed abnormal.  However, she suggested that due to my level of anxiety about the supraclavicular node that I could consider having it biopsied.  She says it is near the skin and would be a very simple procedure and then I could put the issue to rest.  I have an appointment with the surgeon next week for a consultation.  Do you think it makes sense to go for the biopsy as soon as possible, or just watch things for another month or two?  My doctor did not seem to think a biopsy was urgent but that I might want it for peace of mind.  Is this routinely done?  Is there any risk to the biopsy?  Thanks again.\n\n",

There are no risks as far as I know associated with the biopsy procedure. Please ask the surgeon that question as well. Also remember to get all the info you need about the size, location of the incision and if it will leave a scar or not. I should stress that this procedure is a very simple one and does not have any complications but you should get that info from your surgeon first hand. Go over all the details with him until you feel satisfied.   Best regards and let us know how it turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,   I met with the surgeon today, and like my GP, he is convinced that the node is normal and probably just never returned to normal size after some infection or something.  That was very comforting to me.  He said there was no reason to remove it, but he wouldn't mind doing so if it was causing me a lot of concern (which it is).  So we have scheduled the biopsy for January 5.  I will have local anesthesia, and it will be an incision of a centimeter or two that will require a few stitches.  He said it would leave a scar, but I'm not especially concerned about that - I would rather know for sure that everything is okay.  Thanks again, and I'll keep you posted.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, just had a quick few questions. To start of I am a 24 year old male physically fit. I have no symptoms really beside having a small lump on my neck in the spot where the posterior cervical nodes are. It's only on my left hand side a little under my ear/hair line. The node is approx 1.2 cm long by .7 cm wide (i am guessing). I noticed it when I was using two mirrors to shave. I turned my head one way and it popped out a little. The node seems to move under the skin, is a little hard but has a little give to it. As for how long it has been there, I sort of remeber feeling it there as long as 2 years ago or more but can't be certain.  Should I be concerned?  If it was cancer, how long would it stay there before enlarging or me getting other symptoms?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Brian871, The posterior cervical lymph nodes extend in a line posterior to the sternocleidomastoid muscles but in front of the trapezius, from the level of the mastoid bone to the clavicle (on the side of the neck near the back). They drain the scalp and neck, skin of arms and pectorals, thorax, cervical and axillary nodes.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.   Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.   Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (usually less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy.[1]  Also in the same study, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[1]  As you can see the overall incidence of cancer of the lymph nodes in your age group is very small.   To answer your question regarding the rate of progression, it is variable and depends mainly on the pathology of the disease. Some cancer have a very slow and indolent course while most others will develop dramatically within a period of 6 months.  Please understand that I am unable to give you a final verdict on this given the restrictions of the internet. However, my impression is its nothing to worry about. I recommend that you share your concerns with your doctor. If its worrying he could have it tested or even removed.  References: ========== 1. Fijten GH, Blijham GH.

    "content": "I have had a swoolen lymph node in my neck under my chin for about 2 years(that I noticed it). I had a CT scan on it and the test said it was swollen to about 2cm if I remeber correctly. I have had a small lymph on the back of my neck and it is small and hard. I think that one swelled up due to acne and pimples on my head when I used to shave my head during haircuts and would pick at them often and has never gone away. A few weeks ago a lymph node in my groin area swelled. Not large just the size of a bean but I can tell its there. My doctor told me that the node under my chin he thought was nothing because there was nothing to support cancer(Weight loss,night sweats,etc).It has stayed the same size the whole time,sometimes feels hard, sometimes soft. My question is, I am worried over nothing?? I mean I have 3 swollen lymph nodes in my body and am very nervous because I hear about all these cancers with the lymph nodes(Hodgkins disease).I am in great shape, always exercise and eat well. Should I be concerned or what other symptoms should I look for to let my doctor know that I want this looked into. Can lymph nodes stay swollen permanatley or are they supposed to go back to normal size?? Any information will be very helpful. Thank You\n\n",

These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  The first lymph node you described is probably the submandibular lymph node. The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx.  The suboccipital lymph node is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. It drains the scalp and head. Common causes of enlargement include local infection.  The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].

    "content": "Hello- 29/Male w/ fatigue, lump on neck  I went to my GP to have a node looked at on my neck/shoulder (left side, base of neck about 2 inches back from my clavicle). The position of this node really scares me (as everything I've read seems to make this area for nodes quite bad) and I'm unsure how long it has been present (it doesn't hurt)...  It is about the size of a pencil eraser, movable and semi-firm (not rock hard, not soft). The GP felt it and said it was a node but that he was pretty sure it was enlarged from a past infection, saying the nodes \"always stay sort of puffy and never really return to normal\".  Is this true? I've never found any information to support this... I also want to know roughly where the supraclavicular region is (is it directly under the clavicle or can it be further back toward the neck/back)?  The end result is he would not order any tests for it (he offered to see me in a month to see if it was bigger, but didn't measure it to compare) and I am still very concerned. Should I seek a second opinion?  Thanks for your time...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi hedgel, The left supraclavicular lymph node is located on the left side in the hollow above the clavicle, just lateral to where it joins the sternum. It drains the thorax, abdomen via thoracic duct. Common causes of enlargement include lymphoma, thoracic or retroperitoneal cancer, bacterial or fungal infection. Supraclavicular lymphadenopathy has the highest risk of malignancy, estimated as 90 percent in patients older than 40 years and 25 percent in those younger than age 40 [1]. This refers to a clinically significant lymph node enlargement. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size.  However, nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter [2,3]. Generally speaking, it would be considered appropriate to observe a particular lymph node for a period of 3-4 weeks to monitor for any increase in size. Upon your physician's evaluation a course of antibiotics may be indicated as well if there are any suspicions of an underlying infection.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Keep in mind that even after an infection subsides, an enlarged lymph node related to this (even if it's trivial) may not return to it's pre-infectious state. If it persists after a period of observation then I would suggest that you  seek medical attention for further investigations by using diagnostic studies, for example, ultrasonography, FNAC or an excisional biopsy, etc. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: ========= 1.

    "content": "I'm 14 years old, and just about a year ago I noticed an extremely large lump in the crease of my right leg.  I went to my doctor, thinking it was a hernia and found out that it was an extremely large lymph node.  He ran a few tests on my and found out that I had Cat Scratch Fever, and perscribed me anti-biotics.  After the swelling did not subside, he decided to remove the lymphnode for biopsy.  Apparently, the tests came back fine, but I still don't feel convinced to this day.  I still have a much smaller, but still swollen lymphnode in the same place that he says may be there for quite some time, and Itoday I noticed some swelling in my neck.  They seen generally small but I'm worried that I might have something serious to be concerned about.  I've had recent blood tests (a mono spot) and no abnormalities came back, but I just want to be sure that I don't need to be concerned.  All help is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Inferno, Let me start by saying that there is not one post on this forum any more important than another and posts are answered to the best of everyone's ability by people who \"volunteer\" their time on this forum. With that being said, I will proceed in trying to answer your question. One of the reasons lymph nodes commonly enlarge is as a result of bacterial/viral infections because the lymphatic system is the bodies defense in fighting infection. Lymph nodes may not return to their pre-infectious size after an infection subsides. So essentially, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. A biopsy is a very definitive  procedure in determining whether a lymph node is malignant or benign in nature as is is evaluated by a specialist (Pathologist). Taking into consideration that the other lymph nodes are decreasing in size verses enlarging, in my opinion, the most likely causative factor would be viral/bacterial infection related. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Let me start by apologizing for my impatients.  I am sometimes a very nervous person, but in the case of my lymphnodes, its very serious and so I become concerned very easily.  Continuing on, my still swollen lymph node is non-tender, but larger than 1 cenimeter.  And I've tried to recontact my doctor for a check up to be postive that I'm fine, and he doesn't seem concerned himself.  I myself am still a tad worried about it.  I show no symptoms of lymph node cancer, or any other lymph node infecting diseases that I know of, except for the swollen lymph nodes.  I am healthy 99.9% of the time and have maybe had 1 cold since November of last year, when the lymph node was discovered.  If my doctor is not concerned about the size of this lymph node, should I be, and move to a new doctor for a second opinion?  I see you don't seem worried either, so perhaps I'm over reacting.\n\n",

I have always had good health and although slightly overweight, live a healthy lifestyle, IE no smoking, rarely drink. Three days ago I noticed a small lump on my right side, at the base of my neck, right above my collar bone. It seems to me to be an enlarged lymph node that is a bit larger than a Nickel in diameter. I have also over about the past 2 weeks had a slight pain in my neck in that area, that has intensified over the last few days. I sit at a computer for most of my day so before noticing this lump I had just attributed the pain to that. I am wondering if any of the medical professionals on here could provide me with any explanation of what this could be. Thanks!\n\n",

It is imperative that cancer be ruled out by clinical examination.  Please let us know what your doctor thinks. Best regards,\n\n",

I have also had it examined by my father, who is a dentist, and he also said that it did not feel like a lymph node to him either. However, I am still concerned. The lump is at the base of the right side of my neck, right where the central vein running down the right side of my neck goes into my body. The bump is most clearly shown by depressing the skin on either side of it. It is about the size of a marble but is not firm. Both my father and my ENT Doctor seemed to think that it is something that has maybe been there forever. I however, know that this is not true. I have also had pain, not in the exact area of the bump but in my neck/shoulder area, for about the last 3 weeks. I am wondering if anyone has ever had something like this or could at least tell me what this could possibly be. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello LEJ1445, Thank you for your kind words. I am glad that you had it looked at. I trust that their evaluation; however, I understand your worry. Let me address a few points in your second question: As regards incidence findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy.[1] This means that cancer is actually a rare cause of lymph node enlargement.  As regards age in primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[1] Meaning that this is an even rarer possibility given your age.  As regards the accuracy of the clinical examination in one study examining the presence of supraclavicular lymph node enlargement in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients - Nodes had to have a diameter of 22.3 mm or greater to be palpated in 50% of cases.[2] CT scans can detect the presence of enlarged lymph nodes in the neck with a short-axis diameter of 5 mm or greater.  The sensitivities of ultrasonography and CT did not differ significantly in detecting the presence of a lymph node enlargement.[2]  I do not think that there is a high possibility of there being cancer in your case; however if you are still worried about the node you can discuss the possibility of getting a CT scan done to confirm the nature of the finding.

Did you gain any insight into what may be the nature of our problem?  Dr. Fouad, thanks so much for your previous reply. If you could answer just one more question for me. First of all, to recap. My symptoms are a some sort of bump either above or below the vein on my right side at the base of my neck. I also have pain (not severe but a lingering stiffness/pain that has been present for about the last 3 weeks) in my neck area as well as some pain in my jaw area. In your previous reply you stated that the enlarged lump alone was probably not cause for alarm. What I am wondering now is if the combination of the lump/pain in my neck (The pain is not concentrated in the same area as the lump) should be cause for alarm. As I said, I have visited my ENT and he felt of the lump and said that he did not think it was a lymph node, but this left me wondering what else a lump like this could be. Thanks in advance for your reply!\n\n",

Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node.

    "content": "Hi majo, The axillary lymph nodes are located in the axillae (arm pits). They drain the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Age does affect the incidence of the various causes mentioned above.  In primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[1]  References: ========= 1.

    "content": "Hello. About a year ago I noticed a pea sized lump in the right side of my neck. It is located in the middle of my neck slightly back from my ear. I went to my GP at the time and he told me it was nothing to be concerned about.  The lump is now about three times the size it was when I first noticed it and is more oval in shape, it also protrudes from my neck when my head is slightly tilted. (It has never caused me any pain).  My family insisted that I returned to my GP for another cheak up, which I did yesterday and my GP is sending me for a blood test.  I am now a little concerned as to what is might be and that I have left it so long after being told that it is nothing. I was also wondering if a blood test will show up everything I would need to know or should I insist on any further Investigations?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Angel24, An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. I apologize, I do not have sufficient information. Many things need to be taken into account such as your age, if that is the only symptom you have and the only lymph node that is enlarged.  As for the blood test it depends on what the nature of that test was. If it was a CBC then any abnormality could point your doctor in the right direction. There are many causes of lymph node enlargement of the neck and to exclude these causes is sometimes mind boggling. If the lymph node is of a significant size (>1 cm) then you will need to get down to the bottom of this. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen lymph nodes-doctor waiting one month",
    "content": "Hello, and thank you in advance for your kind assistance. I am seeking a (second) opinion on wait-and-see for my symptoms.  I am a 52 year old female. My doctor diagnosed swelling on my neck and arm pit (right side) as swollen lymph nodes. He said he can feel a hardness on the one under my arm when he presses deeply. Some more history in a minute, but first my concern. My MD has put me on 800mg ibuprophine 3x daily for 10 days, and does not want to see me for another 15 days after that (25 days total). Is this wise?  He wants to rule out possible residual lymph swelling from bronchitis which I just got over. He said the ibupro should calm it down if that is all it is. If it does not, we need to look elsewhere, possibly a biopsy of a lymph node. Again, I wonder if it is normal to wait this long. Some more history.  I recently started to have bouts of intense, very localized chest pain, beneath my right breast. At first, it felt like my breast was exhibiting an severe cyst-like pain, but I had just finished my mamogram and it was negative. Just to be sure, they did an ultra-sound--also negative. But the pain persists, quite localize but radiating. It feels like it is between my breast and ribs. Stretching or deep breathing often triggers it, but it can start for no reason. It goes away just as suddenly. My husband wondered if I pulled a muscle coughing with the bronchitis, but there is the lymph swelling. BTW,  I was on a heavy duty antibiotic for 10 days during the bronchitis.   I have no weight loss, possibly a slight gain. I am fatigued, but no more than normal. No fever. I had severe night sweats and daytime hot flashes off-and-on for 3 months, but they disappeared almost completely during my bronchitis/antibiotic. The sweats always accompanied vaginal dryness and tenderness, so my GYN attributed the sweats to menopause. When the sweats were in check, so were the vaginal symptoms, so I tend to agree. They sweats are al but gone now, and so is the tenderness.  I know you cannot diagnose me over the internet, and the symptoms could be a variety of things. One possible and fearsome cause could be Hodgkins or similar lymophoma. My cousin died of Hodgkins There is no sense in worring about the unknow at this point. However,  is it wise to wait 25 days to find out? Is the ibupro experimentation reasonable? Also, please feel free to comment on my symptoms, if you have any wisdom to share. You opinion on waiting will be much appreciated.  The doctor I refer to is not my family MD, but is a general surgeon that he referred me to for an opinion on the swollen Lymph nodes.   Concerned but not worried...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2].  Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.   Given that you do not have any risks for malignancy or any other serious condition, your doctor's decision to treat the most likely condition (infection) with anti-inflammatory drugs and antibiotics for three weeks is standard.  There are reasons for that. Findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy, the rest being attributable mostly to infection.[4]  Should any new symptoms arise, such as new lymph nodes or constitutional symptoms such as fever or rash, you should contact him/her immediately.

It is very painfull to the touch, and seems to move a little under my skin. I have a general feeling of being unwell, and seem to be having excesive cold sweats. I feel vaguely light headed. The lump feels quite hard and \"full\".  I suffer from quite bad dandruff and some other minor skin conditions. I also have a history of dental abcess'es on the left cheek.

    "content": "Hi Khay, The suboccipital lymph node is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. It drains the scalp and head. Common causes of enlargement include local infection which may also include dandruff.  When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of tenderness does not reliably differentiate benign from malignant nodes.[1]  However, constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could also suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. If you have not had an evaluation by your physician I would suggest you have this completed to identify the causative factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: ========= 1.

The next day it was really swollen so I left it alone and it went back to pea size. Within the last couple of months I've noticed it got larger, maybe doubled in size. It doesn't hurt and I don't have any other lumps in areas where there are lymphnodes. A friend of mine whose girlfriend had Lymphoma freaked out when I told him and said I needed to go to the ER ASAP. He said when his girlfriend saw a doc, he said a lump on the neck is never a good thing especially when it doesn't hurt. I plan on getting it checked out, but don't think the ER is the answer. I don't believe in going unless something is broken or bleeding profusely. Any thoughts...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  When I was 9, I had a infection which caused a lymph node to swell up in the side of my neck.  I was told it might not go away, which it didn't. This February, I noticed that I had another one swollen in the same side, no infection. In June, I found a swollen node under my armpit, and went to the doctor about it.  (Again, same side-left) He said that he wasn't concerned about the ones in my neck, but the one in my armpit was abnormal.  He asked if I had night sweats, etc, and that when he sees lymphoma, the nodes are usually about twice the size of mine in my neck.  He Sent me for blood tests, (CBC and another one) and said if the one under my armpit wasn't gone in a month, to go back and have a biopsy. Well, the blood work came back normal, and the one in my armpit decreased in size, and frankly, I forgot about it for a few weeks. I noticed it was still there, moveable and painless.  I am planning to go back to the doctor.  My question is, because of the normal blood tests, and the fact I already have several swollen, one for over 10 years, what are the chances this IS cancer?  Is it true that in some people the lymph nodes just stay swollen?  I feel great otherwise, not tired or anything like that.  How commom is it that they stay swollen forever?  They're all about the size of a kidney bean.  Thanks so much for any help!!  Ranna\n\n",

    "content": "About two weeks ago, I started to feel tired.  It started with a respiratory thing - my head was congested and I got a cough.  Then, about eight days ago my lymph nodes on the left side of my neck ballooned.  I became very fatigued.  I went to the doctor and she agreed that my lymph nodes were huge.  She perscribed me Augmentin, seven days, which I just finished yesterday.  My lymph nodes are still very large and painful, but only on the left side.  I have had no energy at all.    I went to my chiropractor, who became concerned about my gall bladder.  She gave me digestive enzymes to take.  I'm still not sure how she came up with this diagnosis, but then again, I am having pain on my right side midway between my abdomen and ribcage.  I have had fevers, usually in the evenings that only got up to about 101.8, but usually go away on their own.  I've told my doctor all of these things.  I will feel okay for an afternoon or so, and then I will feel bad again in the evening.  The doctor did a CBC and mono test.  CBC was within normal ranges and mono was negative.  So, what's wrong with me?  Doesn't a CBC test for infection and viruses?  If it's neither of those, what could it be?  She told me to wait a few days but I'm worried.....should I be demanding futher tests?  Should I be concerned about the size of my lymph nodes?  I should say that I have lymph nodes swell up frequently - I always thought it was allergies.  But this time they're huge and won't go away.  And I can't seem to get any energy.  Help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I was diagnosed with Mononucleosis/EBV last July (of 2004).  I had a really bad case of it as I am still recovering and can not function as before.  Although I am not as tired now, the fatigue lasted a good 7-8 months before I could function somewhat normally.  During this time I have had chronic swollen groin lymph nodes.  Some days it is more swollen then other days but the lumps never go away.   Also, I have had a chronic sore throat for the last year, and recently had my tonsils removed which were very cryptic with actinomyces.  The report reads \"marked chronic follicular lymphoid hyperplasia.\"  Although it has only been a few weeks, I feel so much better.  I am less fatigued and my throat does not hurt, at least where it used to.  I don't know if there is any relationship between tonsils and prolonged Mono.  I am, however,  very concerned that my groin nodes are still swollen bc I have read that there are some studies showing links with hodgkins/non-hodgkins lymphoma and Mono.  All of my lab work is normal (CBC/diff, LFT's).  Are the symptoms normal considering my history?  Any input would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tinkerbell9999, The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, i.e. laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  There are many causes of generalized lymphadenopathy of which the mononucleosis type syndromes are the most common. They usually present with fatigue, malaise, fever and atypical lymphocytosis on examination of the blood picture. Splenomegaly may be present in 50% of patients due to Epstein-Barr virus infection. These cases can be diagnosed using the monospot test, IgM EA or VCA. So in answer to your question, the previous infection with \"mono\" may very well be resposible for lymph node enlargement in the inguinal region. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Lymph nodes that continue to enlarge despite treatment with a course of antibiotics warrants re-evaluation, etc. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "sore lymph node related to surgery?",
    "content": "I have what I think is a sore lymph node on the left side of my neck for about a week, about the middle right next to my esophagus.  It isn't excruciatingly painful, but enough to be annoying.  It bothers me more when I turn my head to the right.   It doesn't really seem to be swollen too much but it does feel hard.    I guess I'm a little paranoid considering my husband's brother in law was just diagnosed with cancer that's spread to his lymph nodes and he's relatively young and I just want to find out if it's likely or not likely cancer.  I read that cancerous nodes usually aren't painful, so that makes me feel a bit more comfortable.  However, I can't come up with a possible cause for why it would be swollen.  I feel fine, no sore throat and I don't have any signs of an infection, cold, or flu.  The only thing I can think of is that I had my gallbladder removed due to gallstones on August 31st, almost a month ago.  Could that be related in some way?  The surgery and recovery went fine with no complications at all.     This is really worrying me due to recent events in my husband's family and I just would like to set my mind at ease a bit and find out if it's something I really need to go running to my doctor about.   It's also kind of baffling me because I don't seem to have a sign of any infection that usually causes swollen and/or sore lymph nodes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pj523, One of the common reasons for lymph node enlargement is bacterial/viral infections (even seemingly unapparent one's) because the lymphatic system is the bodies defense for fighting infections. This essentially means the body is functioning properly. Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.  Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a lymph node enalrgement, followed by ultrasonography and CT scan. PET scans have been reported in some studies to yield better results than CT scan but they are very expensive and not always available. Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.

Although it's not an impossibility for this enlargement to be connected to your surgery but in my opinion I would most likely relate it to another cause. Have an evaluation by your physician to identify if there is reason for concern. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I have had a low grade fever and the other morning I woke up and had a very swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck. I went to see the doctor who put me on antibiotics (clindamycin) even though my WBC count was normal and told me to expect the lymph node to go down in 2 to 3 days. I am Type One diabetic and have Graves disease. I am concerned because the lymph node is swollen only on the left side, I have no evidence there is an infection, the node is not painful, I cannot move it, and it feels rubbery. I have no sore throat but have been feeling very fatigued for the past few days and have a decreased appetite. Should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Nicfrillo, Have you had a re-evaluation regarding the lymph node enlargement since your treatment with the course of antibiotics was completed? Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin, as found in the cervical nodes of children with viral illnesses. A group of nodes that feels connected and seems to move as a unit is said to be \"matted.\" Nodes that are matted can be either benign (e.g., tuberculosis, sarcoidosis or lymphogranuloma venereum) or malignant (e.g., metastatic carcinoma or lymphomas). The presence of fever is commonly associated with infections. However, constitutional symptoms such as fever, weight loss, fatigue or night sweats could also suggest disorders such as tuberculosis, lymphoma, collagen vascular diseases, unrecognized infection or malignancy. Keep in mind that lymph nodes that become enlarged due to bacterial/viral infection may not return to their pre-infectious size after the infection subsides. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If you have had no improvement of symptoms or they have continued to worsen over a period of time I would suggest that you notify your physician for an evaluation. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy.[1]  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [2,3].  Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [4] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings.   Surgical dissection of the neck for a biopsy is not recommended even when the likelihood of cancer is high. The reason being it distorts the plains and may have bad effects on further management if it turns out that it is a result of cancer.  As you can see from the above information that the likelihood of cancer is not so high. If still concerned, however, and since your question relates more to the 'character of the lymph nodes', I would suggest that you seek a second clinical examination by another doctor. If they both find that the clinical features of your lymph nodes not alarming then you forget about the whole thing.   References: ========= 1. Fijten GH, Blijham GH.

    "content": "I don't really feel sick...no night sweats, fever, or fatigue, but at this point, have become frustrated with  the doctors available to me.  So, y'all are my last line of defense.  In mid-April/early May, I noticed I have a fair-sized mass on my (left) rib cage that is about 2.5-3 cm in length/1cm wide.  It started out tender but is now only very intermittently sore. It's also pretty moveable. Went to about 3 different doctors, & my bloodwork came back fine: normal white & red cell counts.  Got a chest x-ray: that came back clear, too.  Although it was still sore, they convinced me to ignore it as a lipoma.    Through August & September, things seemed to be on the road to getting better...the soreness went away although the lump stayed.  It's not grown noticeably, but hasn't gotten smaller, either. However...  Last night I found a supraclavicular lymphnode.  It's only pea-sized, and is also very mobile... but the location makes me worry.   That side of my neck & shoulder have been sore, but I really thought it was from a rather nasty flare-up of TMJD.  The node itself isn't particularly tender. I guess you could call it rubbery-feeling...not stone hard, not squishy/soft, but like, for lack of a better description, a small, dry pea.    So, should I go to the doctors again? The chest thing took about 4 visits before they'd do an x-ray.  When that came back clear, they basically dismissed me as depressive ('cause I was still worried about the lump), and shooed me out the door with some Wellbutrin.  With the new bump, should I go back again & have them look for something more serious?  Thanks so much for your advice!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi squidahoy, Lipomas are benign fatty tumors in the subcutaneous area of the skin. These commonly are present for an extended period of time before a person actually realizes they are there. Some may grow quite large and can occur anywhere on the body. Most lipomas don't cause any symptoms but occasionally when they become large enough to interfere with adjacent muscles or encompass small blood vessels they may become tender/painful. When this occurs they can be surgically removed. Lymph node enlargement: Following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection.

Although enlargement of lymph nodes in the supraclavicular area can be somewhat disconcerting, lymph nodes less than 1 cm in size are often typically of benign causes. I would suggest that if you remain concerned about the \"lipoma\" as well as the appearance of the supraclavicular lymph node request a referral to a surgeon for evaluation.

    "content": "My husband has been ill for almost a year now. Last November he went to the emergency room complaining of right-side pain. In the months that followed, they ruled out appendicities, crohn's disease, colon cancer (and a variety of other abdominal diseases as he had CT scans, small bowel followthroughs, and colonoscopy). They did, however, see some gall bladder enlargement and removed it in March. The symptoms, which include right-side pain (located between groin and lower rib), swollen glands only on the right side (both groin and throat and jaw), numbness in right hand and leg, right leg paralysis, extreme fatigue, and night sweats have continued and indeed appear to be getting worse by the day. He also had a series electrical tests to check nerve problems -- this too was fine. His blood work has all looked good. The last time he went to his doctor, he became concerned about the fact that the lymph glands were so big (and so big for such a long time) and raised the spectre of lymphoma. Instead of referring him to an oncologist, he is sending him to an infectious disease specialist. My questions are: 1) what would be the rationale for sending him to an infectious disease specialist, instead of an oncologist?  2) what might they be looking for? 3) does this set of symptoms seem stereotypical of anything, including lymphoma?  4) is the negative bloodwork rule out the possibility of a lymphoma diagnosis?   Any help or advice would be so wonderful. He's been bounced from doctor to doctor and they are just \"baffled\" but unfortunately this confusion has not seemed to create a desire to pursue his case and instead they each in turn just throw up their hands and tell him to go away. He's getting worse and worse and as the months go on, I worry more and more about the diagnosis they are unable to make.  thank you, eah [/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This has been the longest 3 months in my life.  What started as a simple chest x-ray to check for an enlarged heart (I have high BP) the radiologist spotted a few small nodules.  I was then told to have a CT scan.  The results of that were the nodules were too small to be tested.  Now the DR has something new to tell me.  I have slightly enlarged lymph nodes in my lungs.  Prior to the first x-ray I suffered the most severe bout of bronchittus I had ever had in my life.  The doctors did not think that my lymph nodes would be enlarged  by it.  It was about 6 months ago that I had that infection.  Now that was said,  the DR referres me to a pulmonologist.  The pulmonologist suggested i have another CT scan to see if any change in the size of the lymph nodes had changed.  Fortunatelly no they had not changed in 3 months.  So, the concern is still there so I asked the DR what my next step would be.  He said we should monitor them for the next 2 years.  I said no, I want to know more now.  A PET scan was done.  The results of the scan showed some metabolic activity in the nodes.  Now a biopsy is needed.  My question is could some kind of infection for example - - - I have molars in my mouth that have absessed and decayed below my gums.  Could this affect the nodes in my lungs?  Should I pursue a biopsy or should I get a second opinion.  Thanks for any help you can give.  Sitting on Pins and Needles,  Todd Eitenmiller\n\n",

Common causes of enlargement include mononucleosis syndromes, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxoplasmosis, dental pathology such as periodontitis. In my opinion this would be the location of enlarged lymph nodes if this was related to your dental health. I hope that you have pursued the biopsy of the \"lung nodules.\" Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  I'm very worried and was hoping to find some help here.  I am a 23 year old female and I am having health issues I have never had. For six weeks, I've had a red itchy rash resembling a cross between heat rash and hives over all of my trunk and back, and it's progressively moved to my legs, hands , arms, neck and face.  It's terribly itchy and has not responded to any OTC meds or creams.  My new doctor gave me a shot of cortizone and a course of prednizone, along with Allegra, and the rash still didn't respond.  I returned, and he gave me another shot of cortizone and another course of prednizone.  Still no response, in fact, it's spreading now.    In the past three weeks, I have started to have other issues.  Fatigue, irregular menses (which I realize could be from the steriods,) fever off and on, night sweats that I wake from terribly itchy, and swollen, painful axillary lymph nodes on my left side.  Slight swelling on my left side and occasional (this is strange) goosebumps on my left quad only. (I  have hx of problems with my L breast, I am screened for CX every six months with a mammogram and ultrasound because 1.5 years ago it was discovered that I had some irregular masses that require to be followed closely.) Could the strong steriods have lowered my immune system to the point that I triggered this?  Tonight, when I Google'd my symptoms together (swollen armpit lymph node itchy rash fatigue fever) there were pages and pages of HL and NHL sites.  I had not even considered the possibility of CX before.   Please help my alleviate my fears... Regards, jmg\n\n",

Following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. Infected Lymph nodes however, tend to be:  Firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  Axillary lymph nodes located in the axillae (arm pits). It drains the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma. Have you had any unintentional weight loss as well? Taking into consideration that you have symptoms of fever, night sweats, fatigue, unexplained rash, I would strongly urge you to contact your physician for an evaluation and have labwork to rule out specific illnesses as well as diagnostic studies to evaluate the axillary lymph node enlargement.

    "title": "Swollen supraclavicular lymph node: please help?",
    "content": "Hi,  I've had a swollen supraclavicular lymph node for approximately 2.5 weeks.  It is firm (a little rubbery) but also pretty mobile, most of the time. It seems to be a little firmer & less mobile in the mornings, and seems to become a little less swollen/more mobile during the day before swelling up again at night.     When one says a lymph node/ bump is moveable, how much is it supposed to move?  Mine will wiggle & move around a perceptible bit, but always stays anchored to what I assume is the rest of the lymphatic duct at the top.   I haven't had any other negative symptoms-- no fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, itchiness, or appetite changes. My neck (to my shoulder) was pretty sore when I discovered that my lymph node was swollen, & the site will still become tender on occasion  although the node itself isn't really tender.   What concerns me is that it hasn't gone away yet.  I've also  had 2 moveable lumps on my rib cage since April. The rib lumps started in much the same way as the neck lymph node--generalized pain and tenderness in the area that eventually (after 2 or 3 months) reduced to only the bumps, and now (after > 6 months) only comes back  after doing something strenuous. (Still have the lumps all the time, though).   Have gone to the doctors' (like 5 times) and, after a significant amount of persuasion on my part, convinced them to do a chest x-ray, since my mother died of lung cancer and I've taken the \"don't wait around with lumps\" approach.  The chest x-ray was done in May and came back clear. Also, had a white cell/red cell count about 5 months ago that came back completely normal.    Is there something that might not have shown up on the blood work or x-ray that might be causing these problems? Of course, my first concern is some type of cancer. But, could toxoplasmosis (cat scratch fever) or another infection stay in my system for more than 6 months without ever causing a fever greater than 100 degrees?  I am so confused...  I'm asking here because I don't believe I'd be welcomed back at my doctor's office...last time I went in (for the rib lumps, after the x-ray came back clear, but when they were still very painful), the doctor told me that she had had >8 years of medical training, had never seen anything like this, no, cancer doesn't just appear on one's rib cage, and that my problems must be because I was still depressed from my mother's death 2 years ago [a load of hooey: my mother was sick for 5 years before she passed away, I had plenty of time to make my peace, and wouldn't have been depressed if I hadn't been in physical pain for 4 months straight].    So, any advice would be appreciated,  so I can go in armed with the proper vocabulary and the  tests I should ask for.  Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi squidahoy, Has your doctor confirmed the presence of a supraclavicular lymph node enlargement? I understand that your primary concern is that its cancer, so lets assume that it is a lymph node and discuss the possibilities. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. Little information exists to suggest that a specific diagnosis can be based on node size. However, in one series [3] of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2. In children, lymph nodes larger than 2 cm in diameter (along with an abnormal chest radiograph and the absence of ear, nose and throat symptoms) were predictive of granulomatous diseases (i.e., tuberculosis, cat-scratch disease or sarcoidosis) or cancer (predominantly lymphomas) [4]. These studies were performed in referral centers, and conclusions may not apply in primary care settings. Also please note that an increase in size on serial examination is very significant.  Regarding age: In primary care settings, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40.[5]  Regarding consistency: Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. The term \"shotty\" refers to small nodes that feel like buckshot under the skin. What happens is that following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Regarding location, the right supraclavicular node drains the mediastinum, lungs, esophagus and can harbor infection or cancer from the lung, retroperitoneal or gastrointestinal tract. The left supraclavicular node drains the thorax, abdomen via thoracic duct and can enlarge as a result of lymphoma, thoracic or retroperitoneal cancer, bacterial or fungal infection. It could be due to many other causes if it is not the only lymph node that is enlarged.  Regarding mobility, an enlarged lymph node that is mobile has a rather limited degree of mobility and usually recoils to its original position when tugged at by rolling the fingers over it.  I must insist that in your case you should confirm your case by referring to your doctor. There is no such thing as not being welcome by your doctor. This is especially the case if your lymph node is of significant size or increasing in size.  References: =========== 1. Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58.  2.

    "content": "Hello, I am not sure where exactly you mean. One of the clinical features that help identifying a lymph node is its location. There is the suboccipital lymp node which is located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. There is also the posterior cervical chain of lymph nodes which is located on the side of the neck near to the back. There is also the postauricular lymph node which is located behind the ears. I suggest that you get it examined if you haven't done so already. By clinical examination it should be relatively easy to identify whether it is a lymph node or a muscle spasm. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Every month - new lymph node swelling",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 25 year old male who has been frustrated with lymph node swellings.  Every month I seem to get new and more swellings.  In June of this year, I noticed my 1st lymph node swelling  on the left side of my neck with a cold/flu that I experienced.  The cold went away after a few days, but the lymph node still stayed.  A few days later another swelling on the same side one came up.  I decided to wait it out until my neck started aching, and I felt an intense ache on the back of my head on the left side.  I went to a doctor in late July.  He tested for mono and it came out negative multiple times.  The CBC report didn't indicate anything.  He took chest xrays and they were negative for TB.  We finally decided to do a biopsy of the deep cervical lymph node- the biopsy came back saying no evidence of lymphoma or malignancy...that was great news.  But since July, I have gotten new lymph node swellings, and the old ones have not gone away.  Every month since then to be exact new ones appear.  Just recently the right side of my neck and under my jaw have all swollen lymph nodes.  At first I felt fine, but now I'm feeling like I have low grade fevers.  My neck and the back of my neck is still aching, and I feel crappy everyday.  I was tested again for mono, EBV, AIDs...you name it they gave it to me but it all came back negative or normal.  I don't understand what is going on?? I live a healthy lifestyle, but I haven't been diagnosed.  Can someone give me some insight...at this rate, all my lymph nodes will be swelling up sooner or later.  I can only think of lymphoma again....I have a total of 11 swollen lymph nodes, the doctors (4) don't know whats going on.  Please help  Thanks, Sean\n\n",

    "content": "Hello asap1, Your case is indeed very perplexing. At this stage I do not know if I can give you any advice by going through an extensive list of symptoms to be on the look out for. There are many causes for generalized lymph node enlargement. All we can do for now is to wait and observe if what is causing your lymphadenopathy will manifest itself with another symptom. Chronic symptoms to be on the look out for are: Fatigue, malaise, fever, abdominal pain (especially on the left side), \"flu-like\" illness, rash,  nausea, vomiting, jaundice, arthritis, renal, neurologic, hematologic disorders, bruising, conjunctivitis, excessive sweat, dyspnea and cough. It should be emphasized that these symptoms are a cause for concern if they are excessive in intensity or duration. Any of these symptoms can cause the doctor to suspect a specific disease entity.  More usefully I would like to go through a list of environmental and pharmacological causes for lymph node enlargement. Environmental risks include: tick bites, tuberculosis, recent blood transfusion or transplant, high-risk sexual behavior, intravenous drug use.  Occupational risks: Hunters, trappers, fishermen, fishmongers, slaughterhouse workers have a higher risk for certain diseases that cause lymph node enlargement.  Travel related risks: Recent travel to any of the following geographical areas; Arizona, southern California, New Mexico, western Texas, Southwestern United States, Southeastern or central United States, Southeast Asia, India, northern Australia, Central or west Africa, Central or South America, East Africa, Mediterranean, China, Latin America, Mexico, Peru, Chile, India, Pakistan, Egypt, Indonesia. Some medications are known to specifically cause lymphadenopathy (e.g., phenytoin [Dilantin]), while others, such as cephalosporins, penicillins or sulfonamides, are more likely to cause a serum sickness-like syndrome with fever, arthralgias and rash in addition to lymphadenopathy.  A more extensive list of medications causing lymph node enlargement includes:   Allopurinol (Zyloprim)  Atenolol (Tenormin)  Captopril (Capozide)  Carbamazepine (Tegretol)  Cephalosporins  Gold  Hydralazine (Apresoline)  Penicillin  Phenytoin (Dilantin)  Primidone (Mysoline)  Pyrimethamine (Daraprim)  Quinidine  Sulfonamides  Sulindac (Clinoril)    Well I hope this list is useful, if any of the above relates to you then we could have a starting point. Let me know how things go.  Best regards,\n\n",

It can thus be enlarged due to infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx. These are the most common causes, cancer being much less common. From your description it appears that none of your lymph nodes are larger than 1cm in size. If they do not enlarge in size and no new lymph nodes appear and you do not develop symptoms such as hoarseness of vioce unexplained lymph node enlargement in cases that are not suspected of being at high risk of developing cancer are observed for 3 to 4 weeks.  Given the limitations of the internet, I am unable to rule out anything. I can only give you a very general impression which may infact be misleading. Under these circumstances I urge to seek medical attention as soon as possible.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sammy1, Thank you for your kind words. Manual irritation is not one of the causes of lymph node enlargement. As for your second question: One of the criteria used to diagnose a lymph node enlargement is if a swelling occurs in a lymph node region. This is then easily confirmed by palpation.  Sometimes the situation is not so easy especially when it is present in a region where it can be confused with other structures (e.g. the supraclavicular lymph node - above the collar bone).  In your case there are very few structures in that region to confuse it with, so its more than likely that these are lymph nodes. Again, confirmation by clinical examination is warranted. Best regards,\n\n",

Yesterday, she came home in the evening with an enlarged node on the back of her neck It appears that it is on the muscle that runs down the back of her neck from her head to her back.  She is complaining that it is painful to the touch and also that it is painful to move her head.  My wife took her to the doctor today, and they said that it is possibly an infection, but she has no fever.  The doctor did strees that a follow up appointment is needed in the next couple of weeks.  My wife and the rest of the family are extremely worried about this condition.  What if anything can you tell me that will help us to get by.  Is there something that we should look for, or somthing that we can do in the mean time that may give us some answers?  Her grandfather died a few years ago of cancer, my Mother in law was recently treated for breast cancer, my father in law has had two bouts with Prostate cancer, and my wife suffers fro systemic lupus.  Can you point us in a good direction? :?:\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sslccop, I am glad you took your daughter to the doctor's. The lymph node that is present in that region is known as the suboccipital lymph node. It drains the scalp and head and is in almost all cases enlarged due to a local infection. Local infection do not usually result in fever.  I would say you do not need to worry, I am pretty sure it will turn out fine. In fact it should start to resolve right away. Given the limitations of the internet as a diagnostic tool, I cannot stress enough the need to follow up the condition with your doctor. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I have a lump in my neck. It is smooth and longish, runs longitude down my neck.  It is on my left side and is back from the tyroid and forward from my ear.  It has been there for quite some time.  It is not usually sore although I do sometimes get some aching.  My left jaw aches a lot. I have been to the dentist and my teeth are fine.  Could the aching jaw and lump be related.  What are the possible causes of a neck lump, could it just be a lump of fatty tissues?  I am not overweight. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello kiwibird2, I cannot stress enough how important it is for you to get a medical examination by a qualified physician. There are many causes of lumps in the neck. One of those lumps happen to be lymph node lumps. These lymph nodes can be enlarged due to benign causes or due to cancer. Of course cancer will always be the most serious possibility to rule out. Again, swellings that are due to cancer have certain features that can easily be determined by an examination.  The fact that it has stayed the same size for so long is in your favor but does not rule out a cancer. Best regards,\n\n",

He is unsure what the lump is, although close to my tyroid he does not think it is my thyroid, it is a little too far back and  it is not a cyst.  He does not think it is anything sinister but has ordered an ultrsound scan of the area for next week. It is not sore to touch but I do get aching around that area.  I had original thought it was my teeth and that is why I went to my dentist. My GP did comment that the glands behind my ears are up a bit too.\n\n",

Distribution of nodes, grey scale and power Doppler sonographic features are useful to identify the cause of cervical lymphadenopathy. Useful grey scale features include size, shape, status of echogenic hilus, echogenicity, micronodular appearance, intranodal necrosis and calcification. Adjacent soft tissue edema and matting are particularly useful to identify tuberculosis. Useful power Doppler features include vascular pattern and displacement of vascularity. Ultrasonography can be combined with fine needle aspiration cytology in which a sample of cells from the lymph node is aspirated using a needle and examined under the microscope.  In the case of neck lymph nodes, ultrasound is a useful imaging modality in evaluation of cervical lymphadenopathy because of its high sensitivity (98%) and specificity (95%) when combined with fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC).[1]  I think you can safely put it all behind you now.

Isn't a different type of Ultrasound used for viewing veins or would a regular ultrasounds pick up a vascular problem.   When I had my varicose veins done on my legs I seem to recall the specialist using a different type of machine that checks the flow of th vein. The reason I mention this is  I do have a family history of strokes and heart disease and this lump is right on the main artery in my neck. Maybe I am just being a worry wart!! :-)\n\n",

It is rarely a pleasant experience, even under the best of conditions.  Patients typically bring to mind many more questions after they leave the office.  The Internet, while being a great resource for information can, more often than not, cause angst.  We need you doctors and nurses to sort though the avalance of information and misinformation with which we are flooded from the internet.

Are they do to the Acne also? Is it something I should be worried about and should go back to my doctor? I should also specify that the nodes do not ''stcik'' out of my neck so are invisible to anyone. Only I know are there cause I can feel them and have found them by coincidence.

I started typing all of this stuff into google and it looks like Lymphoma. The problem is that I have no Health insurance..and won't for at least 6 more months.  What if it is this?? What happens if it's left untreated for a long time?   Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello *Momof3*, Let me start off by reminding you that there is no way that I can exclude lymphoma or malignancy over the internet. If you have an enlarged lymph node you are urged to get examined by a qualified physician. There is no replacement for that, unfortunately.  You should know that not all lymph node enlargements are due to lymphoma or cancer. A very small proportion actually. The body has approximately 600 lymph nodes, but only those in the submandibular, axillary or inguinal regions may normally be palpable in healthy people.[1] Findings from a Dutch study revealed that only 10 percent of patients with unexplained adenopathy required referral to a subspecialist, 3 percent required a biopsy and only 1 percent had a malignancy.[2] Lymph nodes can enlarge due to infections more commonly than due to malignancy. In some cases, following infection, lymph nodes may remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. To answer your question: Any cancer if left untreated will progress in size and stage and may spread to new areas. That's why an increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. In your case this is quite the opposite as one of your lymph nodes appears to be decreasing in size.  1.

Distribution of nodes, grey scale and power Doppler sonographic features are useful to identify the cause of cervical lymphadenopathy.

Ultrasonography can be combined with fine needle aspiration cytology in which a sample of cells from the lymph node is aspirated using a needle and examined under the microscope.  In short, hopefully the ultrasound will indicate what the cause of this lymph node enlargement is. The doctor does this when he wants to rule out serious disease such as lymphoma, cancer or TB based on his clinical evaluation.  Hardness of a lymph node that is greater than 1cm always warrants further investigations.  Hopefully, it will all turn out fine. Please let us know how everything goes for your son.\n\n",

    "title": "Left Supraclavicular Mass/Edema",
    "content": "I was wondering if anyone out there could help me out.  About two months ago felt a mass above my left clavicle.  I went to the doctor, he ordered a full spectrum of labs and a CT with and w/o contrast.  The labs all came back normal, and the ct was normal as well.  My dr told me that if the mass persisted to contact him for a follow up that would probably accompany a referral to a surgeon for a biopsy.  Ive had no abnormal symptoms, and am a little worried about the probable biopsy/diagnosis.  Could it still be something pathological even though the CT was fine?  Could what Im feeling just be a normal anatomical structur/muscle?  Am I automatically doomed because of the masses location?  Please help!   -Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello premed3341, Thank you for using The Doctors Lounge.  As you already know an enlarged supraclavicular lymph node is always an indication that your doctor must exclude malignancy by all possible means. So I will focus my discussion mainly on excluding cancer.  I am assuming your Dr. has already determined by examination that this indeed a lymph node enlargement, or is he still confused about its nature. Did your CT involve the supraclavicular area as well or was it only performed on the head and neck? This would confirm the presence of a lymph node and may indicate if it is abnormal or not. More easily, an ultrasound scan would also be able to detect a supraclavicular lymph gland enlargement. It may show cortical necrosis which is an indication fo possible malignancy.  Once the presence of a lymph node enlargement is established then many things are taken into consideration: your age (incidence of cancer increases with age especially above 40 years), history of malignant disease, the size of the lymph node (>1cm) and the presence or absence of constitutional symptoms among other things.  Given the presence of risk factors, your doctor may consider observation for a period of time and then decide on further investigation. This may include a fine needle aspiration which usually does not yield significant information. On the other hand a biopsy may be warranted in persistant cases.  Please do not consider yourself doomed. If your doctor was sure you had cancer he would not have waited to give you therapy. Trust in your doctor's judgement as he appears to care about you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello premed3341, Obviously I am in no position to challenge your doctor's opinion as he has the advantage of being able to examine you. If I was examining a patient and could feel a supraclavicular mass I would be worried even if the CT scan turned out negative. However, let me give you a few thoughts.  Palpation of lymph nodes is known to be much less sensitive in detecting lymph node enlargement. Both the sensitivity and specificity are in the range of 60-70%, depending on the tumor studied. This means that there is a rather high possibility of false negative and false positive results (as in your case). A false positive result means that the doctor feels an enlarged lymph node when in reality there is none. Nodes had to have a diameter of 22.3 mm or greater to be palpated in 50% of cases in one study (van Overhagen et al, 2004).  In that study, the sensitivity of ultrasonography was triple that of palpation for the detection of metastases in supraclavicular lymph nodes and CT scans were found to be as sensitive as ultrasonography. Ultrasonography can be combined with fine needle aspiration cytology which gives more conclusive results. PET scans have been reported to be more sensitive than CT scans in the detection of malignant disease in lymph nodes. However, PET scans are expensive and not always available.  Let me also add that in another study, patients 40 years of age and older with unexplained lymphadenopathy have about a 4 percent risk of cancer versus a 0.4 percent risk in patients younger than age 40 (Fijten et al, 1988).  Given the high probability of false positives by palpation and the results of your CT scan and your age, the surgeon may opt to perform any of the other methods of diagnosis above. If he decides that a biopsy is warranted he will dissect a very small opening in the skin remove any masses he can see and analyze them.  I have given you a list of different modalities which are used to diagnose lymph node enlargement which you can discuss with your doctor. Keep us updated.

    "content": "Hello premed3341, Unfortunately, there are no blood tests that are specific to a particular cancer. Even tumor markers have a low sensitivity and specificity when it comes to diagnosing cancer (except in prostate cancer and choriocarcinoma). There are basically two ways a doctor will reach the conclusion that what he felt was not an enlarged lymph node due to a malignancy. If on follow up the swelling does not increase steadily with time and all your scans remain negative or by requesting a biopsy that turns out negative for malignancy. A biopsy of course is the gold standard by which all the other tests are measured. Which course the doctor will choose will depend on how risky he considers the situation (based on clinical examination). Let's wait and see what the PCP has to say, I have a feeling it will all turn out fine. Best regards,\n\n",

Dr. said it wasn't a hernia (the swelling went down after about a week with ice), but a sonogram showed swollen lymph nodes in that one area, and later an increase in lymph nodes (or whatever there can be an increase in). The lymph glands are not tender, nor are they obviously  swollen.  Dr. did thorough blood tests and found nothing. My boyfriend was put on antibiotics to get rid of any possible infection -- Didn't work. They are now scheduling an MRI. Boyfriend won't ASK QUESTIONS of the doctor. What could they be looking for? A tumor? Could this possibly be related to Lyme Disease or another tick-borne illness? What could we be looking at here? It's December, and they've been testing since July!  I'm getting very worried.  Thank you.\n\n",

This means that any infection, inflammation or cancer when present in any of the above areas will drain to the inguinal lymph nodes and cause them to enlarge.  Hence his doctors would want to rule out: infections of the leg or foot, STDs, lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague. The list is extensive and an MRI will help rule out a pelvic infection (abcess) or malignancy among other things. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female. I have been diagnosed with OCD and GAD. I am a Hypochondriac! People laugh when I tell them this but it causes me great pain and suffering. I take every little sensation and lump and turn it into some fatal disease. Anyway I am currently convinced that I have Lymphoma, this is why.  This past October I cought a bad cold/flu I am not sure what I had, I cought it off of my 5 year old step daughter. I had horrible head congestion, my ears were all plugged up, I had a slight fever and chills through out the cold. The cold ended up in my chest and I developed a horrible cough, it was productive in the begining and eventualy ended up in a hacking type cough. I also had shortness of breath. A week or so into the cold I decided to check my lymph nodes in my thorat to see if they were swollen and sore. They were not sore but I did find a pea size swelling that was squishy and movable on the right side of my throat just under my saliva gland. I poked at it and made my entire throat sore and swollen. On the 3 of November I had a bad outer ear infection (left ear). I went to the ER because the pain was so bad. I told the doctor I felt I had Lymphoma and she told me she didn't feel that was the cause. She felt the lymph nodes and agreed that they were swollen but she was not concerned.  I left the ER with some ear drops but I still think that I may have lymphoma. I have been sluggish, I lost 5 pounds in less then two weeks. My hair has been falling out for over a year now and I get these hot facial flushes. Im still coughing slightly and feel short of breath. I stopped poking my neck for three weeks and then decided to see if the swelling was still there, it was and I became all panicked again. I left it for another week or so and then re checked a few days ago and it seems swollen like it did before. Its only tender if I bother it, then my throat will hurt for three days after. Some one then informed me that you have lymph nodes in your groin area so I decided to check and see, after messing with those I was sore for 8 days. I also think my spleen is swollen do to a come and go ache that I have had for two years now.  I had made a doctors appointment for today and do to poor weather my ride cant come and get me. I really wanted to get all this sorted out because I have been having panic attacks over this fear. I can't stand this constant worry all the time.  I have self diagnosed myself with having Lymphoma and Im stuck. I am not looking for a diagnosis just some help\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ChloeAnne, Thank you for using The Doctors Lounge.  Lymph node enlargements in the area of the throat drain the lymphatics of the head and neck any infection (cold/flu) can lead to lymph gland enlargement in that area and this would be considered normal.  In such cases, a patient is put under observation for 3 to 4 weeks. If the lymph node does not subside by then or there is an increase in size during that period, further investigation may be required.  A lymph node in the neck that is less than 1 cm in size is considered by most authorities to be normal.  In one series (Pangalis et al) of 213 adults with unexplained lymphadenopathy, no patient with a lymph node smaller than 1 cm2 (1 cm 3 1 cm) had cancer, while cancer was present in 8 percent of those with nodes from 1 cm2 to 2.25 cm2 (1 cm 3 1 cm to 1.5 cm 3 1.5 cm) in size, and in 38 percent of those with nodes larger than 2.25 cm2 (1.5 cm 3 1.5 cm).

Nodes less than 1 cm in are considered normal. A constant increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease do not wax and wane, rather, they progress steadily in size when they do not receive treatment. Your description does not seem to be too alarming. Please check with your doctor and my impression is it will probably turn out to be nothing at all. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Enlarged Supraclavicular Lymph Node",
    "content": "I have had a painless enlarged cluster of lymph nodes above my left collarbone for 3 or 4 months now.  When I first found them, I could only feel two.  They were mobile, but matted.  Now, they are a bit larger, still connected, and I feel some additional nodes underneath.  I have not had a fever that I am aware of, and haven't been ill.  I do have a bit of a cough but it comes and goes and isn't \"productive\".  My GP ran a CBC that came back within the normal levels.  He referred me to a surgeon for biopsy.  I am scheduled for a biopsy in two days.  The surgeon told me that the lymph nodes are \"shotty\".  His concern was that they had been there so long and have grown.    (I had my first doctor visit concerning this issue last week.)    The surgeon told me that he doesn't \"feel\" that it is cancer and that it is most likely an infection, but yet a biopsy is still ordered?  I am a bit confused.    Is there somthing he is not telling me or is it possible that he just doesn't know enough to tell me anything for certain?  I am not overly anxious, but I wonder if I should be prepared for something other than infection.  Please shed some light on the subject for me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi alittleconcerned, Generally speaking, the term \"shotty\" is used in relationship to infection. Lymph nodes tend to decrease in size after an infection subsides even though they may not return to their pre-infectious state. The concern of your physician's is most likely due to the fact that the lymph nodes have continued enlarging. Lymph nodes 1 cm or less are usually less concerning. In the particular area that you describe, lymph nodes greater than 1 cm indicate further investigative studies which is the reason for the biopsy. It would be difficult to make a judgement on a specific cause prior to a biopsy. The biopsy would be used to identify if an underlying disorder exists. I hope this has been somewhat helpful. Our best wishes to you and good luck. I hope you will consider posting an update when your time permits. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Last night I felt something poking out as I layed on my stomach.  When I investiagted, I found what I believe to be a swollen node in my grion area.  It isn't very big (about the size of a bean) and is on the left side as well.  It also doesn't hurt, but is very firm as are the ones above the collar bone.  I called my GP this morning to inform him of the newly found nodes and he suggested that I tell the surgeon of this before the biospy in the morning, but gave me no indication of what he thought may be the cause.  I am still not overly anxious, but I do feel a little more worried today that days before.  Not knowing what is going on is the most worrisome part.\n\n",

However, in answer to your question, a physician would be able to look at a node and identify if it has characteristics of a malignancy and be able to say \"it doesn't look like cancer\" but the actual determination would be relied on by the pathologist.

    "content": "Hi alittleconcerned, I appreciate your update. Sarcoidosis is not a form of cancer and is not contagious. Inflammatory granulomas (growths/lumps) may affect any organ of the body including lymph nodes. The etiology or cause of sarcoidosis is unknown. Research suggests that this is an immune response to an environmental factor or even to the own's bodies tissue. Instead of the areas of inflammation subsiding as it normally does, the inflammation remains and produces granulomas (growths or lumps). It occurs most often in people aged 20-40. Treatment is geared toward severity of symptoms present and what organs are involved. One of the medications used to treat this condition is corticosteroids such as prednisone. I hope this information has been somewhat helpful and good luck with your appointment. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tinkerbelle, If the lymph nodes have been evaluated by her physician and have not changed over the last three years that is probably why the physician isn't overly concerned at this point. Lymph nodes may become enlarged from viral/bacterial infections among other conditions, because they are the bodies defense system. These may not return to their pre-infectious size, the key is that they don't continue enlarging despite treatment. Has she had any ear infections, sore throats, sinus infections etc.? Repeated infections (ear, upper respiratory, sore throat, etc.) may cause enlargement of lymph nodes in this area. If you remain concerned request a referral to have these further evaluated but again, since they are not continuing to enlarge and if she is not experiencing any other symptoms,  they are likely to be related to previously repeated infectious origins.

    "content": "I went to see my doctor about a lymph node above my elbow about 4 weeks ago, which she examined & did a blood test; she said she would call me if anything was abnormal & I haven't heard from her.  The node is a bit less than an inch, and I had already had it for several weeks.  She said it might be a sign of mono, but I didn't and don't have any other symptoms of mono, and I was and am completely health, except that I think a few other nodes in my armpits and maybe around my neck are a little swollen too.  I also sometimes have a very vague sense of discomfort at the back of my shoulder on the same arm I have the elbow node - maybe that's not related.  So anyway I've had these nodes now for almost 2 months and they haven't gone away - should I go see the doctor again?  What could this be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I was wondering if you normally feel lymph nodes even when they aren't swollen.  I noticed that when I massage certain areas of my neck, I can feel small lumps in there, and I figured that's what they were. They aren't big in size, nor do they hurt, but I didn't think you'd be able to feel them unless they were swollen. Same thing with my armpit and groin. If it makes a difference, I was trying to find the lymph nodes when I did it. Also, I've had allergies for weeks now.  To sum it up....if you are 100% healthy, can you normally feel lymph nodes in your neck if you search for them? Thanks.\n\n",

Infected lymph nodes however, tend to be:  Firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (i.e. stuck to each other), fixed (i.e. not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.  These criteria do not seem to fit your description.  Following infection, however, lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty lymph nodes'. They are harmless.  As always, you are advised to confirm these findings with your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello DesperatetoConceive21, I hope you have already had a biopsy and that your results came out fine. An enlarged inguinal lymph node is considered clinically significant when it reaches 1.5cm in size. The reason being that it is commonly enlarged by benign disease.  This lymph node drains the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal and lower limbs.  It is commonly affected by infections of the leg or foot, STDs (e.g., herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  The fact that it recently increased in size is probably what urged them to proceed with a biopsy. Unfortunately, you do not have all the information since they didn't provide you with the lab results. Trust in your doctor's opinion, he is obviously doing what is in your best interest. Let us know how everything went. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello seraphim, Thank you for using The Doctor's Lounge.  Assuming that this is a lymph node enlargement in the left armpit (axilla), here are a few thoughts: The axillary lymph nodes draing the arm, thoracic wall, breast. As such inflammation, infections as well as cancers from these areas would cause its growth in size. Its size in your case is significant since it seems to be quite large. This can happen with infection or cancer. Now let me address the pain and tenderness which are usually not associated with cancer but more likely are indicative of infection. Another point in your favor is your age, being younger than 40 years decreases the overall likelyhood of your lymph node being cancer. I would recommend that you seek medical attention as the only way to exclude the more serious causes would be by clinical evaluation. You would also probably need a course of antibiotics and antiinflammatory drugs that your doctor will prescribe. You will be observed for a period of 3 to 4 weeks where upon if the lymph node does not subside you will require further evaluation. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ucdcows, Thank you for using The Doctor's Lounge. First, the only way for me to be able to confirm that these bumps are lymph nodes I would need to examine them personally which is obviously not possible. However, assuming that they are lymph nodes given your description of their location let me give you a few thoughts.  For lymph node enlargement to be significant most authors agree that the size should be greater than 1 cm (Libman H, 1987).   Regarding, the position of the lymph node enlargement you would be describing the occipital lymph node which are located at the junction between the back of the head and neck. They are rarely malignant, often related to scalp and outer ear infections, exanthematous diseases, and toxoplasmosis.  Given the limitations of the internet in clinical evaluation, you are advised to seek medical attention. In your case the most probable outcome of your evaluation would be to put you under observation for 3 to 4 weeks and then re-evaluate these nodes. The doctor may also recommend a course of antibiotics based on his evaluation.  References: ----------------  Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58.\n\n",

It's all a matter of judgment for the doctor who sees you.  If  your lymph node is significant....then a biopsy should be done to exclude malignancy (cancer) and to reach a diagnosis and follow the appropriate treatment.  It might be enlarged from a serious infection you had....not mono in particular,then it healed by fibrosis and left the lymph node big....and you discovered it accidentally when it was there all the time.  what concerns me is the weight loss...how much did you lose (in Kgs, please) over what period of time? days/weeks/months? P.S: did you have a CT scan done on your neck only? and did it just show this lymph node....or there have been other ones?!  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I have no clue what I am doing, responding or asking. Hopefully someone will answer. I am 33 yrs. old, one child. I have had vague symptoms that are progressing mildly. The problem is; is that I have endometriosis and a bulge in my cervical spine between my C5 & C6. Which symptoms do you attribute to each disorder and which are left over?       In July of 2004, I began to lose weight. I lost 50 lbs. in 6 mos. Drs. don't see what the big deal is. I should be happy, I went from a size 18 to an 8.      I had a tonsilectomy in June of this year, the ENT thinking that this would solve the lymph nodes in the neck, the fatigue, and the mild fever.  The only thing it solved was my chronic tonsilitis. Everything else is still there.       I have numbness in the left side of my face and left extremeties. Extremeties have been ruled as a possible two things: the bulge or swelling putting pressure on a nerve or since it coincides with my period, that my circulation is comprimised at this time. The numbness in my face is thought due to dental stress. What?        I have had psych. testing (in order to rule out hypochondria, to appease the Docs), I have also been on three different anti-depressants and couseling, with no improvement. They would not do any testing until I completed both of these. When a board certified psych from HFHosp finally told them, \"Listen she's not crazy!\", then they did the tests.       I was sent for a sleep test, fatigue, hmmmm nothing wrong...Could be mild narc. even though blood test was neg. They put me on a stimulant. Without this, I would find it very hard to make it through the day. No doubt in my mind that this is masking the prob. Memory Loss is thought to be a result of the fatigue.      I have had bloodwork done and been tested for autoimmune disorders, thyroid, tb, hepatitis, AIDS, RA, B-12, Mono (shows past infec. unknown to me, but not active), diabetes, anemia, metabolic screening, prolactin, and other basic blood screens. All Neg. although some are right on the border. My BP is low and positional.      I have had a brain & cervical CT. Found the lymphs and bulge.      I have been diagnosed & treated in the past for chronic dry eye, carpal tunnel, endometriosis, seasonal allergies, migraines, & poss. low level narco. I have alternating constipation/diahrea (rules out thyroid).     I have not been back to the Dr. in a while. I'm done for now. I sick of being made to feel like I'm an idiot who wants attention. No, all I want is for all of it to go away. I used to be a very active person who was always on the go. Without the medication, I could sleep 13 hrs. a day. That Doc said some people just need more sleep than others.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ukveteran2, Thank you for dropping by The Doctors Lounge. The presence of an enlarged lymph node in the neck could be due to several diseases and not only due to lymphoma. Many things are taken into consideration when attempting to reach a diagnosis. The size of a lymph node (smaller than 1 cm lymph nodes tend to be less important), the consitency, the mobility and the persistence after a course of antibiotics are all clinically significant details. Obviously the most prudent way to go about reaching a diagnosis is to eliminate the most dangerous possibilities first which in your case would mean cancer. Based on clinical evaluation, your doctor can assess how demanding the situation is. If this is the only clinically significant lymph node enlargement that you have; then usually, the next step based on clinical examination would be a CT/MRI scan of the head and neck regions to exclude cancer of the head or neck. At the same time a fine needle aspiration cytology (not a biopsy) from the lymph gland is warranted. Many lymph gland enlargments turn out to be benign (reactive); however, no caring doctor will rest his mind until he has excluded these dangerous possibilties by every means available. Your doctor may also opt to wait a little longer before referring you for investigations if he considers the situation to be less risky. Do keep us posted. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "hi i am new to this board but am 34 and mother of 2 small children.  this all started 1 and a half years ago with sinus problems and swollen lymph node in neck and above collar bone.  i have allergies and post nasal drip constantly.  I also have ocd.  I have seen three ent's and primary with cbc, liver, esr, etc done all being normal.  the ent says they feel normal.  had a ct of sinus showed some blockage and deviated septum.  i am so consumed with the swollen node that i continuously touch poke irritate it all day long.  i have even tried to squeeze it so hard i have bruised my skin thinking it may go down.  they are the size of a pea probably less than 1 cm.  i have no other symptoms like night sweats, fatigue, weight loss or fever.  i am wondering if by squeezing and pinching the lymph nodes can keep them swollen or even stop them from going back to their normal size.  they have been there a year atleast but do not increase in size.  any information would greatly be appreciated i am worrying myself sick.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi candy811, Lymph nodes may enlarge due to viral/bacterial infections, among other conditions, because the lymphatic system is the bodies defense in filtering viruses and bacteria. After a lymph node becomes enlarged and an infection has subsided it may not return to it's pre-infectious state. With that being said, since you have been evaluated by several specialists, had diagnostic  studies, are not experiencing any other symptoms, the lymph nodes are 1 cm or less, not increasing in size, in my opinion, I would have to agree that this in all probability, has an infectious rather than malignant etiology. It is essentially normal. Stop poking and squeezing at the lymph node as this will only cause irritation. The size it is should alleviate your fear and let you know that you body is responding appropriately. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi majo, Generally speaking, enlarged, \"tender\" lymph nodes may commonly indicate an infectious or inflammatory process. Lymph nodes may enlarge due to even seemingly decrete or unapparent viral/bacterial infections because they are the bodies filtering system. Enlarged nodes  may not return to their pre-infectious size. Even something as trivial as a cut or abrasion, may trigger this action. You may want to have the area evaluated by your physician when you go in for an appointment but again, tenderness usually indicates the previously mentioned factors.

Lymph nodes 1 cm or less may often be related to less concerning etiologes/ causes such as bacterial/viral infections. One reason that lymph nodes enlarge is because this is our bodies defense system to fight off infection. When lymph nodes continue to enlarge over a period of time especially if treated unsuccessfully with a course of antibiotics etc. then they are certainly more suspicious in nature. Lymph nodes containing those characteristics, larger than 1 cm is size, etc. warrants further investigative studies. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I'm 33, generally healthy with the exception of chronic sinusitis and asthma .My nodes are not huge, the largest in the submandibular area is 1.9 cm X .7 cm, and I have a couple of palpable nodes in the supraclavicular area (or lower cervical) that are less than 1 cm.  I had been feeling dizzy and under the weather for quite a while, so I had a million blood tests (normal, including esr/c reactive protein) chest x-ray (normal). I also had 2 ultrasounds of the nodes, which appeared benign. They seem basically moveable, but not soft - there is one in particular which feels quite hard.   I consulted with a surgeon who said that as long as the nodes do not increase in size, he would not recommend biopsy. Does that make sense to you, or do you think I should insist on biopsy?\n\n",

Also, the ultrasound evaluation didn't determine suspiciousness. If you would continue feeling generally unwell however, a repeat evaluation by your physician is recommended. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Finally asked to see another doctor who sent me to the surgical clinic. He felt it and said he wants to take it out as it is in a worrisome spot. He scheduled me for an ultrasound on the 18th to see how deep it is prior to surgery. My question is this, shouldn't he do a CT scan or x-rays prior to deciding to just remove it? Plus, if it was cancer wouldn't it have gotten larger? The only other symptoms I've had are hoarseness and the feeling that I need to clear my throat alot. I've had some pain in my collarbone region sometimes spreading down my arm and up my neck. I didn't mention the hoarsenes and throat clearing to him as I didn't think it applied at the time to the lump. I've also been pretty exhausted but that is the usual norm as I have fibromyalgia.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I found a lump in the back of my neck between my ear and my spine.  I am not sure if this is a lymph node or not.  I haven't been sick since about 6-7 months ago.  When i first found this lump it was fairly small, but noticable upon palpitation, now after about 2 months the lump has grown to bigger then a pea size.  It is on my left side. It is hard and doesn't move.  It is kind of oval shaped I guess you could say.  It does not hurt in any way.  Would this be a lymph node?  Should I be worried.  My husband has told me to just watch it and wait to see if it gets any bigger.  It costs a lot to go to the doctors.  I am a diabetic and have been since 1987, would diabetes have anything to do with this.  Lately my sugars have been high, for about the past 2-3 months.  Not too high, but higher then normal.  I have also getting boughts of nausea just about everyday.  I am extrememly tired and feel like I can't get enough sleep.  I usually get a full nights sleep, but after being awake for three hours I am finding that I need to take a nap.  Sometimes I get really weak like I need to sit down.  And advice that anyone could give me would be so appreciated.  Should I be more concerned then my husband?  Any thoughts.  I appreciate your imput very much.  Thanks  -Cinamon\n\n",

As for your lump, don't be scared of surgery. You will get a biopsy, will not feel a thing, it won't hurt, and you will recovery quickly.  The purpose of a biopsy is to remove the lump, and send it to a lab for testing to see what is wrong.  Most lumps are due to an infection of some kind, which is why you were prescribed antibiostics to take for awhile to see if it goes away. If it does not go away by the time you are finished with the antibiotics, then there is something else wrong. It may be serious, and it may not be. I don't think you should worry until after you have a biopsy( which you may not even need) You didn't say how long you have been on the antibiotics. It is very possible the lump will be gone by the time you are finished.\n\n",

    "content": "Im replying to this simply because I did not see where to start a New Topic, if someone could help me that would be apprecitated. Anyway my problem is  A while ago I woke up in the morning after a night of quite intense sweating (night sweat) something that usually does not occur. I immediately felt a tender sensation on both sides of my neck just beneath the jaws. I supposed this sensation was related to the lymph nodes in this location. The tender feeling became most present as I turned the head to either side, did not hurt very much though. Hard to tell if the glands where enlarged or not, no similar feeling in other glands in the body. However this tenderness went away during the course of the day and towards the evening there was nothing to be felt. No further symptoms.  Maybe I`m just a bit paranoid as the symptoms went away so fast, but Ive searched the internet quite a lot in order to find out what caused the symptoms without any success. I am eager to know what caused it, would I have something to worry about? Anyone know if it could be caused by infections or something else? Help would be very appreciated\n\n",

    "content": "My 11 yr. old son has had an enlarged lymph node on the left side of his neck (mid jugular) for about 3 weeks.  He has NO other symptoms at all.  No fever, sore throat, stuffed up nose, etc.  He was put on Amox. for 1 week, and it didn't go down, so they put him on clendomycin (he's been taking that for 1 week too).  It has gone down a little bit, but not enough for me.  There is no pain if you touch it, but it is so big that it looks like something is growing out the side of his neck (almost like frankenstein, but just the left side of his neck). It is about 3 cm now (it was about 4 cm) and he has been fatigued over the past week.  other than the fatigue he still has no other problems.  We go to a little old small town doctor and I'm afraid that she just doesn't know what it is, so she's just pelting him with antibiotics to see what it does.  Anybody have any idea what might cause this???  Thanks mom2tck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mom2tck, Although lymph nodes commonly enlarged in the presence of bacterial/viral infections because this is the bodies defense/filtering  mechanism, they may also enlarge for other more serious conditions. How does the lymph node feel? Is it fixed or movable? Lymph nodes related to infection are usually tender etc.  Lymph nodes that do not decrease in size despite the use of antibiotics warrants further investigation. I am strongly suggesting to you that if he has had no labwork or other diagnostic studies (ultrasound/CT scan, etc) that you inquire about these studies being done. I hope that you will consider posting an update. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

It's not painful, and it's not realy soft, but not hard either...it's pretty much set where it's at, you can't move it around or anything...is that a good thing or a bad thing???  Still he had no fever, and no other symptoms, just this great big golf ball size \"thing\" on the side of his neck.  I just know that the few times I have had a lymph node swell it has been so painful that it even hurt to move, and he has NO problem turning his head or anything.  I will let you know what the surgical doctor has to say after his apt. on Friday.  Thanks Deborah\n\n",

Your son's neck will be somewhat uncomfortable, and he may have some soreness during swallowing but these syymptoms will be relatively short lived. The tissue will be sent to a pathologist for an evaluation for identification of abnormal cells. I will hold you both in my thoughts and prayers for strength, guidance, and in the hope that all goes well and he recovers without incident. I will watch for your follow up post.

He said some of the tests would take a month to get back, but the most important one should be back by the middle of next week.  He even mention that he was testing it for TB.  But, I guess when you have been out of the country they tend to think that it could be some strange bacteria.  Even though I told them that his lymph node was swollen before we ever left for South America a month ago...but I guess they are just being thorough.  My son is having realy bad headaches today and is running a fever of about 102...but the incision looks good..no oozing, or redness...but the on-call doctor just told me to make him take deep breaths and have him cough, but he can't even do that because of the bad headaches.  I can't decide if I want to take him back to the ER or just wait it out and see if it gets better.  The on-call doctor was not the one that did his surgery so I don't feel that he was very concerned about him running such a high fever. Is fever normal after surgery??  His numbness in his left ear has gotten better though.  I guess it's just going to be a waiting game for me.  The only thing the doc did tell me was that his CBC was normal...and his chest x-ray was fine...so I guess that's a good thing right???  Thanks for all your help! Mom2tck\n\n",

In the event that there would possibly be an underlying malignancy then this would most likely exclude spread to these areas. Good news indeed! Generally speaking, after a surgical procedure a fever of 101 degrees or less is relatively normal. An elevated temperature of greater that 101 is not. Call the physician back, your son needs an evaluation! Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Now, I have developed a dry and hacky cough, a small painful lump on the front lower part of my throat and my throat is very sore... it has been for a long time. I am going to see an ENT next week, but am hoping someone can comfort me and tell me what kind of things could be causing all of this. My glands are not as swollen as they were... my doctor has had me chewing sour candy to keep my saliva glands working and they sure are doing that as I salvitate alot now to the point where I have to wipe my mouth dry at times. Anyway, I don't know if this painful lump means anything serious? Maybe cancerous tumors don't hurt? Please, if anyone has answers, I would appreciate a response.  Thank you, Stephanie\n\n",

I am not loosing weight and I am on Estadiiol 0.075 mg weekly patch.  Is this normal? Should I be concerned...?

    "content": "Hi, I have a swollen glands on both the right &left supraclavicular area. To feel the nodes, I have to extend my arms outwards and tilt my neck, otherwise they are not easily palpable. The right node, after 5 weeks has reduced from bean size to pea size (less than 1cm) but is still there. The left node is still big when I extend my arm. Its not growing and is starting to shrink, but still bean sized, maybe about 2cm. I am very worried about this being a lymphoma. I had a visit to my ENT who described them 'shotty' nodes, not to worry. But I read on the internet and its starting to scare me. I also have very small nodes under the jaw and on each side of the neck. these are less the 1cm and have been there for 5 years. I must also note that I have had ACNE and was prescribed ACCUTANE for this. I have been off accutane for 3 weeks now. Do think it is the accutane causing the clavicular enlargements? I had the fear of lymphoma and also took a chest x-ray, abdominal ultrasound and blood tests. The xray and ultrasounds were normal. Bloods such as the LDH was normal, so was the ESR. LDH, 150, ESR 2 mmol. Everything else normal. EBV normal too. I'm not sure what to do. I have no sweating, fever etc. i have within 2 days developed a small cough (to clear throat). I'm 21, male, 168cm, 52 kg. Quite skinny for years now. I'M SO WORRIED I NEED SOME HELP FROM SOMEONE OUT THERE, PLEASE! What would i have to look out for for lymphoma. My ENT says, no enlarged spleen or liver and node would be much bigger than mine so biopsy not neccessay right now. WHAT TO DO, I'M SOOOO SCARED!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi veryworried1, The term \"shotty\" is often in reference to lymph node enlargement related to an infectious/inflammatory cause. Lymph nodes enlarge during episodes of bacterial/viral infections because the lymphatic system is the defense system of the body. Lymph nodes that decrease in size are often related to this particular cause and may not return to their pre-infectious state. Lymph nodes that continue to enlarge are more often concerning. When symptoms arise from Lymphoma they usually present with fatigue, night sweats, unexplainable fevers, weight loss, itching, etc. Even though lymph node enlargement in the supraclavicular area is concerning, taking into consideration that the nodes are decreasing in size would be more indicative of infectious/inflammatory disorders.  I hope this information was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The indicator of whether this medication is associated with your particular symptoms is, did you notice the decreasing size of the enlarged lymph nodes after discontinuation of the medication?

I went to the doctor after a month and he told me to come back if it got bigger. The swelling did no increase, however it did not decrease either. I went this afternoon to the doctor and told me to go have a fine needle biopsy. I'm really worried that it I have Hodgson's Disease or Lymphoma. The swelled node is not tender, it can be moved and I have no experienced any other symptoms. The doctor said it may of been an infection somewhere on my head, but I cannot remember any infection. Can you tell me what I should expect? The swelling wouldn't be larger than a centimetre.  Thankyou, please reply\n\n",

He has recently begun to complain with \"kidney and gall bladder pain\". He also has a couple of symptoms that may prove erroneous. His hair has cycles of falling out in patches and he says his perspiration has developed an odor that is quite pungent. The paradox is this; a lymph node biopsy that has yielded a negative result. Can this be a false negative? This is my husband's brother. Their Father (my father-in-law) passed last year from recurrent Hodgkin's after chemo and a stem cell transplant. Needless to say we are more than a bit concerned. Thank you for your consideration to this post.\n\n",

The only new test (as we understand it) is he will be screened for Hepatitis. We are very puzzled why this has not already taken place. He has been sick for nearly 2 years with the fatigue and hair loss issues. The other symptoms have appeared in the last several months and his current physician (who is the 2nd or 3rd consulted) has had him on antibiotics for the past 5 weeks. We are completely baffled. However some family members say his color has improved. It seems that his liver counts fluctuate and this seems to determine his sense of well being. Is it possible that we are over-reacting and that his illness is a lymphatic infection?  In addition to losing my father-in-law last July I also lost my sister to OVCA. in March of 2004. I just don't think our family can cope with much more...Thank you so much for your time. I will echo your advice to our family 1700 hundred miles away.  Feeling quite helpless...\n\n",

For example, some of the signs and symptoms of Hodgkin's Lymphoma are painless enlarged lymph nodes, weight loss, night sweats, poor appetite, generalized itching, fatigue, hair loss, enlarged spleen, etc. Again, I would inquire about an additional lymph node biopsy, bone marrow biopsy, CT Scan of the neck, chest, abdomen and pelvis. You stated that he has been being treated for an infection of the biopsy site? 5 weeks of antibiotic therapy? Was a culture sent of the wound to identify any resistent organisms? If this has not been completed then this would be another suggestion because 5 weeks of antibiotic treatment in my opinion suggests an infection of a resistent organism, for example, MRSA (Methicillin-Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus). I would hope that Hepatits screens and HIV testing would have previously been completed to rule these illnesses out. I do not feel you are over-reacting by any means. I hope that when your time permits you will post a follow up. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The swollen, red, excise site is merely an addition to the already fragile health of \"Dan\". The biopsy, I am sad to say only came about after several family demands. Please be aware, (as if symptoms were not enough) this physician is fully aware of the death of the patient's Father to Hodgkin's. The 5 week (approaching 6 week) treatment began with an in town doc. We all insisted this was too complex of an issue for a simple Lymphatic infection. \" Dan\" agreed to seek a second opinion which led him 2 hours away to his current doctor. This physician ordered an X-ray and CT of the abdomen. These tests highlighted the presence of a \"spot\" on his lung and an enlarged spleen. The only change in treatment was an alternate anti-biotic. His lung seemed to be a no concern...what?, and his spleen enlargement reduced to a \"mistake\" by the physician. We are now to believe the spleen was \"NEVER\" enlarged ! As to HIV testing and Hepatitis screening, you and I are both puzzled. I have been making suggestions along with my sister-in-laws for many weeks now. It is only in the past week that the physician has indicated that he would consider a Hepatitis screen. It is any man's (or woman's) guess as to if this or HIV testing will actually occur. I'm afraid the identity of my young brother-in-law's illness will be revealed post mortem. Again your advice is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "ourhouse93! Pathology is the most important diagnostic test in lymphoma. Luckily, it is quite accurate. One possibility for false negative results is if the lymph node tissue is not adequate (not likely if this is an excisional biopsy in which the whole of the lymph node is removed) or if the surgeon picked a less significant lymph node (again not very likely). This would depend on the size and appearance of these lymph nodes in relation to others.  Usually a lymph node of the neck is first assessed with a fine needle biopsy. Once the pathologist has the specimen, determining if it contains lymphoma is usually not difficult. A panel of special stains (immunohistochemistry) will allow him to conclude the nature of this disease. If that is not enough in some cases of lymphoma the diagnosis can be made at a genetic level. What exactly does the biopsy report say (other than negative for malignancy)? Whether the spleen is enlarged or not is unclear and it does not appear to show 'focal lesions' which are common in lymphomas involving the spleen. I am assuming his blood counts (white blood cells) are normal since you didn't mention them. I understand your concern but until we exclude lymphoma for the time being it seems that the main concern here is indeed the rising liver enzymes and the bilirubin. A hepatitis screen is mandatory and should be done as soon as possible. One thing to keep in mind is the size and number of the lymph nodes if they are increasing in size and number that should be a reason for concern. In such a case I would advise you to consult with a hemato-oncologist. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tammyabby, Although Henoch-Schonlein Purpura, may be caused when the immune system doesn't fight an infection as it's intended I would not expect this to cause enlarged nodes. I, however, would relate the diarrhea to this disorder. The weight loss, night sweats and fatigue is disconcerting but I would not relate these findings to Henoch-Schonlein Purpura an would be inclined to consider another cause. You may feel some discomfort in your neck along with some difficulty swallowing but these symptoms should be short lived. If a diagnosis of lymphoma would be found the treatment options are based on the type, stage/grade etc. Good luck with your biopsy and I hope you will consider posting an update. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sabrelyn, Lymph nodes that are movable, and not increasing in size despite treatment are most likely related to a previous infection because the lymph system is the bodies defense for filtering bacteria/viral infections. Since your physician has evaluated these lymph nodes and found that they are essentially benign in nature I wouldn't be too concerned. Numbness, tingling, palpitations etc. may be related to numerous conditions. I would not jump to a conclusion of anemia or cancer at this point but would look at the more obvious conditions such as alterations in blood pressure, diabetes, thyroid disorders, vitamin deficiencies, etc. Why put yourself through worrying about the \"what if\"? Sometimes fear of the unknown is worse than a condition or illness itself. I would suggest that you make an appointment with your physician to identify the causative factor.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "A few quick details,  here.....about 3 weeks ago, maybe four, I started to feel tired.  Then, after a wild party the lymph nodes in my neck swelled up rapidly, painfully,  left side only.   It was a Sunday, and I started to feel bad.  For the next 5-6 days, I felt pretty crappy.  I had a fever that would come and go, but never went above 101.8.  I didn't really feel like eating when I had the fever, but when I took ibuprofin, I felt better.  A node in my left armpit swelled and hurt for about 2 days, but has been gone for almost two weeks.  I was very fatigued, achy, etc.  I went to the doctor the Monday after I started to feel bad (because my left side nodes were absolutely HUGE and I was alarmed) and at first she was just thinking the usual.  But because I was so alarmed she gave me Augmentin.  I finished the Augmentin a week later.  I felt better, all symptoms were gone EXCEPT the huge, swollen lymph nodes.  She gave me 7 days of Levaquin, which I finsihed last night.    I had a CT scan a few days ago.  Dr. called with the results, which she said were unremarkable except for the swelling.  CBC was all within normal ranges, mono test was negative.  But for some strange reason, she's sending me to a ENT and wants me to have a biopsy.  I feel fine.  I do not feel sick.  But my neck still hurts and is swollen.  The nodes are temporarily eased with ibuprofin.  At times they are so bothersome, and the back of my head hurts, it almost feels itchy and I keep rubbing it.    The only reason they'd want to biopsy is to check for cancer, right?  Could I have cancer, even if I feel fine, and even if my nodes are painful, CBC is fine and CT was unremarkable?  Can I also assume that it is not an infection, since two weeks of antibiotics did not reduce the swelling (though the other symptoms did disappear?)  Could it be a virus not found by the CBC?  Please comment, I am absolutely freaking out.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Does anyone ever respond?  Update for anyone who reads this and is researching their own symptoms:  I had an appointment with the Ear Nose and Throat doc who did a Fine Needle Aspiration right there in his office.  He had me wait fifteen minutes or so while the pathologist looked at a slide or two and called  me back.  He said that they didn't see anything worrysome, but that they would do the complete test and he would call me if there was anything wrong.  That was a week ago and I havent' heard, so I'm assuming they didn't find anything.  He asked to see me again in three weeks if the swelling didn't decrease, and that they would do another FNA.  I was hoping that by the time I went back to the doctor, the swelling in my neck would have gone down, but it doesn't seem to be getting any better a week later.  Sometimes I think it's actually gotten worse - and let me tell you - these lymph nodes are absolutely huge.  When I look in the mirror, the left side of my neck is very clearly sticking out further than the other side.  To touch it, it almost feels like it's swollen by INCHES, not centimeters.  It was very painful several weeks ago and flares up, but is much less painful now and at times painless.  The swelling seems to increase at night.  It seems I have a pea-sized lymph node on the right side of my neck now as well.  Though I've had tests (CBC, mono, CT of neck, FNA) and nothing has been cause for alarm, I can't shake the feeling that this is not normal.  This just suddenly appeared one day, and I know that painful, swollen lymph nodes that appear suddenly doesn't usually pont to cancer, BUT WHAT IS IT?  Doctors think infection, but can't give me any test results to back up that diagnosis.  I want explanations.    Both of my docs have said something about EBV.  I have heard that you can have Epstein-Barr Virus without testing positive for mono, and that a more expensive blood test can diagnosis this.  Should I request this test?  Also, I have had my thyroid test several times, because I appear to have a slight goiter, but they have all been normal.  My chiro says that you can have thyroid problems without conclusive blood tests.  Should I ask my doc about this?  I know that lymph nodes can stay swollen for a long time after infection, which would make me feel better if the docs could actually tell me with certainty that it IS an infection.  The clear mucous appears to be a side effect of GERD.  I sort of had that problem fixed, but I've been taking large amounts of ibuprofin, which I guess have made that pop up again.  I hate to be one of those patients that thinks the know what is wrong and throws around medical lingo and annoys the docs, (I am a nursing student and now that I know more about disease and the human body, I've become a total hypochondriac).    What else could be causing my symptoms besides infection?  Please respond.\n\n",

    "content": "This is for those researching their own symptoms.  Here's an update of what's happened with me:  Biopsy showed no malignant cells.  I went to my chiropracter still with very swollen lymph nodes.  I was also feeling fatigued, and some days, malaise.  So, all of this had been going on for a month.  I was at the end of my rope.  My chiro suspected infected salivary glands and advised me to begin taking COLLOIDAL SILVER and MEGADOSES OF VITAMIN C (5-6,000 mg a day) to help push the infection out.  This was a Friday - I went straight away to my health food store and picked up the Colloidal Silver, Vitamin C, as well as Astragalus, Cat's Claw and American Ginseng.  (If you want to try herbal/natural remedies, do your homework and make sure they will not interact with any medications or with each other.  And be aware of the symptoms of allergy)  Anyway, I started taking the Colloidal silver and Vit. C on Friday.  Saturday I didn't feel very good, and by Sunday I felt like I had the flu.    I found a resource on the internet that said that, if you're ill, don't be in a hurry to get rid of your symptoms.  If you try and push out infection, etc too quickly, your body's organs will react and you may experience flu-like symptoms.  Decrease the amount of silver for the time being.  I figured out that you kind of have to play with the dosage.  I obviously took too much, though it was well within the dosage range.  But we're talking about something that isn't regulated by the FDA, so you have to determine the dosage range based on what your body is telling you - consulting a holistic expert might also be wise.  Sunday I felt terrible, but by Sunday night, I was feeling better than I had in weeks.  it literally happened within an hour.  I was sick and then I wasn't.  Over the next two or three days, the swelling in my neck lymph nodes went away.  I went to see my MD, who was mystified.  I brought some information on colloidal silver to show her and of course, she didn't know much about it, but basically said, okay, just watch for signs of toxicity, etc.  She gave me an injection of prednasone to get rid of the rest of the swelling, and a script for prednasone tabs (which I didn't take).  Because I still didn't really know what was wrong with me, I asked her to run a few more blood tests, specifically one for Epstein-Barr Virus, even though I had tested negative for Mono.  She called yesterday - Blood test was positive for Epstein-Barr Virus.  Mystery solved.  So, though I don't have cancer, I understand that I am now at risk for certain types of cancer, including lymphomas and possibly breast cancer.  I go to my ENT today to discuss those risks with him.  If you're searching for remedies, I highly recommend the Colloidal Silver, but of course, use it with caution.  Here is a good informational website:  http://www.all-natural.com/silver-1.html\n\n",

All tests have come back normal- Dr also ran a CBC and it was normal. If this is a Lymphoma- is it possible to have a normal CBC? I also notice lately it feels like I have some trouble swollowing foods, and feel some pressure on my Trachea? But not always.  The lymph node feels very hard and doesn't move. Alos is not tender. Is it possible to have a swollen lymph node above collar bone just from infection? Or is this indicator of cancer? My Dad's brother had Hodgkins at age 20 - I have no known infections right now.

Lymph nodes can swell because of irritations, not just infections.  This is not a positive sign for cancer.  Since you do have a family history of cancer it would be in your best interest to have it checked thoroughly just in case, but there a better chance that this will resolve on its own.  The fact that you have a tightness in your throat makes me wonder if you are experiencing allergies, seasonal or food.  Post-nasal drip can cause this feeling sometimes.    Until you see your physician, keep a log of everything you notice you are feeling during this time.  Everything from itchy eyes to tooth pain.  It will help your physician during this process and could also help you narrow the possible causes down yourself.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen lymph node",
    "content": "Hi, for the past week my lymph node in my left armpit has been swollen and enlarged and very painful.  I have also lost about 13 pounds in the last two months and I have not been dieting.  I also am very tired every day and I feel like I have no energy.  I did have a stomach infection about a month ago.  I saw my regular doctor and he has no idea what is causing my painful armpit.  I do not feel sick, such as coughing, sneezing, etc..I am just real exhausted.  I did get bloodwork done and was tested for mono, nothing was abnormal.  I am sure that I have not injured myself by a physical activity and I have not cut myself shaving...for a few days, also the nodes in my neck were painful and swollen, but that is starting to go away.  I am not sure what to do, or where to turn for the next step.  Should I pursue another opinion or does this sound like it will go away on its own?? Thank you for your time!\n\n",

Some people have suggested that I get a breast exam; that there could be an underlying issue there.  After reading many of the posts in this forum, it seems that there are many people with problems similar to mine, and many do not know what would account for thier symptoms either.  I am really confused on what I should do next, or what my next alternative route should be in solving this problem.  Any other opinions or advice would be deeply appreciated.  Thank you...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi LMJ187,  I just read your post and hopefully by now you have received the healthcare you need.  If not, I would suggest getting tested for EBV (Epstein Barr Virus).  Just because you tested negative for Mono does not mean you do not have Mono.  Mono shows up in the blood for a small amout of time (usually 2 weeks).  If it is missed the test will be negative.  EBV (although expensive which is why most doctors do not test for it)  is another test which can show you have Mono.  EBV is the virus that causes Mono.  Your WBC count can also be normal.  You did not mention anything about your throat.  Was it ever painful?  Do you have tonsils?  I hope this helps if you have not found help yet.  Please let me know how you are doing.\n\n",

I am also going through perimenpause (I just turned 50) and have occasional breast pain - especially when I take excedrin because of sinus headaches.  My Dr tells me that it is small and nothing to worry about, but when it swells a little and I feel it when working out or whenever (it is located inside around the joint), it worries me.  My family does not have a history of breast cancer so that eases my mind a little...BUT...it never occurred to me until I read your posting that I should be checking other avenues on the cause.  I too had my left, lower wisdon tooth out.  Since that time, my left jaw/joint keeps popping out of place.  My chiropracter has been treating it.  I went to my primary Dr and had my annual pap (normal) but that is when she found the small swollen lymph node.  An ultrasound was done (O.K.).  I also went to Physician Assistant Nutrionist that did a full blood panel on me.  It came back with a slight EBV - but no one seems to be worried about it.  The Lymph node went down during my time that I took antibiotics for my sinus infection, but today its back.\n\n",

Also, would it even be possible because I have never had sexual activities except had a penis in me for about 20 seconds ( was telling him no). What do you think I have and is it possible for that to be the cause? (It was 10 months ago). Thank you for taking your time i really appreciate it. I am from N.O. so there is no access for me to get to a doctor for any other tests other than CBC\n\n",

I realize you are in a difficult situation in your area, but the swollen lymph glands and coinciding fatigue really shows a need for further testing.  There are medical facilities set up in your area.  I have no idea how close you are to any of those and with the current weather it may be impossible to get to one in the next couple of days.  It's very scary thinking about all of the possibilities of illness you have been exposed to over the past month.  Do your best to not become exposed to any new toxins, and find a medical facility that can test for bacteria and such as soon as the weather clears.  Prayers to you and all in NO!\n\n",

My doctor told me ppl get swollen glands all the time when they are young and not to worry. He ran a bunch of general tests and told me nothing came back except for the third time doing a secified mono test it had a small trace found and i was supposed to be fine .  I have gone from a size 12 to a 8 and i am so tired there are some days i cannot think properly or even stay awake, and sometimes i cannot walk (if it was ebv, i didn't think glands would stay swollen for over a year) my periods have almost become obsolete, andi have had serious pain in my groin and lower left abdomen. Recently i have found a hard lump under my ribs on the left side and have been getting bladder infections.     I was just wondering if i should go back to see maybe a different doctor because i don't even want to go but if there is reason for concern i will.  sorry for the long post, thanks for any replies\n\n",

At my last GP visit he told me that if it was lymphoma, I would show many more symptoms after four years.  I have another appt tomorrow, should I have it checked again or just forget about it.  It is about 1cm in size, but of course it feels much larger.  Oh and he said that since I am thin, then the lymph node is easier to feel.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I found a small lump on the side of my neck, and my doctor had a CAT Scan done this past Friday.  I was expecting it to be a fatty mass, but when the results came back, my doctor called me into his office.  The scan showed:  \u201cThe patient places a radioplaque marker over the palpable abnormality.  This overlies the right plastisma and subcutaneous fat.  Just above the nodule there is shotty bilateral submandibular adenopathy with 3 to 4 nodes in both beds measuring 8 to 12 mm in diameter.  Right greater than left jugulodigastric and carotid nodes are also seen at an intermediate size of 12 to 15 mm.  \u201cAn isolated right posterior triangle node meets enlargement criteria at 15 x 12 mm size.  There are scattered bilateral posterior subcutaneous nodes measuring 8 to 10 mm.  No parotid nodes are found nor adenopathy below the level of the hyoid bone.  \u201cThe airway is patent, mucosal surfaces are intact and there are no sites of submucosal mass or infiltration.  Parapharyngeal fat planes are normal.  The salivary glands show no masses or calcifications.  Included osseous structures are intact.  The paranasal sinuses are clear.  \u201cImpression: 1.\tNo mass noted at marked site.  Normal subcutaneous fat and platisma. 2.\tBilateral, right greater than left shotty submandibular, carotid, jugulodigastric and posterior triangle adenopathy. 3.\tthe patient relates history of frequent upper respiratory infection.  This adenopathy is nonspecific and may be due to chronic inflammation or metastasis.  Short interval follow-up urged after treatment\u201d  My doctor is always quick in action, but very short on words, so although I\u2019m seeing an ENT Specialist this Thursday, I do not understand what the results mean.  I tried to look up the individual words, and so much of it came back with \u2018lymphoma\u2019 attached, so I thought someone on here might be able to offer me at least a thought on what might be going on?

    "content": "Well, I went to my ENT Specialist, and I\u2019m going to have a tonsillectomy next week.  He said it may be too early to tell anything from my tonsils but they\u2019ve been swollen for quite a while, and I\u2019ve had sore throats for longer than I care to think, so it\u2019s time.  *smile*    My next question is about a pattern I\u2019ve noticed on my blood tests.  I know it sounds like a mark of desperation, but I\u2019ve been not feeling well now for over a year, and maybe I am getting a bit desperate.  I\u2019ve been examining my blood tests, four all together over the past eight months, and I noticed a consistent pattern with the percent of Neutrophils and Lymphocytes.  Over the past eight months (and four blood tests), the Neutrophils have dropped 12% consistently over time, and the Lymphocytes have risen 11% consistently.  Neither is out of range yet, but they do seem to be moving steadily, and although I\u2019m going to continue to monitor this movement, I was wondering if anyone might know what it could mean (if anything)?  Another change, though not as marked,  is that my platelet count has been rising.  It has not been as consistent, but it did make it just past normal for this past blood test, so possibly they are all tied together.  Thank you so much for any information you might have! Mary\n\n",

    "title": "Lump in armpit",
    "content": "Hello, I'm a very concerned 18 year old female. 4 days ago I found a small lump about the size of a pea at the top of my right armpit, which literally popped up over night with no preceeding pain. The lump now seems to have gotten slightly bigger, but this may be because I am touching it and pinching it, I'm not sure. It is a little painful when I apply pressure to it and I get a few twinges when I move my arm about or lean on it. When I lift my arm it protrudes quite a lot and is hard and quite red, although again this might be because I keep touching it. I think I might have shaved with a blunt razor recently but somehow it doesn't feel like that, although I don't actually know what that would feel like as I've never had it before. My mum had lymphoma a few years ago and I'm really afraid I have the same thing, although her's was not found in the armpit. I don't want to worry her for obvious reasons, so is there a period of time I should leave it to see if it disappears or should I go to the doctor immediately? I don't know how fast cancer can spread. I'm really worried and any advice would be very much appreciated, thank you!  ps. I've fairly recently changed to a stronger antiperspirant due to excessive sweating, could this have caused a problem?\n\n",

So i had my yearly mammogram and also a diagnostic and sonigram.  Everythign cam back good.  My underarm swelled again (its only in the curve not completely under the arm)  family physican says now its a fatty tumor - sent  me to a surgeon.  (i have a history of heavy weight lifting for about 16 years don't lift anymore) surgeon states he thinks its orthopedic - send me to an ortho surgeon.  Ortho does x rays of my neck , right shoulder, shows arthritis in neck and a small bone spur on the top of shoulder. Says he is completely baffled with the swelling, cannot find any swollen hard lymph glands.  I asked him not to send me to someone else can he help me find the answer.  He has me scheduled for MRI on next Thursday. Puts me of 800 mg Advil twice a day until MRI is done.  I am scared to death I am a single parent and just cant seem to get the answers I need.  Does lymphoma swell and recede withanti inflammatory medications.\n\n",

It would not, to my knowledge, have an effect regarding lymphoma. Diagnosis of lymphoma is done by labwork, Ct scan, excisional lymph node biopsy, etc. In my opinion, considering the location, evaluation is certainly warranted of the \"fatty tumor\" by excision and should be done  to rule out any underlying pathological disorder. I would certainly inquire about this with your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I have been to doctors and none have really made that big a deal out of them. Recently however I have noticed them a bit bigger and a few more.   I went to my Dr. and he immediatley ordered a blood test. All my results were normal including my Sed rate. He said that basically there is nothing abnormal going on in my body. I have had some other tests throughout the years and they too have come back normal (kidney/pelvic x-rays, normal earing and eye stuff).   He sent me on my way and yet I am still somewhat concerned.   Do you think that what he did was enough and would those rates necessarily be high if it was serious?   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there.  I too have had one lymph gland swollen since I was 8.  (I am 24 now)  I was told sometimes they just don't return to normal size.  Anyways, I have had a few more this year, and went to the doctor.  The first doctor said if the one in my armpit didn't go away within a month, to come back for a biopsy. Two months later it was 1/2 the size, yet not completely gone.  So I went back. Different doctor this time. He said that they are soo small, (I would guess about 1-1.5cm) and just to watch them.  He also said, (he also does naturopathic medicine as well as western) that sometimes they will swell when your digestive system isn't working that well, or your diet is not great.  (which mine isn't)  He suggested getting a homeopathic medicine called:  '\"Lymphomosol\"  which clears out the lymph system of the toxins they are trying to get rid of. I went to the herbal store and bought it the next day.  I am not using it until Wednesday when I quit smoking.  The doctor at the store said it flushes out the lymphatic system.  It was $16 but called \"lymposot\"  I hope that yours is nothing serious.  I was also told that if you have one swollen for years, it isn't really a concern.  They will go up and down, as mine does when I am sick or cut myself shaving like yesterday.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank You for this site...In 1995 1year after daughterborn, green discharge only one side of R nipple...never got results. In 2002(estimate) I went to Dr. for a lump on my rib above my L  breast.Ultrasound..Dr. says no shadow? I let it go, but is egg shaped and hard, still there, hasn't gotten too much larger. Stll have ugle dark camafluge green discharge one nipple when squeezed lightly from only one (HOLE) upper outer duct. This is opposite breast than chestbone lump.  2003 I notice a dime size firm irregular lump in R breast. Go to Dr.not until Jan 2005  spot mammogram=ultrasound. Dr. said Category 4 small calcifications clustered, lump is about 3.5cm/4.3cm./5cm. Noticable white area of mammogram film that I could see.  He took a lot of images. recommended incisional biopsy, I am scared, so I opted  for 2nd opinion from Breast spaecialist. She says take Danocrine, it is Fibrocystic.  Gave me info and sent me on my way to come back and monitor meds in 4 wks.  I read the papers she gave me...I don't have this.I have no pain, there is an attatched wormy feeling lump, they are not cystic, and movable. I wrote too much, but now, swollen painful when touched ankle, lumps in legs, what feels like a cobblestone road on my ribcages , and this might sound more crazy than the rest, but is it possible to see cancer from the outside of the skin?  Not with any marks or color, or open sores, it actually only looks like nicely healed scars, or dents that are just barely inverted. Some the size of a pencilhead, others the size of quarters. You actually have to look at my skin  on an angle in the light, but in all honesty, everytime I look for one of these barely noticeable mark, sure enough there is a swollen ball or lump behind it.  I am afraid of Dr, but I am a mother of three.  My amily knows that I have these things.  they think i am crazy. Im 29 I have Von Willebrand's Disease, and I have known this for a while, but since the Dr. said it's not breast cancer, I have not been back.  I know that I should, but I can't.  And the times that I get really scared, I will call and it will take me forever to get an appt, so I just put it in the back of my head, or i research it online.  I think that is why my family thinks I'm crazy because a normal person would go to the dr.  Why can't I ?Thank you for listening\n\n",

You must have the greenish discharge cultured and for cytology as well.  This is serious... and Cancer should be ruled out or ruled in ....the only thing to do that is by seeing tissues under the microscope...please have it biopsied so that you can rest your mind and have a proper diagnosis.  You can do a tumor marker as well, the CA 15-3 and the CEA.Do a Chest X-ray to see what are theses bumps in your ribs.  Tell me how it goes, best regards,\n\n",

Was theree anything showiwng on ALll myu Bloodwork that would ACcount for these Nodes?? (Im assuing you had the bloodwork) iof not insist! and if you have it then SEE the ACtual Report of your bloodwork. High WBC, low WBC, Lymphosites (SP), EOS (if Higer Can show Allergic posssiblites in BOdy, Bloodpatlets, B-12 Ecttt antuhing that could be throwing off your System and showwing highs or lows.  If I Wait a FEw weeks and come back can We do bloodwork again?  Wouldd you mind if I Get anothe r opinon?? (if they Balk that is a SIgn they Are not someone you wantt to deal with for sure) MY DOctors alwayss encourage 2nd opinons.  those ARE SOme Examples Thatt I would be askinggg if I had THe biopsys done.  I woulddl Say if anythingg happens psyicallyl that alarms you Calll Them ASAP if Emergent HEAdd to ER if you must because its your life and your body.

    "title": "Lump 1cm below ear.",
    "content": "Hi there,  I have a firm lump / nodule about one centimetre below the bottom of my left ear, near to the top of my jawbone. It's directly below the ear.  It's about one centimetre in length and perhaps half a centimetre wide. I've noticed it there for about one week. It's painless, although I can make the area tender by constantly fiddling with it. I had mumps last November which resulted in swelling in that region, but I recovered from that fully. I had infectious mononucleosis as a teenager, so I should be immune to both of these illnesses now.  Otherwise, I'm fairly healthy. I'm 21, have never smoked and rarely drink. I've suffered from urticaria since January 2005, which I control with either fexofenadine or high dose loratadine. I have no other symptoms. I rarely suffer from colds and flu and don't recall having an infection recently.  I guess I've just fallen into the trap of looking things up on the internet, which is dangerous as a layman. I work full-time so it's hard for me to see a doctor: do you think I have anything to worry about at this stage? Should I wait a while?  Thanks for any help: I really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Barn!  It sounds like even if there is nothing to worry about - you are already worried.  From reading your post, it seems you have run the gamut of illnesses, and for that reason you may be hypersensitive to any new occurrences in your body.    This isn't a bad thing, but it can be exasperating to worry about what might be going on, and stress can be just as problematic as any other major illness.  It is for that reason that I would recommend you go ahead and try to see a physician.  I realize it may be difficult with your work schedule, but it would be much worse to continue to speculate on what might be happening.  I wish you the best! Mary\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your message, Mary.   I went to the doctor after I had the swelling for over two weeks. He noted that the tonsil on that side was rather red, so he put me on a course of antibiotics for a week. He told me to give it two weeks (one with antibiotics and a further one week) and then return if the swelling had not subsided.  I went back to the doctor today because the swelling had not gone down even after the antibiotics. He took another look at my throat and said \"well, it's not red anymore, but it's about twice the size of the other tonsil\". He says that the next step is to visit an Ear, Nose and Throat specialist.  Unfortunately I won't be able to get an appointment for a couple more weeks as I shall be moving back to my university city during this time. I'll need to get a referral from a doctor up there.  This leaves me time to worry.   A lymph node swelling that doesn't respond to antibiotics coupled with unilateral tonsillar swelling can't be good, right?\n\n",

I'm glad to hear you are about to head back to Uni...I hope I understood that right.  *Grin* Sorry to hear that the swelling has not gone down either, but equally glad you went ahead to the doctor.  Well, from what I've understood, sometimes it can take quite a while for the swollen area to return to normal size.  It is not necessarily a bad thing that it is still swollen.  I would recommend going ahead and trying to get a referral to the ENT, but try not to worry too much.  In fact, it might be something fun to use at parties, right??  *grin*  That the red has gone down is a very good thing, so try not to worry too too much.  I hope everything turns out alright, and please keep me posted!  Best Wishes, Mary\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jo!  I am so sorry to read about all you have been through!  How strong you must be to have survived so much, and still be active in your life!  I want to commend you for being proactive in asking for support to your concerns, but I also want to urge you to go ahead and make that appointment with your physician.  Most physicians would not see concerns such as yours as a 'simple' problem, and with your family history it might be best to go in for a check-up anyway.  Anytime you are concerned about something going on in your body, there is a certain amount of stress that goes along with those concerns.  Unfortunately, the stress can build up and cause a myriad of health problems all on it's own.    I truly hope you find the answers you are looking for after speaking with your physician.  They are there to help, and I hate to think that you might let this go by because you think it is too small to be a problem.  That you are concerned makes it big enough to need addressing.  I wish you the best, Mary\n\n",

    "title": "Nondiagnostic core biopsy...What  now?",
    "content": "Hi, I have a question after a recent biopsy.   Last October I had an ultrasound of my thyroid due to autoimmune hypothyroidism.  It showed a nodule on the lower left pole and several extrathyroidal nodules thought to be nodes.  They were all 5mm or so and inferior to both lobes.  There was also one that was about 1 x .7 cm, also inferior, on the left.    A follow up ultrasound in Feb. reported stable, but did not mention the original intrathyroidal nodule.  A third  ultrasound in July also did not detect any thyroid nodules but showed the inferior nodes .  It showed that the larger nodule had increased some in size and the Endo recommended ENT appt.    ENT ordered ultrasnd guided fine needle biopsy.  The Docter who performed the biopsy decided while viewing the ultrasound that a core needle was neccessary and took two samples.  Between sticks he asked if I'd had a CT of my chest, but didn't say why.  The assistant asked him if he wanted something about a sample preparation?? for lymphoma which is why I posted in this catagory.   The labs came back as muscle and fibrous tissue.  ENT says basically nondiagnostic.  (Did it miss, I guess?  It felt like being knuckled in the trachea).   ENT says I can wait a few months, do another ultrasound in Dec. and see it's grown---or excise now.  Since it's lower than my collar bone and behind the sternocl. muscle I would love to avoid surgery (and scar).  However,  I am a bit extra concerned because in the last 2 1/2 years I have developed multiple bumps on bones.  I have some frontal bossing, a bulge at right ethmoid sinus, one on the back of my right hand, one on my right heel and a large one on the 3rd costochondral anterior right which is clearly visible.  I am beginning to get one opposite to this and the end of the right rib under my arm is thickening.  An MRI was done of my chest in Jan. for the large one and although there is enlargement of the bone there  was no other finding.  Chest x-rays show nothing.  Family Dr. said I'm just getting older and I'm going to be \"lumpy-bumpy\".  But this started at 36 and that's not so old.  Also no one else in my family is \"lumpy-bumpy \"   I am not satisfied with this diagnosis.    I have had endocrine labs for acromegaly -negative.  I have also had 24 hr cortisol due to new stretch marks on my abdomen without weight gain (besides I didn't get them with pregnancies).  It was also neg.  Sed rate and rheumatoid factor --neg.  The only abnormal labs have been thyroid related and my last WBC count done in Dec. 03 which was slightly below normal.   I also have a lump (firmish rubbery) on the edge between my hard and soft palate (newly discovered) on left side and my right tonsil has been slightly larger for over a year.  Usually my tonsils can not be seen (my family doctor asked if I'd had them out when I was her new patient).    For the last few months I am running an intermittant low grade temp 99-100, which is unusual for me as being hypo I tend to stay in the 96-97 range.   I have intermittant periods of swollen extremities and numbness/pain in fingers, hands and sometimes entire arm.   I have some memory and cognitive deficits.  I forget the names of people I know.  I cannot organize, and my formerly excellent perception of spacial distance  is gone.  I get lost in conversations but my hearing tests above average.     I have an excess of estrogen to progesterone and have begun progest. drops sublingual.  Family Dr. says this is what is causing rise in temp.  I have had headaches for over two years behind right eye/forehead/ ethmoid lump.    I have been told that I have Fibromyalgia (which I doubt).  I have shrunk almost an inch in the last  1 1/2 years but bone density is still in normal range.   I have a family history of  malignant melanoma moles.  I have recently had to have many moles removed.  All were atypical.  Two required re-excision for complete removal and one was severely displastic requiring a re-excision with  1 cm margins.  When I get my current stitches out,  I have to have yet another one removed.  I am so tired of being cut! (but recognize with my mother and uncle (twice) having melanoma and my sun-baked childhood at the beach this is what I have to do).    I also have about 1-1 1/2 inch long, narrow rubbery nodes under both arms and some on the sides of my neck (these are small bean and pea sized,  deep and firmer).  I am sorry this is so long, but I wanted to be thorough.  I suppose I should add that I'm 38 y o, female, ex-one pack/day smoker (quit Dec. 99).  Anyway, the short of this long post is that I don't know whether to wait or have this cervical node removed??  If you've read this far--thank you!  and if you have any advice it would be much appreciated.  I'm wonder if I've posting in the wrong topic.  If I have please advise me.  Thanks sincerely,  Anne L.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 20yr old female and I have had a small lump on the left side of the back of my neck(right below the hairline) for over a year. I am fairly sure my doctor told me it was a swollen lymph node when I got it checked (which was close to a year ago). Even though when I went to see my doctor it had already been there a month or more, he said it was nothing to worry about. The lump has not grown in size, but I am becoming increasingly concerned because if it was a swollen lymph node due to some infection, I would think for it to have shrunk or disappeared by now. Does anyone know what might be causing this and whether or not this is a serious symptom of something. Other than occassional stiff necks, I can not think of any other symptoms. Thank you for your time, I really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "title": "Daughter of Lymphoma Survivor... Found Swollen LN Behind Ear",
    "content": "(I had accidently posted this in the wrong forum, so if it looks familiar, that is why.  I've since remedied the mistake.)  First of all, I would like to say \"thank you\" to anyone who takes the time to read and/or reply to this post.  Also, I'd like to point out that I am making an appointment to see my GP.  However, it can take up to two weeks to get in to see her, I need some wise words in the meantime!   My father was diagnosed with Lymphoma about five years ago (and has survived).    Yesterday while my husband, two children and I were out to dinner, I swept my hair behind my ear and felt a large, hard bump there.  I researched what this lymph node could be called and I guess it's called \"postauricular\".  It is about (if I had to make a 'guess-timate') about 1/4 of an inch in diameter.  It hurts a bit to push on, but I have to push with pressure to get that reaction.  I guess I should point a few things out that may or may not have a part to play in this:    ~I have a bad cavity on the back, lower part of my left jaw.  The gum is slightly swollen around it.  ~I have three small (about the size of a pea) boo-boo's (for lack of a better word at 2.48 in the morning!   ) on the left side of my head (I'm a klutz... always whacking my head on a low-hanging cabinet).I am constantly scratching them by accident.  One of them has become sore and has a bit of an infection.  ~I have severe Tendonitis that goes from my left shoulder, up the left side of my neck and all the way down my arm.    ~I had a really bad sinus infection for about three weeks that I got over about a week ago.  I'm basically falling apart!     I have checked the rest of my body and there does not seem to be any other swollen lymph nodes at the moment.  The bottom line is I'm scared to death!  My father has suffered through this and I cannot help but be freaked out!  Also, in talking with my sister today, she has a hard lump in the exact same spot.  She's had it for about five years.  I have two small children (ages four and two) and I am I very frightened!   Not just for me, but for what this could possibly mean for them some day!\n\n",

I am glad to hear that he is doing well today, and it is understandable that you would be especially sensitive to any out-of-place lumps you may find.  It sounds like you have a strong grasp on the consequences of waiting for treatment, so I want to applaud you for reaching out to your physician so quickly.  I wish the wait weren't so long, so possibly you could start calling each morning to see if there are any cancellations that would let you be seen earlier?  Before you go to your physician, I would recommend writing down a list of what has been going on lately.  Any symptoms, any new swelling areas, anything that you have noticed that is out of place.  I would also recommend you write down a list of questions and concerns; and I would urge you to let your physician know about your father's lymphoma during this visit.  I wish you the best!

That's exactly what I did yesterday and I was seen by my GP.  I saw two GP's actually.  The first (my usual GP) seemed very distracted and rushed (she was the only GP in the office and was very busy).  She said that it was not Lymphoma.   However, I felt that something was missing from the exam, so my sister recommended her GP.    I was able to get in to see him this morning (just got back as a matter of fact).  He confirmed that it was not Lymphoma.  However, unlike my GP, he sat with me and explained exactly what Lymphoma consisted of and what to look for.  He gave me a full exam and gave me a 100% bill of health.   He also told me that I was right in getting it checked early because of my father's Lymphoma and I was correct to get a second opinion (I had explained my experience the day before).  So, again, I thank you for your concern and advice.  I now hope and pray for every person on this board that they may be as lucky as I have been!!!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thank you for hosting this very important and helpful forum!  I have a question about swollen lymph nodes. I have had swollen cervical lymph nodes for a few months now. Actually, they may have been there even longer, but I guess I just noticed them a few months ago. There are nodes on both sides of my neck, with the largest ones on the left side. An ultrasound showed the largest one to be 1.9 cm, with others between 1.4 and 1.6 cm. I even have a couple of palpable, but small, supraclavicular nodes (less than 1 cm, but clearly palpable) on the left side. The ultrasound results note that the nodes appear benign, but I understand that ultrasound is not a reliable method to evaluate lymphadenopathy.   I have been evaluated by a surgeon to consider biopsy. When the surgeon examined me he found bilateral axillary lymph nodes as well. He sent me for another ultrasound of the breasts and underarm area, which revealed a 1.4 cm node on the left side, and a 1.2cm node on the right. The surgeon did not seem particularly concerned, and said that if they do not grow he will not recommend biopsy, even if they do not get smaller and disappear. Does that sound like the right course of action? Btw - I'm a 33 year old female.\n\n",

I am not a physician, so I could not speculate on if this is the proper action or not, but it sounds like you have concerns regardless of propriety.  For that reason, I would like to recommend you seek a second opinion.  Perhaps another physician/surgeon would be more communicative with you about what is going on, and what course of actions might be taken.  I also want to recommend that you take a list of questions with you, so that you could open the dialogue between you and your new doctor.  I don't know if there will be a different outcome with a new physician, but sometimes all we need is that reassurance that we have taken all the steps necessary for the sake of our health.

This time, though, it has gotten bigger. It feels hard under the skin and soft on top.

The pain has gone to my back. It hurts to lift my arm and/or drive. Another thing is that I just found out I am pregnant yesterday for about 5 weeks and don't know if maybe that is why that node has come to spring. Please advise.\n\n",

Now, I'm not a physician, so this is not professional advice, but I wanted to tell you a bit about my personal experience.  Each month, for about the past five years as my hormones begin to surge, my underarms get tender.  I'm not positive that this is what is happening to you, but when I first asked my obgyn about it, he said that many women experience a similar pain.  I would recommend keeping an eye on any further 'developments', and certainly addressing these concerns with your physician at your exam in the next couple of weeks.  Meanwhile, if things get too painful, try applying a heating pad to the area, and make sure and keep a journal of this, and all the other \"Wonderful\" new pregnancy developments that are taking place.  Congratulations, and I wish you the best!!! Mary\n\n",

The ones in my neck get big and then smaller but never go away...sometimes my neck feels stiff because they swell so much.   I also have a tiny one down my neck almost on the bone from my shoulder (is this a lymph node too?). I am worried because it has been so long and they won't go away. doctors don't really give me any answers. I have epilepsy so I have many doctor appointments and this has kinda taken a back seat. advice would greatly be appreciated. Thank you so much for your time.... it is wonderful what you do to help people. Thanks.  - Krby84\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Krby!  Wow!  What a positive step for you to reach out for help as you have.  Nodes often swell to help the body deal with infection, and at times they don't return to their original size.  I'm not a physician, so I could not tell you exactly what's going on, but I would recommend being a bit more insistent with your concerns.  The next time you go to the doctor, come armed with a list of symptoms and any questions you have about these swelling nodes.  Let the doctor know just how much this concern is affecting your life, and hopefully they will take the time to sit down with you and address everything you have written out.  If this does not happen, you may need to find a separate physician to bring your concerns to.  Any time something 'strange' is happening in your body, you have the right to know what's going on.  I truly hope you find the answers you are seeking.  Best Wishes, Mary\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jo!  I wanted to begin by telling you that I'm sorry for what you and your daughter have gone through!  How scary it must be to have a child so sick, after already experiencing such losses in your family through cancer.    Although I am fairly certain that a diagnosis would not missing something such as lymphoma, I feel it would do you well (if for no other reason than peace of mind!) to seek a second opinion.  Since you have been instructed to follow up with your physician in ten days, I would recommend doing so, but you need to write out a list of concerns and questions to take with you.  If you feel as if your doctor is not giving enough attention to these very important concerns, than you need to seek out a new doctor.    Now, I'm not recommending you change your physician, only that for your sake (and your daughter's) it might be best to have a fresh pair of eyes.    I wish you the best, Mary  P.S. Have you or your daughter gone through any type of grief therapy for the losses you have experienced?  This is unrelated to your post, but after experiencing such devastating losses as you have, it may do you well to have help in processing your grief.  When I was a teenager, I lost several friends within a year, and had a difficult time dealing with the pain.  I never told my family how much I hurt, and became quite sick from the unrecognized \u2018stress\u2019 I was experiencing.  I\u2019m not saying by any means that this is what is happening with your daughter; only that therapy might help both of you work though some of your pain.\n\n",

I have been to doctors and none have really made that big a deal out of them.  Recently however I have noticed them a bit bigger and a few more.  I went to my Dr. and he immediatley ordered a blood test.  All my results were normal including my Sed rate.  He said that basically there is nothing abnormal going on in my body.  I have had some other tests throughout the years and they too have come back normal (kidney/pelvic x-rays, normal earing and eye stuff).    He sent me on my way and yet I am still somewhat concerned.  Do you think that what he did was enough and would those rates necessarily be high if it was serious?  Thanks\n\n",

I went to the doctor three times and have been given anti-inflamitory and anti-biotics, which have not helped.

The pain is experienced from my left arm pit down my arm and the knuckle under the middle finger is painful like artritis or something, but not to the touch. The pain is also felt a little bit in the chest area muscles right before the arm. I have not been bit by any insect or injured recently. Any thoughts?  Thanks Brian\n\n",

I can not offer any advice on what might be going on, but since you have not responded to antibiotics, or anti inflammatory medications, I would recommend going back to your doctor and requesting further diagnosis.  Possibly your doctor could order an x-ray, or a CT Scan so that you both could have a better 'picture' of what's going on.  Nodes swell as part of your body\u2019s natural defense against infection, and often can take time for the swelling to go back down.    If it feels as if your doctor is not giving the level of care you need for this concern, it may be necessary for you to seek a second opinion.  Possibly your doctor needs to make an effort to explain a bit more about what could be going on, and you may need to let him know that you need that explanation.  I urge you to make a list of questions, anything on your mind, to take with you to your next appointment.  Best Wishes, Mary\n\n",

It is pretty hard and not mobile. It seems to go up and down in size depending on times of year. I have allergies and in the Spring time it seems to swell up more than in the winter. I have also noticed that when I exercise the node usually goes down in size dramatically. I have no weight loss I have actually put on a lot of muscle weight since 7th grade to now going into my senior year of High School. I also don't get fatigued easily either and am in very good shape constantly staying active. So I'm curious if I should be worried about this or not? Thank you.\n\n",

If in the course of two weeks new lymph nodes appear or this one enlarges or you start having new symptoms you should get it checked out. If after two weeks are over it still remains the same size and has not decreased you should also get it examined.\n\n",

The cold was never really that bad, I think it was brought on by stress from going through the process of moving across the country.  Is there anything over the counter that you would recommend that may help?  I don't really feel sick at all, other than a constant drip and phlem.  I am not really sure if this an ear, nose, throat thing, or a gland thing...I'm just a bit of a worrier.\n\n",

Is there other parents who has been obsessive about lymph nodes like I ? I am conserned that the fact that I have been poking and squezing this node for a long time, has made the white blood cells inside make a mistake so he will get cancer ? Does the white blood cells split elsewhere in the body or only in the lymph nodes, I read somewhere that the white bloodcells are very sensitive, does that mean they turn cancerous very easily ?  The family doctor checked him several times and told med that it is normal for children his age.   Thanks.  A concerned Mom.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old male who has had no major illnesses, surgeries, or sickness until this past year.  I had an enlarged lymph node (2 cm)  removed behind my ear in February and it came back as benign.    Since then, I have been having faint chest bruising weekly to every two weeks.  It is usually just one to two bruises that show up.  It is always yellow, I never notice them purple or blue.  I went and got a physical in April got blood tests, etc.  All came back o.k.  Since April, I have continued to  have the chest bruising.  I now also have a soreness underneath my arm pits and slight chest pain on the left hand side (more pressure than pain).  I have also noticed several tiny red pinpoint dots on my body (2 on my left hand, one on my left forearm, one on my right hand, one on my right knee, one on my back, and one on my stomach).  They are pinpoint in size and do not fade when putting pressure on them.  They also have not gone away.  My general doctor thinks they are just spots that come along with age, but I have never noticed them until the bruising started.  I cannot get into a dermatoligist for another month.  I am extremely scared and wonder if I  am just crazy.  After all, just two short months ago, none of my blood work was out of line.  The monocyte range was 0-10 and mine came back as a 10.  That was the only boderline range.  I read on the internet some ranges for this can be 2.5 to 8.    Any advice would be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.  Chip\n\n",

    "title": "Swollen Lymph Node",
    "content": "I'll start from the begining to hopefully make it easier. I had lymph node come up on the back right side of my head a little over a year ago. It was close to my mastoid bone, according to some illustrations possibly postauricular or occipital. It was probably the size of a peanut and quite hard and painful. It would come up and go down in a matter of minutes. I went to two different doctors who said it was probably a infection and one prescribed me Doxycyclene, and the node went down about a week later and it didn't return for about six months. When it returned six months ago, I just got my prescription of Doxycyclene refilled, and the node went down about a week later. It is still larger than the one on the other side of my head. However, it is no larger than 1/2 centimeter. I had shaved my head the night before each time the node enlarged. Is it possible that had something to do with it?  Anyway, now i'll move to the present. A couple of weeks ago I went for a physcal, and the doctor said I had a swollen lymph node on the right side of my neck. I had a sore throat around a month earlier, and I have allergies so I keep alot of sinus drainage. He advised me just to keep a check on it, and come back in four weeks. Well, every since then I've constantly been feeling my neck. When I extend my head backward I can see the lymph node, but otherwise it is unnoticable. It also feels like the size of peanut or bean. It feels hard, but it insn't irregular in shape, it is extremely moveable, but it isn't sore. I also found a small node behind my left ear, that is smaller than 1/2 centimeter. My throat started to fill a little raw, so I went to another doctor about a week later. He said my throat was a little red, and the lymph in my throat was a little swollen. He gave me a shot for my allergies and some sample of Zyrtec. He said he thought the node was just viral and nothing to worry about. However, I voiced my concerns and he done a cbc and cmp for bloodwork. He also done a chest x-ray, and a E.K.G. The e.k.g was due to my high blood pressure. The tests all came back normal. Do you think I should listen to the doctor, and quit mashing on my neck every couple of minutes or go to another doctor? The node has been there for two weeks now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi CrimsonLegacy, I understand your concern that this maybe something more serious than your doctors are saying. However, in performing their normal function of defending against infection and inflammation, lymph nodes tend to enlarge. In that sense I think it is very probable that your shaving had something to do with it. As long as you have been examined and were cleared by a doctor I think you have nothing to worry about.  You should only seek his attention if the lymph nodes enlarge in size or new lymph nodes arise in the coming few months.\n\n",

I could tell by the look on his face that he did not like the way it felt.  I asked him if it should feel like that?  He said...No.  He then said to come back in two weeks and then he'll look at it and take care of it then. All of my lymph nodes have been large for the past six months.  I know he is waiting because I've had some other health issues going on and he thinks I can't deal with anymore at this time. I'm just going crazy thinking about what it could be.  I told my husband that I think it's cancer and he's saying it's not.  Could it be anything else?\n\n",

Your lymph nodes....-or we can say \"generalized lymphadenopathy\"  -because you have lymph nodes in several lymph node groups all over your body.....are most probably due to that chemical exposure you've had...but it depends on how serious that chemical substance can affect your system,its dose and since how long has been that exposure (6 months?).

    "content": "TO anyone that may have som answers: I am an 18 year old female and have always been relatively healthy; however, a couple of days aog, I found a hard lyump under my armpit that is about the size of an m&m hurt when I first pressed on it, but now, it no longer pains me that much to pressure it. It literally appearned ovre night as I am always checking my armpits and breasts for signs of cancer and hait has no disocoloration to it. To add, in the past, I have experienced many little bumps that have appearned on my groin area and thigh area and also the armpit area, but have all gone away and gradually gotten smaller by day. This bump does not appare to be gettin gsmaller  .  Any informatino would be GREATLY appreciated! edit: I'm sorry for all the spelling errors; my server for some reason is distorting the webpage nad hence I can't reada what I'm typing...but back to the topic, I'm really worried...is that bump a real sign of cancer?\n\n",

    "title": "Lump under arm",
    "content": "Hello Friend, Based on your description, I feel confident in saying it is more than likely an ingrown hair follicle, esp w/ the rapid onset. This is nothing more than an infected follicle that will heal by itself or if too bothersome, you can pinch the area to force it to come to a head same as a facial pimple and use tweezers (dip in alcohol first) to withdraw the hair which has more than likely encircled itself in the lump. As far as prevention, get some facial scrub like Neutrogena scrub and vigorously scrub under arms and bikini line area twice a week. If you notice any ingrowns hairs, you can attempt to squeeze and pluck them out and they will then heal spontaneoulsly. If you happen to be waxing, this practice actually promotes the problem, but can be treated as above. In the event that it enlarges and does not appear to be infectious in origin, you may consider visiting your PCP or dermatologist. If you are able to move the lump and it does not seem to be securely rooted in place, it should subside on its own.  In the event that you are continuously afflicted with these complaints, may want to ask your dr about a low dose antibiotic such as tetracycline, esp if facial area is also involved. Good luck and LMK if you require addtional info.\n\n",

    "title": "Lump on head, new lump in neck.",
    "content": "About 2 months ago I noticed a small hard lump on the back of my head. It's about even with the top of my ear and about half way between my ear and the center of my head. A couple of weeks later I started getting headaches almost every day that were usually throbbing and generally radiated from the back of my head forward. I went to see my doctor who briefly felt the lump and said that it was nothing to worry about and probably a cyst. I had a skull/sinus x-ray as he suspected sinusitis as a cause for the headaches. Now that the headaches have gone away I'm not longer concerned about them but I recently (4 or 5 days ago) noticed 3 hard, small lumps on the left side of my neck (about 2 inches up from my collarbone, all seem to be on my trapezius). Two of them are on the back, one right above the other, and the other is on the front. The one in the front I am able to hold in between my fingers and is very mobile. The two on the back are identical and feel just like little bumps underneath the skin. And like I said earlier, they are all fairly hard.  How big does a lymph node need to be in this area to be considered enlarged?  The reason all this has me concerned is that from what I've read on the internet masses in that area of the neck are not very common and usually malignant. I've also read that the scalp is the area that drains to these lymph nodes. Is there a possibility that the bump on my head wasn't a cyst and is actually a hardened lymph node and that it has drained into this new spot?  Like I've read in so many other posts I'm constantly worried. It seems as though once I finally put one concern behind me another one presents itself...sometimes resurfacing some of my old concerns.\n\n",

He feels that all of them (including the bump on the back of my head) are glands. He could tell I was worried and said that he was almost positive it wasn't cancer. I got a blood test done today to see if it could be mono (my brother has it) so I'm waiting for those results. He also said that if I was really worried about it he's sure my regular doctor would be able to do a biopsy.  I have an appointment with my regular family doctor this Friday so I'll ask for the CT scan then. Do these kind of lumps sound suspicious to you or is there a good chance they have come from some sort of scalp infection or something else?? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "My dad called the doctor (I think I forgot to mention that I'm only 18) and asked about the blood test. Everything showed up completely normal and I do not have mono. Haha, I think this is the only time in my life I would have been disappointed that I don't have mono! Anyway, he was talking to my dad and basically said that he certainly doesn't believe it is cancer and that if it was up to him he would wait a month to see if they go down, but that sometimes a biopsy is necessary to calm the anxiety. I'm happy to say that he's been really helpful, even though he is not my regular family physician he said that if I wanted to go through him he could arrange for a surgeon to perform it or I could go through my regular doctor if I preferred. Unfortunately CT scans here in Canada aren't exactly a simple process and I have a feeling that if I asked for one my situation wouldn't exactly be considered urgent and I could end up waiting at least a month anyway. I'll talk to my doctor about it and if he really doesn't feel the biopsy is necessary at this point my parents said they'll drive me over to USA (I live on a border city) to pay to get the scan done. I noticed yesterday that my scalp is mildly irritated and red on the left side...lets keep our fingers crossed for a scalp infection. Thanks for listening.\n\n",

    "content": "5 nights ago I woke up in the middle of the night with sharp pain in my neck. i reached to feel my neck and noticed a lump under the skin on the right side of my neck, near the center at the hairline. the next morning i went to the doctor to have the lump examined. she found what appears to be a spider bite about  2 inches below the lump. she said that the lump was probably a swollen lymph node in reaction to the spider bite and put me on cephalexin antibiotics. she said it should clear up in about 5-7 days. it has been 5 days and although the pain is less severe (during the first few days I could barely turn my head and would wince if i touched the lump) the lump is still there and relatively painful (I can tough it lightly but if i press on it is is painful). the \"spider bite\" is also still on the back of my neck but it seems to be getting smaller every day. it is a purple raised bump with what looks like a scab in the center. i have been taking 500 mg. of cephalexin 4 times a day but it doesnt seem to be doing the trick. could the gland have reacted to some spider venom and not bacteria?  my question is what else could this lump be? it has been 5 days and it is not healed. if it is a swollen gland in reaction to the spider bite, how long will it take to not be painful? how long will it take not to be swollen anymone?  thank you so much for any help you can give me.\n\n",

It'll take time to resolve especially when the antibiotics are not doing you any good...just give it time for the immune system to get rid of it . As long as you're not getting worse then you are on the right track. You can ask for  a complete blood count to check if the spider bite had caused any inflammation... that's if you are getting worse.   I am sure the lump is from the bite...since it's nearly next to it.  Keep checking it out and keep me updated, Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "I know you all are as sick of hearing about my issues, as I am in having them...  I saw the Doctor (again) on Tuesday (May 24). The one who had my lab work done.  He said the labs looked good. We were both especially relieved to see the HIV NEGATIVE results in black and white.  He examined me again, and we discussed the mass (node?) in my neck.  I reminded him that a couple of days before the node appeared (back in early April), I had a SEVERE (like swallowing razor blades) sore throat (both me and my partner did), after talking with a man & wife from West Virginia who were visiting California despite obvious and severe cold/flu type symptoms. The sore throat that my partner and I experienced was particularly bad at night and included mild fevers, chills and seemed to resolve quickly (36 hours +/-). It was after this that I first NOTICED the swollen node/mass.  He said that was good news in favor of my node just being reactive.  I thought I had told him this before, but I guess he forgot.  I feel so flustered in Doctor's offices and I generally just blurt out all the things I've been thinking about and try to squeeze in as many questions as possible. This system we have for patient care has room for improvement.  Anyway, I told him I was sick that day too! (Tues, May 24). I had been (at that time) sick for about 5 days, with serious and unrelenting sinus pain, nasal drip, sneezing, and pronounced, unforgiving coughing (especially when trying to fall asleep), and mild fevers. (All since resolved 95% with only a postnasal drip and minor sinus congestion remaining).  He was completely disinterested in my current symptoms.  He said the next step was to have the node removed and analyzed. Then he asked if we had done any imaging and I reminded him that he hadn't ordered anything. He said, OK, that would be first.  So, now I am trying to get the insurance approvals, etc for an MRI. (w & w/out contrast) that he Rx'd.  Then, on FRI. (May 27), I kept an appt I had a few weeks ago to see a General Surgeon locally.  I half expected him to dismiss me as being absurd; especially since, to me, the node was still feeling like it was getting a little bit smaller (SLOWLY!!).  Well, he didn't. He said this is very serious. He said he is almost sure it is some sort of cancer... Said that more often than not, this type of single node is related to a head, neck or throat cancer.  He ordered a CT of the \"Soft Tissue, Neck\", Chest & Abdomen.  Said because of my weight (about 60 to 80 lbs heavy), that there may be dozens of nodes we can't see or feel. Said, because of my weight that I likely have had this node/mass in my neck for a long time and just didn't ever notice it.  Wrote on the work order the following:  \"Enlarged LM\" \"Right, anterior cervical triangle\" \"r/o chest, abd, neck lymphodeophy\"  He stated that he doubts very seriously it is Lymphoma since he can\u2019t feel any other nodes, and since I don\u2019t use tobacco, and I\u2019m only 36 he said it is unlikely to be Lymphoma.  He said that a single node like this usually means that I have mouth cancer, neck cancer, esophageal cancer, larynx cancer, etc. He looked in my mouth and said one tonsil looks bigger then the other.  So, of course, now I am having a TOTAL MELTDOWN!   One day, I feel like it's getting smaller, and going to be gone in a few days and I can laugh about it...The next I am afraid I will be dead in 6 months.   QUESTION 1:  I can likely only get one of the two imaging orders preapproved from insurance. (And the hospital will ONLY book an appt if it's preauthorized!).  Based on all the facts, which one should I do..?  Also, I am so unhappy with the medical community where I live (the closest Dr is 30 minutes away), and even that is in a rural area with a population of 1,000. The hospital here is small, and always has a week plus wait for MRI or CT.  I can drive in to the city (San Francisco) but it's 4 hours each way. I have found a specialist (Head & Neck surgeon) who seems to be well respected in the city. According to his profile he specializes in diseases of the neck and cancers in particular.  But, I can't make several trips to the city, especially overnight ones, unless it is mandatory to my survival.  I have made a tentative appt with this new Dr in the city for about 2 weeks from now. He doesn't accept my PPO, but said they will help me get reimbursed (I'm guessing about 50%), but who cares about a few hundred $. Said that if I need surgery that would be in the hospital so anesthesia, room, meds, etc would be covered by insurance since the hospital of course takes my insurance. So, I don't mind paying the surgeon out of pocket his fees directly, (guessing maybe up to $ 2 or 3,000?), and trying to get up to half back.  Before I leave to see him, I would think he would want to have CT or MRI with me for best diagnosis. Which one should I do..? I can't stay in the city for more than about 24 to 36, maybe 48 hours, so I need to plan ahead and maximize my time there.  Of course, if it is cancer, etc and I need to do chemo or radiation to save my life, etc I will make drastic changes (hire extra staff etc) at whatever long term damage to my finances there is. But, I need to pace myself for time away for now, in case I do need to do these things like radiation and my life might depend on being able to be away for a day or two weekly or whatever.  QUESTION 2: Whatever it is, will waiting for 2 more weeks have any negative repercussions..?  QUESTION 3: I understand from research that lymphomas rarely show any evidence on blood work. That they typically present as one, enlarged node, especially in the neck, that is hard, non-movable, large (greater than 1.5cm x 1.5cm) and non-tender. (All of which apply to me). But, for other cancers, is this also true. In other words, is there any comfort in the lab results showing nothing abnormal when considering other cancers of the head, neck, etc..?  QUESTION 4: If it is some other type of cancer, I gather from research that the prognosis is much worse than if it is Lymphoma, with only a slight chance of long-term survival. Where can I find statistics about the chance of survival..?  I am beginning to hate my new life. I wake up every morning and pray that it was all just a bad nightmare. I am already sick of Doctors and Doctor\u2019s offices.  There is NOTHING comforting, nurturing, calming or supportive about a Dr's visit. The offices are always drab, poorly light in fluorescent bulbs, cold unfriendly surfaces, matter-of-fact clinical feeling. And the irony is, despite all this posturing, I've been to 4 Dr's now, and still no real information.  Thank you for taking the time to read my information.  - Michael\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Michaelii,  Well, so that i wouldn't  forget anything...let me answer your questions one by one:-  Q1: get a CT for the head and neck done ... it's simple,diagnostic and less expensive... if he found an abnormality that he cannot distinguish with CT...he'll order MRI by himself.  Q2:waiting for 2 more weeks is not hazardous...you've already waited for months and nothing serious has happened to you.  I just want to add that... having chronic sinus problems....one big tonsil and all these ENT  problems are better checked out by an ENT specialist...that will save you a lot of fuss...ENT are surgeons as well... let him examine you...and if he feels that the enlarged tonsil is query...he'll remove it and have it analyzed so you can call this a biopsy as well. It'll be beneficial to have that CT scan of head and neck done.  Q3:blood results are a good negative test where some of them are indicative for the bulk of a tumor...for an example like LDH enzyme, and if all of your blood counts,chemistry  and enzymes are already normal...then it's highly suggestive that you are....or else the human body would have manifested his objection of having a tumor in one way or another.... you cannot be perfectly free and have no blood abnormality!!....but at the same time no one can promise...there are  cases which breaks the rules.  Q4:if it is ....God FOrbids ....any kind of cancer...don't look for statistics and follow your doctor's regimen for treatment.. you'll only get yourself exhausted and more stressed out...and you'll make your doctor more confused ....  you can then take our opinion here about your therapy (IF IT WAS PROVEN YOU HAVE CANCER) .... We have BRILLIANT oncology (cancer) doctors on the site....  PLEASE DON'T JUMP INTO CONCLUSIONS!   Please visit an ENT doctor (he's a surgeon at the same time) tell him about your sinus  and nose problems,the lymph node and your enlarged tonsil....show him the CT scan.   I am sure everything will get sorted out very soon...just be patient dear and we are all here for you    Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "As always, thank you!!!!!!!  I just confirmed my CT appt (w & w/out contrast) of the head, neck and abdomen for Thurs at the local hospital.  I also revisited the surgeon I saw on Friday (the one that said he \"sure it must be cancer\"), and he said he wants to do an FNA on Fri. I asked why bother since they are inconclusive and he said that there is a new lab at Stanford which can look for Lympocites or something, so I said \"OK\". *(any idea what he means &/or is thinking?)  Then, on Monday (june6) I'll go see a new Dr, this time the Head & Neck Specialist in the big city with my CT results, and possibly some findings for the FNA..(???)  I'n the meantime I still have significant postnasal drip and I think I mentioned before, two of my staff have tested positive last week for having Mono. I am thinking along these lines for now, and mentally accepting the FNA (&/or biopsy) as simply being safe vs sorry to rule cancer out.  But, (and maybe all of this is TOTAL DENIAL??) I feel fine. No other symptoms whatsoever and as you know all my CBC etc was normal, plus, today the node DOES feel a bit smaller (even the surgeon today said it is a tiny bit smaller and softer), so I am just taking one day at a time.  Maybe I am manic-depressive and this is just my manic phase ...But I just don't accept that this is cancer...hopeully I'll be right since I've physched myself into believeing it must be something benign, a malignancy pathology report would send me into deep shock!  Thoughts are always appreciated!!  - Michael\n\n",

    "title": "NOW WHAT?",
    "content": "Ok, so today I went to the surgeon for the FNA.  The Dr had to poke me 5 times!!  Each time he got ONLY blood (What he called \"Old Blood\"..??)  After the first one he mubled, \"Dude, you've got a cyst\"..(?)  He did some smears on the microscope slides (I don't think ANY of it took! It was smeared with my blood, and NO cells made it I'm sure!!!) Maybe I could be totally wrong, but none of the stuff he took out of neck made it to any of the 6 slides he preparred.  He said he was concerned it was vascular...(?)..So I said, Like an anyurism? I thought that's what it was all along since it was/is so pulsatile.  He said \"yeah, maybe\"...\"I am very confused and baffled\"..\"I am very very puzzled\"...  He said, I want you to go the hospital IMMEDIATELY. I'll meet you there in the ER.  So, now myself being baffled, I did just that...  Turns out, he ordered an Ultrasound.  The technician took about 45 minutes with the ultrasound on my neck, probing and proding. She said it was a brand new one, latest and greatest. Anyway, the radiologist (A Dr) came in and said ...\" looks like lymph nodeS to me\"   I said NodeS, plural? He said yeah, a couple of them...  I said, well, I am concerend about it being vascular in nature and/or some type of lymphoma, or malignant neoplasm. He said, yeah, he can understand that, but based on their location and the fact that they look like they aren't on the jugular(?) he thinks they are \"just nodes\"..  So, now my neck is VERY sore. The mass, whatever it is, is extremely tender and feels like a bruise would feel. PLUS, it is about 25% larger, noticable by just looking at me, and much more pulsatile.  I am still having the CT for tomorrow, but the Radiologist Dr said not to bother with the abdomen, chest or head CT's and not to drink the barium contrast they gave me.  He said they will just do the neck CT now.  I called the Dr that tried the FNA today and his office closed early, I never saw him at the hospital.  I am SOOOOO CONFUSED NOW!  What, if anything, does ANY of this mean?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Michaelii....  It's a good call for the FNAC doctor to order the Ultrasound. They excluded an aneurysm.. you can feel it's pulsatile because you were anxious...not because it's really pulsatile in nature...only a surgeon or a skilled internist can differentiate a pulsatile mass from vigorous pulsations out of anxiety.  Ofcourse your neck will be sore for a few days...you've been punctured more than 5 times...and it's tender because you are bruised from the punctures. You can feel it's getting bigger because blood has accumulated around it and clotted (from the FNAC attempts) so you can feel it bigger,tender and sore.  The Ultrasound showed multiple nodes but not on the jugular... it depends on their site ,size,consistency and shape to determine if they're malignant or inflammatory...or even significant of any other disease.   Next step is to do the CT of the neck...and preferrably a LDH enzyme level in the blood which reflects the bulk of the lymph nodes IF we are suspecting any affection.  So waiting to hear about the CT scan results, Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "CT Scan Results",
    "content": "I just got back from the CT scan. The radiologist (Dr) said it looked like a node, or maybe 2 swollen.  I asked if he thought it was malignant, and he said he had no idea. He said he looked for other cancer (I presume looking for a \"primary\" in case the cytology comes back positive.)   He said he didn't see anything else that looked alarming. He said it looks like the node(s) are filled with blood/fluid and they did the CT w & w/out contrast.  I asked him if what he was thinking, and he said that \"Maybe Lymphoma\" ...\"Since it is so abnormally large...\" (I forgot to ask the exact dimensions). He said, if so, Lymphoma is very treatable (I am optimistic on this since I don't yet have any \"B\" type symptoms.)  He was a little somber sounding, but did offer that since I had a sore throat prior to the appearance of the node, that it lends itself more to a reactive node.  (I think I did, jeeze, it's all becoming a blur now, maybe I just remembered it that way as a form of denial or something..?).  I will ask the size tomorrow when I go to pickup the films after he's dictated the findings.  Also, the lab has no news on the pathology report from the FNA done yesterday. They \"might\" have a prelim tomorrow, and the surgeon promises a call if so.  The hospital lab said it looks like Tues before they have any results.  I revisited the surgeon who did the 5 poke FNA yesterday and discussed the Ultrasound and CT findings. He said again it looked like \"old blood\" when he tried to do the FNA.  I asked for his thoughts, and he said he hasn\u2019t any.   I asked if he would do some more blood labs to rule out things like Mono, etc. I specifically asked him if we could do an LDH enzyme level. He said, \"Let's just wait and see what happens\".  I get so frustrated. On one hand, Drs order things willy-nilly with wanton abandon for the cost or financial repercussions, but when a patient wants a specific test, forget about it!  He said, the next step, if the FNA comes back inconclusive, is to do another FNA at the hospital, this time performed by the Radiologist, using CT or Ultrasound to help locate the node (site) for the FNA.  I think I am ready to just have it removed in an excisional biopsy. The FNA was VERY painful, and I am sick of all the guessing without any results, and such non-committal medical people.  I thought since all he got was \"old blood\" that this was good in a way. Guess I am grasping at straws. When I talked to the surgeon again today, he did say that it was \"softer in there than he thought once he stuck the needle in there and felt it with the needle\"..? Whatever that means?!!?  Aren't reactive nodes supposed to be filled with Lymph fluid though? Isn't it bad that it was like \u201cold blood\u201d on the FNA?  I am still planning a 4-hour trip on Monday with the new Dr, and ENT, and surgeon of the Head, Neck & Throat who has a sub-specialty in oncology. Hopefully he will shed some light on things, and no doubt will want to see the lab results, film, etc to date.   Symptomatically, all I have is a very slight (barely perceptible sore throat), and minor postnasal drip, with occasional (2 to 3 per day) sneezing fits (5 to 6 sneezes), and NO OTHER symptoms.  NO abdominal pains, no ear aches, no hip pain, no fevers, no night sweats, no itching, no eczema, no other pain (except for the site where he did the FNA, which is still HUGE very pulsatile (visably from the front) and tender)  Thoughts, as always, appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Later on Monday I visited the ENT.  He did a laryngoscope & said everything looked \"normal\"   He said the ulcer on my tongue was not alarming.  Ears looked fine.  Sore throat not alarming.  He said the node IS alarming.  (Or NodeS as per the radiologist's reports)  When forced to \"guess\" he said he best guess would be lymphoma.  I asked him (the ENT) if I should have an excisional biopsy done of the node and/or tongue lesion. He said not at this point. He said the node (or nodes) may \"have to come out eventually\" but it would not be necessary at this point.  I asked what stage (I, II, III, IV, etc) he would guess my Lymphoma being in, if he had to guess, and IF it turns out to be Lymphoma. I asked this based on the fact that the first 5 pass FNA was so inconclusive would this point to a less aggressive or less invasive Lymphoma if that's what it is, and he said not necessarily. He said staging is a complicated process, done with an Oncologist and not something he could guess about.  I asked him about the pathology report for the FNA done a few days earlier and he said it means NOTHING. (Is that true?)  He said that the next step would be to have another FNA. I protested saying that they are inconclusive and unreliable.   He agreed, BUT, said that around the corner was the BEST FNA clinic in the world. They almost never ever miss a diagnosis. The UCSF FNA medical center. An entire center dedicated to the art and science of FNA!  So, we hurriedly wrapped up our session and scooted off to the UCSF FNA clinic.  There, the staff was amazing! Professional. Competent. Thorough.  Clean, relaxing offices. Tranquil decor. Pleasant and hygienic procedure rooms.  A Dr did two \"pulls\" and studied them under the scope, RIGHT THERE!  He said it didn't look like lymphoma at first glance (using the fairly inaccurate \"quik stain\" method), and that it \"...looked maybe cystic in nature..\"  He said that they wanted to pull enough sample to be sure he had enough cells for cytology Or flow symmetry or something), and pulled another sample. He studied this also, RIGHT THERE!  Extra slides were setup for distribution to a more detailed lab (flow symmetry, cytology?,  etc?)  The FNA Dr said he wanted to be sure to get enough before I left, so he called the head of his dept in. She was amazing also!  She made one more pull, this time from the front angle to get a different sample. As she pulled, he commented to her....\"..Looks cystic..\", she said, \"..no, I think infection...I see some puss..\"  (Of course, that sounds good to me!! But, then again the puss could be a by-product of the previous 5 stabs FNA the local surgeon tried on me 4 days earlier)  They both agreed that they had enough cells to get a clear diagnosis.  After, I asked the Dr what he thought. He said:  - Infection - Lymphoma (Hodgkin\u2019s or Non-Hodgkins) - Squamous Cell Carcinoma  In that order.  My question (as if I only have ONE!)  is about the later. I have only briefly heard about it. I thought it was associated more with tobacco use?  It is not as treatable as Lymphoma from what I understand.  Could it be related to the lesion on my tongue that the ENT dismissed as not being cause for concern..?  Finally, on another, hopefully unrelated note; I have had back pain in the same general area (under my left shoulder blade (scapula?) ) for about 2 weeks now. It is intermittent, and maybe a 3 or 4 on a 1 to 10 scale at it's worse. The node in question is on the right side of my neck. Does this sound related? Or could it just be stress/obesity/not sleeping right, etc? It only bothers me for a cumulative total of about 3 to 4 hours each day, sometimes I go an entire afternoon without noticing any pain or even remembering about it.  When I rub it, it does seem to help and my posture seems to make a difference (ie: slouching, or sitting in the car, etc seem to aggravate it more).  Well...That's it for now...as always, feedback is appreciated!!!!!!!!!!\n\n",

Let's wait and see what the new FNAC will say...don't jump into conclusions!! you are really stressing out yourself for nothing... wait till you have evident data in your hands and we can start treatment from there...  Don't just make hypothesis and build up things on no ground basis...this is really very tiring for you.  I'm a little bit worried though about your tongue lesion....how long has it been there? and did he check the lymph node circle of your pharynx...it's called Waldeyer's circle ...u cannot see it yourself because it's an imaginary circle rather than a drawn one  ... but a good ENT would have checked it...I am sure he did but never told ya?  tell me the FNAC results when they're out.

    "content": "looks like the primary is most likely in one of my tonsils, and they found a 2nd swollen lymph on the 1st ct.  That means T2N4 Stage 4!  Plus, I saw the chest X-ray. It had a whte dot on the right side, kinda star shaped with white feathery lines branching out to the edge.  Pretty sure that means it has already spead to my lungs.  Which would be a lot worse than Stage 4, but I don't even know what comes after that.  From what I can fiind, I have a less than 1% chance of 5 year survival.  I had chest pain last night which kept me up all night long, so I am terribly sleep deprived.  I feel exhausted and lost and I haven't even started any treatments yet.  IF there is any chance of any survival my quality of life will never been close to the same, assuming I beat all the odds by 99% .  We're talking Radical Neck Disectomy. Serious radiation and chemo, and I don't even KNOW what they might do (if there's anything they can do) about the possible invasion into my lung(s)...Can a person live with one lung?   I've read about Toma imaging / radiation therapy which pinpoints the radiation but I'm guessing it's more marketing gimmicks than true advances in tx.  Also, I've read about gene therapies, but again, I'm just grasping at straws.\n\n",

You are a very strong woman and i am sure you can go through this with a little help from friends and great doctors and by choosing the appropriate management which you are having a hard time choosing one as i can see.  It is great that you have had a PET Scan to determine that there are no further metastasis going on. It is a very sensitive and very expensive investigation.  All what the doctors say make sense...BUT....let's try to see what suits you as well.  You should definately remove the tonsils...that's for sure...both of them not only one.... then Radiation and chemotherapy.  I don't think Radical neck dissection in your condition would be of benefit if not the same to radio and chemo therapy's outcome.  you can try chemo and radio without tonsillectiomy but it's always preferrable to remove the primary if you know what i mean.   So tell me how things go...we are here for you .....and I want to tell you something... I know what books write about chances for survival ,etc....but miracles always happen to whom have faith in God and believing in his mighty powers.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "i have a plan...",
    "content": "I know a positive attitude is essential in every study I read and everyone I talk to so maybe the Dr's telling me 50 to 70% survival chance are using inflated odds to improve the odds?  Here's why I am concerned:  I've read that people under 40, in no other risk groups who get this (ie: \"me\"), usually have a much more agressive neoplasm. This is what I've heard from a couple of sources...So, maybe the Dr with the 70% odds he's using, for his outlook; has demographics of generally older patients who smoke, etc who don't have such an agressive version.  4 ENT's & 1 Oncological Surgeon have said 50-50 chance of 5 year survival.  There's tremendous consistency in that number...It's also a \"safe\" bet, meaning whatever happends, they are right..   But, maybe there's some code out there that say's \"if the patient has less than 50% chance, tell them 50-50 just to keep them sane..\", or maybe that's what they say when they don't really know.  That is the bottom line after all. They DON'T really know. No one does, and that's the problem with statistics.  I have this mental block about all the 50-50 projections, I feel like I would be measurably more resolved if they would have all said 55 or 60% chance...Crazy huh?  But, again, that's what following statistics is...\"CRAZY\". None of us is a statistic.  SO...I've decided.  I'm 36 DAMNIT! I'm a healthy male (other than the whole \"cancer thing\"  )  I'm not going to fall into the crowd on the failing side of the 50%.   I've got way too much life left in me and too much to live for.  Just do me a favor everyone, on those days in the future when I forget this, please give me a gentle reminder    Now for my plan:  1) Radical Tonsilectomy  & Modified Radical Neck Dissection  next week 5 hour surgery! (Please keep me in your prayers that day)   Top ENT Surgeon @ Stanford  2) 2 weeks of recovery at our resort my partner and I own on the North Coast. We'll work on getting computers setup, phones forwarded, systems in place, people trained, hired etc for our absense.  3) Right after our busy July 4th weekend, we'll leave for So Cal where we have a home and all our familes and lots of friends live, to start Radiation/Chemo, maybe using one of two new drugs in combination, Motexafin Gadolinium &/or Proxinium, and possibly Erbitux. This will likely be a six week cycle. This will be supervised by the Stanford team and administered by a great local oncologist (the 70% guy!!). Friends and family will help my parter and I run our resort remotely (as much as possible), and help me with trips to radiation and chemo, and meals, chores, etc. Every weekend or two, my parter (me too when I'm feeling up to it), will run up there and check things out in person (9 hour drive each way!  ) Returning to be back in time for the next radiation treatment. Family will stay at the place occassionally to check on the employees, releave people, etc.  The radiation I plan to use is the new TomoTherapy. I've read a ton about it. It's not available up North, and my charts are being reviewed by the chief of radiology at one of the installations now. He said it is brand new and they plan to use it on a lot of H&N cancers.  Okay, so that's the plan. There's a chance they won't get it all on surgery. There's a chance they won't get it all with radiation/chemo, and there's an ugly chance it will return with a vengence! But, I'll be ready..!!  I have several other things up my sleeve, like Gendicine, Avenox and more ideas.  Plus, I'm radically changing my diet to be \"cancer resistent\".  I've gone 8 days now with ZERO coffee or caffeine! (Unbelieveable I was a total espresso junkie 2 weeks ago)  I am going to be more active, exercise and be overall healthy.  Plus, everyday I am going to visualize my body eating up all the cancer cells (my Dr (from Stanford!!) actually suggested this!!!!)    That's the plan...! Help me stick with it!  I feel so connected to all of you. Thank you for all the inspiration, prayers and good wishes.  Hopefully, my surgery will go smooth, and they will find good results in the biopsies (ie: Little tissue involvement, no spreading, clean small margins, and no other nodes.)  Sorry for the LONG post   PS: I am going to move my discussion to the HEAD AND NECK category, with a copy of the above since we know now that it didn't turn out to be Lymphoma.\n\n",

They seem really big to me but she said that they were not that large. I have some  intermittent teeth pain but the dentist said that there was nothing wrong with my teeth. It only occurs very rarely. I have no other symptoms except for allergies. I occasionally smoke and drink and didn't konw if this caused that. I have a complete blood test done and everything is totally normal. My doctor put me on antibiotics and nothing has changed. my ears are a little better but still very itchy and red. I just moved so I am not in the same place as my doctor and was wondering what i should do. I am scared to go back to the doctor because i don't want bad news. I can't really tell but they do not appear to be growing at all and I touch them a lot which  I know can make them bigger. what do you think?\n\n",

Try some cortsone cream (you can get it over the counter) and use that a couple times a day.  It will probably get rid of the problem, although it can come back. Antibiotics won't help skin allergies; only the ear infection itself.  The teeth pain if the upper teeth, could possibly be a maxillary sinus involvement.

I'm not sure if these are lymph nodes or not. If it is a node, then I'm guessing it could be from my sinus infection/sore throat/ eye infection? I'm really kind of freaked out, but I guess it could be caused by the sore throat and infections I have. I also have small masses on my collar bone, 1 on each side. Also, I am having breathing problems and some fatigue, but my doctor said the breathing problems are because the drainage from my sinuses down into my throat. So basically my question is, are these masses (nodes) caused by my infections or something else?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I finished up my antibiotics about 3 weeks ago, and since then I have been to the doctor so he could check the nodes under my chin and on my neck and he says everything is fine, and that its caused by my continuous sinus problems and allergies. Well I noticed my nodes havent been getting any smaller, or bigger, (I really cant tell if they are much bigger). I also noticed nodes above my collar bone are swollen (just below my shoulders). The ones near my shoulders hurt a little if I move them a certain way when I feel them. Sometimes the node under my chin is painful. When should I go back to the doctor if my nodes havent gotten smaller? Also I had a blood test and a thyroid test and everything was normal.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 26. I've had generalized lymph node swelling in my head and neck for a year and a half.  I had a bad case of mono when I was 18, and the cervical lymph nodes along the back/side of my neck had been palpable ever since.  A year and a half ago these nodes, in addition to the nodes behind both ears and on the back of my head, swelled noticably and painfully.  I went to the doctor freaked out that I had lymphoma.  The doctor noticed some sores on my scalp, cultured them, found bacterial infection, put me on antibiotics and sleeping pills, and sent me home.  The node swelling went down, but not completely. Two months later the nodes came back fully swollen.  I went to a new doctor who put me back on antibiotics and also put me on meds for anxiety.  That was about a year ago.  Since then, my lymph nodes on the back/sides of my neck have always been palpable and swell noticeably when I have a cold/flu.    This spring the nodes swelled up huge again.  Yet another doctor checked my scalp, cultured a sore, and found an infection.  She put me on antibiotics.  To see if the lymph node swelling my have another underlying cause, she also did a CBC, some kind of liver-related blood test (?), a TB test, a chest x-ray, and checked for Epstin Barr.  All these tests came back normal.  After two weeks on antibiotics, the scalp infection was gone.  Two months later, my lymph nodes are still swollen.  I'm worried about lymphoma, so she did a fine-needle biopsy on one of my swollen neck nodes.  The lab results came back normal.  I know fine-needle biopsies aren't 100% accurate in diagnosiing lymphoma.  Yet my doc refuses to fully remove a node, saying the fine-needle biopsy is fine, that none of my other symptoms point to malignancy so she doesn't think my anxieties justify a more invasive procedure, but she can't explain the 18 months of swollen nodes.    I feel like if I have lymphoma, it's getting late in the game to be playing dare with my doctor.  should I switch doctors, or demand a full biopsy of a node?  I'm scared to death and frustrated that I've spent so much time and money at the doc office with no answers.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ms_barnacle,  Well, first of all...Thank you for your lymph nodes consiced  medical history  . So you are not worried about your neck nodes because they've been there ever since your mono infection. But you are worried from your flactuant nodes on the back of your head and behind your ears.  Your doctor has done  a very good approach to a case of lymphoma, when he did a Chest X-ray,blood tests,TB and EBV test,....and these nodes (back of head and behind the ears) are not common to be malignant. That is why your doctor is excluding malignancy....he's just missed an abdominal ultrasound  ,for nodes in your abdomen....and he should check nodes underneath your armpit (axillary lymph nodes).....and that would complete his investigations to exclude a case of lymphoma.  You have noticed that each time he gives you an antibiotic according to culture they go away....malignant nodes wouldn't behave like that.  If the Fine needle biopsy(FNAB) was inconvenient to him...he would have ordered an excisional biopsy (removal of the largest lymph node) ...but it seems that he's content with the FNAB.  I also want to inform you that infections in the scalp sometimes become chronic... you should look for  the cause of that infection and  consider a better hygiene and management to your scalp...frequent washing of your hair with therapeutic shampoos may be as directed by a dermatologist.  Don't worry, I cannot be 100% sure that it's not malignant...but i highly doubt after your history and the investigations that you've had.  You just make sure that you don't have other lymph nodes anywhere else...axilla,groin,etc...and ask for an abdominal ultrasonography...those would be the last investigations you can make to exclude lymphoma.   I am sure if he had felt that your lymph nodes consistency was wired...he would have investigated more.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "thanks--a few more questions...",
    "content": "Thank you so much for your reply.    Are fine needle biopsies relatively accurate? I also wonder weather it would matter which node she biopsied. The one thing I didn't explain clearly: the lymph node swelling never goes away completely.  All of those nodes, even the \"new\" ones, will shrink and get big again, etc. but they're always palpable, they never go away, now for a year and a half.  And the scalp infection does go away... then comes back within a few months. I've also wondered if the scalp infection could signal something else wrong... I shower twice a day because I go to the gym after work, I use dandruff shampoo, but I still get these infections.  I do have allergies, and I've wondered if that could have anythin to do with it.    And is it normal for my lymph nodes on the back of my neck to be palpable ever since having mono?  It's never given me much anxiety until now, but now I can't seem to find anyone who has experienced the same chronic enlargement.      Lastly, may I ask approximately how much an abdominal ultrasound would cost?  I only have catastrophic health insurance so I pay for everything out of pocket.  That's a lot of questions.  Sorry!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, always a pleasure:-)  Well, FNAC are relatively accurate....but when it's inconvenient and we feel query about it....we just excise the node.  I just have to say that it's very common for nodes after severe infections...like mono,TB or even minor but very prolonged infections ....to stay big...forming something called granuloma which means...infection trapped inside the node that has healed by fibrosis and reactive tissues...so the nodes never go back to their normal size!   Although you have plenty of nodes... but the way they behave and react to antibiotics just makes me doubt that it could be lymphoma.  What type of infection do you have in your scalp...what does the culture say?  Scalp infection doesn't signal something that i am aware of...? You told me your CBC was fine? what was the WBCs count (white blood cells)!?,  because if your scalp infection was due to something systemic(in your body) and not local(confined to your scalp)... the white blood counts would have been elevated!  I don't know how much does an abdominal ultrasound costs in your country...you can  ask the hospital or the center by phone,sorry.  Well, you can do the ultrasound whenever you can...but your doctor is doing a good job...I'd just ask you to go to a good dermatologist and ask for a proper treatment to your scalp condition,please.

    "content": "Yesterday while yawning I found a lump on my neck, left side, just under my jaw bone near by ear.  It's about the size of a large pea, is firm, and I can move it - it slips easily back under my jaw bone, at which point I can no longer feel it. I can only spot it when I drop my lower jaw (as in yawning), and it moves right to the edge of my jaw bone.  I thought at first I felt a faint pulse in it, but I think now that I was just feeling the arterny there, which is right by the lump.  There is very minor soreness to it - just enough to notice, but not enough to want to take anything for it.  Over the past 2-3 weeks, I have noticed sore neck muscles along both sides of my neck, but had just been thinking that I was sleeping oddly and that was causing the soreness.  Could the soreness be related to the lump I've found?  More importantly, is this something I need to get checked out?  Does it sound like it is lymph node related?  I am a smoker and wondered if that were at last causing me problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am female and am 37 years old.  I am having a few problems at the moment.  Firstly I found a lump in my neck last August 2004. The doctor said it was an enlarged lymph node.  Two weeks before I noticed the lump I had had my hair permed and also had treated my hair with a headlice treatment twice as I caught headlice from my son.  The lump decreased over a few months and now it has shrunk but is not completely flat- It is on the right side of the back of my neck, about  2 inches away from my earlobe and one inch down from the base of my skull.  If I turn my neck and head to the left, and keep my finger placed on the lump I can no longer feel the lump as well as if my head is facing towards the front direction looking ahead. It feels as if the lump is part of a muscle.  Then I had a blood test.  The blood test results in November 2004 showed a raised ESR level in the 30's, my last blood test in April 2005 this year showed that the ESR level is now 44. I am having another blood test in 3 months time. I am really worried about the ESR levels.  This is my medical history- I suffer from kidney stones and gum disease which the doctor said could cause raised ESR. I am recieving lithortripsy for the Kidney stones. I am Vitamin D deficient but taking a supplement prescribed by the doctor.  I have lipomas on my left side on my ribs also. I went to the doctors and he said it was lipoma-as I have Obsessive Compulsive disorder I find I am constantly getting these lumps checked. I think I found another one-a bigger one above the original one, but I am afraid that I have cancer spreading rather thatn lipomas. How can they tell the difference between lipomas and cancer by feeling a lump?  Please could you advise me.   Thank you. Maidie.\n\n",

We do that thing so often that we don't need to go in for a FNAC also! If you are really in doubt go in for a FNAC which will provide you with the diagnosis.

FNAC stands for Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology in which a fine needle is inserted in the lump and a little bit of material is aspirated and examined under the microscope; it is fairly accurate in a large number of cases. Of course, the confirmation is by biopsy. Your ESR is a bit elevated and your doctor is right: it might be due to those infections. For OCD, go in for psychotherapy, it's really wonderful and will help u relax a lot! Best wishes.....\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 18 year old male and have been feeling several lumps on the back and sides of my neck.  I've found this picture on lymph nodes with google and marked the places where I feel the bumps. Click here!  I've had them for as long as I can remember but I've been getting worried about there origin lately.  The biggest and toughest one of them is about 1 by 1 centimetre (0.3x0.3 inch) and quite hard, the smaller ones are all in a line. (see the picture at the place of the oval at the side of my the neck) The one below my jaw is in between of the other two when it comes to size and is hardly feelable because it's rather deep.  The lumps arent painfull at all and don't seem to grow though I do notice them changing in toughness a little, sometimes they become tougher and sometimes they become a little softer, nothing permanent though. I can feel them all the time though so the change in toughness isn't that big but it is easily noticable.  I would like to know what these lumps are and if they should be treated. Once more, I don't feel any pain what so ever, there not big enough to be noticable without feeling my neck or without me telling you that they're there. However it's a very uncomfortable thought to have these unknown lumps in my neck and I hope anyone here can shed some light onto this.  Thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sander,  You have to see a doctor about these lymph nodes and to make sure that you don't have other lymph nodes anywhere else in the body.  The lymph nodes under the jaw are usually non-specific and they can enlarge for all sorts of reasons. If the lymph nodes at the side of the neck get enlarged they have to be checked by a health care professional to make sure nothing is wrong.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Mass in my neck...has me freaked out!",
    "content": "DAY ONE: | 04.12.05 I have a nodule on the left side of my throat, and it is about 3cm x 3cm. It is not tender or painful. Just noticed it a day or two ago.I don't feel like it is a lymph node (no pain etc)it doesn't move much when pressed, and it feels rather hard to the touch.Also, this may be completely unrelated, but I have had itchy patches (like eczema) on my eyelids.   DAY TWO: My Dr thinks it must a swollen lymph gland, but I am afraid it's cancer...I return in a week to see it's progress...   DAY THREE: I am scheduled to revisit my Dr. tomorrow. I've noticed that my voice is changing, more of a strained, deep voice...tired sounding...Also my vision seems worse..?Also, I am having involuntary facial twitches, not horrible, but they seem to be getting progressively worse, first my upper lip, then cheek and now tonight forehead...I've noticed I am tired a lot, and have less appetite.I also have a sore in my nose that's new. Could just be a pimple or something..? Am I driving myself nuts, or what?! The mass in my neck is painless and hasn't\u2019t grown in the week or so since I've first noticed it. Its about 3 x 3 cm   DAY FOUR: Saw my Dr, who basically had no good advice. The good news is that the reported size is now 2.5 cm x 2.5 cm. At least I guess that's good news, the Dr didn't seem to care one way or the other. Nose is fine and I think the twitches have stopped for now. Did feel pain in chest area, left side, near rib cage, under breast, along the side, had the same pain a few weeks ago, was sure it was an imminent heart attack   DAY FIVE: Had a TOTAL meltdown last night at 3:30 AM. Started balling uncontrollably. Feel alone and scared. Totally freaked out. Went to ER, Doc there waived me right in, and after 2 seconds said I was being nuts for no reason, said he'd seen tons of lymphoma and that this wasn't cancer, he personally \"guaranteed\" me that it would go away in a while, and said to quit thinking about it.He checked for other lymphs and said not to worry. Went home and felt like I had a new lease on life.   DAY SIX: Still worried, and now my voice seems to still be changing and I feel overall \"off\" like I'm sick, or almost sick with the flu, etc...   DAY SEVEN: Been two weeks since I first noticed the lump. Family swears it seems smaller still, but I feel fatigued. I've been breaking out in tears frequently. Also, the lump seems more spread out maybe. I also have hot flashes and feel like maybe there are swollen lymphs in my arm pits, chin area and groin, and I think I have a fever occasionally. Have a slight discomfort on my left rear flank, below my ribcage, kind of like a muscle pain, might be from recent work I've been doing physical. Some tingling in my extremities and occasional headaches.   DAY EIGHT: Have appt next week for follow-up with the GP Doc. Have slight (weird feeling) sore throat, and maybe a slight ear ache (in same side as lump, right side). Then, I also have pain on the side (almost like when you walk too fast too much), on my right side.Also, noticed white stuff on my lips that look to me like thrush.   DAY ELEVEN: I saw the Doc again today and he agreed that it is either unchanged, or ::slightly:: smaller, maybe a little more spread out and not so 'pointed'....   His bedside manner is not too great...He records the exam into a tape recorder which I think amplifies any anxiety.   He referred me to another Doc that specializes in blood diseases, and said it is OK to wait about 10 days (until my insurance kicks in).   Said 10 days or so won't make any difference even if it's an aggressive malignancy.   I told him I had swollen glands a couple of days ago, in my arm pits and my groin. He used a bunch of fancy terms as if to mock me, and that was it.   I asked him if he thought this was going to kill me, and he actually said...\"well who knows you could get hit by a bus too\"...Talk about not being any comfort.   Wouldn't give me any probabilities, expectations, etc. I couldn't get any likeliness of this being cancer, etc etc.   Today I have a slight sore throat, and even a very slight ear ache in the ear on the same side as the mass.   I also have a slight nasal drip, and non-productive cough only about 2 or 3 times a day, or so.   And my voice still seems to be changing a little.   DAY THIRTEEN: For the last 36 hours or so, my lower back has been in extreme pain...   It seems to change from the left to the right occasionally.   Right now there is a tender knot and it seems to be raised a bit on the surface. When I twist a certain way or sit for a long period it bothers me.   It is below the rib cage and seems to be radiating...   Could this be related to the swollen lymph node and does this indicate cancer?   DAY FOURTEEN: Back pain seems better today, not gone, but better.   Ok, so last night I felt like my face was slipping off my skull.   It was tingly and numb!   What in the @#&@*$!% is going on with me??!?!?   I finally had to pop an Ambien just to get to sleep.   Woke up this morning and my face is still on, thank God    But, the node on my neck is still there too!   It's been almost a month since I noticed it. I think it changes a bit in size, but know I can't be sure I'm not just fooling myself.   Tiny, tiny irritation in my wisdom tooth closest to the node, like an infection, which seems to be going away quickly...was hoping this was somehow related. But seems to be unrelated since it only lasted 36 hours and never got more than just barely noticeable.   Slight sore throat overnight, no night sweats or fevers.   Going to Dr next week...can't wait, but am scared to death!   DAY SIXTEEN:  Sorry to say, this marks about 3 weeks since I first noticed the swollen mass in my neck and this morning I noticed there is a small smaller (and tender) swollen node that is sort of anchovy shaped below the large hard mass.   I know this can't be good.   No fever, night sweats or fatigue. Feel ok, except for the stress of worry. (Plus my best friend is near death in a hospital about 500 miles away and non-responsive, on breathing tube, etc).   My neck feels \u201ctight\u201d like I slept on it wrong (could have actually). Muscles feel tight and a bit sore, nothing major. Feel like my muscles are pulled along my shoulders surrounding my neck.   No tooth pain or sore throat at all. No nasal or sinus problems today. No noticeable facial \u2018twitches\u2019 or any other symptoms except for the itchy eyelids.   Slight itching on my back too, but have used the hot tub a few times this week so could be from the chlorine / bromamine in the water maybe? Speaking of which, we are in the forest and there are TONS of wild birds all around. Every day when I get into the outdoor hot tub there is always some bird droppings on the cover which drops into the water a bit. Is there something (like toxoplasmosis, or cat scratch etc) that could be in the water and contributing to this??? (Just wishful thinking I guess)   Actually feel pretty good overall, except for the depression about my best friend and the stress over possibly having cancer.  My voice seems raspy and deeper, and my nose has been stuffed up with some pain in my sinus cavities today.  The Dr I saw said my thyroid seemed fine. I did have a complete blood work up about 6 months ago. My Thyroid panel was all normal.   I guess a lot can happen in 6 months. In-fact, my CBC & Differential, Metabolic function and cholesterol were all basically fine (within normal range) back in September.   I also have never smoked or chewed tobacco. I'm am overweight but otherwise healthy, and only 35 years old.   A quick background issue: About 6 or 7 months ago I noticed a 'weird' \"sensation\", best described as a rapid heartbeat.   The best way to explain this is as follows. It ONLY happen(s) (ed) when I put my head down to rest.   I could feel my heart beat in my skull. I felt sort of flush and almost like a panic attack but not really (I've never had one to my knowledge anyway).   Basically, I could feel my pulse in my head and feel a tiny bit dizzy. It's VERY hard to explain. Anyway, it was VERY prevalent for a few weeks, and seemed to get worse every night, so much so that I went to a Dr and tried to explain my symptoms.   It was so severe that it would actually arrest my falling asleep since it only occurred JUST BEFORE I would specifically drift asleep.   So my Dr prescribed Valium and Atenolol (Tenorman). I never took the Tenorman figuring I didn't want to open that whole pandora's box. The valium helped when I used it occasionally. He did an EKG on me at the time and it was all normal.   The reason I mention this is because the symptoms seemed to subside for a few months, but lately, coinciding with the neck mass these symptoms have returned.   The neck mass is VERY PULSATILE and the Dr I visited last week said it is right on a corotiid artery.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Michaelii,    Well, let me answer your questions one by one...   * Well, you should be concerned ofcourse from your neck mass...It's on the carotid artery lymph node chain....hard and BIG!....you have voice changes...and this can be related to the larynx (voice box),rather than the thyroid...when the thyroid is normal on examination, blood tests and you don't have its symptoms.   * at first i thought it was infectious mononucleosis (mono),but then its symptoms should be more severe, more lymph nodes involvements,sore throat and fever with a special character....but u said you felt lymph nodes under your armpit,chin and groin with hot flushes and occasional fever....u should check your blood for mono as well.   * This weird sensation of rapid heart beat and that you could feel it in your skull,etc, this is simply called \"Palpitations\" which means awareness of heart beats...it's from anxiety and stress, also if you drink alot of coffee and tea ... but anxiety can cause it very easily and it's very common to normal people, so don't worry about that.   * The answer to all your questions would be in a lymph node biopsy. just ask for needle biopsy of it, where they give you local anaesthesia, and prick you with a needle, take a core of tissue and examine it under the microscope to know its nature...if it's cancer or not and from where did it come.   * Second thing to do is a laryngoscope.... to check on your larynx and vocal cords... that can explain the change in voice which is something also that you shouldn't let go easily ,especially with the presence of that big hard lymph node in your neck... and the appearance of a new one as well,ok?   I think those were the most alarming symptoms that you mentioned , if i skipped something that's important to you, don't hesitate to remind me ,ok?   and by the way, that out door hot tub with birds in the forest,etc!! well, i dunno what kind of wild birds,squerrils or any other animals swim in your tub before you get in,but as long as you don't drink it, then it's fine i guess?! ask your doctors about that as well,ok?   * So to sum it up...here is what you should ask for:-  1-Lymph node node biopsy.  2-Laryngoscope...preferrably direct laryngoscope , NOT indirect,ok?! where they can see your larynx properly, you'll be sedated,or even asleep,don't worry.  3- screen for Infectious mononucleosis in your blood and do a complete blood count as well.   Best regards,   Keep me updated,   Thanks for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope this infromation has helped you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Michaelli,  well, i cannot tell you or predict how it's going to be ...because if it is malignant (God forbids) ,then the prognosis(outlook) will depend on its stage,cell differentiation under the microscope and how aggressive is its behaviour, but not all malignant tumors means the end..according to the stage and other criterias varies the response of each one of them to certain chemotherapy /radiotherapy/surgery or a combination of them.  don't jump into conclusions please,that is very distressing for you.  Just Have faith and take each step, one at a time,ok? we are all here for you. May be it's a simple inflammation and we're making a fuss out of nothing...so relax....but at the same time...don't sit down and do nothing ....as i told ya...with a hard,big lymph node in the neck,around the carotid artery and changes in voice...we have to make sure it's nothing serious.... then celebrate when it turns out to be fine,ok?Best regards:-)\n\n",

    "title": "new leg pain...?",
    "content": "Just  a quick update, and to thank you again for being so kind and supportive.  Okay, so I haven't had ANY other swollen lymph nodes in days.  ONLY the one semingly HUGE one in my neck, maybe 2cm x 1.5cm..?  But I think it is VERY VERY VERY SLOWLY getting smaller and not as pronounced. It still doesn't seem to have much to any pain, is sort of fixed and kinda hard.  I check it several times a day, but am trying to do it less. It usually seems smaller in the mornings when I first wake up.  So, my hip pain is 85% gone, but still there occassionally. I treat it with asparin (2 once or twice a day). It might be related somehow to my plantars facioitis. I changed shoes recently (about 3 days ago) and the old shoes were worn out pretty bad. The new shoes (boots actually) seem to really help the pantars faciietis. It is 70% better.  Yesterday, I spent several hours sitting in the car on a trip, and now today my lower leg is kiilling me...My shin area, near the bone, doesn't feel especially muscular, but the asparin helps it a little too...  Also, I noitced a sore inside my mouth where it looks like I bit my inside of my cheek, infact it looks like my teeth are rubbing against the inside and today it is getting better.  As far as ALL the other things I mentioned, red eyes (stye, pink eye, etc), ezcema, everything is 100% better, except that I wake up with a slight to mild sore throat and occassionally a slight ear ache. Other wise I feel fine. Also my friend who the Drs said was dying is slowly improving.  I still have my Dr's apointment next week, but I am still scared it is something serious like cancer!  I haven't had any fevers, night sweats, etc.  Yesterday, my friend and I were cleaning my room and noticed TONS of dark black MOLD under my pillows and against the headboar of my bed.  We cleaned the area with Lysol a lot, and bleach too.  I don't know if we got it all.  Could this realted you think???  Finally, I wanted to tell you that I live in an area with a LOT of ticks, and I may have been bitten by one in the past.  Please let me know any thoughts you might have!\n\n",

Please tell your GP about the ticks , everything and your concern towards that.   Regarding your lymph node...being overweight makes it hard for  interpretating a lymph node...may be when they do a biopsy it'd be a pad of fat?!  who knows... so don't jump into conclusions please...wait to see your doctor... i wish if i can help more...but i just can't give a diagnosis for something i can't feel myself and if i felt that it is suspicious ,I'd definately ask for a biopsy.  Take good care of yourself and ,try to clean the house more frequently... sunshine in the house is very important... not only for mold...but for other diseases and infectious sources that harbour dust and moist,ok?

    "content": "Hello.  I'm back again. After being silent for several days, I wanted to post an update here.  Overall, I\u2019d say that the node (mass) in my neck is definitely smaller. If I had to guess, and I could just be fooling myself here, I\u2019d say it\u2019s maybe one half the size that it was when first noticed about 6 weeks ago. Not as \u201cdeep/tall\u201d and not as big. But, since I rub it 20 times a day, who knows..?  I finally got to see my new Dr at the end of last week.  He said he feels NO OTHER swollen lymphs.  Said he thinks it is one of 4 possible things:  1) Lymphoma (Hodgkin\u2019s or Non-Hodgkin\u2019s) 2) Some HIV/AIDS related reaction (?) 3) Melanoma of some kind (??) 4) Infection of some kind (i.e.: abscessed tooth, etc)  So, I said, basically, your saying it's most likely either \"cancer, AIDS, or both\"...and he said \"..well. Yes, I guess so\"...  Said possibly melanoma since my Mom had it about 10 years ago. (it was a mole on her back and was 100% removed with ZERO reoccurrence, no radiation, chemo or anything), and since I\u2019m from Southern California and fair skinned (I HATE the sun and spend as little time in it as possible).  Not exactly comforting or what I wanted to hear, but I guess that's why Dr's are so respected in our culture.  So, he ordered blood work, (CBC, (w/Man. Diff), Syphilis, HIV and a couple of other's I don't recall. Naturally, I am TOTALLY FREAKING OUT!! My follow-up appt with him was set for 10 days!!!! (I can't believe a Dr (knowing how anxious I am), would ask me to schedule the return visit in 10 days!!!!!!) Anyway, I've got 8 days left and each one is feeling like an eternity!  AND, to top it all off, I can't imagine what the blood work is really going to tell us. Assuming I'm HIV+ then what??? That doesn't tell us what the swollen node is, just makes a couple (BAD!) things more likely! And then what, another week to get a biopsy scheduled, and then what, another few days for the pathology report!!!. Or, (god willing!!) I'm HIV -. Then what?? Still do a biopsy? It could still be (maybe even more likely is) cancer!  AND, I don't think he even had a T-cell count done, so I'll have to go through that HELL later, If (hopefully NOT!) I test positive. I'll be scared to death later waiting the few days (after the new blood draw again!) to find out what stage of HIV infection I am in.  In the meantime, I'm praying it's #4! I do have a VERY SLIGHT irritation on my lower right wisdom tooth (in fact I've had trouble with all of my wisdom teeth over the years and have had 3 of them removed as impacted wisdom teeth), don't know if this one (bottom right) was one that was removed yet or not, but I think so, and the pain is very slight, but reminiscent of the pain I used to get from the impacted wisdom teeth. In any case, I'll see a dentist this week, while I wait for the lab results.   The stress alone is killing me!!  The good news (I guess) is, despite all this tremendous SCARY STRESS I feel 100% fine.  Maybe everyone (even end stage AIDS, or Stage IV Lymphoma patients) say that, but I really do physically feel fine.  No fevers, no night sweats, no itching, no fatigue, no thrush, no KS, no voice changes, no vision changes, no stomach problems, no headaches, nothing...(except a minor clearing case of planter\u2019s-facietis (sp?), which is getting better every day).  I'm eating healthy foods only. Drinking LOTS of clean water, and walking now everyday.  I still DON\u2019T WANT TO DIE! But, for some reason, I feel like I\u2019m not going to from this...Maybe this is some sort of denial, or self-preservation mechanism..?  I have no other swollen nodes, no heat flashes, etc.   ONLY, a VERY slight sore throat on waking and tiny tiny ear ache, (feels like a traveling tiny pain that radiates from the behind my ear lobe (on the same side as the swollen node), and travels down toward my throat, kind of in my jaw too, pressing around in there makes a \"good pain\" if that makes sense, kind of makes it feel better. It's almost like a taste-bud feels when you suck on a lemon, etc. In fact, I'd swear there's something in there to do with a taste-bud. (These can be malignant too right?)  Finally (I'll bet you are saying Jeesh!!! thank God he is wrapping up!), I have a question:  I can't find any online information to corroborate this, but is it possible that a first time dose of TADALAFIL could have caused this lymph node/mass in my neck??  It seems to correspond with a 20mg dose I took for the first time of this drug (and then once again about a week ago). I found some data indicating that doses in mice equivalent to human dose of 40mg have caused lymph node necrosis.  Here's the actual text: \"Animal studies showed vascular inflammation in tadalafil-treated mice, rats, and dogs. In mice and rats, lymphoid necrosis and hemorrhage were seen in the spleen, thymus, and mesenteric lymph nodes at unbound tadalafil exposure of 2-to 33-fold above the human exposure (AUCs) at the MRHD of 20 mg.\"  Next time, I'll only have one 'double-espresso' before writing my post   Ok, that's it for now, as usual, EVERYONE'S comments, feedback, support and questions are deeply appreciated!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Bout 5 weeks ago I noticed a bump under my arm that I assumed was a swollen lymph node.  It was not very big.  about the size of a pea if probably even smaller.  It went away after about 2 or 3 days.  Just the other day, I noticed another swelling under the same arm.  It was a little bit smaller than the first swelling 5 weeks earlier.  This one too, went away after about 2 or 3 days.    I normally don't suffer from allergies.   However, this year I have been having alergy symptoms such as a slight cough and runny nose.  does this have anything to do with causing the swellings perhaps?    Also, the lymph node swellings I have had were not very big did not really hurt, and went away after a few days..  I have always been under the impression that cancerous lymph node swellings would last for a much longer time than just a few days and are much larger than what I have noticed.  Am I correct about this??  or could what I have possibly be a sign of something cancerous?  Should I be concerned??    Any Advice/comments would be appreciated!   Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi pargolfer4, A recent infection would cause lymph nodes to enlarge/swell. It is quite a normal occurence because lymph nodes are the bodies filtering system for bacteria. After a lymph node enlarges it may not return to it's preinfectious state but does generally reduce in size. When lymph nodes continue to enlarge even despite treatment for example, with a cycle of antibiotics, this would raise concern. In my opinion what you have experienced, is the normal functionality of the body to fight off bacteria. I hope this is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

In the absence of lymph node enlargement or an increase in total leucocyte counts there is probably not much happening. A follow up blood count after a month will help lesson your worries.

The smaller ones do not bother me but the large one is.  The feel of  It is solid my neck does not hurt no tenderness.  I am more concerned because cancer runs in my family and I already had uteran cancer and had a partial hysterectomy.  Lymphoma, Breast, overian and cancer of the mouth.

    "content": "Hi~   Since my last posting I have gone to see my Dr.  He said it was nothing to worry about.  But I would not leave until I felt something would be done.  He put me on Amoxicillin ran some blood work which he said was all good he also checked me for mono which thats not back yet.  He made me an appointment for an Xray but my concern is will it show what kind of mass it is?  He said because my white count was good I am worrying about nothing.  In 1999 I was diagnosed with cervical cancer no HPV found and had 4 cyst and a benign tumor  which was not movable on my left ovary which through laparoscopy had been removed and a leep procedure was done on my cervix.  From there on till 2002 I had abnormal paps diagnosed as cin 3 so every 3 months for 2 yrs colpo's, biopsies they finally decided this was never going to go away it was hysterectomy time.  During surgery and pathology testing they found that I had  cancer in my uterus  so what I was told by the Drs at that time they were glad they did it then and not later because of my uterus ( So to this day I am not sure if the cervical cancer spread to my uterus)  I do know they kept my right ovary for homones.  They told me at the time I did not need any treatment because it was not invasive.    I just want to make sure that it is nothing to worry about but the Military Moto goes: If it's not broke don't fix it.  I just hope I am led to the right path whatever it may be.  Should I press for a biopsy?  What should I be looking for on the reports of the xray?  Again thank you\n\n",

Let's see what's your mom test result as well. but to have your description of lymph nodes...that's worrying and requires a biopsy.  Lymph nodes in the neck should be investigated for carefully,especially if it's been going on for quite sometime (months) ,like you said.  please insist on the biopsy or at least a FNAC(fine needle aspiration cytology) from your biggest lymph node....it's just a needle prick.. putting into mind that they have good pathologists to look into it carefully.

    "content": "I've had a swollen gland in my neck for four years.  It started with the feeling that somehting was stuck in my throat.  Over the course of 4 months it became larger.  When I get a cold or am suffering from outdoor allergies, it becomes very, very painful.  Almost unbearably so. It is always enlarged but becomes larger and more painful under these conditions.  I have also noticed that sincethis started my memory has become significantly worse and I have a numb feeling in the middle of my back near my spine when I lay in a certain way.  Much of the time I feel \"foggy headed\"...that's the best way I can describe it.  I have had several endoscopies done and a CT scan.  They found the node was enlarged but not extremely large. They did not locate any other enlarged nodes to be concerned with. Have seen 2 ENT doctors that do not feel the need to perform a biopsy and suggest that it may just be a \"reactive\" node.  However, I have just found out that my uncle faught and won a battle with throat cancer last year. And i have a 2nd cousin who lost a battle with bone cancer. I'm much more concerned about my condition now.  What can I do? Shouldn't these tests have shown cancer if I had it?  Should I demand a biopsy?  Would that detect cancer?\n\n",

    "content": "jmannina, The long duration of your symptoms, the size of the lymph nodes and the pain are all more against the diagnosis of cancer than for it. Where exactly is it located in the neck? The general procedure is to avoid a neck biopsy as much as possible even when the diagnosis of cancer is a possibility as this distorts the anatomical planes in the neck and may affect prognosis of an occult head and neck cancer should it turn out to be so. I would recommend follow up preferably with an oncologist.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My Dad recently discovered a swollen node in his throat region- but it is painless. He has lost a lot of weight in the past few months and his neck has gotten a lot smaller, so we aren't sure if it just swelled, or if it has been that way and we just couldn't see it.  Anyway, he went to the doctor and did an x-ray and he has many swollen lymph nodes in his neck area- front, sides, and back.  The one in his throat area is the only one visible though, and from the outside it looks to be the size of a big marble.  He's going for a biopsy next week- but I was wondering if all painless swellings are a sign of malignancy or if it is ever possible with infection for the swelling to be painless.  He drank for many years- so is it possible for it be throat cancer? And if so how cureable of that? Any information is greatly appreciated.  Thank you, Lea\n\n",

(I had mono about 4 years ago, but have been fairly healthy up until the last 6 months or so).  The past few months I have been very tired & have had a low grade fever on and off.  I have also noticed that my skin was pretty dry and itchy (don't know if that has anything do with it.)  Anyway, after antibiotics did nothing, my GP did a CT scan which showed \"numerous enlarged lymph nodes greater than 3 cm\".  However she said she wasn't concerned.  So I took it upon myself to see and ENT.  He's scheduled for me for a tonsillectomy and removal of the biggest lymph node (the one that I've felt for years) for biopsy.  However, that's over a month a way.  He says not to worry myself to death, but he also said that the size & location of this largest lymph node make him a little suspicious.  I don't want to worry over nothing, but I don't want to convince myself I'm okay only to be shocked to find out somethings really wrong.  Any advice or insight?\n\n",

I'm not sure that I mentioned it, but it keeps slowly getting bigger.  The other enlarged lymph nodes vary in size from 1-3 cm.  They are on both sides of my neck, but most of them are on the left side (where the big one that they are removing is located).  They haven't said anything about consistency.  Although when my ENT & his radiologist looked at the CT they said that a few \"looked a little suspicious.\"   No I haven't had problems with my tonsils lately.  Back 6-10 years ago, I had tonsillitis and strep throat all the time.  My ENT just said that they had grown large and they had folds in them.  I'm honestly not sure what that means.  He just suggested taking them out.    I guess I just feel like they aren't telling me honestly what they are thinking, and all I really want is to be leveled with.  If they really think that they're fine, I wish they would just say so.  Or, if they are suspecting that they are malignant, I wish that they would tell me that.  I just kind of want to be prepared.

I know it's a bad custom/habit,but people have to control it...    and that pain you got in your neck is called neuralgia(pain in the nerves)following alcohol consumption ...because Alcohol causes damage to nerves as well.   how big are  the lymph nodes under your arm pit...because sometimes they are non-specific (due to an infection or  from the long use of deodorants)  Listen....take it easy, let's see what will the biopsy show....it really depends on the lab ,so it might take from 2-5 days?!  keep me updated, best wishes,\n\n",

The lymph nodes in my armpit are tiny. That's why I'm not sure if I'm really feeling them or if I'm just going crazy!!! (It's probably a little of both!  Ha, ha!!!)  Monday is the big day.  Both the tonsillectomy and biopsy are being done at the same time.  My ENT said that I should take off of work for at least 10-14 days?  I think that seems a little excessive.  Is that really necessary?  I'm a broker and really can't afford to be gone that long.  Would it hurt me to come to work on Wednesday or Thursday?  Again, many thanks!!!\n\n",

I started with a tumour and very large nodes in my right neck and symptoms of night sweats, hot flushes, temperature etc. I have had a needle biopsy, a nodal biopsy under general anaesthetic, a bone marrow biopsy, ultra sound and ct scan as well as blood tests. I was found to have it in my bone marrow and spleen as well as neck. I I am due to start chemotherapy this Wednesday, but for some unknown reason the tumour in my neck, plus the enlarged nodes have shrunk almost to nothing of thier own accord!!! and the discomfort and sharp stabbing pains in the spleen area have stopped, also I have felt better than I have in the past year and have renewed energy. I am totally perplexed and need to speak to my team this week about this as I feel so good. Does anyone know of this? And if so what does it mean. Does this happen often, I need to know if it is a common occurance, or if it is just a fluke and it is still growing somewhere else.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Rosemary, No, it is not normal for low grade lymphoma to decrease on its own. This can happen if you are taking steroid medication though. An important point should be made here: If you are not taking steroids then the pathology needs to be reviewed. The bone marrow and the pathology needs to be stained to test for monoclonality. Some cases of reactive, inflammatory or immune lymph gland enlargement are very difficult to differentiate from lymphoma. Another confirmatory test would be Bcl-2 staining. I would have recommended an excisional biopsy (where the whole gland is removed) as opposed to a needle biopsy. Please let me know how it all turns out. Best regards,\n\n",

As to the relation between the lumps and your symptoms, it is hard to tell as well.  If you are very worried and need to know what are those lumps and if they were already diagnosed as lymph nodes, what is causing them to be enlarged, the best way is to get a lymph node biopsy.  i recommend that you stop smoking whether this is related to smoking or not.

She just received a mammogram and sonogram (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) and the report mentioned something about her lymp nodes underneath her armpit. We know this because she asked for a copy of her test report from the clinic where the examination was performed.The specialist that refered her to get these examinations done is NOT explaining what her condition is because the doctor is NOT returning my mother's phone calls and messages. I am extremely worried about my mothers condition, and I was wondering if someone here would know what the correct term for a specialist who mainly deals with this kind of lymph node problem because we do not know what specialist to see for this condition. This pain under her armpit has been going on for about 3 months and now the doctor my mother is seeing is not returning her phone calls. I do not wish for my mother to drag this on any further because if it is cancerous, she would need to remove it ASAP or find some sort of resolution to this problem.

Strangely enough, I recently discovered a very tender mass in my upper pubic area (about 4\" below my navel. You can roll the tissue in that area and feel the mass (about the size of a lima bean). It is very tender! When pressure is applied to the mass it creates a burning sensation an the pain is sharp enough to make me whince.

    "content": "Hi dhalltoyo, Lymph nodes become swollen and tender and may result as a response to infection. However, when you had your CT scan and the finding was enlarged retroperitoneal lymph nodes, was this not investigated? Has there been no mention of biopsy? Do you have any other symptoms aside from the tenderness etc.? I would strongly suggest you call your physician and inquire whether this was stated as a benign finding on the CT scan report etc. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Everyone ! I am really hoping some one out there can help me with this, let me try to start from the beginning. About a month ago I started having this clicking noise when I swallowed on the right side of my neck. I went to my family doctor he did not seem concerned, I also went to my ENT who again was not concerned at all. I requested a CT Scan of my neck and my family doctor said it was a normal study.   Well this is my concern.... I have had a swollen gland on the right side of my neck for as long as I can remember, I had mono a few years ago and the doctor had said it may just be a swollen gland from the mono that has never returned to it's normal size? It never really bothered me so I just let it go.     I went and got a copy of the CT study report and it said something that bothered me it said \" there is a 6mm lymph node on the right side of the neck inferior to the hyoid bone. Mild adenopathy may be obscured due to the lack of intravenous contrast.\" Now I know that is what is probally causing the clicking considering it is in front of the hyoid bone it is most likely hitting it on a swallow. Does it sound like something concernign that I should persue. My doctor seems to want to just ignore it. I have been going to him for many many years and I do trust him just I am not to sure about this.   What is the normal size of a lymph node in that area? Is 6mm something concerning? Thank you for any input you can give me\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Cheercoach,  You could be right about the gland clicking against the hyoid or it could be hitting on your thyroid cartilage when you swallow. Have you noticed the clicking to be worse or more painful if your head is turned to the side when you swallow? The gland may be slightly swollen at 6mm but I believe it is still within normal limits. If it continues to bother you, feels like it's getting bigger or becomes more difficult to swallow ask your Physician how he feels about a contrast CT to rule out a growth in that lymph node.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 19 year old female.  Back in october I was having trouble sleeping on my right side because my underarm kept hurting when I would lay on it.  I started to feel in the armpit area and I noticed that I had two lumps in my armpit.  My underarm was really puffy and it was really sore around the lumps.  I went to see my doctor a couple days later and he put me on an antiobiotic and told me that they were just swollen lymph nodes. One was  1 cm and the other was really small.   I took the antiobiotic and it made the puffiness go away and the pain, but the lymph nodes were still there.  I went back to the doctor and they sent me to have an ultrasound done. I went and had the ultrasound done and the radiologist told me that they were just swollen lymph nodes and he wanted me to come back in 3 months and have another ultrasound done to see if they changed in size.  So after 3 months I went and had another ultrasound done, and they told me that they might have gotten slightly smaller and that they didn't get any bigger so He said I didn't need to come back. It has been over 6 months and they are still there. They haven't got any bigger. Should I look into it any further, or should I just let it go?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sunflower, Lymph nodes may commonly enlarge as a result of an infection becuse they are the bodies filtering system for bacteria. Keep in mind that even after an infection resolves lymph nodes may not return to their pre-infectious state. I would be more concerned if the lymph nodes became larger in size despite antibiotic treatment but since they have decreased in size over this period of time I would be less concerned and consider this to be a relatively normal outcome. However, at the time that your lymph nodes were evaluated did you also have a physical breast exam as well as diagnostic studies of the breast? If you did not, I would suggest that you contact your health care provider for an opinion about an evaluation to include a breast exam just to exclude any other possibilities unrelated to an infection. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

We had it checked at her one year appointment and the Dr said not to worry that it was a lymph node.  Well, her 2 year appt is in two days and he is going to have to convince me that it is normal for the lymph node to still be swollen.  I do not think it has gotten any bigger.  She hates when i probe it so i cant get too good a feel.  I do not think it hurts, i just think she doesnt like getting poked in the neck all the time.  I am a big time worrier about my girls (twins) and this has been on my mind for over a year.   Is it normal for a lymph node to always be swollen?  Should i push the issue if the Dr claims it is still a lymph node?  It is directly below the ear, in the middle of her neck.    Any info would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dearest jakeeler, As Theresa explained that lymph nodes are the bodies filtering system, that become swollen in response to any infection. The fact that your child has swollen lymph nodes doesn't mean that she has an illness. Rather, it's a sign that her immune system is at work. With acutely swollen glands, it is more important to diagnose and treat the infection causing the glands to swell, but the glands themselves need no treatment. Chronically enlarged lymph nodes, as in your daughter's case, are considered 'non-specific' and usually no focus of infection could be found. Again as Theresa explained, they sometimes just don't return to their pre-infectious state. If the lymph node becomes red and painful, larger than 2 inches or not mobile, then you should worry and should immediately seek medical advice.\n\n",

    "title": "SWOLLEN LYMPH NODE, PLEASE HELP",
    "content": "Hello EVERYONE, I have ahd this swollen gland for a long time over a year. And I went to a ENT they did not seem concern at all so i let it go.   it is located on the right side of my neck, it seems like it is on the side of my adams apple? I did have mono awhile back and my family doctor had said it could just be a node that never returned to normal size?   Well here is the problem about a month ago I started having this clicking/popping noise on the right side of my neck on a dry swallow, this really made me nervous. I went back to the doctor who sent me back to the ENT, I had a CT Scan done, and my family doc said the results were normal. My husband went and got a copy of the report and it says... \" A6mm lymph node is present on the right side just inferior to the hyoid bone. Mild adenopathy could be obscured due to lack of intravenous contrast.\" Now on the bottom at the conclusion it says : Normal study of the neck??? Well of course I am assuming this is what is causing my problem, considering it is in front of the hyoid bone, I guess it is hitting it on a swallow? And appartently if it is the same gland I have been noticing for the past year, I am thinking it must of gotten larger......... now i am really worried..   I have a few questions 1. Is 6mm really big for a node? how large should they be? 2. In the place I described on the right side just next to the adams apple, is that in front of the hyoid bone? 3. I did also have a very through blood screening done about 6 months ago and  everything was normal, should I have it done again?  The gland/or node that I can feel on the side of my neck is movable (i think) and at times can get tender. Sometimes i do feel as though there is a lump in my throat but it goes away by the end of the day.   Please help with any ifo possible I am driving myself crazy here, i do not know if I should persue this or just let it go as they are saying? I don't want to seem like a hypercodriac but I can't shake the thought of cancer? PLEASE HELP !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I have not found any other nodes swollen. (I have been checking)\n\n",

Back in May of 2004 two lymph nodes behing my left ear became very swollen, it stayed that way for a few weeks and went away and at that time my legs and ankles were very swollen. Since May the tender glands have came back 4 more times and went away. The problem is now one of them stays larger than the others and seems to be growing at a very slow pace. It doesnt hurt and is not tender unless it becomes actually swollen. It is hard and doesnt move easily. If anyone can help me with this I would greatly appreciate it, also an idea of what type of doctor I should see for this matter will be helpfull too. Thanks for you time.  babyblues720\n\n",

First, let me state that it is somehwat difficult to talk about specifics of your situation without the benefit of seeing and feeling what is going on behind your ear.  Nevertheless, it would be a good idea to see a doctor for evaluation.  Sometimes if there may be an infection or fluid-filled cyst, then either a course of antibiotics is tried or a needle aspiration is done to remove any fluid.  If the swollen areas are to be removed, then It would be a reasonable idea to consider obtaining CAT scan of the affected area first to see if anything is going on deeper in the area.  A general surgeon or an ENT specialist can be involved to remove the affected areas.  Sometimes a Plastic Surgeon is asked to be of help if there are any cosmetic concerns with regard to a biopsy.

I am afraid that the biopsy could've came out false and every morning I wake up thinking I have lymphoma. It's so hard for me to function without having any answers. Can someone please help me?

    "content": "Hello and thank you in advance for your replies,  I have had a small lump on my chin for about a year.  Originally, my internist said it was nothing, because it had not grown.  I went to a dermatologist, who recommended an ENT doctor for further evaluation.  The ENT wanted to take out the lump & biopsy it, but that would have had professional repercussions for me, so he recommended a needle biopsy.  He said it was a lymph node, but this is located on the front of my chin, towards the right side.  Anyway, the needle biopsy came back & said everything was normal (no indication that they did not have enough cells to make that determination), but then the original dermatologist said a needle biopsy still might not take enough cells to be sure.  I'm trying to get an appointment for a second opinion, but in the meantime this is driving me crazy.  The lump is definitely not fluid-filled (cyst).  There was no definite diagnosis that came back from the needle biopsy (or the ENT doctor).  What else could it be, if it isn't cancer?  Thank you, Strum\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  First, I would verify that the needle aspiration obtained enough material.  An aspiration and a biopsy are not the same thing.  The former has a higher likelihood of not being diagnostic (i.e.- not having enough tissue or cells for analysis) compared to the former.  However, a biopsy on the face can leave a scar.  Usually an ENT doctor or a Plastic Surgeon would be involed with a biopsy about the face if cosmetic issues are a concern.  Second, I would talk with your doctor if the area about the chin is a lymph node or something else, such a subcutaneous (under the skin) nodule not associated with a lymph node.  There can be many reasons for lymph nodes to enlarge.  Fortunately, most of those reasons are not due to a cancer.  If the nodule or lymph node has been enlarged for some time and has not changed or has not been associated with other areas appearing, then that can be reassuring that a cancer is not involved.  Cancers do not tend to remain static; they grow and spread over time.   There can be two approaches to a situation such as yours: 1.) watchful waiting, looking to see if anything changes over time; and 2.) proceed with a biopsy for a more definitive tissue analysis and diagnosis.  If you would feel comforted by a second opinion, then it would not be unreasonable to do so.  After all, you are the one at the center of this issue.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  There a re lymph nodes, countless of them, all through out the body.  Some are easy to feel if they become enlarged, whereas others are deep in the body and can only be seen on scans (e.g.- CAT scans).  Some areas of the body do not have any regional lymph nodes associated with hem, but those are not many in number.  I cannot speak to the specific locations you describe.  Most of the lymph nodes about the mouth, nose and eyes are deep in the head, not on the surface, so to speak, and thus usually are not easy to feel.  Some lymph node areas in the mouth region can be seen by looking into the mouth if those lymph nodes are swollen.  Some areas of the head have lymph node drainage basins located in the neck.  I would suggest taking a look at an anatomy text book to learn more about this subject.  There may be some anatomy texts on line, although they may require a subscription to access.  Jeffrey A.

He had his Tcell count an viral load tests after surgery and his T-cell dropped from 330 to 246, his viral load went from 331 to 10,000. He has started his anti-virals for HIV about 1 week. Since he had his kidney surgery on December 28th, he has not had any symptoms of lymphoma untill about 3 weeks ago. He now has B symptoms, (itchiness, night, sweats, weight loss, fever).

In the United States do the Dr's. start chemo right after diagnosis of cancer?? We don't get much information from the Dr's here. We aren't sure what stage he has. He has had CT scans, they show nothing except for a small mark in the lungs. They say that could be from TB? Any info you could give would be great.

You did not give any information about the type of lymphoma diagnosed.  Do you have that informaton?  The treatment of a lymphoma in a person with HIV/AIDS can be complicated by the HIV/AIDS itself.  The HIV/AIDS predisposes to various infections and the lymphoma treatment can further put a person at risk for infecions.  Also, if the person is debilitated from the HIV/AIDS, then that can make it difficult to tolerate chemotherapy to treat the lymphoma.  Sometimes antiretroviral medications are given to better control the HIV/AIDS before starting lymphoma treatment.  Other times, if the lymphoma is aggressive and fast-paced, there is no time to wait before starting chemotherapy.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

I am assuming that if you have been evaluated by an Infectious Disease doctor, then you would have had a lot of tests done looking for various infections.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, yesterday I developed a painful lump on the side of my neck - I thought that sleep would make a difference, but it hasn't. In late November, I had the same problem - a lump (lymphnode?) erupted on the upper left side of my neck but disappeared in one-two weeks, but has now erupted again on the same side. I wouldn't worry but the fact is it hurts. I have also developed a lymphnode on the right side of my neck about two-three inches from my collar bone. My question is, what should I do about it? And is it any cause for concern?  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mp213, Generally speaking, swollen, painful lymph nodes may be a sign of infection. Your lymph nodes sometimes swell because lymph nodes are the bodies filter system, so to speak, for bacteria etc. I would suggest an evaluation by your physician who will likely prescribe a course of antibiotic therapy to see if they decrease in size. If the swelling is due to an infection this should resolve the problem. Keep in mind however, that lymph nodes may not return to their preinfectious size but they should not continue to increase in size either. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "In August 2004 I was massaging my neck when I discovered a lymph node on the side of my neck. I had my GP look at it in October and was referred to an ENT in Nov. The ENT said it was less than a cm and not concerning, but put me on antibiotics and Allegra (for allergies and itchy throat) to see if the node would go down. I followed up with that doctor twice and he concluded that this node shouldn't be biopsied due to its size and location and the fact that it hasn't changed over all these months.  He said to follow up with him if the node enlarged.  I sought a second opinion in January and this ENT said that the node was about the size of a pea, but that nodes should not be felt in an adult. He said they were ok to be felt in children and that it should be biopsied in a month if it does not go away.... I asked him to describe the node and he said it is rubbery and mobile and less than a cm.  My question is: Which doctor's advice should I take? The only thing they have agreed on is the size and character of the node. The first ENT said the node can be felt because my neck is thin.  I can feel the node at times just by lightly rubbing my hand down my neck. At other times, I can only feel it if I gently press on my neck. It is felt most easily when my neck is turned to the side. What is your advice as far as biopsying this node?\n\n",

My doctor at the time didn't think it was anything to worry about and suggested that I watch it for changes.  Just last week I noticed a swelling -- again about dime sized -- just below my hairline on the left side.  It's a little tender, but not red or hot.  I may be blowing it out of proportion, but I'm concerned now that these two lumps could be connected and that I may have an undiagnosed cancer.  I'm in good physical shape, do plenty of exercise and have no lymphoma/leukemia symptoms that I know of.  (No fever, sweats, weightloss, itching, etc.)   So, is it at all probable that a cancer could move so slowly?  Should I watch and wait on the new swelling?  Thank you!\n\n",

If applying heat makes you feel better, it's fine to do so. Lymph nodes swell as a result of an infection or recent infection since they are your bodies filter so to speak. If you have had a recent infection then that would explain why your white blood cell counts are now normal. Take the full amount of your antibiotic treatment and if the lymph node swelling is a result of an infection it should reduce in size. However, keep in mind, if it does not reduce in size and you continue to have pain, follow up with your family physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The lump is not \"hard,\" but is firm. It is not tender. It is approximately 1 3/4 inches long and runs on a diagonal from an area a couple inches above the top of my clavical toward my throat. It seems to taper. (meaning larger at the top and narrower as it goes down my neck) Any growth of this lump if any, has been so minimal as to not be noticed.   Although when feeling the lump, it can be felt by moving my fingers upward or downward, it is really pronounced when moving my fingers downward.  My Primary Care Doctor sent me for a CT Neck scan. Three lymph nodes were noted at 7mm, 5mm and 5mm. All are considered within normal parameters. He then sent me to an ENT specialist who found nothing out of the norm and states there is nothing to worry about. Upon a followup visit to my Primary Care Physican, he tells me based on the CNT findings, don\u2019t worry, monitor the lump, go to followup exam with CNT specialist and let him know if it changes.   I believe in fixing a dripping faucet before it cannot be turned off. I feel the same about my health. Early detection of any potentially adverse condition is essential to effective treatment. Any suggestions would be appreciated. As it seems to be along the muscle, is there such a thing as a \"muscle\" specialist that I could seek a second opinion from?  GB\n\n",

If the ent specialist and the ct scan of the neck did not find an abnormality in the neck, then most probably, there is nothing to worry about.  If the lump that you are feeling and showed to the doctor and the doctor thought this was a lymph node at the time of examination and you are still worried about it, then a lymph node biopsy could be done to remove the lymph node and analyse it.  Is this lump originitaing from the muscle? If you contract the muscle that you suspect that the lump is originating from or attached to and the lump completely loses its mobility then this lump is originating from the muscle.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Mokhtar,  Thank you for your input. I appreciate your time.   When I discussed the lump with the ENT, (followup visit) he thought a biopsy would not be in order. The lump can be felt with the muscle expanded or contracted. Its' mobility does not seem to change. It would appear to me that it is fixed (attached) and not mobil at all. It is pronounced enough that it can be seen when the neck is held in normal upright position and is more pronounced if the head is turned to the right. Lump is located at the lower end of the left posterior triangle. I have no pain or discomfort and feel there has been no growth. I first noticed it in August 2004.  Thanks again,  GB\n\n",

    "content": "Dear gb,  Thank you very much for the update.  Still what did the ent specialist think this lump is? If this is a lymph node and it is not getting any bigger and there are not any other lymph nodes any where else in your body that are getting bigger, i don't think that there is anything to worry about.  For the time being, i think the best thing to do is watch it and if it gets any bigger or starts to hurt or other lymph nodes anywhere else in the body start to get bigger, i would suggest that you call you doctor.  From your description, this does not sound that it is attached to the muscle.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "My wife has had swollen lymph nodes for the past three weeks. She had a cold for a week when one appeared on her right side of the groin area. The cold was over and she got two more lumps, one on the left and now two on the right side of the groin area.They are painfull to the touch and when she walks they hurt as well. Her last period started Dec. 10th and she has been spotting. It is unlikely that she has a STD. She also has very bad cramps, nausea,and bladder infections right before her period starts.When she has a bladder infection she has clots of blood in her urine. She drinks lots of water and cranberry juice when this happens but  it doesn't help until her period starts, then the bladder infection goes away. She had an MRI done on her lower back in April of 2003 and in one spot of the report it said REPRODUCTIVE- lymph node problems. Just wondering if you might know what is wrong? She will be going to the doctor soon and any help would be appreciated. Thanks for your time,  Nick[/b]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi nick, Generally speaking, swollen, tender lymph nodes is the bodies response to fighting infection since they are the bodies filtering system. They usually decrease in size (not always returning to normal) after the infection has subsided. Now to my concern, the result on the MRI that stated \"Reproductive lymph node problems\" isn't very specific as far as determining the actual problem. Did it happen to state on the report \"abnormality attention needed' ? Has she had a recent examination by a gynecologist to rule out any anomolies? If she has not been evaluated by a physician specifically since the MRI was completed I would strongly suggest one being done.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I have been to several different docs (family doc, and er doc) about the enormous swollen gland(s) on the right side of my neck. Tried Zithromax, minimal resluts. Now trying Keflex. Same thing- the swelling around my face goes down, but the majority of the lump remains- very, very noticeable. Now, before I go see an ENT (I pay as I go, no insurance) I have been trying to research what my symptoms could possible mean... Or rather, what is CAUSING them...  Way back before the swelling on neck, I started with just a general feeling of fatigue, regular swollen glands (both sides), even a little depression, so I went to the doc. Was tested (negative) for mono, and given Zoloft to try. Only tried 10 days, the feeling of tiredness was too much- so I stopped. Then noticed huge lump on right side of neck...  One other thing, that could be related, or unrelated... Few weeks back, began feeling some pangs under right armpit, back near my shoulder blade and on down the arm a bit. Now today, sharp pain between the shoulder blades- causing me to have to take 4 motrin!   Any professional opinions would be greatly appreciated! I have a young daughter (16 mos old) and I know she would want her mommy to be in the best health possible! ;-)\n\n",

My dad had the same thing and after he had it removed cancer showed up in his prostrate.  The lump was benign or so they say.

    "content": "Dear dsalerno,  i don't think that there was any correlation between the lump that your dad had and the prostate cancer that he developed.  The hard lump on your husband's neck is most probably either a lipoma (a fat growth) or a sebaceous cyst (cyst filled with oily material that the skin produces to lubricate the hair). Both very commonly arise in this area and both are benign. If you or your husband have any worries about any lump, the best thing to do is to have it removed and analysed.  Regarding your granddaughter, this might be an enlarged lymph node or an abscess or an infected cyst, as the pain usually points to either inflammation or infection.  She needs to be seen by her doctor as soon as possible.  Thank you very much for using our website http://www.doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "This past week I worked outside in the rain. I quickly became sick, and I've been struggling this weekend with a lot of chest congestion and head congestion. Friday night my girlfriend pointed out that I had a knot right at the top of my right armpit. Yesterday it appeared just a bit bigger. It doesn't hurt to touch it, and it is soft. It's almost like an inflamation of some sort, but I can feel something in it. It feels like fatty tissue, about 3/4 of an inch. On the surface it's just a bit red, and again feels soft, like inflamation. For some odd reason, it seems like I remember looking in the mirror a couple months back and seeing what appeared to be a little lump there. Not sure about it, but I know there's one there now. I had a fever Thursday and Friday with the head & chest congestion, but it's breaking up today, and my fever's gone. I can't tell if the swelling has gone down in the spot I mentioned, but I must admit it's really scared me. Should I go on to the DR and have this checked, or is it related to the infection I've had? Any advise at all would be greatly appreciated. Thank you, and God bless.\n\n",

Most times it comes around my period and stays for a week or so. Lately, (in the past 4 months) I have also been experiencing other vaginal problems as well. Usually after sex, but also occasionally during the day, I've had a thick bloody-colored, mucus discharge. It doesn\u2019t smell bad, and it's not painful. Sometimes after my period I get a little sore/blister where my vagina meets rectum. It's itchy but not painfully so, and not really big. I assumed it was friction from wearing maxi pads but now I am not so sure. During my most recent period, the lymph node was visibly enlarged and very tender to the touch, even walking was difficult, because my legs felt heavy.\n\n",

If it has not changed in size and it's not causing you any other problems, I wouldn't be overly concerned. You should, however, bring it to your doctors attention when you have your appointment.

    "content": "I have a long story here and wondering if someone can help me.  I have had a swollen arm pit and breast in Aug. I went to a doctor right away to get some advice and was sent to a small hospital where I had an ultrasound done. Nothing was found. So, I was still dealing with pain but the swelling went down for a week or 2 then came back with pain in the left breast as well. So, I went back to the doctor and was told it would be good to have a mammogram. Had that done and all was clear. Now, in all this time, no one had mentioned to me what to do about the pain and so on. I decided to go to my GYN again and have some blood work done. Now while waiting for the results to come back in a week, My armpit blew up again and I went to my local GP and asked if it could be an infection. He gave me  a low dose antibotic. 2 days later I go back for the results of the blood test, and was told I had an infection. So again, I go and show the results to my local GP.  Now, I have been taking this antibotic and it seemed to be working at day 5 . I had little pain to nothing at all. But day 7 , today, in the evening the pain started again. We are having bad weather and I caught a slight cold on top of everything and I am taking medicine for that.       Now, since the pain has returned tonight , it also goes around to my back.  I don't know if it is just from sitting the wrong way or from an infection or something else.  I just don't know what to do , where to go to or what kind of treatment I should be having but am not getting. Can someone help me or advise me! I am getting desperate!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Maureen,  What you are suffering from sounds to me like an infection but it lacks some of the characteristics of infection like having a fever, redness of the area and the intermittent course without treatment (usually infections are either progressive or self limited). This sounds like a skin infection as the antibiotic improved it.   At this time, i would recommend going to the doctor once more for renewal of the antibiotic or prescription for a stronger one.  If you are worried about what is going on in the breast are and whether or not this might might be something malignant, i think that mri now is being used by some to search for malignancy in the breast.  There is another remote possibility, that this could be shingles in an atypical presentation.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Enlarged lymph node in back of neck",
    "content": "Ok, this is it.  Around 13-15 months ago I had a swollen lymph node in the back of my neck. I can't remember if it hurt or not but think it did.. It wasn't all that hard if I remember correctly. Sorry didn't pay that much attn.. I figured it was just an infection and went to the dr. and he did agree and gave me some antibiotics and said if it didn't go away to go to the surgeon. Well, it didn't go away, however, it did go down alot. So I ignored it. It has since been getting big again and oh yes a few months ago I went to give blood and almost wasn't able because they said i had a slight fever but i felt fine and they waited and it went down low enough for me to give like .1 down below.  I do freeze almost constantly to the point where my husband and kids are hot. I am young I am 28 and have heard lymphoma is usually much older.  My sister had bone cancer and it did spread to her lymph nodes and she was 16 at the time, my other sister had mylenoma(sp) and she was around 21 I do come from a very strong back ground of cancer. One cousin was 24 with breast cancer she is the only one in my family who had that. We have a variety of different cancers. I do have pcos, I am not overweight anymore and within normal weight (textbook) at the higher end. I did have cervical cancer as well. It was aggressive and the gyn was surprised at how much so. within like a span of 4 months it went from mild dysplasia to cancer. and how it was shaped she couldn't get it all but burned around it to prevent spreading. the biopsy before leap was at severe dysplasia and day of leap she said she saw cancer cells and was amazed at the rate it went and the shape of it. I don't know what all that means.. I went to the dr. last week today. It was bigger then 2 cm he said. It is hard, painless, but it will move side to side not up and down but still movable. He wouldn't do blood work of any kind. he said i get the biopsy done and come back and we will do blood work then. Everyone in my family who has had cancer had bloodwork,x-rays or of the like. He was the only dr. there and was already an hr. behind and he sat there for additional 20-30 mins. discussing lymphomas with me and telling me this needs to be biopsied asap. He was acting as if it is lymphoma but everything in me is saying it isn't. It went down before and it feels like it is going down again. If it is cancer wouldn't it not go down but get bigger. He knew that before it went down i told him so. He jsut said since on how long I have had it he really wanted to get it checked out further. He did and i am not exaggerating this either. He was without saying it telling me it is lymphoma. I just don't think it is. I have had low fever (I guess) 99.7 usually.. I think it was just an infection and scarred tissue and that is why it won't go all the way down. My point is I don't have insurance and have alot going on right now. My husband and I are bying a new home and starting a small business and all the money is going to that.  I am not saying I am not getting the biopsy I just think he was being to cautious. I asked him is this something that could wait a few more weeks when things start to settle and he went on saying how my life is worth more then a million dollars and what good is all of this if I am not around. So, I feel like I am obsessing over this but I can't get his words out of my mind. I was feeling like I had the flu mainly this yr almost everyday but for the past few days feel better. I do think I may be anemic or thyroid I don't know I do have extreme fatigue but that is even feeling better for the past three days. I just need another opinion. My husband says it isn't going down but it is. I think he thinks I won't go if he tells me it is going down but that isn't the case. I can see it in the mirror still from a side view but it definately is going down.  I have been on amox for exactly one week, today. I go for consult on the 28th. but haven't heard good things aobut her. but have heard the dr. i went to is very conservative and doesn't make you take unnessary test. but i think he may be.. I would've like or felt better if atleast we had some blood work and soemthing fishy came out of that. He wouldn't though, I asked..  what do you think about all of this.. Sorry, this is long but i tried to be very descriptive so you would have a better picture of it.  P.S I do have two lymphnodes next to the big one which is still small but are growing but it is different then my others it is like two hooked together?? I don't know what is up with that. I didn't even bring it up to the dr. he had already scared me enough and just wanted toleave. One on the other side is normal but can feel which i know is common. Not worried aobut that. Last pap./breast the dr felt lumps and wanted em to go to surgeon but didn't she did say she didn't think it was cancer. I am not one of those who freaks out over everything. However, this dr. scared me and this is the first dr to have done that.  Thanks, wish\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wish: Your name suits the problem.  You are wishing the lump would go away.  In fact you are wishing it so hard that you actually see it getting smaller when someone objective, like your husband says differently. I am sure your husband wants this new house and new business to succeed.  But he doesnt want it at the cost of risking your life.  With your history of cancer and your family history of cancer you know you are at a much higher risk than norm.  The fact that the doctors words keep haunting you is your own conscience telling you what you should do.  Do you really think that any doctor online can diagnose cancer from afar without seeing you? This doctor, you saw, has much experience and wisdom and you should not think so lightly of that.  Let his haunting words motivate you to take action and have this thing biopsied before its at the point where you have less of a chance for a good outcome.  The fact you say its getting smaller but you have two more lumps shows that if its infection its not going away.  If it was going away the lump would subside, not two more develop.  If not for yourself, for the sake of your husband and your future get it biopsied.  Heres wishing for a good outcome. Thanks for using The Doctor's Lounge, Carolyn\n\n",

That morning i developed a lump.   It is located about level with my earlope, at the right side almost a finger length behind my ear.  Just above my hairline.  Itis rather large, dart shaped, long ways across my head.  It has not gotten any bigger but it does shrink and then flare up again.  I went to a few clinics, cause my docpast a few yrs back and i havent been able to obtaiin a good doctor in the area.   The clinic told me it was nothing more then a pulled muscle...get a massage, take some advil for swelling.  I am concerned that doctors are not looking at this the way they should.  should i be worried.  Is there anything i can do for it myself.  No headaches,(other then stress), its not sore to touch, nor sore, just a little uncomfortable, enough to know its there.  Please Help anyway u can. Urgently awaiting a response.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MyBabe,  i can not tell you what the nature of this lump is because i have not examined you myself. This lump could have been there for a long time and you noticed it only when you woke up with your neck kinked and turning and you might have felt your neck and accidentally stumbled on this lump and this is the way most lumps are discovered, accidentally.  Concluding from the area where the lump is, it might be a lymph node, a sebaceous cyst (collection of the oily lubricating fluid of the skin), a lipoma (benign fatty tumour) or other lumps orignintaing from the skin itslef.  Since it is not causing a major discomfort, i would suggest that you follow it for any change such as sudden increase in size, new onset pain or redness. Any change should prompt a visit to the clinic.  i don't think there is any thing to worry about now.

So that he can examine the draining area to rule out any serious causes of enlargement of lypmh nodes. 3.

    "content": "My child is almost 17 and he has an enlarged lymphnode in an armpit for a long time now (>1.5 years). First we were advised it is nothing and happenes, maybe infection. Blood test was normal. The node is not huge, but perhaps close to 1 cm. He also has another lump behind his ear, and we are told it is nothing.  Last year we have discussed a catscratch disease with the doctor - we have a cat in the house, but she rarely scratches, but the lump is always there. It's present there for about 1.5 years or more. I don't check it every day obviously, but several times during a year I did.  At the present time we are getting ready for the biopsy, but should we have some other tests done first? What are the pros and cons for biopsy? Pros are mostly clear, but are there any cons? Let's say nothing is found, then why it is there for such a long time? No visible signs of any other infections are present, mostly he has scratches and bruises from his activities. Another thing: during his early years he used to have all his lymphnodes enlarged immediately if he gets sick.   Please help and answer and advice  Can it be just an allergic reaction to paints ? (he uses oil paints) or anything else?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Karu,  An enlarged solitary lymph node for 1.5 years most probably does not represent much, in the case of groin and armpit lymph nodes, drainage areas are not the cleanest areas in the body, so sometimes, there is just chronic non-specific lymph node enlargement in these areas.  Are there any other symptom of chronic disease such as fatigue, weight loss, low grade fever or night sweats? If no, then most probably there is nothing to worry about.  A biopsy is a good step for diagnosis, it is usually a simple procedure but you will have to discuss the potential complications with the surgeon who is going to perform the biopsy.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

It is very painful and has made it quite uncomfortable simply walking.  The node it's self is very red with almost a white hugh to it and there is a very large area around it that is pink.  I feel fine other wise and see no skin irratations that I would expect to cause this.  It has gotten to the point that a call to the doc may be in order tomorrow but Iwas just curious if anyone had any ideas for diagnosis or even pain releif.  Thanks for any insight. KH\n\n",

    "content": "My 33 yr old daughter discovered swollen (not painful) lymph nodes at the base of her skull, armpits, neck, groin, on clavicle 5 weeks ago. She went to family doctor and he did a CBC and mono test, which were both normal.  He ordered a biopsy and she had that done the next week. The surgeon was very suspicious of lymphoma, but it was benign. The nodes are still swollen and she has an intermittent low grade fever and is extremely fatigued.  The path report comments:  The histological findings are nonspecific but consistent with a reactive process.  Multiple infectious diseases including infection with Epstein-Barr virus, toxoplasmosis, HIV infection and syphilis can result in similar histological findings.  Also included in differential diagnosis is reactive lymph nodes due to systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, dermatopathic lymphadenitis and early sarcoid.  Clinica correlation is recommended.  She does have an appt Monday with family doctor to begin the necessary tests to rule these things out.  My question is, do cancer cells always show up in the biopsy, if lymphoma is present?  Her symptoms fit lymphoma more than any of these other things. [/quote]\n\n",

An excision biopsy is the most definitive diagnosis for lymphoma. Certain criteria inlcuding monoclonality would easily differentiate between lymphoma and reactive lymph node enlargement. However, there are times when the diagnosis is not so straight forward and in this case follow up is advised. Its good that the other causes will be excluded soon. If it turns out that she has any one of these things that would clearly exclude lymphoma.  Best of luck.\n\n",

This morning when I woke up I had nothing. They just appeard like that. The right one is slightly more swallen and a little more painfull then the left one. Can you tell ne what may have caused this? I also mention that I have no cancer history in the family and one important info may be that I am always on a diet and I have very disordered meals ( like I eat once a day when I get home from work, in the evening.). I smoke a lot and I usually drink too muck coffee. Thank you  Andreea\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there  I have had a swollen lymph node in my neck on the left side for the past three months.  Sometimes I feel swollen glands under my jaw and somtimes feel minor pain into my ear.  I have had neck pain on the left side which came with what seemed to be some swelling of the left side of my head, right down the middle.  Could all this be caused by an impacted wisdom tooth?  I had some dental work done in January which caused me tooth aches for two months after.( had two fillings done and two replaced)  My teeth were sensitive to pressure and hot and cold.  Now they are fine.   After all that dental work,  I think it must have encouraged the impacted wisdom tooth to move again because for a week I could not sleep on that side.  The tooth is already badly impacted into the root of the molar next to it.  I feel no tooth pain now but I am wondering if it caused some kind of an infection which could be causing this gland to stay swollen. The gland is hard and does not move and is not painful.  Also, I have lost 10 lbs in the last two months and this is very unusual for me. I haven't gained a pound of it back and it's not for lack of eating.  Also, my throat is sore on and off and in the last two weeks, my stools have been very narrow. Could this have anything to do with stress?  Any advice would be much appreciated  Chantal\n\n",

I urge you to visit your doctor and get your node examined, if it's still there.  bill\n\n",

Like if it's submandibular or jugular or supraclavicular? Did your doctor aspirate the node with a needle before determining it to be reactive in nature?  As for your dentist's opinion that your jaw is what is inflamed, I wonder if he could figure out if it's the bone or soft tissue (like from a spreading infection from the oral cavity) that is actually inflamed.  Has any of your care-providers prescribed you with medicines?  bill\n\n",

The doctor did not aspirate it and I have not seen my dentist again yet to ask him if it's a bone or soft tissue problem.  He tried to fix my bite by drilling a little on a tooth for a better 'fit' but it seems to have made the problem worse.  The day he did the drilling he said 'If that doesn't work , have the wisdom tooth taken out'. I think the more work and drilling etc he is doing on that side, the more 'off' or out of alignment my jaw is getting.  Now the right side is beginning to bother me somewhat.  Could my sustained weight loss be due to my body fighting the inflammation?  I also have a stomach problem (overactive stomach acid) for which I take Pantoloc.  when I lost the weight , it was after I took some anti inflammatories and it really hurt my stomach.  It took three weeks for my stomach to feel better.  This was around the same time I started having the 'swollen lymph node' and dental problem.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband is 32 years old and has always been in very good health, last year he noticed a small knot under his left arm pit and finally went to the doctor, they told him it was a swollen lymp node and gave him an antibiotic. he never told me until last week but the knot never went away, he is one who does not go to the doc unless it is bad, well he has been complaing with the same arm saying it is aching and feels like he has hit his funny bone and the two end fingers are starting to go numb for a moment or two. well the knot has gotten bigger so we went to the doc on thursday and he said it was definatley something there but it felt like a cyst to him so he sent us for a ct scan of his upper extremities. the ct scan come back saying they seen no cyst but did see a small mass of some sort maybe a lymp node, they said they felt that it needed a biopsy so the next day sent us to a surgeon. we went today for the consultation and took our ct scan pictures and the surgeon come in felt of the knot and said that the knot was normal he said my husband has large lymp nodes which may be true but why would it just come up on one side and with all of these sympoms? he started saying that it was not nothing to do with this knot that the knot was normal and just totally looked over this whole situation and started saying that his problem was neurological and needed a nerve test done, i was arguing saying we wanted a biopsy done and he said he wanted this done first, well the closest appt. that we could get is 3 weeks away and my point is i do not agree with this dr. i am a nursing student and for what little i do know is this does not sound normal, he kept saying that it was my husbands ulnar nerve but for what research that i have done on the ulnar nerve that is not even really associated with his under arm it is more associated with his elbow which he is having no problems with! my question is what does this sound like and should we get a second opinion, i do not want to waste time, we have 2 small children and a life ahead of us and i do not want to loose my best friend i want to do everything i can, my husbands paternal grandmother had lymphoma in her neck lymph nodes and had them removed and chemo and now she is fine, so my other question is does this sound like cancer at all or just some benign mass of some sort?  All the docs around here i feel like i can not trust with my husbands life!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your post to The Doctor's Lounge.  I cannot tell you any specific info about the lymph node since I have not examined your husband or seen his films.  Given the neurologic symptoms being experienced, it seems reasonable to me to have further evaluation done.  The question is what is the next step.  If you do not agree with the recommendations from the surgeon or have confidence in him, then getting a second opinion woul dbe in order.  Not everything found is a cancer and not everyhting found is biopsied.  However, it would be helpful to get another opinion about whether to biopsy the lymph node.  One can do such even while seeing a Neurologist.  I would condider getting an MRI (unless it has been done already) to see more the anatomy ehre this lymph node is sitting and to see if it is affecting any nearby nerve structures.  The ulnar nerve starts high in the arm, as do all nerves in the arms, and thus something high up in the arm can be affecting it and such is felt lower down the pathway of the nerve.   This could be one possibility as to the pain or nerve feeling being experienced.\n\n",

    "title": "Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma",
    "content": "My husband was diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in March of 2003. He went through several treatments with the CHOP chemo and rituxin. He is now having to do the treatment with rituxin 4 times a month(every 4 months). When they first found his lymphoma, it was on the  liver, kidney, lymph nodes under his arms, and 10 percent in his bone marrow. Since then, the doctor has only ordered one series of tests to see what the treatment was doing for his cancer. He only done ct scans. He didn't do another bone marrow test. We have a friend who has cancer now and is having a test called PET Scan done. Is this something our doctor should be doing for my husband? Also, his left breast (mostly the nipple) is really tender. His cancer doctor is not concerned. He says everything is going as he wants it to. However our family doctor went ahead and done a mammogram and it showed a benign tumor. This was done in December of 2003. His breast is still very tender. Should we address this again with his cancer specialist? I know this is two questions for you. I would appreciate anything you can do to help us with these questions.  Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your question to The Doctor's Lounge.  Please note that I am limited in what I can do to give you information since I am not privy to your husband's case and I have not seen any of his tests results or examined him in person.  Any information that I provide does not replace the expert advice of your husband's doctors.  PET scans can look at the lymphoma in a different way than can the CAT scans.  The PET scans do not replace the CAT scans, but can add to the information.  The PET scans are not always done, but more and more PET scans are being used along with CAT scans.  Sometimes lymph nodes may look normal in size on CAT scan but can \"light up\" on PET indicating residual disease.  Regarding the finding in the breast, it either can be monitored closely for changes and if such changes do occur, then proceeding with a biopsy or it can be biopsied now to make certain that it is benign.  My best to your husband.\n\n",

I've had trouble in this area for about 3-4 years now, but never to the extent of this last time.    The day after the cyst was removed, I noticed a hard lump below the incision.

    "content": "Dear Mike,  The swelling at the incision site could be either a small hematoma (blood collection) or a small seroma (serous fluid collection) either of which is not an unexpected minor complication of any incision. It also could be another smaller cyst that the larger cyst that was removed was covering and got exposed once the bigger cyst was removed.  Regarding the swelling in your right breast, if you have had quite a few surgeries in your arm pit (and you don't mention what kind of trouble you had), this is where the lymphatics of the breast usually drain and they can get interrupted by the multiple surgeries you had and so the lymphatics vessels were cut and the lymphatic fluid is not being drained properly and hence the swelling in your breast (assuming that the swelling is not a localized mass like a tumour).  i guess you should the doctor who took the cyst out and see whether he could like to start you on antibiotics as some of the surgeons would do to prevent this mass (whether it is a hematoma or seroma) from getting infected. In the same time, draw your doctor's attention to your breast swelling.  All this of course assuming that the cysts that were removed have always been benign without any signs of malignancy.

    "title": "Lymph nodes",
    "content": "Tylerand,  Thanks for posting a question here at The Doctor's Lounge.  First, enlarged lymph nodes do not imply a cancer or a lymphoma.  Most enlarged lymph nodes are not such and are due to \"reaqctive\" reasons, such as infections.  Second, if an enalrged lymph nodes becomes even bigger or if other enlarged lymph nodes appear, then a doctor should do an evaluation and an examination.  Sometimes blood tests and/or imaging scans are done, depending upon what is going on in a particular case.  Third, there can be enlarged areas of fat under the skin that appear as lumps.  These are almost always benign findings and are called lipomas.  They are usually small to moderate in size.  They tend to soft and rubbery, a bit firmer than the surrounding skin and fat.  If an enalrged area is firm or hard like a rock, then it should be evaluated.  Not all of these findings are cancerous, however.  Fourth, it is always a good rule of thumb to have something of cancer checked out.  In my medical practice caring for patients with cancer and blood disorders, I tell my patients that I would rather see 100 patients with \"problems\" and find out that 99 of them are not anything of concern then to have have that 1 patient with a serious problem not be evaluated and that serious problem missed.  In your case, it is difficult for me to give you any sepcific diagnoses to your enlarged lymph node since I am unable to examine you.  What was the infection that you had recently?  Where was the infection?  Where were the other enlarged lymph nodes that you noted when you had the infection?  If the enlarged lymph node is in the groin area, are the genitalia O.K.?  Are you having any fevers or sweats?  These are some questions that come to mind.\n\n",

What this means is that they can be increased, sometimes high, when some other process or illness occurs.  It is a general, nonspecific sign of an illness and in and of itself does not imply anything specific.  There are some cases when a high ferritin is specific to a disease, such as in body iron overload (i.e.- hemochromatosis).  In the case of cancer, a high ferritin is a nonspecific result of the cancer affects on the bosy and is not a cause of the cancer.  Jeffrey A. Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jimswife,  With your previous history of both breast and thyroid cancer (and especially the thyroid) i would be really vigilant about getting a fast and reliable answer about the nature of these lymph nodes as they may represent recurrence of the thyroid cancer. Most probably you had a thyroidectomy, taking synthroid and following with an endocrinologist. Recurrence or extension of the thyroid cancer to the lymph nodes of the neck depends on the type of thyroid cancer. Your tsh test should be followed by an endocrinologist to be able to adjust your synthroid dose (to decrease tsh to inhibit the growth of any thyroid tissue). My advice is to schedule an appointment with your doctor who is following your thyroid cancer as a first step.

If you start to have any new symptom such as pain in your neck at the site of the nodule, difficulty breathing, difficulty swallowing, new masses in your neck or if the nodule is getting larger faster, these are considered alarming symptoms and you will have to call your doctor about them.

    "title": "Swollen lymph nodes",
    "content": "At the beginning of November I went to the doctor due to sever fatigue.  He found a large lymph node on the back of my neck and took blood.  His inital guess was mono but bloodwork came back negative.  My white count was slightly elevated and it showed I was slightly anemic.  I was out of work for 3 weeks due to fatigue.  The lymph node on the back of my neck has not gone down at all since and now there are more enlarged nodes in my neck (two on each side and two under my chin).  I've taken Penicillian for 2 weeks and then erythromycin for 2 weeks (whcih I just finished) and the nodes have not responded.  It's been about 9 weeks now.    Yesterday I noticed that the nodes in my groin are now enlarged and also have something that feels like more nodes on the back of both of my knees (I'm not even sure if there ARE nodes in that area...).  None of these nodes are painful.  I've had some soreness in my knees randomly and I can hear my pulse in my right ear almost all the time lately.  I also notice that my heart rate seems to speed up sometimes, mostly when I'm laying down, but doesn't usually go over 100.  My normal resting heart rate is about 70 and when it's racing it will be in the high 90's - 105.  I have no signs of infection, but do have a low-grade temp sometimes (like 99.9).  Also, an EKG he did on my first appointment showed abnormalities (he didn't elaborate and I didn't ask), but he said it was nothing to worry about.   Tonight my upper abodomen feels really full and I'm starting to worry.  I've eaten almost nothing today (apetite isn't too hot) but feel like I'm stuffed.  I have an appointment with my doctor on Friday.  Should I try to see him sooner?  What kinds of questions should I ask?  Up until now he hasn't seem too concerned about all of this although he has mentioned taking a biopsy if they don't go down.    Any response will be greatly appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

If the swollen lymph nodes do not go away, then I would talk with your doctor about a further evaluation, such as a biopsy of one of the lymph nodes, lab tests for any possible infection problems, and perhaps CAT scan imaging of the chest and abdomen to look for any enlarged lymph nodes that cannot be seen otherwise.  My best to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had swollen lymph nodes for about 10 weeks now.  I've been on 3 different antibiotices in this time period and none have made  a difference in the size of the lymph nodes.  They started in my neck, about 2cm on either side of my neck.  Since then I now have swollen nodes in my armpits, groin and behind my knees.  My doctor has given me a referrall to an ENT specialist to have a biopsy of the nodes in my neck and has also scheduled a CAT scan.  Everything I've read online has pointed towards lymphooma or leukemia. I'm really freaking out...  Is there anything other than cancer that can be causing these symptoms?  I don't have any signs of infection, the major thing I have is fatigue and a general feeling of just not feeling good.  I also have some abdominal discomfort, although it's not consistent.  I feel very full after eating a little bit of food sometimes and sometimes get sharp pains in my abdmoen, but they pass pretty quickly.  Bloodwork was done about 10 weeks ago and showed only a mild elevation of wbc and that I was slightly anemic.  Doc has not had any bloodwork done since then.    Are there any other tests I should be asking for?  Is an ENT the right kind of specialist to be seeing?  I have very good health insurance and can go to whoever I want to, so any suggestions will be greatly appreciated.  I am otherwise in very good health, never had any problems and am usually very active -- dancing, yoga, go to the gym.  Feeling this tired is killing me!!!   Thanks for any insight/reassurance you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Dr. Sekhar,  Thank you for posting such an interesting case on The Doctor's Lounge.  It appears that the conjugated bilirubinemia developed before any of the ABVD chemotherapy was administered.  How large was the liver biopsy?  What else was seen or not seen on the liver biopsy?  Have the liver tests improved once the chemotherapy treatment was started?  Has the patient responded to the ABVD chemotherapy?  The predominat elevation of conugated bilirubion appears to rule out hemolysis causing the anemia.  In significant hemolytic anemias, more unconjugated than conjugated bilirubin is released.  In addition, the anemia is usually macrocytic if there is an increased number of reticulocytes.  I have two initial thoughts based upon my experience with patients with Hodgkin's lymphomas.  First, there may be lymphoma in the liver not seen on the intitial liver biopsy.  I would consider obtaining a second liver biopsy from a different part of the liver.  Second, there may be a loss of bile ducts in the liver.  There is a syndrome, albeit it rare, of \"vanishing bile ducts\".  A thorough review of the liver biopsy would be in order.  I would consider a second liver biopsy.  If the former problem is causing the bilirubinemia, then it should improve if the lymphoma is responding to the chemotherapy.  If the latter problem is the cause, then it does not improve with treatment of the lymphoma.  I do not know the incidence of Hodgkin's lymphoma with various congenital disorders.  Perhaps someone else can comment about such a relationship.  Please post more information about how the patient is doing and if anything further has been found to explain the high bilirubin level.  Jeff Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Lump Under the Armpit",
    "content": "Hey! I have a rather strange thing happening. About 3 weeks ago I got a swollen bump in my right side armpit. It steadily increased in size and was about the size of a golf ball a week later. It hurt a little bit when pushed on. I wasn't too worried about it, thinking that it was probably just a swollen lymph node, but i have had several new symptoms of something come. The major one is a rash that is all over my entire body except my head. It is just under the surface of the skin and is a lite reddish/purplish color. It does not itch, burn, or peel, and is not raised; it feels just like my normal skin does. The heaviest concentrations of this rash are on my stomach. I also have had swollen hands and feet when i wake up in the morning and I have felt pressure behind my eyes which I believe made my blood vessels burst in my eyes. It feels like I have fluid in my right ear. When the first lump got under my armpit, I thought that it might have been cat scratch fever. The only thing is, is that I have already gone to my family doctor twice over this and he doesn't believe it is cat scratch (my white blood cell counts are normal). I had blood tests sent off to be analyzed but the results for them haven't come back yet. I do know that they ran an infection detector (sedrate) on me and it was in the normal range (0-15). So I don't have an infection. I overall feel in normal shape and health. I'm 18, weigh 145 lbs., and am 6 feet tall. I have always been in good health but whatever I have right now has puzzled my doctor and he has been in contact with doctors in Riley Hospital in Indianapolis, IN and they are a little stumped as well. I might also add that I haven't had a fever, but my temperature has been a bit lower than normal; about a 95-97 range. The swollen gland or whatever it is under my armpit has gone down by size a bit and is now about the size of a marble and doesn't hurt anymore. If anybody has ANY possibility or lead as to what this could be, I would greatly like to hear it. It has been almost a month now since I first noticed the initial swelling in my armpit. Thanks!  jglair\n\n",

    "content": "Jennifer, It could be a lymph node or it could be nothing at all. I cannot judge from here obviously. An enlarged lymph node does not necessarily implicate cancer. It could be a normal reaction to an infection in the area of the ear, scalp, face.. Usually however, they are not stone hard. Clinically significant lymph nodes are those that are larger than 1 cm.  From what you've described it could also be the normal bony prominence behind the ear (called the mastoid process) and that you are just worrying too much. In such a case you should be able to feel another one on the opposite side.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Betty,  Sorry for the delay in your receiving a response to your question.  Do you mean \"lymphoma\" when you asked about \"lymph canal cancer\"?  Your question is not a simple one to answer given that there are many variables involved in formulating a prognosis for lymphoma.  First, lymphoma is a large disease entity, encompassing numerous different types of lymphomas, each with their own specific issues relative to treatment and survival.  Second, there is a standardized staging system for lymphomas that does have prognostic information relative to survival (generally, survival decreases as the stage increases).  Third, there is an International Prognostic Index used for different lymphomas that combines various variables into defined categories that carry prognostic information relative to the successfullness of treatment and long-term survival.  Fourth, there are other characteristics of specific lymphomas, the presence or absence of which do carry important prognostic information (for example, in the common diffuse large cell lymphoma, the presence of bcl-2 may imply a worse prognosis than if the bcl-2 were absent, but this may be overcome with the use of a specific monoclonal antibody (rituxamab) incorporated into the treatment).  Fifth, a person's overall medical condition and general health status are very important because someone who is medically unfit is not expected to tolerate  chemotherapy whereas someone who is medically fit could withstand the effects of such treatment.  In sum, each type of lymphoma has various variables that need to be taken into account when talking about prognosis.  Like any cancer, a discussion of survival issues in a lyphoma situation must be individualized to the clinical presentaion and the person affected by it.\n\n",
