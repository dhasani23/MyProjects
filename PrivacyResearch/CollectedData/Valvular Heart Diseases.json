    "content": "Hi, Non-fasting lipid profile is alright for screening purposes only. Some studies have indicated that screening non-fasting adults for total and HDL cholesterol is appropriate for making decisions about primary prevention of coronary heart disease.  For therapeutic purposes, fasting profile is necessary. However, there are some exceptions. For instance, non-fasting, non-HDL cholesterol levels may be used for the management of dyslipidemia in hemodialysis patients(as the mandatory 12 hour fasting may not be practicable in these group of patients).   All your non fasting levels are high. Therefore,you must have your fasting lipid profile done to serve as a baseline for further therapeutic decisions and followup. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe aortic stenosis with moderate AR",
    "content": "Hi, In patients with severe aortic stenosis being considered for valve replacement surgery, the concomitant presence of intermediate degrees of mitral regurgitation represents an additional risk.  Mitral regurgitation (MR) associated with severe aortic stenosis (AS): can be  - functional, or  - structural.  - patients with a severe degree of MR have a worse prognosis, and are advised to undergo mitral valve surgery even if the MR appears functional.  - However, intermediate degrees of MR with no structural involvement is usually attributed to the pressure overload due to the aortic stenosis and alterations in ventricular anatomy and geometry (functional). Although it is generally believed that MR in these patients will improve or disappear after aortic valve replacement, no clear agreement exists about this.Functional MR is a common finding in patients with AS, with an incidence of > 60%. Its management, therefore, assumes great importance, as simultaneous repair or replacement of MR is associated with greater postoperative morbidity and mortality  Diabetes adversely affects the expected improvement of MR following aortic valve surgery. Role of diabetes mellitus in the lack of improvement of the MR after aortic valve surgery is thought to be due to the following two mechanisms;  - firstly, the indirect association between diabetes mellitus and coronary atherosclerosis, which in both its acute symptomatic form and its silent form adversely affects ventricular remodeling.  - secondly, the role of diabetic cardiomyopathy should be considered. Diabetes mellitus predisposes to the development of heart failure (by myocardial fibrosis or diabetic microangiopathy), even in the absence of significant coronary atherosclerosis, resulting in a less favourable ventricular geometry, thus hindering improvement of the MR after aortic surgery.  Increasing age also adversely affects ventricular remodeling   mainly because these patients often have greater ventricular dysfunction, more tricuspid regurgitation and more heart failure.   The increasing numbers of poor surgical candidates in the increasing very elderly population mandate less invasive methods such as Balloon aortic valvuloplasty (BAV) to improve quality of life. A resurgence of this procedure is becoming possible through improved understanding of the disease and refined transcatheter device developments.  The high rate of restenosis and the absence of a significant mortality benefit preclude its use as a definitive treatment option in adults with severe aortic stenosis.  Balloon valvuloplasty can be considered in certain selected indications. - in patients with severe congestive heart failure or cardiogenic shock, - as a bridge to valve replacement (palliative measure),  - for patients with other comorbid conditions with a very short predicted life expectancy, - for those who refuse surgery, - for those with heart failure who need an urgent major noncardiac surgical procedure, or - in pregnant women with critical aortic stenosis.  As you have been advised against the \"open\" surgical option, you may discuss with your cardiologist as to the feasibility and suitability of BAV in your specific case. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "possible pulmonary hypertension?",
    "content": "Hi. I am a 32 year old female (5'7\", 130 lbs) with a history of bronchitis and asthma that has been worsening within the past year. I recently did an EKG and echo with a cardiologist, as I was recording very high BPMs (180-190) during exercise. Findings from my echo test show that I have pulmonary arterial pressure estimated between 30-35 mmHg (33 was the doctor's estimate) and mild tricuspid regurgitation on my right side. The doctor also noted that a slight (very mild and \"nearly unremarkable\") increase in size for my right ventricle. My question is, should I be concerned that this is pulmonary hypertension? Are there other possible causes of this type of finding? Everything I have read suggests a diagnosis of PH is a fairly grim prognosis, so I am very scared. I have made an appointment with a pulmonologist, but am having to wait 3 weeks before being seen, and am terrified. Thank you for any insight you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your findings are very slightly suggestive of something pulmonary, they are also within the generally normal range. The right pulmonary artery pressure is on the high side of normal, given there are no other marked corollary abnormalities, and it seems there are not. \"Mild\" triscuspid regurge is in itself unremarkable, and borderline enlargement of the right ventricle is also a fairly common finding and something which can vary from study to study.   Your doctor is perfectly reasonable in referring you to a pulmonologist, mainly for the worsening obstructive pulmonary problems (asthma and recurrent bronchitis). Although these can sometimes be  the result of pulmonary hypertension, your overall clinical picture wouldn't support such a conclusion at all. On the other hand, these problems, chronically, could cause some of the very slight variations seen in your right heart study, and because of this they, again, do deserve the attention of a specialist.   My guess would be you do not now have nor are you likely to develop pulmonary hypertension. While the pulmonologist may want to follow you over time to see if there are any significant changes, as of now, based on the information you've provided, I don't think you need be worried about pulmonary hypertension. Just be certain you are properly treated for the asthma and recurrent bronchitis, and perhaps (if the doctor feels it's appropriate) plan to be re-evaluated on an annual or semi-annual basis to be sure there's nothing else going on.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed here.\n\n",

I should also mention that I have been experiencing occasional dizziness (eg, sometimes standing up from a horizontal position, or standing up \"too fast\") and SOB/ pounding heart after exercise -- especially taking stairs or walking up hills. This is what has me worried. I never thought much of these symptoms until seeing the cardiology findings so I don't recall how far back they go and therefore can't note if they've progressed.  I also had surgery for scoliosis in 2004 (had an \"S\" curvature of 55 degrees, now reduced to around 20 with titanium rod.) Could this also create 'false readings' on the echo or EKG that would suggest a favoring of one side of the heart?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  While the cluster of symptoms, including the new ones you've mentioned, could be grouped under pulmonary hypertension if it were likely, it still seems odd, considering that even if you were in the early stages, you would be unlikely to be symptomatic to this degree, so I am still pretty comfortable with the conclusion that something else is going on.  Also, while the rod correcting the scoliosis shouldn't skew the readings of an echocardiogram, the scoliosis itself might well be responsible for some of the symptoms  you're experiencing, due to the changes in pulmonary capacity it can cause in some cases. The ability of the entire thorax to work mechanically in concert can be thrown off to varying degrees by the curvature, which can result, in some patients, in a reduction in vital capacity and a number of other annoying problems.   Given all this, I am even more anxious to hear the results of your pulmonology consult. Meanwhile, try to manage your anxiety over the issue, as the story, thus far, at least, still argues, on balance, against pulmonary hypertension (or cor pulmonale, abbreviated \"CP\" for future reference). Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr Kenyon. I wanted to report back and let you know the outcome of my further testing for PH. Fortunately, after several extensive tests with a PH specialist, and another repeat echo, my doctors do not feel that I present with pulmonary hypertension. Rather, my PFTs showed that my lung capacity was more dramatically impaired by my asthma than I previously thought. I have since been put on a new inhaled steroid medication which has dramatically improved my SOB symptoms. My original heart rate complaint also seems to have lessened, as I am recording bpms in the 120s-160s through workouts now on the whole.  One follow up question I do have, which is still puzzling: my last two echos showed 'trace', or insignificant, pericardial effusion. None of my doctors have a clue what could be causing that, and were a little perplexed. Should I be concerned?\n\n",

    "content": "Great news! Thanks for this update. I'm always very happy to learn things are fine and it sounds as though you're already improving. Asthma can be very insidious, which is why it sometimes tricks people into thinking something else is going on and is often misdiagnosed or missed altogether. I'm so glad you've found something that works for you.  As for the trace pericardial effusion, this is actually quite common, and in otherwise healthy people who haven't had heart surgery recently (I'm pretty sure you haven't or that would have come up) it's usually the result of a passing viral infection. It can also be caused in some cases by anatomical anomalies or even persistent fits of coughing, which can, in some people, cause just enough irritation to the pericardium to create a little fluid in there. It usually will resolve on its own, but can also remain visible for a long time, so don't be surprised if, in the future, the same thing is noted again. As long as it remains \"trace\" and causes no symptoms, it's fine.  Good luck to you and keep up the good work.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr Kenyon, After this post some 18 months or so ago, I wanted to get back in touch with you with an update and a question on some new findings related to this matter.  After my examinations regarding PH (as documented by this thread), I was absolutely fine for 18 months... I even completed a half marathon without much difficulty, and while my heart would still occasionally pound after stair climbing, it didn't really affect me or wind me at all. Now, I am pregnant with my first child, and about 16 weeks along at this point. I've been a lot more aware of my heart rate since becoming pregnant; indeed it is back to easily pounding upon exertion, with some mild SOB. I know this can be quite normal in pregnancy but because of my previous cardio-history, my OB suggested I get another echo during my pregnancy to make sure all was still well. My cardiologist's echo findings noted continued mild tricuspid regurgitation, and also very mild mitral regurgitation, with some suspected mitral leaf thickening. My pulmonary pressures were estimated at 34 mmHg, with the highest recorded tricuspid jet at 2.7. The RV looked normal in size as did the LV. In contrast, my last echo about 12 months ago, showed estimated pulmonary pressures at 25 mmHg with a jet of 2.3. My cardiologist didn't seem terribly concerned with this finding, as he thought the increased blood flow of pregnancy was accounting for the increased velocity in the tricuspid valve (my flows were all raised across most other valves as well), and thus causing the estimated pressures to be calculated higher. What is your opinion on this matter? I would love to believe all is well, but being that I am pregnant, I am nervous about possible PH (I know it can have a grim prognosis in pregnant women). Thanks for your advice on this matter!\n\n",

I have had sharp chest pain, usually below my left breast, and difficulty breathing deeply for about ten years. The difficulty breathing deeply is always, while the sharp chest pain is constantly changing in frequency over the years, anything from once a month to twice a day. I have fainted about four times in the last few years, and am constantly lightheaded. I also had a seizure last year while doctors were taking blood. (I have no idea why...) I have low blood pressure: 90/60 is normal, not sure what it is when I feel lightheaded, and I am ALWAYS tired. I am constantly fatigued. Standing makes me tired, moving makes me tired, not doing anything, I am still tired. And now recently I have started feeling arrhythmia. It feels like it is skipping a beat usually, though lying down it feels more like a very uncomfortable quiver. I have felt arrhythmia for about six months, but not very frequently. It may not occur for a week and then I may have four in one day. I had a doctor give me a 24 hour holter, but I did not feel arrhythmia during that time, and the test of course didn't show it either. I did confirm though my feeling of arrhythmia in my chest with me actually feeling my pulse and feeling the arrhythmia in my hand. Anyway, hat I am most interested is in the title: arrhythmia, low blood pressure, fatigue. Listing all of this has actually made me a bit more worried, but hopefully someone can give me some kind of answer, at least as a guide. I really really would like an opinion as to what steps to take or any possibility of what it may be. Also, the doctor that gave me the holter, initially gave me an EKG, and from that said I have a heart murmur, but continued on as if it were nothing. Not sure what he based it on nor what a heart murmur is, if its serious, or has anything to do with my symptoms. Anything from you guys would help. Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, asdfasdf,  It is totally understandable that you would be worried about all of your symptoms.  To reassure you a litte, I'll point out that having the chest pain episodes for 10 years without having the episodes advance to a more serious situation is a good sign!  I do not mean to minimize the discomfort you feel, but to say that it does not appear to be life-threatening.  An irregularly-occuring arrhythmia is very difficult to diagnose.  You might consider discussing it again with your doctor in regard to a 48 or 72 hour holter monitor, and to discuss the possibility of a complete cardiac workup, including a stress test, echocardiogram, and any other test the doctor feels might be helpful.  It might help you to know that all of us experience arrhythmias at times; it's the frequency and the type of arrhythmia that determines how serious it is.  The impulse for the heart to beat can arise in different locations in the heart muscle; normally, it's in what is called the sinus node, located in the upper portion of the heart.  Thus, a \"sinus arrhythmia\" is one that starts from the correct spot, but misfires occasionally, and that can be entirely normal or acceptable.   Monitoring it by taking your pulse will not tell you what type of arrythmia it might be.    When was the last time you had a complete physical?  Your symptoms could be related to things other than a heart condition.  It sounds like you have become deconditioned physically.  If your physical examination reveals no serious problems, perhaps you could discuss a reconditioning program with your doctor.  It would generally consist of mild exercises, increasing over time.  This type of approach strengthens the heart muscle, as well as benefits the oxygenation of all the muscles in your body, which would help you feel more alert.  Do not do this without your doctor's supervision, however.  Have your doctor determine your body index; sometimes something like a weight-loss program can help tremendously.   Your blood pressure actually is quite good, barring any unknown condition.  It's on the low side, but within a normal range.  I hope this information helps you proceed in establishing your best state of health.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- MVP is essentially a benign abnormality in the vast majority of instances, but those who have it are inclined to experience more palpitations, benign arrhythmias and other occasional, odd symptoms, which can lead to a state of chronic anxiety (something which may also be associated with MVP independent of the symptoms). While the symptoms are largely only of nuisance value (not life-threatening) a lot of people who have them are distracted by them a good deal and do become anxious. This would be the only potential problem in any future plans for marriage, and it would be wise to determine whether someone you might consider marrying is willing to understand and be supportive of you with regard to this problem. As far as longevity is concerned there's no statistical difference between someone with MVP and an otherwise healthy person without it.   You've tried a number of different medications to help manage the symptoms, but I don't know how succesful they've been since you've changed them a lot. My personal favorite for treatment of MVP-related symptoms is metaprolol (brand name Toprol XL), as it tends to have the fewest side effects. However, any of these drugs can produce some side effects, and if your heart rate gets really fast (greater than 140 beats per minute without exercise) you may have an associated electrical derangement of the heart which could better be managed via electrophysiologic (EP) study with possible radio frequency (RF) ablation. This isn't likely to make the day-to-day \"skipped\" beats go away, but any sudden tachycardias, if they are quite fast and disruptive of your activities, may well be possible to eliminate by this procedure. It's something worth considering, and would make drugs such as carderone unnecessary.   Other than that it is mainly a matter of learning to live with relatively benign but sometimes startling sensations from the heart. Again, the only way this is likely to affect married life would be due to a spouse's inability to understand just how anxious these feelings can make you.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, JOHN,  Kashif here, thank you very much for detailed answer. May God bless you. it is true that there are side effects of these beta blocker. i will consult my Cardiologist and ask him about metaprolol and also the treatment you defined as EP. very personel i am telling you that i feel miss beats very frequently when i feel weakness after nightfall and masterbate or shortness of sleep. therefore i asked you about doing marry. i had tachycardia one time when i was going upstairs, over 160 beats so i scared of using upstairs. I know it is cyclogical and trying to overcome this. after meals my pulse getting faster and some times while sleeping. please suggest me the exercise that i can do. i am doing job in the bank 9-6 and not involve in any physical excercise i used to sleep about 6-7 hours a day. once again thanks for replying me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kashif -- When you speak to your cardiologist, also ask how he feels about your undertaking a formal exercise program. This often will help a lot in more ways than one, as it helps to relieve stress and anxiety while also serving to bring the two sides of the autonomic nervous system into balance. It may not solve the entire problem but, if your doctor agrees it is okay to do this (starting slowly but progressing and keeping it regular) you may discover the problems are a lot less bothersome. This would be my best advice regarding this. It would also help with the other reactive problems you mentioned, which would, in turn, make married life less worrisome and more enjoyable.   I hope this also is helpful and please let us know what your doctor says about both the medication and an exercise program.   Best to you John\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the good wishes.  Most of what you report, at this time, is relatively normal. Much of it is related to hypervigilance and somatic awareness. Most is within or near normal limits. I would follow doctor's advice to exercise in moderation and look forward to increased stamina over time, with hopefully less attention being paid to the far edges of normal cardiac performance.   Tachycardias and (more often) bradycadias are often noted following meals. It depends in large part upon the individual and what has been eaten as well as the emotional state of the patient. Generally following meals the heart rate will increase at first, but may slow in a while and drowsiness may increase the slowing. This can result in opportunistic but harmless premature beats as well.   What you describe is not life threatening, but the awareness of it can be emotionally disruptive. One must make every effort to let go the tendency to mentally monitor everything the body is doing and allow one's self to become distracted by more pleasant and important events taking place around one, interacting with others or paying attention to outside events -- television, reading, whatever draws the attention from the normal and natural variations in the various rhythms of the heart and other bodily functions.  Good luck with this. I realize it is far easier said than done.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome.  With MVP the symptoms and annoyances can be fairly random and inexplicable. It's something we just eventually get used to, learn to adapt to the annoyances. It can take time.  Regarding the echo report, what that means is there is mild outward bowing or distortion of the forward (frontmost) of the two leaflets, which is minimal criteria for diagnosis of \"prolapse\" (it could be a lot more \"floppy\" but is very little). Trivial regurgitation means just that, very minor and trivial, inconsequential but noted. Anything that doesn't conform to the specification of \"normal\" is noted, even if it is essentially meaningless. A huge minority of echo reports will show this finding in perfectly normal, healthy people from time to time. The \"normal LV dimension with normal function\" means your left ventricle, which is the real workhorse part of the heart, is working perfectly.\n\n",

    "title": "MVP with hypertension, high aerobic exercise capacity?",
    "content": "I am a 24-year-old male who is thin (5'10\" and about 145-150 pounds), with a strong capacity for aerobic exercise.  I generally run about 4.5 miles several times a week at a fast pace.  Despite this, I have had high blood pressure for several years.  I originally thought it was white coat hypertension, but even blood pressure measurements at the grocery store, after sitting for a couple of minutes, usually fall into the prehypertensive range.  I have tried to lower my blood pressure by running more and eating less salt, but it remains above average.  In addition to my blood pressure, I have also noticed two other circulatory-related symptoms that seem odd:  one, I often become dizzy when standing up suddenly; and two, my heart beats noticeably harder and faster during sudden exertion from being sedentary, even rather moderate exertion, like going up a flight of stairs.  This is true even though I can run for several miles without stopping.  My body almost feels like it \"shifts gears\" when I start running.  These symptoms seem to have appeared in recent years; I don't remember having these as a kid or adolescent.  After reading a bit about these symptoms, I noticed the first symptom is a frequent symptom of mitral valve prolapse.  However, I also have heard that most people who suffer from MVP also have a reduced capacity for aerobic exercise.  So, with all these facts in mind 1)  Is it likely that I have MVP, despite being a runner; and 2) if so, is it likely that my persistent hypertension is causing my MVP, or vice versa?  Thank you very much for any advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- There are a lot of questions here, but not too many facts to work with. For instance, while you state you have high blood pressure (or prehypertension) you don't tell us what numbers you're working with. That would be a big help. You also state you suffer from orthostasis (getting lightheaded upon standing after being at rest), which is a fairly common problem, especially among those who are relatively taller and thinner, but can happen in many people. You also note your heart beats \"harder and faster\" upon exertion after rest. This is also quite possibly normal, but again we have no numbers to look at to tell whether this is actually problematic or not.  You have looked up things on line and, in fact, suspect you might have mitral valve prolapse (MVP). Well probably 15 per cent of the healthy population has some degree of MVP, some with symptoms, most without. MVP will not, however, cause elevated BP, and is more often seen in association with lower BP or orthostasis. It's difficult to have both lightheadedness on rising and chronic hypertension.   You do sound like someone who is obsessive about his body's functioning, particularly the heart. Despite all this you are obviously aerobically very fit as you tolerate significant running exercise (which is absolutely great).   If you could provide some numbers re: resting and exercising heart rate and what you consider to be elevated BP, we might be able to sort this out for you, but the problem of overawareness of bodily functions (particularly the heart's action) belies a neurotic obsession that may not allow you to feel fully okay til you discover what's causing this somatic overawareness. It is usually some obscure emotional issue which gets played out in this fashion. Still, please give us some numbers and perhaps we can make a little sense out of your concerns.  Good luck to you. We'll be waiting to hear from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mr. Kenyon,  The problem with posting exact numbers is that they seem to vary quite a bit.  As far as blood pressure goes, it almost always follows the pattern of rising after mild exertion (such as walking from my car to the grocery store), and then decreasing (but still remaining higher than ideal) after a few minutes of sitting down.  For example, today my blood pressure was 157/97 when I first sat down at the machine.  After a few minutes, though, it had decreased to 134/86.  Two days ago, the numbers were lower--148/91 to start, and decreased to 125/79.  This change in pressure worries me.  My resting heart rate varies as well, but it generally seems to be about 65-70 beats per minute.  I have seen readings as low as 47, but I don't know if the machine was accurate in that case.  Again, thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "While there is some pretty significant normal variation in cardiac output during the course of a day, both rate-wise and in terms of blood pressure, there are upper limits, especially regarding BP, which need to be observed. So far what you've noted is on the high side of normal. For this reason it would be worthwhile to keep watch, occasionally, but while trying to duplicate the exact conditions each time (upon rising, mid-day, evening, for instance) and noting any stressful things going on at those times also.   As for the heart rate, you're in the normal range. The 47 you noted once could have been an abberation on the part of the machine, or it could have simply been caused by a pause or premature beat having fooled the calculations of the machine, which is often seen and is usually only perplexing for those who have frequent premature beats, since this can consistently throw off the accuracy of some (but not all) machines, since they perform a 15 second calculation for rate, multiplied by 4. If there is a missed beat during that period it will be multiplied by four at least, so the reading can often be quite far from correct.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- While echocardiography is not the gold standard for diagnosis of PAH, the results of your exam warrant your being followed or perhaps even being subjected to more specific testing to be certain this is what's happening and if there is an underlying cause or if it's a primary condition (assuming the diagnosis is correct). As it stands right now your doctor has said it's mild, and the problem with this is either it is mild and the echo is absolutely correct and so is the interpretation, or it's an erroneous finding and there's really nothing to worry about. PAH, as you likely know now, is usually progressive, so the sooner it is diagnosed precisely and treatment is begun, the better the outlook. As for what you can do on your own, the main thing is to remain fit and healthy as possible. You're tolerating the small, suggestive degree of possible PAH well right now. It may not progress or may be very slow in progressing, if it's actually present. I'd want to know more certainly, though, because early medical treatment can often delay or prevent significant progression.   So aside from taking good care of yourself via healthy living and levels of fitness, the other thing you can do is press for more accurate diagnostic testing. Other than that there's really not much you can change, add or subtract.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you! There is a threshold for invasive testing for PAH, and yes, RHC is the appropriate and most accurate way to determine for sure if that's what's going on. The determination as to when to do RHC is somewhat controversial, and the reason is that if the problem progresses slowly or reverses, the patient has been subjected to an invasive study for no really good reason. However, if you are greatly concerned you certainly could bring this up to your doctor and see where he stands on doing early RHC. If there is nothing found you then could relax completely about this issue.  The medication you're currently taking for blood pressure control is appropriate, but ideally the diastolic pressure would be a little bit lower, so perhaps the dosage needs to be upped one notch. Other than that everything seems to be in good order.  Please stay in touch and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again. The RVSP of 19 does, indeed, seem to lay to rest any concerns about PH. This is an excellent number. It also renders moot, for now, any concerns about the tricuspid regurgitation, which is a fairly common finding, especially the trival sort, which appears in the majority of normal, healthy patients. It is simply an artifact that must be noted because it is not considered \"normal\" by textbook standards. A CT wouldn't reveal anything new about the valve and, in fact, one with \"trivial\" regurge is pretty much a normal one.   This is all good news and its sounds as if a lot of worry can be let go now. Good for you! Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  First time posting here. I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse at a young age. I never noticed any symptoms as a child or teenager, but in my twenties I began noticing symptoms that could be related: lightheadedness, premature heartbeats, shortness of breath, chest pain, panic attacks, general fatigue, tendency to dehydration, etc... In short, the older I get the more symptoms I become aware of. Unfortunately, as I've been living overseas for the past three years in a country with fairly poor medical care, I haven't been to a doctor with expertise on this condition recently, despite two trips to the ER after my first two panic attacks. Both times EKGs came back normal as well as blood tests.   I am also an avid weightlifter, and often perform squats and deadlifts at weights upwards of 400lbs. From various searches I've performed on the internet I've read that it is not recommended for people with MVP to perform exercises that greatly increase thoracic pressure. I have yet to read an explanation as to why, however. I've also read that people with MVP are no more likely to suffer a heart attack than regular people. Basically, I'm looking for more insight on the subject. Is it dangerous for a sufferer of MVP to perform these exercises? Are there certain precautions I should take? I would hate to be required to give up weightlifting.  Some basic stats about myself: -27 years old. -Resting heart rate between 55 and 65bpm. -Light cigarette smoker -Occasional moderate drinker. -5'11'', 175lbs -vegetarian -Exercise 4 days per week for approximately one hour. Also, cycle on an almost daily basis.  I've just been concerned about my symptoms and looking for advice. Thanks so much. Best,  Travis\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Travis -- While nearly all MVPers can safely do as much as they feel like doing physically, there is that caveat about straining and heavy lifting, simply because this constitutes a Valsalva maneuver (stimulation of the sinus of valsalva by straining), which can cause a faint with consequent injury coincident with falling down. You've been lifting for a long time so, like most MVPers, you've already established what, if any, limitations you have. Doing what works for you should have no adverse effects. The only thing I would recommend -- and I'd recommend this anyway, to anyone -- is to have a spotter right there with you if you're doing extremely heavy bench pressing. Losing consciousness during such an exercise could be more than just painful. Other than that there's no reason you need to limit yourself beyond what your body tells you if feels like doing. MVP is essentially benign, although as you already know, it can carry with it certain odd problems you've already experienced. Staying hydrated is highly recommended too, in order to keep the fluid volume and blood pressure at normal levels.   Carry on. If you have any further questions please don't hesitate to follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: irregular heartbeats-eventual damage",
    "content": "Hi there -- You are in good company. Almost everyone  has this happen sometimes, and some  people have it most of the time. It can come and go rather randomly, and for some people can be very upsetting, while others don't even notice it's happening.   The short answer to your bottom line question is no, this will not damage your heart. Further, it is not diagnostic nor prognostic of anything. People with heart disease almost always have these things, but so does almost everyone else, so even in a clinical setting it means almost nothing. It is, in fact, unfortunate you've been diagnosed specifically with \"irregular heartbeat\", because it is such a common thing it shouldn't carry a specific diagnosis so much as a notation that it was happening at the time of a given exam.   Some of the people who have this more frequently also have a benign conditon known as mitral valve prolapse (MVP), and they often will have more frequent and varied sorts of palpitations, random (usually sharp) chest pains, and even sometimes shortness of breath -- yet tolerate exercise just fine (it's estimated half the NBA players have MVP).  In any event this is just a very common problem. While your doctor is correct in saying it's like a headache (I prefer to compare it with sneezing or hiccups), he is could have given you a little more reassurance at the time, rather than leaving you wondering. Sometimes a cavalier answer like that leaves a patient feeling he or she has been given the brush off. Actually doctors who do this simply forget how disturbing this can feel to a person and, knowing it has no clinical significance, overlook the emotional harm a response like that can cause.   I hope you find this reassuring. Some people accept the benign nature of these things but still have a hard time believing it won't do eventual damage. It won't. It just feels really weird, especially when it's happening a lot.  Please feel free to follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: irregular heartbeats-eventual damage",
    "content": "First, depending upon the muscle relaxer you used, you could risk actually aggravating the problem. Flexeril is one of the more popular muscle relaxers and is actually a tricyclic antidepressant which can cause or increase ventricular arrhythmias. If you used something like Skelaxin or Soma there shouldn't be any additional problem, but it's also not as effective against emergent anxiety/panic as Xanax is (and bear in mind Xanax is most effective as a \"rescue\" drug to abort panic attacks, not so effective for daily long-term use).   You might be surprised how many times I've had people ask if they coudn't just get a pacemaker or have some other electrical intervention to relieve the palpitations, but I'm afraid the problem isn't one which would respond at all to any of the more invasive remedies, which are designed to either convert a truly irregular heartbeat (as in atrial fibrillation) or pace a heart incapable of conducting all the regular beats from top to bottom. Premature beats, especially PVCs, occur in a pattern that is almost always involves a perfectly regular underlying sinus rhythm interrupted only by the occasional early beats followed by perfectly compensatory pauses. Atrial premature beats aren't always perfectly regular, since they reset the sinus rhythm each time, but are still not candidates for articiial pacing.  This actually is one of those times when what seems highly abnormal is actually relatively normal, and the only variation is in how randomly the premature beats appear in a given individual, with actual frequency not really a consideration. Unfortunately they can cause terrible anxiety because of the unpleasant sensation (and yet some people have them and never feel them). A beta blocker drug can sometimes help when the palpitations are causing the patient a great deal of emotional distress, and this would be a lot more effective than just Xanax. Definitely better than a muscle relaxer, although either may help you get a better night's sleep. The days are still likely to be difficult, though, until the premature beats suddenly seem to go away for no reason, which is the same way they usually show up.  Wish I could tell you something more helpful, but this is one of those universal complaints and it's very real, and though it is physically harmless it certainly can make life miserable. It can be very difficult to adapt to this going on, but trust me, when you are able to do this, the frequency of them will almost always diminish. It's strange but true.   Good luck with this and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: irregular heartbeats-eventual damage",
    "content": "You're very welcome. Flexeril has some pretty annoying side effects (feeling \"weird\" is certainly one possible one, as is feeling like a zombie for some people), but the potential heart problems, both arrhythmias and other stuff, make it a non-starter for someone like you who has a positive family history for heart disease. If you should need something else for this you might try Skelaxin, which while not as potent also doesn't have the multitude of side effects.  You're absolutely correct about the cycle of premature beats, anxiety, more premature beats. One of the things which will cause more of them (and they will occur at some time or other in most people anyway), is anxiety, and especially stress acompanying anger. Anxiety and anger both release large extra amounts of adrenaline, which irritates the heart muscle (as do most stimulants), causing more premature beats, which causes the subject anxiety, and so on.   A beta blocker often can break the cycle, and may well be calming also. It will slow the heart rate and possibly cause some lethargy early on, but much depends upon which one is chosen and what dosage. A low dose of metaprolol ER (extended release) often is just the ticket.  Since you have a positive family history for early heart disease you should keep this in mind as an additional risk factor, but premature beats are not especially indicative of anything in that department, since they happen anyway. You've been worked up by a cardiologist so you have a good basline heart profile, so just work on the stress reduction and anxiety management. The more of this you can accomplish without adding drugs, the better, but just know there are things in the formulary to help with this if you have difficulty with it.  All in all things sound very good. Keep up the good work and do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- First, you would seem to be doing really well overall, and are to be congratulated on the progress you've made as well as having chosen good doctors (or at least tripped over them). While the 3 cigarette habit isn't something I could endorse, it beats the heck out of a pack a day or more! If smokers only smoked 3 cigarettes a day there's be a whole lot less ill health worldwide. Still, needless to say, when you smoke a single cigarette, you add a significant burden to the cardiorespiratory system during the time the cigarette is being smoked as well as for some hours afterward. This is more important with significant left ventricular damage, of course, but at least you're at a known and minimal level. I hope you're able to eventually break it off completely, but for now that's real progress.  As to the pains: you mention the anterior chest pain is even tender to the touch. This isn't heart-related and since you've had bypass surgery you are especially prone to both costochondritis (inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs where they attach to the sternum) and just plain chest wall tenderness. Whenever pain can be elicited by manual pressure it is not heart-related. The other pain, that between the shoulder blades, is of course likely something else, and could conceivably be heart-related, but is more likely related to the chest wall tenderness in front or another orthopedic issue. The shortness of breath definitely sounds anxiety-related, mainly because it doesn't occur during exertion but at rest. And you must realize anxiety is extremely common in people with known heart disease, especially when there is a concern there may be something \"they missed.\" You've had a pretty comprehensive workup and are being followed. Yes, you did sustain your MI at a rather young age, but you've done very well since, especially considering the degree injury you sustained.  Continue to be followed regularly, check this pain (especially the upper back , infrascapular pain) by doing upper body movements and stretches to determine if you can duplicate the pain on movement, as this will rule out cardiac pain as well. And you might want to have asthma ruled out as a cause of both the chest discomfort and shortness of breath. There's nothing that says you couldn't have asthma. And of course consider a possible role for anxiety in this also. If all the physical things are ruled out you might want to consider seeing someone who practices cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), since you already know this is an issue, and CBT is often very effective in managing this problem. Finally, while I'd never say menopause makes women \"crazy\" it certainly can affect the mood a great deal -- this is not just a joke -- and with anxiety already present, menopause can aggravate this problem a great deal.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated as well. Good luck to you, and keep up the good work!\n\n",

    "title": "Mitral Valve with Vegetation Indicated What to do?",
    "content": "Thank You for taking time to consider my question.  Back in Jan 09 one of our family members had surgery to repair her mitral valve. Her orginal valve was sucessfully repaired and and all was reported normal after her surgery  However, in April this women started having trouble at time focusing her eyes which would be a transient problem lasting less then an hour.    Various MRI were performed but all returned negative.  She went to various Doctors but other then the MRI no one could say what was at work with her eye focusing issue.  I pushed that they could be TIA's but we live out of State and no one seemed to honor my logic.    This went on through-out the summer of 2009 perhaps once or twice a month with her eyes.  Then in Oct 09 she suffered a minor stroke but serious enough to have her hospitalized for a week and a half.  She is making a good recovery.  This time in the hopital they finally ran a TEE.  This echo was fairly unremarkable till the section that dealt with the Mitral valve.  Here it was noted vegetation was found on and around the mitral valve (to me this was a key finding).  No sizing data was presented re: the vegetation on the final report and which to date I have had no luck trying to get the Doctors to re-evaluate the digital data to provide sizing data.  Hence I have no way to say how large an area was being reported. I feel this was another key marker missed.  All cultures taken indicated a negative culture for infections as I am told.  Nor did this women have any signs of an infection (i.e. fever, joint pains etc. etc. prior to her stroke and there after).  Current treatment consisted of long term warfin as well as 80mg of Liptor and I am still trying to get her recent Lipid panel results, prior to her stroke her Lipid panel did not require the use of statins.  I have no real objections with Lipitor just general curiosity as to why such a dosage and what does her current lipid panel have to say.  The only feed back that thus far that makes sense to me is that her Cardiologist feels the clot came from her heart and seems to me why his choice of blood thinners as opposed to others.  Now my questions -  after doing a little research at the American College of Cardiology specifically http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/reprint/52/13/e1.pdf  using the search criteria culture negative (pages e8, e71-78).  I am left with the impression that the recommendation (minus the sizing data re: vegetation  I can\u2019t get) is to treat with antibiotics if less the 1 CM.  If larger then surgery seems to be called for.  Is there any other condition that would show vegetation on the Mitral valve other then infections with a culture negative repotr?.  Perhaps from the original mitral valve surgery itself?  Although all testing at the time of surgery indicated - successful repair.   If it would help I can say what was exactly done to the mitral valve to effect the repair but this is getting lenghty enough.  My fear is that there is perhaps a sub-clinical bacteria, microplasam pathogen slowly at work on the valve resulting in the finding of vegetation.  This women is 72 and further reading seems to indicate not all with heart valve infections (in the elderly) present with fever and/or other symptoms.  So my two questions are what other then infections could show on the TEE as vegetation and would you take the treatment plan thus far of blood thinners and Lipitor as the correct treatment regiment in light of the ACC recommendations to treat with antibiotics.  Since her stroke and new meds \u2013 I can\u2019t be sure but she may have had a TIA (numbness in her foot that lasted a half hour).  My fear is it might not be just blood clotting but infected tissue that is breaking away.  Your thoughts would be greatly appreciated to know if I am tilting at windmills. Sincerly, Wizbanger\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mitral Valve with Vegetation Indicated What to do?",
    "content": "Hello -- You've certainly done your homework. If this is, in fact, vegetative growth then either antibiotics and/or surgery are appropriate. However, it appears as though it is being treated as non-infectious. There are other vegetative growths that don't respond to regular antibiotics, but they do respond to appropriate medications (anti-fungals for example). What I'm really wondering, since this was uncovered via echocardiogram and stroke is consistent with a diseased mitral valve, is whether or not this is truly vegetative growth. It's been my experience that sometimes this is a pretty equivocal finding visually on echo vs. myxotomous growth (a sort of tumor, actually, myxoma) which sometimes can look exactly like vegetation or even a large clot. If the problem were treated with medication appropriate to either fungal or bacterial infection (or both if enough doubt exists) and it responded, that would pretty much be that. If it were unresponsive it would almost have to be, by default, a myxoma. Of course this can be determined more quickly by angiographic visualization in the cath lab, and sometimes a myxoma can even be romoved via this process.   You could be right about small bits of the growth breaking off, and sometimes both clot material and vegetative material have been found in thrombi removed from a patient. Whole clot is more common by far, of course, but either is possible and the real issue is that whichever form of growth is on  there, it favors formation of clots. The first stroke already happened, and warfarin is likely to prevent additional ones, but is a mixed blessing when it has to be used. If the problem could be resolved without indefinite use of warfarin it would be a lot better for the patient. Of course in cases where there's no other option it can be a lifesaver. However, if there's some disease on the valve and it was already repaired once, something is not right and it is likely to continue to grow or recur if not treated appropriately for whatever type of growth it is. To simply circumvent a cerebral event with symptomatic treatment seems odd to me.   The patient could easily not present with fever or other typical symptoms of infection with a subacute endocartitis (which is characteristic of \"subacute\" infections) and if it were a fungal growth this also would likely not cause fever. Myxoma would grow merrily with no fever ever.   The question remains: Why is this not being actively pursued beyond simply recognizing there is something growing on an already problematic valve? I have no idea, but were it me or my family member I would be strongly considering or advocating a second opinion. This isn't something normally just worked around. It can and should be corrected; if not, there should be a sound explanation. Obviously none has been advanced thus far. A second opinion should be considered, and if the patient lives near you there is a wealth of talent in the area in the cardiology field nearby.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you very much for your response.  This is further affirmation to me that a chance for the vegetation to be resolved is being missed before more damage is done.  If not addressed correctly, I fear additional strokes and or eventual mitral valve replacement will occur.    Plus, I too would hope that if the vegetation is resolved then perhaps the use of warafin could be discontinued or at least changed to a less problematic blood thinner (i.e Plavix or perhaps one of the newer ones coming online).  Since the surgery on the mitral valve occurred fairly recently (Jan 09) I feel it is not impossible that a myxoma growth could be involved but my guess would be somewhat low in comparison to the infections mentioned. Perhaps as you point out an angiographic visualization in the cath lab will be performed.  Lupus could also be a factor but there is no reason I would say to suspect she has this condition.  Hence, I agree fungal and/or bacteria are the most likely causes (it would seem) and the chance for a cure will only occur if the correct diagnosis is made and treated with the appropriate medication.  My next step will be to find a seasoned cardiologist that is current with the literature re: vegetation, wants to provide great patient care and who will work with an infection disease specialist to help nail down the correct diagnosis and treatment plan.  Thank you so much for your input, good wishes and helping confirm that there are reasons to get a second opinion. Sincerely Wizbanger.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 24 year old male, about 160lbs, 5'11, in excellent \"running shape.\"   About 10 months ago I started having unexplained, intermittent high blood pressure (it was high, once, at the store or something when I randomly decided to check it on one of those machines. After that, every doctor's appointment revealed high blood pressure.). Most doctors were not at all concerned with it. I attended a police academy and excelled physically: I can run for miles and never really get tired (my shins start hurting of course, but my lungs/heart feel like they can go forever).   About 2 months ago I went to the dentist and, of course, my BP was high. I decided to go to my new PCP (new insurance) and it was high there, too (like 150/100). He put me on a beta blocker. I take my blood pressure obsessively now at home, and over about 100 separate readings it has only twice been over 120/80 (and never above 130/80). 99% of the time it ranges from 90/50 to 111/70. I am suspecting white-coat hypertension, but that's another issue.  I had a stress echo done recently to rule out any secondary hypertension causes. The cardio said I had \"trivial\" tricuspid (sp?) regurgitation and \"moderate\" mitral regurgitation. He did not dx me with any sort of disease, and said I did not need antibiotics. He really did not seem concerned, but said for me to get another echo done in a year. These were the results of my echo:  1.) Normal stress echocardiogram with normal hyperdynamic LV response to stress. 2.) Normal LV chamber size and systolic function with an EF estimated at 55-60% 3.) There is moderate mitral and tricuspid regurgitation. Pulmonary artery systolic pressure is within normal range.  4.) There is normal antegrade flow across all cardiac valves. 5.) Resting BP was 118/72; peak blood pressure was 158/76.   I am really worried about the \"moderate\" mitral regurgitation. If it progresses or requires surgery or whatever, realistically I could lose my job. I am asymptomatic I think... my chest hurts sometimes, but I am sure it is anxiety which I have always had since a child. When I am relaxed my chest never hurts.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Moderate Mitral Regurgitation?",
    "content": "Hi there -- Your echo report came out beautiful. The term \"moderate\" mitral regurge is such a common notation as to mean very little, and currently nothing is being affected by this. You sound very much like a typical anxious patient, which is just what some of us are dealt as a hand in life, but it can be managed. Often the anxious patient does have a less-than-textbook-perfect exam and this, though extremely common, is productive of more anxiety. You also mention possible White Coat Syndrome, which is very common and seems likely given the story you've provided here. You even mention your \"obsessive\" checking of blood pressure, which is something which you can render meaningless that way, because our BP varies so much during the course of a day and different emotional states, etc., and trying to achieve an almost laminar charting of it would be self-defeating. Taking it once in a while, at specifice times, is the best way if one must do this at all. Once it appears stable and predictable within certain times and situations, it's then best to just leave it alone unless there is a hint of essential hypertention, in which case it can be checked once in a while to be certain it's not getting high enough to warrant medical management.   Right now the mitral valve is functioning well with \"moderate\" (may mean negligible) regurge, so all that's required is that it be rechecked on perhaps an annual basis. This is because it was not textbook perfect and could conceivably become more pronounced -- or not. Either way you'll want to know so as to manage it -- or not -- as needed. Chances are excellent it won't progress and many times these findings actually improve or disappear over a year's time, just as mitral valve prolapse (MVP) often shows up on one exam and is not visible the next time. So it's not anything worthy of your concern. The tricuspid valve is totally within nornal limits, and the main thing is your left ventricle is functioning 100% normally, which is the bottom line where heart health is concerned. So long as that's the case you really have no basis for concern. A practical person will follow up a modestly abnormal finding such as the moderate mitral regurge in about one year's time. The only exception would be if there were to be specific and pronounced symptoms suggestive of progressive malfunction, which is extremely rare in the course of a year's time anyway. So all in all your exam was pretty good and if it were me I'd take it and be really pleased.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: aortic valve stenosis symptoms inexplicable",
    "content": "Hi Robby -- The symptoms you mention are actually pretty well-recognized in cases of aortic stenosis, especially where the outflow tract is compromised. Patients often tolerate exercise well but have some angina-like pain after the fact, and cooldown is extremely important for these patients at the end of exercise sessions. However, the pains you describe really doesn't sound especially heart-related, but rather maybe musculoskeletal. The other stuff does sound heart-related, though, and I don't know why this would be especially surprising since it's established you do have some abnormality of the aotic valve. You also have biscupid phenomenon, so need to be checked annually for possible dilation of the ascending aorta, but again this doesn't sound like its causing your problems.   This doesn't have to be psychogenic to be present. You may be having either orthopedic chest symptoms, delayed aortic outflow tract problems (which could be caught be echocardiogram but only if it were done while the symptoms are being experienced, which is pretty difficult to arrange.  I'd suggest you continue to follow this with your cardiologist, make sure your exercise is followed by adequate cooldown, and on days when you feel the discomfort, fatigue and shortness of breath, take it easy and maybe try to arrange to make it possible to be seen during one of these periods. It's not easy to get a STAT walk-in with a specialist, but I can think of no other way (other than going directly to an emergency room) to get this evaluated while it's going on. This latter may actually be appropriate and could be the simplest way of determining what's causing this and if it's a reason for concern or just part of your natural up-and-down.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: chest pain moving to the lower lung",
    "content": "Hi there -- You describe your symptoms by identifying internal organs, but these are almost certainly not involved in what's happening. Your problem was originally diagnosed as a cracked rib and this is still possible. It almost certainly involves a rib or the cartilege between the ribs. Heart pain isn't sharp or stabbing in nature and angina is aggravated by exertion, not sleep nor lying down. Rib pain is often aggravated by lying down and frequently occurs during sleep because of pressure on an inflamed area of the rib cage. This is most likely what's going on, although there is no way to prove this at a distance. It would be wise, because of pain in the chest, to have a comprehensive workup including an EKG to rule out any sort of heart involvement (for your own reassurance) and a chest x-ray to rule out possibility of pulmonary embolism, which also seems highly unlikely. I do believe in ruling out the worst-case scenarios first, and since you're not in a doctor's office there's no concrete way to eliminate these concerns on line. Once the serious problems are removed and you're not worried about them, you can find out what's actually causing this, which very likely is orthopedic (involving bone and/or muscle and connective tissue). The fact that this responds to pain killers (and I assume you mean over-the-counter pain medications like Advil or Aleve) in an appropriate time period suggests very strongly it is neither heart nor gastrointestinal, which of course leaves chest wall structures, again muscle, bone and connective tissue. Even if this is proven to be the case there's usually not too much to be done other than treat the symptoms. If it turns out to be muscular only, sometimes a muscle relaxant along with non-steroidal anti-inflammatories such as ibuprofin (Advil, Motrin) or naproxyn (Aleve) can be helpful, especially in avoiding sleep disturbance. Hopefully this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Heart murmur is very loud now!",
    "content": "Hello -  Well your blood pressure does need to be managed, but the MVP isn't causing it. The  elevated BP could,  however, be making the murmur (usually a \"click\" sound  with MVP) sound more prominent. This is usually a contentious matter anyway, as one doctor may hear a click murmur in a given  patient, while  another hears nothing and questions  the whole diagnosis.  MVP can be like that.   Your Holter  monitor findings referred no doubt to premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) which occur normally in most people from time to time, and more often in people with MVP, but have no  real diagnostic significance of their own.   There are actually two types of MVP. One is the usual \"variation of normal\", which can range from an intermittent finding to a constant annoyance, but is totally benign. This accounts for perhaps 10 per cent of the general population (some estimates run even higher). There is also MVP due to degenerative disease, whch is fairly unusual, and the progress of this can  be easily visualized over time via repeated echocardiograms. This type, which is not usually what is referred to when  the  term \"MVP\" is used, sometimes requires eventual valve  replacement. The  common  form of MVP doesn't progress much, if at all, but can change from apparent to non-apparent at different times for reasons that aren't entirely clear.  It would seem the increased volume of the murmur is puzzling one doctor but not another in your case. This happens fairly frequently, and the  reason could be the increase in blood pressure, which can make the \"click\" seem louder sometimes.  Control of elevated blood pressure would be the first order of busniess. If, with that accomplished, the murmur is no longer a concern,  then that will probably have been the cause of the change in loudness. If there is no evident progression of the prolapse then the volume of the murmur really shouldn't be a concern.   I hope this helps clarify things somewhat. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John             just had echo today and been advised that i have moderate to sever reguritation ,the technician doing the echo said it was difficult to tell for certain because it was going around the outside (not to sure what he meant by that )but that it was his view it was probably most likely sever because my  lung pressure is a bit high as well , but i would need a down the throat food pipe echo to no for certain,he also added my heart looked healthy but was dynamic and pumping hard                 i asked him what is likely to happen now and he said i would need sugery and they would likely opt to repair the valve ,this has filled me full of fear and its only just sinking in ,i did ask how soon i would need surgey but he didnt answer and said i would need go to the clinic for more details. also one thing i have noticed i urinate more frequently and up approx 3 - 5 times nightly but i have a dry mouth and sweat quite easily          i need to ask because i am petrified of surgery and outcome !             thanks               Dean p.s what are the timescales for ops and how long could i go on without surgery   i have just been swimming for 1  1/2 hours today which i do once a week if i can .  on other days i do 1/2 hour weights in the morning and  35 mins on a cross trainer in the afternoon  nearly every day should still be doing this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean -  You've turned out to be one of the relative few who wind up with progression of the problem to the point where it requires surgical repair. It's pretty unusual, given how common the problem is overall. Still, this does happen once in a  while. Since there have been a lot of mitral valve repairs and  replacements done over the years, largely due to damage from rheumatic fever, they've gotten awfully good at it. While there are risks associated with any form of surgery to any part of the body, they are classifiable based on how \"radical\" the surgery is. Replacing and/or repairing the mitral valve is, as a rule, fairly routine anymore, and the recovery time is generally fairly quick, although there can be some lag in the return to a normal energy level. The replacement valves are virtually indestructable, so that's a plus if it needs to be replaced.  The \"down the food pipe\" echo is called a transesophageal echo or TEE for short. It's a really good way of getting an excellent view of most of the internal structures of the heart, and makes the surgery all the more precise. The actual test is barely annoying for most people, just takes most of your day because of mild sedation (which makes you pretty much unaware anything's going on). Recovery from the test is quick, and you're able to go about your business afterward, although you'll probably need someone to drive you home. This will give a great picture of where everything is and what all is going on in there.  The anxiety that comes with the prospect of almost any kind of surgery is pretty universal, so don't feel strange about that. It's understandable and almost everyone feels it to some degree. The doctor should be able to reassure you greatly about the low risks associated with it, and the importance of having it done. For a number of reasons, some of them psychological, others practical, I'd suggest you move forward with all deliberate speed, so this can be quickly put behind you and your problems resolved once and for all.   The surgery can take anywhere from two to six hours (there's no set timing for it, and a lot just depends on the anatomy of any given patient) and recovery time usually takes about a day for full clarity. Grogginess and sometimes soreness are the main complaints in the hours to days following, and you should be up and home inside five days on average, but will have to take your time getting back to activities as usual, although there's usually nothing remarkably unpleasant (other than site soreness, which, again, varies a lot from patient to patient). Many times now this surgery can be done using minimally invasive techniques, which reduces the discomfort and need for pain meds, and allows for a quicker recovery time.   Based on the comment that the regurge is occuring \"around the outside\" may mean the leak is in the annulus (the ring to which the leaflets are attached) and if that's the case, this could actually make the repair simpler. It all depends.   Regarding the exercise program, you seem to tolerate it well, but only your doctor can tell you for sure whether or not you should curtail it, since he knows the precise details of your individual case. You should ask very specifically about this, because it's always nice if one can continue to exercise up til shortly before surgery. If not, hopefully you can learn to just take it easy for a little while. You seem to be in excellent shape otherwise, and so should have a pretty smooth recovery.  While I'm not happy you were dealt this hand, at least now you know what's happening, and even though it is unusual for MVP, it's still a pretty common type of surgery which keeps improving. I hope I've been able to reassure you and answer some of your questions -- although the swimming and lifting one really does need to be directed to your personal doctor -- and I look forward to hearing more from you regarding the TEE and everything else that happens from here on out. Best of luck to you, and please continue to bring your questions here as needed or at least keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John    i have been to the clinic today,saw the registrar who has gone through everything ,he said the heart hasnt enlarged one chamber was slighty bigger but no significance probably due to regurgitation and it had probably been happening for years. my BP was 135/70 and my lung pressure was slightly high and there was no a fibralation shown on the holter which was good,i am going to have the throat echo in the next few weeks which will determine exactly what the leakage is ,he did say he would most likely be recommending sugery purely because the outcome is better before the heart suffers any damage and he beileves the leak is sever, it looks like any surgery will be early next year after my 46 birthday! which will make me slightly more at ease !, he told me it would be Frank Wells who does there repairs at papworth hospital i have looked him up and he trained in london and america http://www.papworthhospital.nhs.uk/cont ... rank_Wells seems like i would be in very good hands. he also said i would have an  angiogram to check for any artery problems and any probs would be done at the same time     i asked how the operation is likely to be done and he said they split the rib cage to get access to the heart which did sound quite brutal and painfull!      but i am getting a bit more used to the idea now still worried but the more info the better       i feel i am getting my head around it all now.i did ask about exercise and he said to continue as normal unless i experience breathlessness in which case  i was  to contact my Doctor ,the only problem i have is i am asthmatic as well so not quite sure when its not asthma related    he also added if i hadnt kept fit i may have been at this position much earlier in life            i will update when i have my next echo which he has put in as urgent         thanks for your in depth advice in this uncertain time it has been much appreciated                        Dean\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean,  I'll try to reply to both these posts, at least the most pressing parts. First, the dream you had, which was traumatic for you, but also was oddly premonitory. That has had to cause you a lot of discomfort over the intervening years. I won't attempt to analyze why that happened, but it certainly does add a layer of complexity to everything else that's happening now.  Regarding genetics and your daughter, you do describe her as sounding like someone who may have Marfan's syndrome, which is hereditary, and you say she resembles you, build-wise, when you were younger. Long fingers, longer-than-normal long bones (arms, legs), and a number of other characteristics, are possible markers for this disorder, which almost always causes the subject to have MVP and frequently to have partial detachment of the mitral valve's annulus, which is what it sounds like you may have, and which is repairable surgically. Sometimes this can be done between the ribs on the left side of the chest and sometimes it requires cutting the sternum and spreading the ribs that way. (I've experienced the latter personally, and while  it is uncomfortable for a while, it heals really well and usually fairly quickly). At any  rate, you probably should have your daughter evaluated for Marfan's as if she has it she'll be able to know what to watch out for, and that puts everyone ahead of the game, whether the problem is with structures of the heart or loose joints or retinal detachment (all things that can happen with Marfan's).   I've read up on Frank Wells, and I must say you seem to have found yourself a very accomplished surgeon. That's a very happy thing in itself. It seems he is especially good with valvular repairs, which is just what you're looking for.   If you should experience breathlessness related to failure of the mitral valve apparatus, you'd very likley be able to tell it is different from asthma. Hard to explain or describe, but it's apparently a markedly different sort of sensation.   Finally, yes, your fitness level has no doubt made you an excellent candidate for this repair, which should also speed your recovery ahead of more sedentary people.   It sounds like all the bases have been covered, at least pending the TEE. I hope you'll  have time to let us know how that turns out. Best of luck to you. We'll be standing by for further updates.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean -  \"Slightly\", in this case, means just that, and the implication is only that there is a remote possibility of early pulmonary hypertension, which can be quite serious if it develops fully. As a result, you will need to be rechecked for this over time, and if it doesn't show up in future visits, it is probably just an artifact of the test, or it would have been persued far more vigorously. Unfortunately,  everything has to be noted that is not exactly according to the book (that is to say,  \"normal\"). It's very likely nothing significant.  A recheck later on would prove this to be so. Not to worry.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean,  Well that was an intersting if uncomfortable procedure, or at least the finding was. I won't try and predict or second-guess or anything. This sort of torn or flail mitral leaflet isn't uncommon, and some are amendable to repair while others wind up having to be replaced. It's surgery either way, and so long as there's a working valve afterward, not much else should seem different one way or the other, subjectively, except that you shoud begin to feel better afterward.   That's awful about the sore throat. It happens sometimes. Other times the patient will act like they're unaware anything was down there. It should settle down shortly though. As for the diazepam, not my favorite, but I'm not a doctor, let alone the doctor in the case, so I'll just say it's probably better than nothing.   Great news about your daughter not having Marfan's, but it's a shame about the panic attacks. Hopefully she'll get the right kind of help with that and will learn to manage them to the point where the cease being a problem.  We'll be looking forward to updates from you. Hang in there. Help is on the way.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean,  The holidays were great, thanks. Hope they were for you as well.  I'll keep this brief: the most positive thing about having repair done sooner than later is that there is less opportunity for damage to be done over time. Since you remain asymptomatic there is likely none being done at present (at least not grossly), and it gives you time to mull this over. However, the sooner it is done (and this won't repair itself or remain stable indefinitely) the sooner you can set it aside as a future worry and the less damage can possibly be done (such as development of a weakened left ventricle, the one thing you really don't want). So use the extra time to ponder it, and I only hope you won't wait until you're looking at a timeline rather than a strictly elective procedure. The latter is a lot safer and better over the long haul. At the same time, I don't know of many people who, feeling fine, would volunteer to go under the knife, so I'm glad you have this buffer period to give it some thought.  That wasn't all that brief, was it?   Stay in touch and keep us updated. Good to hear from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John                  just to update ,i met with FranK Wells discussed my mitral valve surgery and hes confident it can be repaired i discussed what the TEE doctor said about it being more complex ,  he replied i know what she means but it is still repairable.    before hand i was dreading discussing the mortality rates etc but i felt really at ease and he had a really nice calm manner. he said that because i was  in good shape and looked after myself although there is a risk its minimal think for 1st time procedures under 65 its less than 1%,i asked if he could do my surgery personnaly and he said yes which was a big relief ,we then discussed timing he said that nothing was going to change in the next 3-4 months so we will look at september/october and i was more than happy with that as i wanted the summer to get things done                                 best wishes                                          Dean P.S. will update when i hear anymore\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean -- This is all extremely encouraging news, especially if Dr. Wells will be doing the surgery himself. The mortality rate he quotes is about that for any general anesthesia surgery at minimum in the general population, so that's almost as good as getting a tooth pulled!   We'll be looking forward to further updates. Thanks for this. It's really encouraging and a lot of readers here will benefit from your sharing all this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dean,  I am one of those folks that just clicked on your post to see what was happening with you.  I am glad that you are having the surgery soon.  I have a dog with this condition.  In dogs (probably humans too), it's a myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve, or Myxomatous Mitral Valve Disease.  She also has a ruptured tendinae that flails.  All I can say is that she was fine and nearly asymptomatic for a long time, but once that thing ruptured, the murmur became louder, and the disease started to progress at a fast rate.    The surgery is not done for dogs (at least not cost effective, and not very successfully at this point).  She is not yet in congestive heart failure, but will be eventually, if the valve does not bust before that.  Perhaps in humans there is a longer time frame for more symptoms to show, because we age more slowly.  Good that you are getting this taken care of, best of luck with your surgery!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi John Hears an update on my surgery Went in Wednesday for 11 am they took the bloods but didn\u2019t have a bed free so gave me a voucher to go get some lunch, came back at 3 to my home for the next 8 and a bit days I can understand when people say about as strange calmness when you enter the hospital it was almost like I was someone else my wife and children left at 8 pm quite emotional goodbyes             My wife came up on the Thursday morning about 7.15am I had slept pretty good considering, they shaved my chest and fore arms say shaved they could have plucked the two hairs quicker! At 8.30 they gave me the pre med at 9.15 they came for me and wheeled me down for surgery my wife came with me to the entrance it was hard       I see the Surgeon Frank wells we chatted for a few seconds then he patted the back of my hand and said you\u2019ll be just fine the anesthetist then said think of somewhere nice and I was gone!           At about 7pm I heard voices saying Dad ,Dean, mr b  wake up , I woke up in ICU and  proclaimed im still alive ,and said I hadn\u2019t seen any white lights or had any out of body experiences rambling quite a bit! Think my kids found it quite amusing!               Mr Wells rang my wife personally at about 3 to say the surgery was successful and he had repaired the valve and it was a nice tidy job but more complex than expected               Mr Wells visited me on Saturday and told me it was more complex than first thought and I was made slightly differently (not quite sure how yet) also said the leaflet was torn and he stitched it back together, so got a few questions for 6 week check up also think I have a C shaped ring round the valve not a closed one. I thanked him for everything, the whole hospital was brilliant, very patient focused         Cant remember exact days now. but first thing to go was the auto  morphine and catheter ,then I had drain tubes out think that was day 2 , take a deep breath and hold and out came drain tube one, then  another deep breath  and drain tube  two was gone .very strange sensation  , they had to pinch the holes while they tied the stitches ,the pacing wires were removed day 4  and one snagged but she gave it another hard pull and it gave up its hold I know how a fish on a hook feels now, the nurse showed me the thin outer plastic sheeth covering the pacing wire had a split, that is what caused it to snag and had a bit of me attached ! I was up and walking day 2 but only to the toilet all the pain was managed very well with a combinatination of paracetamol and tramadol  Also given breathing exercises to do.         Day three I was up and about for short walks , day four did the stairs and was told if my inr was ok I could go home but my inr remained at 1.5  ,today Mr Wells done his rounds and said this was only  prophylactic treatment and could be managed in the community and I could go home  So here I am with my mitral valve repaired walking quite well and considering everthing I feel really good, my kids have bought a leather reclining chair and its great and intend to have a lot of use in the next few days, rest, eat ,walk, its good to be alive!              will be on warfarin for the next 12 weeks  Dean\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -- The findings of your father's cardiological workup, if they were not triggered by frank heart disease or possible heart disease symptoms, are unremarkable. The echocardiogram findings are not very informative of anything significant at all.   The EKG shows some non-specific signs which may be seen in the setting of acute of occult heart disease, but also often show up in totally healthy people as well. When there is a left anterior fasicular block there will be a corresponding left deviation of the axis of the QRS complex in the EKG, but again, if no underlying heart disease is found this has no meaning nor significance. The same is true for low voltage, which can occur for a number of reasons, including excess body fat, electrolyte imbalance, and other even less important causes.   Given there is no history of prior heart disease in your father, it is very likely there is nothing else to be concerned about. If appropriate study of these findings and others show no evident disease then they are just findings that are not textbook-normal and so must be noted for the record, as many of us have slightly abnormal EKGs and this needs to be known when future EKGs are done in order to quickly compare and rule out any problem.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Frequent Ectopic beats, ST abnormality, etc",
    "content": "Hello -- Your mother's echocardiogram report and EKG findings, while quite sparse, are also very non-specific. Most of the things listed could be found on resting EKG and are unremarkable, such as \"frequent ectopic beats\" which means very little in general, and even less out of context. The \"ST abnormality\" also sounds like it came from the preprogrammed findings built into an EKG machine, but without specifics probably are meaningless. Without context they are definitely meaningless. The comment \"possible digitalis effect\" is also common computerspeak from an EKG machine, and is only accurate if in fact the patient takes the drug digitalis (digoxyn, lanoxyn) for atrial fibrillation or flutter. If not, this also means nothing whatsoever.   The other findings listed, referring to \"PWD\" and \"color flow\" are findings noted by an echocardiographer during an echo study of the interior structures of the heart, and again, are mild and out of context mean little of nothing. Generally speaking there is very little here that would, out of context at least, raise an eyebrow. If your mother was having chest pain, shortness of breath of other possible heart-related symptoms, then a lot more needed to be looked at besides just these items. \"Normal sinus rhythm\" means there were no dysrhythmias present, which is as it ought to be. I'm wondering why these exams were performed, and why so little of the findings were passed along to you. What you've provided here tells us nothing of your mother's cardiac health except that it would seem to be normal, with frequent premature heartbeats which may be perfectly normal for her.   The matter of the ectopic kidney has nothing at all to do with ectopic heartbeats and merely means there is a kidney in an unexpected location, sometimes in addition to the regular pair that come standard.   I hope this helps clarify things for you. If you have any further information available from the exam that might help make things more clear as to why they were performed. Otherwise, it would appear everything is fine.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: A \"Regular\" Irregular Heartbeat",
    "content": "Hi there -  This is a pretty easy one. First, your husband is having occasional premature ventricular contractions (PVCs). When these occur as every other beat (a regular beat followed by a premature beat followed by a compensatory pause, then repeat ad nauseum) it is called \"bigemeny.\" When it occurs after every two beats it's called trigemeny  (the third beat is premature); When it occurs after every three beats it's called \"quadragemeny.\" I don't know if anyone has ever actually tried to come up with all the other possible names for arrangements spaced even farther apart.  There is an arcane rule in cardiology which explains why this happens and why it perpetuates itself, at least until something knocks it back into random occurrence of the PVCs or they just go away. I won't go into it as I can barely repeat it myself. Trust me, however,  it is benign. PVCs do tend to occur more often in people with MVP than those who don't have it.   One of the very few cases where increased PVCs (we all have them at times, some more than others) are a concern is if it is possible the subject is dehydrated (which leads to electrolyte depletion, especially of potassium, which can cause increasingly irregular heartbeats, muscle weakness, fatigue,etc.). People using diuretics (the HCTZ part of that combination capsule) often lose more potassium (K) than normal, sometimes leading to fatigue, lots of PVCs,  etc. It's not usually a terribly serious thing, but it should be addressed. It's possible the diuretic is the culprit in your husband's case.   If this is so (and it should be checked via a blood test), there are two forms of prescription potassium replacement medications available (one a large pill, the other a powder which mixes with water to drink, easier to swallow but some balk at the taste of it) and this is often suggested with a prescribed diuretic as the loss of K is so common with these meds. If there's  no shortage of potassium then this is just a totally random phenomenon, although caffeine, stress, etc., are always  potential aggravants as well.  The actual PVCs, whether random or in bigemeny,  trigemeny, etc., are not, in themselves,  a cause for concern, but they could be suggesting that your husband is low on K and this should be brought to the attention of his doctor, who can check his serum potassium level and, if necessary, prescribe one of those two forms of potassium supplement. If that's what's causing this,  it will go away (for the most part at least; again we all get them sometimes). The pattern you (and he) are noticing isn't really important, but it can feel very unpleasant, one more reason  to eliminate it if possible.  I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to you both. Please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

It's very nice to know this is not something to worry about, but that we do need to go get some tests done like you said.  Greg used to take potassium supplements years ago, but stopped.  I know that potassium is important to take with diuretics, but also recall that his doctor told him to AVOID the supplements with this new type of diuretic (Lisinopril) he had started taking.  Maybe I misunderstood, and he should have been taking them all this time.  We'll get the blood test like you said, and in the meantime - we'll relax!  I noticed that his heart rhythm sometimes is completely normal, especially if he's exercising, and other times it goes into the regular skipping mode again.  Again, thank you for your time and help.

    "content": "You're very welcome (and I'm flattered, but not an MD, just a cardiology tech/EMT).  :)  The doctor may have been referring to the Potassium \"sparing\" quality of HCTZ, which is a confusing term even to many professionals, or he may have been referring to health store variety potassium supplements, since these either are too little, unregulated, etc., or can pose the danger of too much (as bad as too little!) since there is no medically therapeutic dose listed on these types. The only safe form is a prescription type, and those are frequently time-released, the exact amount taken is known, and the serum level is relatively consistent. Potassium is one supplement I'd leave strictly to the doctor, and of course only if he finds it necessary. When a patient is experiencing irregular heartbeats we generally like to see the K level a little more than the minimum normal (at least  4.0 rather than 3.5, for instance), and this can sometimes keep the \"skips\" to a minimum.   You've noted something I forgot to mention that's also typical of PVCs. If they occur at rest they will usually disappear with exercise -- then often return afterward. The reverse is also true for some people.   I'm glad the response was helpful. Let us know how things go with the blood testing, etc., and if there are any other questions, please don't hesitate to bring them to us here.\n\n",

When I listened to it, it has an extra beat and then seemed to skip a beat. with that what my question is, is I would like your opinion as to whether you think I should fork out the cash to get the tests done. I do not have High blood pressure, but my pulse is real strange also which I'm guessing is from the heart beat. My doctor said that he thinks that it could be a leaky valve and when I looked up a leaky valve well it scared my a bit so I have turned to you for some guidance. Thanks Jane/doe\n\n",

I have an appointment for my child with a pediatric cardiologist, however, it is going to be 6 weeks before they can get me in and I'm looking for some answers.  How is an aortic root dilatation diagnosed on an echocardiogram under findings & conculsions?  Is it strictly taken from the measurments not being what they are predicted to be?  Or is it also visual?  Are there errors in the interpretation of echocardiograms?  The only thing negative on the report was the aortic root dilatation, everything else noted was good.  What other conditions (other than Marfan) might result in an aortic root dilatation of a 16 year old?  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Aortic Root Dilatation",
    "content": "Hello --  Aortic root dilation is usually correctly diagnosed via echo, but there can be errors. It is properly diagnosed by measurement deviations, although if it is grossly dilated it might first be noted visually alone. This would be very unusual. Dilation  is not, in itself, necessarily problematic, but often is, and should be followed periodically.  The most common cause, aside from Marfan syndrome, is bicuspid aortic valve (two leaves instead of three), although it is unclear exactly what the connection is. If this finding wasn't noted and your daughter doesn't appear to have Marfan's then this may be a one-time misread or oddity which may not show up in followup. If it does persist, then it's there, but still may not mean anything. It can be simply idiosyncratic. So long as it doesn't undergo significant change it shouldn't cause any problems. The measurement could be very minimal.   I hope this answers your question. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "I would like to thank you so much for replying to my post.  I thought the appointment would be 6 weeks, however, the ped. card. dept. called me up and said it will be mid-August.  We're trying to look at that like that is a good thing since they do not want to see her right away and the person who called said that the doctors (who reviewed her echo. report) would have asked her to come in right away if they thought she was in danger.    My daughter is 5' 7\" and weighs 114 pounds.  I came up with a BSA of 1.55.  There was no bicuspid valve noted in the report so hopefully that means that the radiologist saw that area and it was normal.  Under m-mode, her aortic root diam. was 31.  Under 2-D her AV Ann. was 22, Sin. of Val. was 24 and her ST junction was 28.  I called up the hospital that did the echo. because I noticed her height & weight incorrect on the report (they had her BSA at 1.45 with the wrong height & weight).  I was asking a pediatric echo. tech. if that could account for why the dilation was noted in the report.  She said it would make a slight difference, but not enough to run another report.   She brought up my daughter's echo. on her computer and she said she could not actually see where the 31 was measured, but said that she would have probably measured the S of V just a little larger and the ST j. a little smaller.  She said it didn't really look too worry-some.  She said sometimes it could be the angle of the picture, they way she was lying or she may be growing (which I think she just grew 1/2 inch since the echo).  Are those possibilities?   She also said the radiologist that read it probably meant the aortic root was just mildly dilated.    Other than the items listed below, everything else was noted as normal size &/or functioning. Left heart: \u2022\tsystolic bowing without evidence of prolapse  \u2022\ttrace mitral regurgitation  \u2022\taortic root dilatation present Right heart: \u2022\t trace physiologic tricuspid regurgitation; trace pulmonary valve regurgitation  Also, can you explain the systolic bowing and if that is a problem?  The echo. tech. told me it is not perfect, but is only a problem if it is with prolapsed.   Does this mean she is more likely to develop prolapse?  When the doctor originally heard the murmur, my daughter was extremely worried.  The doctor just mentioned she wanted to have her blood drawn for some testing.  I could see the panic come over my daughter\u2019s face.  The doctor then continued to ask her other questions (because it was an annual physical) and I could just see my daughter getting more nervous as the doctor spoke, she could hardly think.  After that, she examined her (her blood pressure had already been taken when she was calm) and listened to her heart.  She had asked me if she had ever had a murmur before which she has not.  I asked her what did it sound like and she said \u201cwoosh\u201d.  Not sure that that means.  But, could murmurs sometimes be caused by a sudden increase of blood pressure with stress?  I didn\u2019t even think to ask it at that time.    Sorry for so many questions, but 3 months is a long way away.  I really appreciate your help and this forum.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, and thanks for the comprehensive followup.  I'm inclined to think as you do, that if the doctor felt there was an issue of great concern he'd have moved the appointment up instead of pushing it ahead. So that's probably a good thing. Also the information you were able to gather is sufficiently vague (on its own merits) to sound pretty benign. The variations were trivial, there was no mention of bicuspid aoritic valve, and while your daughter is tall and thin, that alone doesn't relegate her to Marfan's status. There is actually now a very simple single, non-invasive test using a slit lamp to examine the retina, which will expose nearly all cases of Marfan's so,  there being no other  problems in the meantime, this is probably fine. All the specific findings were close enough to be fine, and as for the \"bowing without prolapse\", this is,  first, a splitting of hairs, second, not important, and third, could be a precursor of slight prolapse, but even then it is almost never of any significance anyway (except in terms of the disruptive-but-benign symptoms that sometimes accompany it, and she'd already have those now most likely and doesn't). MVP is very rarely a big deal clinically. The bowing is not a problem at all, and is very common.   The murmur, a \"whoosh\", is pretty vague also, and is not the click murmur heard with MVP. It may be due to the trace tricuspid or pulmonary regurge. When a murmur is described this vaguely it's often meaningless.   One other thing: to answer your question about sudden anxiety can definitely cause a blood pressure spike in certain individuals, and with this the heart's valves, especially the mitral, can expand (the tissues are cardiac, like arteries, and respond to adrenaline rush); this can cause momentary technical MVP or slight changes in the shape of other valves and pretty much everything, but not in an abnormal way. It certainly could account for a vague, nonspecific \"whooshing\" murmur. It is entirely possible.   Thanks again for followuing up with us, and please update us after the cardiology consult and any other time you may have any questions or concerns. Right now things sound very stable and normal.\n\n",

We met with a team of cardiologist as well as a geneologist.   They do not suspect marfan and after listening to her heart, the doctor told me her murmur is benign.  She is to come back in one year just to make sure no changes since she did have one abnormal echo before, but that every looks good and she can resume eating and doing whatever she wants - great news!    Note:  I have to wonder if the echo done the first time was accurate.  The person got about 3 phone calls during the echo, she input incorrect weight & height and it looked like some of her measurements were not taken accurately (I have a copy of the actual echo).  I watched both echos being done and the echo today was so much clearer to see than the first one (I believe this one is 3-d).\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  First, as I'm sure  you understand, being HLA-B27 positive means you have inherited a genetically-transmitted autoimmune collagen disease which can cause SA, but fortunately for you has not. You may just have one non-working gene or be a carrier only, but you are still subject to other potential problems from this, including Reiter's syndrome. None of this directly affects your heart, but MVP is often seen in people with this disorder because it is common to various diseases of the connective tissues. \"Moderate\"\" MVP is a vague finding, so you will need to be followed at least annually for this, just to be certain it's not progressing. Most often it will not, but can sometimes in association with this defect. Not a serious concern, at least for the present, just bears some watching.   In general being HLA-B27 positive will affect specific connective tissue resulting in AS. You don't have that, so you're ahead of the game. MVP, again, is a slightly greater concern (for possible progression) than in the general population, but, again, \"moderate\" is a very vague and even evasive term, so this will just need to be watched over time. As for other structural heart disease or corornary artery disease, you are, by the literature, not at any greater risk than the GP, although with any autoimmune disease there is a potential for inflammatory processes to occur in other parts of the body, including coronary vessels. In the case of HLA-B27 the inflammation  is generally very specific and results almost exclusively in SA, so I'd say you're in a pretty good postion generally right now, and would not be overly concerned about heart disease,  although prudent, healthy habits benefit anyone in that area. Also, do be sure to have an echocardiogram at least once yearly.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and  follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  FIrst it is important to start your stress management program (you didn't know you had one, did you?) by not allowing concern over this set of diagnoses upset you and cause you additional stress. Now then:  MVP is extremely common and, as a rule, extremely benign. That, in itself, is not usually a cause for concern unless it causes unacceptable and upsetting symptoms, which it often does, especially anxiety. Second, it is often associated with MVR, but you haven't given us specifics on this particular issue. A certain amount of trivial MVR is very common and only significant MVR is a concern. Finally, you say you've been diagnosed with CAD, and could you please fill us in on how this diagnosis was reached? Did you have a nuclear scan stress test? I have to assume you've had an echocardiogram or there'd be no way to be certain of the MVP and MVR. If you've had an echo perhaps you have the report and could relay some of the details from it? That would be helpful.  As for the most troubling finding, that of CAD, I'm wondering just what this actually constitutes and to what degree. Any details you can add as to how the diagnosis was reached and what details were given would help both you and us, since sometimes things are stated in a way that's more alarming than it needs to be or perhaps often totally misunderstood. Also, sometimes the diagnosis is simply wrong. I'm not saying that's the case this time, because I don't know enough details. It's certainly not impossible for an otherwise healthy young woman to have CAD, but it is less likely than in someone who is post-menopausal.  Your overall cholesterol level was fine for a person with no heart disease, but a breakdown of the components would  also be helpful. I'm just a little dubious about the diagnoses, and I'm not even sure why. Can you describe the character of your chest pains, the location, and when and how they are triggered? All this stuff is very important in sorting out what you've been told. Finally, while it's not impossible to have a heart attack, even when in apparent good health, having any of the problems you've mentioned does not mean you will have one, nor that you'll die of heart disease. It is worrisome, and it needs to be clarified. I guess the fact that you seem to have been given so few helpful details is what makes me wonder if there hasn't been a snap diagnosis or maybe there's been some miscommunication. I'd like to help clear that up if I can. Please follow up with us and in the meantime do everything you can to relax and lower your stress and anxiety levels.  I hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us at your earliest convenience and fill in as many blanks as you can. I'd really like to help more. Good luck to you and hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Melissa --  Your concern is certainly reasonable. This condition is fairly common, and often remains stable for long periods, sometimes forever. It does need to be followed on a regular basis, however, even though right now it's not causing any problems, not counting the palpitations, which are pretty normal for everyone. Myxomatous valve disease (usually of the mitral valve) can, depending upon the underlying cause, progress, and so needs to be evaluated periodically. If it stays good, then great. If not, then it needs to be followed more frequently with an eye toward repair or replacement. Your doctor is technically right not to be concerned now, because now it is fine. He is likely looking to avoid unnecessarily upsetting you, since it could remain fine indefinitely. Even some mild  progression might well not cause any problems. If in the future it gets to the point where regurgitation is significant you'll likely be aware of it before it's seen on exam anyway. Meanwhile, I would treat it as just a finding, not obsess or worry over it, just be aware there is a potential future problem and treat the followups over time as a maintainance issue. This is the most productive approach, since it is fine now and could well remain that way, and should not go bad over night, but if at all, could take years to get to the point where it's a problem, and the potential problems are eminently treatable now.   I hope this answers your concerns. Please follow up with us if you have any further questions or if there is anything new that comes up. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm new here. I'm glad I've found a place where I can post a question and someone would be able to answer it for me. I have a 16 years old daughter who was diagnosed with a mitral valve prolapse when she was 9. Later, when she was 11 her doctor discovered she had a \"mild\" regurgitation at that time and ask her to avoid sodas with caffeine and chocolate, which she did for sometime. As soon as she was 13 o 14, she started drinking coke all the time and usually hide the chocolates from me so I'd not find out she was eating them.  My daughter has not seen her doctor for more than a year because he retired and she was doing \"fine\".  Two weeks ago she had was seemed like the flu and did not feel well. The thing is that that day, she told me she's been having palpitations even when resting and in fact we were having lunch at the time she told me and her heart was racing.  Later that day, she was at school and sat down outside, trying to get warmer (she was wearing a jacket) because she felt \"really cold\". But we live in a tropical island in the Caribbean (Puerto Rico) and the climate here is not cold. Anyways, she sat there for about 15 or 20 minutes, in the sun and then felt somehow dizzy and went inside the building.  She got a tan in the part of her body that weren't covered, but she did not feel the sun over her skin.  When she got inside, she faint and fell into the floor and was unconscious for a couple of minutes so I rushed her to the ER and they did some blood and urine tests, an CTScan to find out if she hurt herself when she fall on the floor and everything came back ok, except the blood test that revealed she had a virus (cold) and the doctor at the ER told us we should make an appointment with a pediatric cardiologist which I've been trying to do ever since without any success. What concerns me the most is that my daughter gets really tired even from walking from the couch to the kitchen, and she feels fatigue when she have to speak with someone for more than a couple of minutes.  She has to walk from one building to another at school and this make her really tired.  Last Saturday she went to a restaurant with her boyfriend and afterward they try to take a walk inside the mall where the restaurant is but couldn't do it because as soon as they got out of the restaurant, she fell nausea, dizzyness and tiredness. They came right back home.  Another thing is that lately she can't feel heat or pain very well, especially in her hands. The other day she touched a pan containing hot cheese for nachos and she felt like surface of the pan was cold (I touched it and it was really hot) instead of hot.  Yesterday she was moving her pedestal fan from a place to another and one of her fingers got into the fan and got hit. She was bleeding from the cut (a small one), but did not feel any pain until a few  minutes later. Her brother had to tell her she was bleeding.  I'm concern about my daughter and I'd appreciate any feedback. Thanks for yours\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mitral Valve Regurgitation in a Teenager",
    "content": "Hello --  We may be talking about two different problems with your daughter, but then again maybe not. I'll explain.  First, about mitral valve prolapse (MVP): it sounds as though this is fine and as near normal as it can get.  Some doctors see it as a variant of normal and it is extremely common, almost always benign, and rarely causes any serious problems.  Trivial mitral regurgitation is commonly seen whether MVP is noted or not. This in itself is not a problem.  Now then, MVP is also often associated with a distinctive syndrome, a benign but often psychologically troublesome one, involving palpitations, shortness of breath,  anxiety and sometimes panic disorder, fatigue, etc. Usually these people test normal in all aspects for their hearts. The reason this happens with some MVP people is unclear. Also, MVPers are more likely to have bothersome palpitations  more often than others (though this is difficult to ascertain), which is the reason they are told to avoid chocolate and caffeine. The doctor figures this will reduce the frequency of palpitations and so the patient  will be less anxious. Those substances will trigger palpitations in many people, even those without MVP. Your daughter decided she didn't want to give up the caffeine and chocolate, and eventually began to have more palpitations, which can feel pretty unpleasant but won't do any actual harm. If she understood the caffeine and chocolate were making this problem much worse, perhaps she'd stop or cut back. The alternative is to keep consuming them and know they will probably cause these sensations. It's as simple as that.  People with MVP syndrome often also have what's called neurocardiac syncope,  in which the blood pressure becomes abnormally low, fainting sometimes occurs, but again it's not life-threatening. Cold extremities may also be a feature.  So then comes the issue of lack of sensation in her hands. This could be a completely separate neurological problem and should be looked into,  since she clearely could injure herself seriously if this continues. If this is the case it's totally unrelated to the heart issues. Still it needs to be looked at. However, there is also a possibility this is being caused by hyperventilation (faulty breathing or overbreathing) which is due to anxiety which may be  related to the MVP, but needs to be treated separately as an anxiety disorder. Hyperventilation may often cause coldness, numness and tingling in the hands and around the mouth, as well as profound  sense of faintness (and occasionally actual fainting). It can become a chronic problem, and again, it's not dangerous, but needs to be managed.  These various possibilities need to be sorted out by a cardiologist and, possibly, with the consultation of a pychologist.  I hope this is helpful. The problems are very likely all benign and much of this may be rooted in anxiety. Even though this may be associated with MVP, it needs to be treated independently. Also, neurocardiac syncope should be ruled out, as this also requires medical management, mainly to avoid injury due to falling because of fainting. If she hasn't fainted yet she probably won't, but whatever combination of non-life-threatening problems may be present, they need to be managed in order to restore calm and eliminate disruption. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Unfortunately, you are correct.  I cannot advise you to start or not start exercising again.  If you have a diagnosis of angina this must be considered a warning sign for your heart.  Unfortunately for some people, even a heart healthy lifestyle does not prevent such complications.  It is possible that your chest pain was not angina; however, based on an internet evaluation I cannot say yes or no.  My best suggestion for you would be to see your regular doctor.  Perhaps after your primary care doctor evaluates you, you can be cleared to start exercising again.  Exercise is important and most likely there is an exercise program that will be OK for you.  I encourage you to get a medical clearance before you start again.  This is the safest course of action for you.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Julie, I would be interested in knowing how the cardiologist tagged you with \"angina\" if you declined the tests that would help make such a diagnosis, especially since the term generally already assumes an underlying on-going heart pain, which you did not mention having. I would guess you may have had some reason to consult the cardiologist to begin with - did your primary physician suggest you see him? You also did not mention if you are faithful with your SCPT meds.  Sometimes, if you miss some of your doses, run out of meds or something like that, and your paranoia was therefore uncontrolled, it is possible that you may have some anxiety attacks that may emulate the symptoms of angina.  You may wish to discuss your chest pain with your psychiatrist as well as your primary physician.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While your daughter definitely needs to be seen by a cardiologist (and if a pediatric one isn't available then any one will do), to be worked up for progression of the MVP, it seems she'll also be need a neurological consult, since she's got some sort of peripheral nerve disorder that's affecting her ability to differentiate between hot and cold and to feel pain. There's something more than simple MVP going on and it should be pursued aggressively. There may be some issues with MVP, but more likely the symptoms she's been most affected by are neurological in nature. Sometimes certain people with MVP  do also have neurological problems for no obvious reason.  I hope this is helpful to you. If you can't find a pediatric cardiologist then  by all means take her to a regular cardiologist, as your daughter is close to adulthood anyway and it shouldn't make that much difference. But also find a  neurologist to coordinate with because there more prominent symptoms lie in that area.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

Every few months she spits large blood clots. She has had ekgs and they have show nothing. Her doctor says the area from surgery is irritated and when the spitting up of blood occurs she is put on Clarithromycin. This seems to help the problem but it continues every few months.

    "content": "Hello --  If none of the usual exams are showing anything other than the presence of MRSA, this is an odd situation and I'm wondering if the blood may not be coming from some entirely different area just coincidentally, namely her sinuses. This can happen for a lot of reasons and can be insidious with nighttime drainage leading to collection in the bronchial tree, then coughing up in the morning. Since she seems to produce more blood and phlegm in the mornings anyway, this might be something worth looking into. The nasal and sinus passages are rich with very superficial capilaries, and drying (for instance due to nasal O2, as in ICU, or just in a dry environemnt) can often cause bleeding which will drain downward during the night. Since there's no mention of anemia or other obvious areas of concern this may explain the problem.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and your mother.

    "content": "Hello --  While Minoxodil does have some potential side effects of significance, there are very few cardiac-related ones. I suppose if any of those were to take place the MVP could potentially cause them to be magnified, but the ones you describe don't fit in with what it might cause. Now then: the 5% formulation is very strong stuff. It can irritate skin and hair follicles. It can cause dermal problems. It can also be absorbed through the skin if over-applied, and this can cause non-specific EKG changes, as well as palpitations sometimes, which is what I mean by \"exaggerating\" usual stuff.   I think the arm pain is very likely due to over-enthusiastic massaging of your own scalp. It fits this, but not the usual problems Minoxodil can cause, especially the cardiac ones, which are mostly unnoticeable except on EKG. I think you're OK in that department, and if the current dose is prescribed and is being followed by a doctor, then just make certain you're not applying excessive amounts, as this can cause other sorts of problems as outlined above.  MVP has its own little galaxy of annoying and unnerving symptoms, as I'm sure you know.  So long as they aren't increased in conjunction with Minoxodil use you really have very little to worry about in that regard.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,   I'm 30 years old female and I have been diagnosed with Mitral Valve Prolapse (MVP) in 2006.  It may sound strange since I might have had it since I was born.  I have always wondered if some of the symptoms that I have experienced are due to MVP such as:  - Anxiety, nervousness  - Very sharp chest pain which happens very rarely ( maybe once  a year or less) and it lasts less than a minute. When this happens I have to hold my breath because of the unbearable pain.  - Having difficulty breathing especially when I'm stressed out. - Having fast heart rate during exercise - up to 187 beats per minute.  During rest period my heart  rate is 70 to 90 per minute.  My other questions are:  - Can mild MVP progress into moderate and eventually severe without any infection problem?   - What can cause it?   - Could that possibly be caused by doing heavy physical activities or stress?   - What is the range for a normal heart rate during exercise?    Here is the summary of my Eco reports:  My echocardiography report in 2006 showed that I had a mildly redundant mitral leaflet with trace mitral regurgitation, trace tricuspid regurgitation and normal heart size. The 2007 report showed mild prolapse of anterior mitral leaflet with moderate mitral regurgitation (eccentrically directed posterio-laterally and may be underestimated), moderate tricuspid regurgitation and mild left atrial enlargement.      2006 report:                                         2007 report:  Aorta:                Normal                                                Normal Root Diameter:  33 mm                                                 35mm Left Atrium: Int.

The evidence is that the trace regurgitation had progressed into moderate regurgitation.  Can this condition progress into cardiomyopathy?   Why my diastolic and systolic dimensions decreased on 2007 report considering the report also shows that my heart has enlarged?  I am very worried about my condition since I am planning to get pregnant. I cannot ask my physician about this because I moved to another state.  I would appreciate if anyone can answer my questions and give me advice for my heart condition.    Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: MVP, MVR and Tricuspid Regurgitation",
    "content": "Hi there -  MVP is one of the most  common \"abnormal\" findings, with estimates of up to 15 per cent of the population having some degree of it. While there are two kinds, the far more common type is often considered a \"variant of normal;\"  the other more rare sort is a degenerative myxotomous disease that can be progressive and sometimes requires surgical intervention. This latter type is usually easily visualized on echocardiogram as it generally looks much different from the \"normal\" type.   As for the variations in  your two echo reports: both are within normal limits. It's important to understand that it would be unusual for two different exams on two different days to  yield exactly the same results. MVP is especially variable from day to day, and in some patients it cannot be seen at all on some days,  while is fairly clear on others. While the echocardiogram is an invaluable tool, it only \"sees\" what is there on a given day, and  to some degree is influenced also by the technician's style. Given these vagaries, your two reports are very consistent and very normal with the exception of \"moderate\" mitral regurge, which is greater than \"trace\", which almost everyone has at some times. For this reason it should be  followed, even though the likelihood of it progressing  to a problematic degree is very slight.  As  for the symptoms you describe, they are all commonly associated with MVP syndrome, a syndrome which only occurs in a minority of the very many people who are known to have MVP. This, of course, is still a relatively rather large number of people. The sharp, stabbing pains,  anxiety, perceived difficulty breathing (yet exercise is generally well-tolerated), and sometimes frequent premature heartbeats ('flutter\" sensations or sense of a \"skipped\" beat), unwarranted fatigue (again, with exercise generally well-tolerated), panic attacks, and even a faster-than-average resting heart rate, are all classic for both anxious patients and patients with MVP syndrome. It is unclear what the connection is between the \"redundant\" leaflet tissue and  the symptoms,  but it's common enough to be considered classic.  The echo reports, side by side, do not indicate that your heart has enlarged, only that there are differences between  the  two exams, but that both are within normal limits. Again, this is the rule, and to have an exam exactly replicate a previous one  would only happen in an android with a mechanical heart or  if someone had accidentally pulled up the previous report by accident.  The best number in the bunch is yuor ejection fraction, which is preferred to be higher rather than lower, although the normal range is between 50 and 70+.  Yours was already very good and the second time was even a little better. In  both cases it was excellent. It is the most crucial number of them all.  Your resting heart rate is also normal.  Your prolapse may have increased slightly, or it may have simply been more prominent on the day of the second exam than the first one. Because of this you will likely have the test done again, and if there is an increase in any of the prolapse or regurge numbers and you also have symptoms which might relate to that, then you'd be evaluated further. However, this is very unlikely, since there is no mention of myxotomous disease. The next exam could as easily show an \"improvement.\" This is the nature of these things generally.  The situation, as described in your two reports, would not cause cardiomyopathy, and there is no reason to assume that might happen in the future. Generally a seriously failing mitral valve with myxotomous disease is most likely to cause a weakening and dilated cardiomyopathy of the left ventricle, but so far you have nothing to suggest this is taking place or that it will. Your exams, again, are very normal with that one exception of \"moderate\" regurge, which could  stay that way or could be less (or missing) during the next exam.   Oh! Also, no,  MVP cannot be caused by heavy lifting or exertion. The MVP syndrome symptoms,  however, are sometimes triggered initially by stress, at which time the patient discovers he or she has MVP. MVP is almost always genetic in origin, and is rarely acquired. One way it can be acquired is by use/abuse of amphetemines, although this is difficult to prove because it is such a common condition anyway.   You're in very good company. There are millions of people out there with similar  MVP findings. Some have more or less severe symptoms associated with it, and the majority are completely unaware of it.   I hope this helps ease your your concerns about this very common, sometimes annoying, very rarely serious problem. Good luck to you, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Prominent pulmonary vessels in hilar region",
    "content": "Hello -  The hilar region is the area through which blood vessels and nerves, etc., enter and leave the service of the lungs. \"Prominent pulmonary vessels\" in this area could mean any number of things or could mean absolutely nothing, but every finding that is not precisely \"normal\" must be noted in any medical test report, if only for baseline purposes.   That being said, I would certainly take the radiologist's advice about having this correlated medically via a chest x-ray, just to see why these vessels seem to be prominent. It may just be an anatomic anomaly, which is still useful to know, or it could be due to some actual abnormality, whether harmless or, possibly, secondary to some more serious problem (although this seems unlikely since there have been no symptoms).   Generally these findings wind up being medically irrelevant, but the radiologist sees enough of this to be qualified to advise having the thing illuminated and then you can know exactly what is (or, more likely, is not) going on to cause this.   I hope this is helpful. It's deliberately vague, as this can be caused by so many different things. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Roundsgirl -  We now know the outcome of all this was surgery, and I hope that by now you've fully recovered from that and are back to living full-tilt. From looking at the report above I would have guessed surgery would have been a sure thing also, mainly because of the progression of aortic valve dysfunction.  You raised a very important question early on: can this dysfunction go away? For the sake of possible interested readers who my visit this thread, it is unlikely (as I'm sure you now know) that any degree of valve dysfunction will go away on its own, especially aortic valve dysfunction. We sometimes may see an apparent reversal or disappearance of borderling regurgitation in the mitral or pulmonary valves, simply because (especially where the mitral valve is concerned) there is a certain degree of flexibility of the apparatus. This mild degree of regurgitation is often seen and as the mitral valve in particular is dependent on the behavior of the wall of the left ventricle, the strength or weakness of that muscle area, on a given day, can vary enough to permit a tiny but notable degree of regurgitation. The aortic valve is very different, and once there is a certain degree of malfunction it is unlikely to ever go away on its own, although it may not progress as yours did.  I hope this finds you well and fully recovered. Perhaps you could update us on how you're doing.\n\n",

I asked my Cardio. about it, but he just basically said lets see what it shows in 6 months.  It also showed that I still have diastolic dysfunction with pseudonormalized inflow pattern; any thoughts about that?  The last note on echo said Normal function of aortic bioprosthesis.  Mild to moderate residual gradient.  What does that mean?    I still feel as fatigued as before my surgery, also still have shortness of breath, could this be due to the moderate stenosis?  As a matter of fact after sending me for a work performance evaluation test, my Cardio deemed my 100% disabled.   I do have other health issues also.  Thanks and I look forward to your response.

    "title": "Re: Echo report",
    "content": "Hello and thanks for checking back in -  Sometimes after a prosthetic valve is placed there is some mild scar tissue growth or just plain irritated tissue around the opening, which can on occasion cause a bit of stenosis. Often this resolves with time, as the heart gets used to having the foreign object in place. This will need to be checked in the future, as per your doctor's suggestion, to see if it has resolved or if it has progressed, which is rare, but sometimes happens. When it does, sometimes microsurgery can  be performed to remove the intruding tissue, but this is rarely necessary.  The \"mild to moderate residual gradient\" would be the product of the slight stenosis, and while it normally wouldn't be noticed, your continuing symptoms could possibly be due to this. With this in mind, did your doctor have you go through a comprehensive cardiac rehab program after the surgery? This is not always thought of with valve replacement, but is every bit as important as after bypass or other coronary surgery or event.   If you have other health issues going on also, these may be contributing to the slowed recovery. Hopefully things will improve before too long.  Thanks again for getting back to us here. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

Did the report once again state the prothesis to be working normally? It would be both rare and odd to find it wasn't, given the reliability of modern replacement valves. The fact that the gradient has appeared and/or increased over time also suggests continued scar tissue growth as a likely cause for the change, and also the likely cause of your symptoms. While this is a rare sequal to aortic valve replacement, I am aware of a few cases where it has happened. Follow-up with your cardiologist and/or surgeon would be urgent at this point, to try and determine just what is causing the new stenosis and how best to manage it.   There is always the possibility, too, of an aberrant reading in the ER setting. Once can hope this is the case, and part of your follow-up should, of course, be a quietly deliberate echocardiogram. If it confirms the increased gradient the problem will probably require aggressive management, especially since there are corollary symptoms which match the findings.   Please stay in touch with us here and let us know what you learn. I wish I could tell you something more (and more positive) but for the moment all we can know for certain is that it appears the stenosis is increasing post-surgery, which is rather unusual.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again and thanks for your taking the time to respond to my postings.  Here goes the latest.  Both my Cardio. and Surgeon want me to have some type of weight loss surgery.  Both letters I received from them state a valve/body mismatch as the problem.  I am confused as we never discussed this as being an issue before the surgery when we we going over the things that could go wrong.  I also have a hernia right between the breast, which is quite painful in and of itself.  Anyway, the valve/body mismatch is the reason I am getting from my doctors about the stenosis and gradients levels, does this sound right to you???  I am so confused right now, and really the  thought of another surgery is not sounding so appealing to me.    What are the dangers of body/valve mismatch, is it very serious?  Sincerely, Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Hello and you're very welcome -  The  \"valve/body mismatch\" is another way of expressing that all of us are either one of three basic body types or a combination of two of them, and some of them are not capable of carrying excess weight as well as others. The heart itself is smaller, and the aortic valve, which experiences the largest amount of applied strain because the left ventricle is the hardest-working part of the heart, often suffers (and consequently so does the patient) when the body mass index far outstrips the basic body design.   Because of this, the weight-loss surgery would have to be considered as possibly life-saving, which is usually the only time it should be considered anyway, and it does make sense. I can well understand your reluctance to undergo another surgery, but given the facts as I understand them, this surgery could be life-saving and certain would  be life-changing in a positive way. At the very least the reasoning all  fits together.   I hope you'll give this the most serious consideration. Please do stay in touch with us here. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It's honestly difficult to assess the level of concern warranted by this, but it is worrisome, at least, since it appears to be progressing rather regularly. I supposed the next question becomes: How should that be treated medically, while waiting for a surgical solution to the weight disparity? I would think beta blocker therapy might be a useful short-term help prior to any surgery, but won't make the problem go away. Most likely you'll be advised to curtail, somewhat, your physical activity, at least the most extreme forms, although sometimes this needn't apply. I think the fact that the gradient continues to rise is suggestive of a certain urgency to correct the underlying problem, but would advise against becoming inordinately anxious, as the problem at least seems to be understood and there is at least a tentative plan to correct it. This probably should be done while the valve is still able to function adequately during surgery, so the progress of the situation does apply a little bit of time pressure, I would think. Your cardiologist will certainly be able to shed more light on this and please let us know what he has to say after that visit.   Hang in there! Help is on the way.\n\n",

Do you think any of these med.'s should be helping? I tell you I honestly feel like giving up sometimes.  It's not only the heart thing, but in the last few months, I've found out I have esophegeal ulcers, gastris erosions, hiatal hernia and gerd. I will have the light ran back down my throat on Dec. 3rd to check all of that.  Then about a month after that I started bleeding with bowel movements for 5 weeks.  I had a colonoscopy done they removed a polyop (sp), seen where diverticulia had been bleeding along with internal and external hemhorroids. I was told I need to see a surgeon for the hemhorroids, (just great another surgery)  I feel like a medical freak and without insurance I've put that whole scene on hold.  All this along with my other health issues, I feel terrible all the time, just keep looking for the light at the end of the tunnel.   I am still waiting on a court date for my disability, after my Cardio has twice filled out paper work stating I am totally disabled along with my PCP also filled out the same paperwork.  I can't help but feel all this stress is not helping my heart, but how can I avoid it at this point?  You didn't even have to mention slowing down on physical activity as I have no energy anyway.

    "content": "Hi Lisa,  You're very welcome.  The Exforge combined with the Inderal should manage any blood pressure issues, and Inderal (a beta blocker) is often used to reduce the stiffness of the left ventricle's free wall and the ventricular septum, either/or which can sometimes cause a narrowing of the outflow tract leading into the aortic valve, and  which could possibly be causing your problem. In those cases the Inderal is sometimes pushed to pretty high doses (yours is a moderately high dose, but I've seen higher ones). That may be a useful approach, although it won't cure the underlying problem; it can sometimes make it manageable.  You have a remarkable number of upper and lower GI issues. This is interesting, in a clinical sense, and I can't help but wonder if there might be some sort of obscure connection between this and the heart problem (even though on the surface it would seem to make no sense).   I'll be very interested in what you find out during your Thursday appointment. Meanwhile please  feel free to vent if it helps. You have to be feeling a great deal of frustration, and sometimes just talking -- or writing -- about it can help relieve some of the stress of dealing with issues that sometimes seem positively crazy. I'm sure there is an underlying cause and  that it will be found out sooner  than later. Hang in there.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank again, I sometimes also wonder if there is some connection to all of this .  My appt. yesterday was actually pretty uneventful.  I didn't see my regular Cardio, but another one.  It was basically, you know this valve is failing, you know the road ahead will involve another valve replacement, but you can't change that; so try to work on your anxiety.  About the numbers he acknowledge them, but didn't seem overly concerned, he said about that \" the increase wasn't drastic\"... but my point is they are going up every few months. I'm also not sure what 's the magic number that I should worry??? I honestly don't know.   It seems to me, they are taking the approach of let's wait and see what happens.   FYI I have an appointment to have the light ran back down my throat on Dec.3rd.  It's just never ending. My mom tells me I should make the medical books pretty soon.  I think I mention the disability I am trying to get, to give you a little more background about me; I always had problems with cysts, one removed from breast, one from neck, several bartholin gland cysts, finally had to have the glands removed.  Not fun.  As I type right now I have an Arachnoid Cyst in the middle cranial fossa, a thornwalt cyst, one cyst on right ovary and three on thyroid.  Why are some people prone to cyst???  I also have spinal issues that along with my heart issues don't allow me to exercise.  Spinal stenosis, spinal arthritis, facet joint hypertrophy, a bulging disk laying on nerve root.    I guess when you combine all of this it's no wonder I'm stressed and not handling it well.   Take care and Thanks again. Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, Lisa,  Well, what often happens when there is a slowly progressive negative change such as with the valve in your case, there isn't necessarily a strict cutoff point where numbers are concerned, but rather these are corellated with symptoms to determine the overall need for intervention. Sometimes certain people can have pretty \"unsatisfactory\" numbers but for some reason (often remodeling of the heart and blood vessels, a natural accomodation), things work well enough for a longer time than one might expect if looking at test numbers alone. Hopefully this will be a sufficiently gradual process, and your doctor will work with you to determine when the time is right to do the next surgery. Of course that's probably cold comfort, given that no one especially wants to have that to look forward to. I think that part's a given, but it sometimes helps in that the patient is able to become more philosophical about the problem and realizes there is a lot of reserve built into us to deal with these things, physically as well as emotionally.  I wouldn't be surprised if you do wind up being written up in medical journals, especially if someone finds a common thread connecting all these disparate problems. I can't help but suspect there may be one, too. Meanwhile, though, you'll have to attack them separately and I hope the endoscopy winds up yielding some useful and helpful information.  You have every reason to feel stressed and frustrated. What's truly remarkable is how well, overall, you really are doing at dealing with all this! You may be a lot stronger than you think. Just try and hang on to that sense of humor. It'll take you a long way.    Take care and please stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey Doc, \"It's me again Margaret\"  I actually just got the copy of my echo in the mail today and wouldn't you know it I have another question for you.  I would have asked my Cardio, but I didn't have the report yet and since I knew I had one on the way I didn't ask him for a copy of it.  I knew what the gradient numbers were before I went because a nurse at my PCP told me.  They are good to me there, they say they see me so much I'm like family.  Anyway for my question; it's concerning the AV Area:  5/2008 it was 1.36 cm2 8/2008 it was 1.49 cm2 11/2008 it was 0.95 cm2  So is that bad?  Or is it just confirmation of the aortic stenosis?  I promise I'll try and give you a break after this. Thanks again for everything.  I wish I knew you in person.  I find the medical community now a days is all about the money with little to no compassion.   Oh, I have one more question for you, now after my OHS, I have noticed when I am in pain or mad my blood pressue and heart rate go through the roof.  An example was one night in the ER in Sept. 08, the night before I had the first test of the light down the throat, ( I can never remember the abbrev. for that procedure) anyway I was hurting like crazy, chest pain, upper abdominal pain shooting through to my back.  I also found out I have a fatty liver and don't drink alochol I will be follow up with the Gastro. on Dec. 3rd about this, but I'm thinking that it's probably due to all the med's I take.  Sorry I got off track, so anyway, one cocky resident doc. who would be admitting me; after he was called in by the ER doc., they have to come in and give you the once over and they make the final call on wheather or not you'll be admitted.  He came into my room and was so cocky as I already mentioned and had absolutely no compassion and he says to me and I quote \"I don't think you're in the pain you say you are in\", well I lost it.  I lit into him like there was no tomorrow, I was laying there thinking and telling him at 40 years  I've been through more pain than your young but can even imagine etc, I screamed at him to leave my room.  The next thing I know 6 nurses and some aids were standing over me screaming at me to calm down, my blood pressure had shot up to 161/140 and they were saying your heart is in v-tach.  I remember somebody saying she is about to go into a lethal rhythm, my heart rate maxed out at 171 before they got me calmed down and I think it was the word \"lethal\" that got my attention, they were saying he's not worth this, as they could hear our conversation as it did get rather loud.  Anyway needless to say after this there was no longer a question of my being admitted.  So I was put on a heart monitor and the next morning had the light ran down and found all the ulers etc. So now I'm like don't upset me all the time kidding with my family, I tell them you know my heart will freak out.  Is or should this be a real concern for me?  I guess it may have done that before the OHS and I never knew it, but now that  I do know what it will do should I worry?  Thanks again and sorry it turned out to be so long. Lisa\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 28 year old female. My health history includes endometriosis (2 surgeries) and gallbladder removal last year.  About 1 month or so ago I started having sharp stabbing chest pains. The pains were near and around the heart. My family physician diagnosed me with reflux....after treatment, we concluded it was an incorrect diagnosis. I have been to the ER 3 times for this chest pain. The day that the first pains came about I was just sitting on the couch watching tv and the pain radiated from my back shoulder blade to my chest, along with shortness of breath. I've had blood work, EKG's, ABG, CT w/dye of my heart at the ER's all came back fine. Next stop was the cardiologist. He did an EKG, echocardiogram & a Stress Echocardiogram. The echo showed that I have mild tricuspid regurgitation and mild mitral valve regurgitation. I could not get my heart rate up as high as he wanted me to during my stress echo. So when they tried to do the ultrasound of my heart, my heart rate dropped quickly. He put me on 25  mg of toprol-xl 1x daily. My blood pressure has always been around 120/80 and now with the toprol it has lowered greatly. I start on 1/2 of the 25 mg toprol tomorrow.  The toprol seems to work ok, but I still have mild chest pains. And of course all chest pains are scary...which is what I don't like!  My question is does the pain sound like tricuspid & mitral valve regurgitation? And is there any other drug out there that will not lower my blood pressure, but help my chest pain?  I am thinking about having children and am also worried about the effects of my heart on the pregnancy.  Sorry to make this so long! I appreciate your help!  Mandy\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mandy - While your symptoms are a mixed bag, the likelihood is that they are not due to coronary artery disease both because of your age and gender and because of your description of the pains.   One possible structural cause could be mitral valve prolapse (MVP) which can often be difficult to diagnose definitively because the \"gold standard\" requires an echocardiogram which shows one or both leaflets prolapsed or redundant; a \"click\" murmur, and non-specific ST-T wave changes on a resting EKG. With those requirements it is very difficult to nail the thing down. Many doctors, however, will go with a presumptive diagnosis of MVP if the symptoms are consistent with the syndrome. Having sharp, stabbing chest pains, especially at rest, is one from the long list. Shortness of breath (paradoxically with reasonable exercise tolerance) is another. Fatigue and palpitations are also common. MVP is reported most often among young, otherwise healthy females. So that is one possibility. The fact that your symptoms seem to have responded to the Toprol also would help support a presumptive diagnosis of MVP since there is mild mitral regurgitation also.   Given the likelihood of MVP syndrome (if not a concrete diagnosis of MVP) a beta blocker would be the first line medication to be used (and often the only one). Toprol is an excellent choice as far as that family of drugs go, usually having the least side effects.   Sometims MVP frustrates the doctor because it is difficult to meet all the criteria for a definite diagnosis, and the symptoms can be quite diverse. Sometimes people with  this syndrome will also have occasional migraine headaches or optical migraine (visual disturbances without the headaches). Anxiety is often prominent as well. Has any of this ever happened to you?   My best guess, given the information you've supplied, is either MVP syndrome or possibly something irritating the diaphragm (hiatal hernia?). It seems at least that there is nothing life-threatening going on, but you should continue to follow up as needed, or if the symptoms increase or change.   Best of luck to you and do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again, Mandy - You are very welcome. The additional information you've provided convinces me more than before that you likely are experiencing one of the common variations on the theme of MVP Syndrome (which can be diagnosed without a diagnosis of actual MVP - although this remains controversial in some quarters). Results are what matters, really, so long as there is no life-threatening problem, and I don't believe there is.  Generally what helps the pain and other symptoms is a combination of a beta blocker (Toprol is my personal favorite because of generally fewer annoying side effects), a guided fitness program and management of anxiety and/or panic. Usually this will bring MVPS-related pain under control, and the Toprol should have some fairly immediate benefit. It doesn't do it in every case, but many people have benefitted from just the beta blocker therapy.  Coronary artery disease is usually diagnosed via a series of tests, starting with a simple 12-lead EKG. If that shows nothing specific then a stress test either with echocardiogram or nuclear scan comes next. If this yields no positive findings then for most people that's where the search for CAD ends and the hunt for a resolution of the symptoms begins. That's where you appear to be now. If, for some reason, the stress echo exam had yielded some positive results (and remember, in diagnostic medicine \"positive\" is what we don't want to see), the next step and gold standard for diagnosing CAD would be to move to an angiogram, where a catheter is intruduced through the femoral artery and up into the heart, contrast dye is injected, and real-time pictures of the coronary vessels can be made and studied. This is (so far) the last, best way to rule CAD in or out, but only if there is some good reason to take that step. There has been nothing turned up in your workup that would warrant this, so MVPS seems by far the most likely cause.   It is worth noting that people often say \"But I didn't have this before!\" Often the symptoms of MVPS don't show up until young adulthood, and often they are associated with some emotional or physical stressor that is out of the ordinary for the individual. Other times it just starts up for no apparent reason. Either way it's treated first with a beta blocker, and sometimes also with one of the benzodiazapine family of drugs, like Xanax or Klonopin, at least temporarily, to ease the anxiety that often accompanies the symptoms.   To answer your final question, mild mitral or pulmonary regurge should not, by itself, cause chest pain. The connection between apparent MVP and most of the symptoms is extremely unclear, as most of the symptoms involve not the heart itself, but the autonomic nervous system (which in turn can affect the heart's behavior). What has been established is that there is some sort of statistical corelation between the two (although not all people with MVP have symptoms). Also, chest pain characterized as sharp and/or stabbing is rarely associated with CAD, which usally will produce fairly insidious, longer-lasting, constricting pressure, deep aching, or crushing sub-sternal pain. \"Sharp and stabbing\" is very often reported with MVPS. It also often is located in the left chest instead of beneath the breastbone as in most cases of symptomatic CAD.  I hope this helps clarify the picture for you. You've had a very comprehensive cardiac workup, so it is very unlikely that anything was missed. On the other hand, something telling, although essentailly innocent, was uncovered. The symptoms strongly suggest MVP syndrome. No one can declare this with certainty at a distance, but, given the excellent workup and your description of the symptoms, it is pretty much a textbook description of MVP syndrome, which is definitely not life-threatening, although it can be, as one authority on the subject has put it, \"lifestyle threatening\", mainly because of the anxiety and uncertainty it causes, the unnecessary worry and consequent fear of doing a lot of the things one would normally do.   It's hard when you've got a very literal pain going on, to tell yourself it's unimportant. We are wired to react to pain as though something is wrong. In the case of MVP, though, the thing that is \"wrong\" is actually the pain itself. Toprol hopefully will put a major dent in the pain and other symptoms as well.   Good luck to you and pleae keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "No problem! While the pain associated with MVP can occur on either side of the chest, most people tend to point to the left breast. However, I have encountered people whose pain was more random and some whose pain followed the typical cardiac pain route (center to left, then down the arm). Since yours occurs in different places at different times there is also the possibility (I think I mentioned this early on) that it is referred pain from something irritating the diaphragm. I still think MVPS the most likely explanation though.   I should ask you: is any of this pain worsened by breathing or upper body movement? (This would disqualify it as any sort of heart-related pain and lead toward an orthopedic cause). Just curious.\n\n",

About 5 years ago I was put on anxiety meds for my social phobia and test anxiety (I'm a college student) and I also began experiencing acid reflux and was told to take an otc med. So for 5 years I've still experienced chest pain. I've visited 3 different cardiologists, all acknowleding that I have MVP and a heart  murmur but saying I'm too young for chest pain and dismissing me with a perscription of Toradol...which will cure the pain for the moment and then it comes back. I'm not overweight for my height, I don't eat badly, and I go for walks almost everday, yet I still have pain. The pain is on the left side of my chest and sometimes feels as though it's shooting straight through to my back. Sometime it will go from the far left to about midchest. Many times it's accompanied by shortness of breath. I just want to know that I'm not crazy like the doctors around here are making me feel. I really would like to find out what is wrong with me, but I can't find one to listen. Any advice you can give to me would be helpful. Also, is there something I can do to make doctors take me seriously? I've tried dressing nicely for appointments, taking my mom, nothing seems to get me anywhere. I'm sorry this is long..I tried to give good information. Thanks again\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your symptom of concern, the left-sided chest pain, is classic for MVP  syndrome. It is atypical for coronary artery disease, but young women generally do present with atypical heart disease symptoms (when it is present). While it's very likely your symptoms are due to MVP, and can be treated, you should be given the courtesy of a reasonably thorough cardiological workup. This would ease your mind and satisfy the highest ethical standard of care, something to which everyone is entitled.   It's an unfortunate fact of life that young, otherwise healthy women -- and women in general -- are taken less seriously regarding heart disease than are men by a majority of doctors. That you've met three. and that they were all cardiologists, who would make a summary judgement based on statistics, is shocking. (Statistically it is entirely likely your chest pain is due to MVP -- but what if it weren't? Who would answer if  something bad happened?).   You're gone above and beyond the call of duty to get your doctors to treat you as a patient and not as \"just\" a young, apparently healthy woman. This is a problem that will improve over the coming years, as it has become an issue and a cause. Still,  as your story proves, not everyone is on board yet.   I want to repeat that I believe, based upon your description of the symptoms, that what you're feeling is due to MVP syndrome. At the very least, you should have been prescribed a beta blocker drug to help manage this. Toradol isn't appropropriate for this  sort of pain; although it will do no particular harm, it's not a solution, either.   I also want to repeat that you are entitled to be treated as a human being with a potentially serious complaint that deserves to be explored and anything serious ruled out. An EKG an echocardiogram and a stress test would be appropriate. You may have had one or two of these, but apparently not a stress test. All should be done based upon symptoms. I hope also your meds for social phobia are working well for you.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

If either of the first two questions can be answered \"yes\", it's not related to your heart or surgery, but if you take a statin drug (Zocor, Lipitor, etc.) it could be related to that.

At the time I went to the doctor , she eliminated any heart condition or fluid in lungs.  My blood pressure was only 133/90.   Just said anxiety.  So I'll be incorporating relaxation techniques in my routine.   But everyday everynight STILL I am hearing bubbling and gurgling and popping sounds on the left side of my body, sometimes under my breast, and 98% of the time the bubbling is heard ONLY on my left side in between the area under my left armpit down the my pelvic bone. So I don't know what all organs are there, I guess my spleen, abdomen, etc, but if you can pinpoint what these symptoms might be.    The doctor of course did not hear any of those noises and just asked me was I moving my bowels regularly and yes I am.  No stress or strain.  The bubbles never come out in the form of gas, they just travel up and down along the left side of my body, making noises and being irritatins.  Now I feel a heaviness in that area much like I would feel when you have the pressure in my chest, but THERE IS NO PAIN.    So what could this be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it's of course impossible to say with certainty at a distance and without any imaging studies, that there is nothing really bizarre going on, but it is, needless to say, unlikely. Usually when these sorts of symptoms occur on the left side (right side, too, but more often on the left), it is because there is not only one's stomach largely located beneath the left breast, but the splenic flexure of the colon is also over there. Gastric and intestinal contents can be heard more clearly in some people than others, for various innocent reasons, and a lot goes on over on the left between the hip and the breast, in the fundus of the stomach and that last sharp turn in the colon. Lots of peristalsis can cause lots of sounds, even if there is no gas passed (and a lot of gas is disbursed osmotically anyway, so may not be passed via the obvious routes). In other words, for certain individuals this is normal.   I hope this is helpful to you. If you have any further questions or any other information to add, please contact us here. Good luck to you.\n\n",

This is something that can create a lot of noise at that turn in the gut, which is often audible at some distance. Adding a fiber supplement to your diet may possibly help quiet things down, although doing so many times will actually cause the very problem you're concerned about now in people who've had other GI complaints but not the noises.   Needless to say, if it continues to trouble you, the best thing you can do is to be seen by an MD, preferably a GI specialist.\n\n",

My symptoms lasted for a very long time, ie; a few years (along with many others involving gastointestinal issues) They would come and go until summer 204 when I got a very bad case of poison ivy and was put on Prednisone and all symptoms went away until now. The racing heart, chest pain, horrible anxiety, pounding chest, shortness of breath have returned over the past month. These episodes always seem to correlate with indigestion and last for months.  I have mild scoliosis, pectus excavatum, flat feet, hypermobility, I have had IBS and GERD intermittently. I am generally healthy, female, 41, 5'5\" and 120lbs.  My question is: looking at my echo, can I develop mitral valve prolapse? I have a history of positive ANA (I got very ill in 2001 and my Dr thought I had an autoimmune disease.)  I have had anxiety since I was a teen, my hands are frequently cold and I am very sensitive to things like caffeine, medications, etc. I know this is sort of rambly, I am just throwing it out as I think of it. Could it just be anxiety?  My heart rate goes from very low 60's to high 90s for a long time. I don't have any pain with exercise but I do get out of breath with little exertion. I go up stairs fine but after I get to the top then I am huffing and puffing. I don't smoke but used to. I haven't smoked for 4-5 years. I have been a bit stressed lately. I sigh a lot as if I can't get a good breath in.  Should I be worried about my heart or the leaky valves progressing into something serious? Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Trace mitral regurgitation and trace tricuspid insufficiency",
    "content": "Hi there -  First, your echo came back looking good. The trace regurgitation in either of those valves is commonly seen in otherwise healthy people. The  only reason you might  require periodic re-examination is because you sound as though you may have some anatomical markers for possible Marfan's syndrome, a disease of the connective tissue, and so could develop progressive valvular problems such as mitral valve prolapse (MVP), although normally you would already have that at this point in your life.   In  general it sounds as though the causes of your symptoms are those that cause them in most otherwise healthy people and they shouldn't be related directly to the very trivial valvular regurgitation you have right now. Such things as GI issues, IBS and GERD can all contribute to the triggering of palpitations (usually premature ventricular contractions -- PVCs -- and sometimes premature atrial contractions -- PACs -- as well). This can be extremely uncomfortable and may be associated with functional symptoms such as you describe, which may be attributable to timing of the premature beats and/or chronic anxiety, the latter being responsible  for a lot of ancillary symptoms such as a sense of shortness of breath (usually along with markedly good exercise tolerance). The habit of sighing can actually also not only trigger premature beats but can create a chronic sense of shortness of breath by throwing off too much CO2, the very thing that tells the brain to tell the person to breathe. This results in a lack of stimulus to breathe, which, in cyclical fashion, leaves on feeling one can't breathe properly, leading to more sighing. If you can stay aware of it and try to work at not doing that, eventually you'll find the sense of shortness of breath will tend to go away. It sounds backward, but trust me on this one.   The one thing which I  find unusual -- though not necessarily in a bad way -- is the fact that your symptoms subsided when you were given steroids. Usually people who suffer the same symptoms you describe will report they get worse when on steroids. However, there is always the  paradoxical effect, and in this case that seems to be what happened. At any rate, it worked to your advantage, which is a good thing.   Because of the anatomical anomalies you have, which are often associated with MVP and other valvular heart problems, you'd do well to have at least an annual echocardiogram, but given your age, it would seem your body has gotten comfortable with the arrangement and is actually doing well. I don't think you have any heart problems at this time, and you may be able to actually help reduce the frequency of palpitations and other  anxiety-related symptoms. The outlook would seem to be very good overall.   I hope this is of some help. Best of luck to you, and please do follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: having bad palpations and pounding w/ chest pains",
    "content": "Hello -  Your event monitor results show several different things going on at once, and these need to be explored to discover the underlying cause.  Since you had AVNRT already, and had it ablated, it is not unreasonable that you might have other electrical abnormalities as well. The variety of arrhythmias recorded by the event monitor all could cause chest discomfort, pressure or pain without there being any significant coronary artery disease, but given the extremely positive family history for coronary artery disease you should be (or should have been) worked up for this as well as having been evaluated for arrhythmias.   The findings from  the event monitor report are  interesting but also present at least one finding that  doesn't make sense. Hopefully you have access to additional information which could help clear this up. While atrial flutter with a rapid ventricular response would cause chest discomfort,  palpitations, dizziness and even possibly a cough (some sufferers do report this), the finding of \"idioventricular tachycardia with a rate up to 180 bpm\" actually doesn't make sense. I say this because, firstly, the term \"idioventricular tachycardia\" isn't usually used, and idioventricular rhythms are either very slow escape rhythms or, if not slow,  then are called \"accelerated idioventricular rhythm\" and are generally only about 15 beats faster than the regular sinus rhythm, and most often lower than 100 beats per minute. At a rate of 180 bpm, this would actually be considered ventricular tachycardia.   In the case of each of the two tachyarrhythmias above, the report doesn't mention duration of the episodes, and this could be very important. Atrial flutter not only is uncomfortable, but can, like atrial fibrillation, can cause clot formation in the atria,  which can come loose and  cause stroke. If  it is only an occasional and very brief episode it may not be significant. If the episodes lasted any significant amount of time, however, you may need prophylactic medication to prevent this from happening.  Since you had AVNRT to begin with, it is entirely possible you might also have Wolfe-Parkinson-White syndrome (WPW), which is also correctable, usually, by the same ablation technique used to correct AVNRT. WPW is usually easily detected on resting EKG, but not always, so this should be explored, and whether or not WPW is present, the duration of episodes of atrial flutter need to be known.  The idioventricular tachycardia issue needs clarification as well. And finally, you need to be evaluated for possible coronary heart disease. I don't now how much of this has been done or is being done in possible followup, but it all needs to be addressed. Your various arrhythmias would account  for the symptoms you describe,  and while  atrial flutter is not life-threatening it does have the potential,  if it continues for sustained periods,  to cause clot formation and stroke, so this needs to be addressed. The  ventricular arrhythmia most definitely needs to be clarified. While  both of these would account for the numerous symptoms  you are describing, the rate attributed to idioventricular tachycardia really needs to be clarified. If this is incomplete or erroneous information it may not be significant, but the rate of 180 bpm concerns me both because of its potential to cause harm and because it is inconsistent with the definition  of this arrhythmia. If these two issues can be clarified and coronary artery disease ruled out, you may really have little to be concerned about,  but until then I  really feel you should pester the cardiologist about this until you get some concrete answers.   I hope this helps or at least gets the ball rolling. If there is any other information you may have, please let us know.  Thanks for bringing your concerns to this  site. We'll look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

I have had a cardiac enzyme done on 02/19/08 that had a Troponin-I of 0.11 (this is the only one where it was high), but the next day it went back to 0.0. they told me damage to muscles other than the heart can cause this. i do have a trace as my cardiologist put it of pulmonary regurgitation. ( i have had every test done known to mankind) i have had an hiv test, stress test, echo, ekgs(over 10 all normal, except for the tachycardia) all of these came out normal. i even had a nuclear scan of my heart done the day of the stress test which my cardiologist said was normal. i have had a ct scan of the chest with contrast to rule out clots due to a positive d-dimer) it. came out negative. a ct scan of my head which was normal. i have had a ugi and ba swallow which was normal, but i still have some burning and pin prick pains in both sides of my chest nd experience arm weakness. i am a 50dd/ddd and i am due for breast reduction. but i need to know where you think this burning in my chest area (upper) is from and the mucsle weakness and fatigue. do you think it is muscle inflammation? i have not lifted any thing heavy or could it just be from haveing large breast. i say no because i have them up in a bra all day long. my cardiologists stated that my psvt and panic attacks were all stress related due to me being worried after all these tests that something is still wrong. also i had high levels of cholesterol, triglycerides, hga1c, ldls. i have gotten them back in great range and i have lost from 225lbs down to 180lbs. please help??????\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  You have undergone some extensive investigational work up! All that I can find positive from this is the PSVT. Sometimes it can be precipitated by anxiety, a basic organic conduction abnormality is always there and if the PSVTs are too frequent and not preventable by oral medications, its certainly worth considering an ablation therapy.   The burning and pin prick sensations (paraesthesia in medical parlance) are usually a classic sign of either some nerve irritation or some deficiency of Vit B12. Paraesthesia in chest area is sometimes due to nerve root irritation or compression in the neck vertebrae. If your doctor agrees you may get an X ray of the cervical spine done.  However I think anxiety on your part is playing a major role in your predicament, and you must try and calm down as majority of youe tests have come out normal.  Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It seems you have a great deal of insight into the link between depression and somatic feelings of illness or discomfort. Depression, whether situational or clinical, can cause physical stress which can, in turn, cause symptoms that can mimic other diseases. Your symptoms could, of course, possibly be heart-related, especially if there is a strong family history of it, and those symptoms  should be evaluated by a healthcare provider, but it is relatively rare for heart disease to show up, even in people with a family history, before the age of 50 (although  there is a small subset of families in which it begins to show up in the 30s). In short, the odds are great that your symptoms are not caused by heart disease (and your good tolerance for exercise really argues that  it's something else). You also recognize your own depression and the fact that these symptoms tend to show up mostly when you're feeling down. The connection is probably solid.   I would bring the whole matter, the physical symptoms and the emotional ones, to a doctor, who can evaluate the physical ones and likely refer you to a psychologist who can help you deal with the emotional ones -- which are very likely causing the physical ones. Even if the depression isn't causing them, which it probably is, depression is as serious as any illness, and is very manageable in the right hands.  I hope you'll pursue both problems medically. I strongly suspect one is causing the other, but even if it's two separate things they deserve to be treated, and you deserve to be enjoying life a lot more than you can when you're depressed and hurting.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Your calcium score places you at mild to moderate risk of a coronary event, and the scan demonstrates apparent narrowing of less than 50 per cent in the affected arteries. Normally this wouldn't necessarily suggest an angiogram urgently unless you were having symptoms such as chest pain, shortness of breath, etc., or unless your EKG showed significant abonormalities, which may be what led your doctor to order the CT angiogram.   I don't see anywhere in your list of results anything which suggests there is plaque on the outside of the affected arteries, so I'm not sure what  gave the the notion that was the case. All I see is that there is plaque buildup inside two of the coronary arteries, each less than 50 per cent, which is usually followed medically with statin drugs and a supervised diet and exercise program to maintain or reduce the calcium score and perhaps reduce the amount of plaque. Unless your doctor has told you otherwise, I would continue the activities and exercise you currently pursue, but with some caution not to overwork yourself in an unusual fashion. So long as you are symptom-free and your obstructions are less than 50 per cent you are probably maintaining well by remaining active and, hopefully, eating a heart healthy diet as well.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While I'm sure your cardiac sillhouette may indicate an enlarged heart, I have to criticize your doctor's approach in  telling you it is \"huge\", even though that may have been the first impression.  There are many things, some of them fairly benign, which can cause a large cardiac sillhouette on x-ray. The echocardiogram is appropriate given that finding, and will be a lot more informative. If you truly have a \"huge\" heart it is surprising you haven't had more severe symptoms. It is possible of course, but it seems unlikely. The echo findings will be much more helpful in determining what, if any, risks you face due to any heart abnormality. If your heart is enlarged there are several ways in which this can happen and some require more aggressive management than others.   I hate to say \"wait and see\", since there's no way you won't be on the edge of your seat til you find out what's going on, but please at least take comfort in two facts: first, the x-ray is hardly definitive of the condition  (if any) and second, since you seem to have had few cardiac symptoms (unless the cough and wheezing are somehow related to a heart condition), the problem  may not be as severe as the doctor's reaction might have indicated.   Please do follow up with us here once you know more about what's going on and we'll do our best to help explain things as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

One question I have is about Viagra.  I have read on numerous web sites that Viagra can help with enlarged hearts & also may even reverse some if not all of the damage.  Can you give me your input on Viagra & this condition?  I would like to ask my doctor about it, but I mean it's viagra... don't exactly want to be a 23 yr old female asking for that lol  Would you reccomend it?   Also, I would like to ask what are the symptoms that I should look for incase something goes wrong?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Enlarged Heart",
    "content": "Hello again -  First, an ejection fraction of 50% is at the lower end of normal, so it's really fine, but probably should be rechecked in six months or so. Uncontrolled high blood pressure is one possible cause of a low EF, but you're not really at low yet, but still within normal limits. However, elevated blood pressure should be treated, and interestingly enough, what is good for high blood pressure is also often what's good for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. While Viagra seems as though it may have some promise in this area (it certainly can lower blood pressure), there are several other medications (one or two ACE inhibitors and one or two beta blockers) which have a proven track record of effectiveness in this area. Many blood pressure medications lower pressure by reducing the cardiac output, which effectively weakens the force of contractions. This can sometimes lead to mild  atrophy of an overbuilt heart muscle. It couldn't hurt to mention your interest in Viagra for this purpose, since there is some interest in it, but most likely a beta blocker, possibly in combination with an ACE inhibitor,  would be the preferred therapy, and this often can reduce the strain on the heart and even reverse the  enlargement to some degree.   I wouldn't hold back on the Viagra question. It's funny, but it's appropriate, too.   Best of luck to you, and just make sure you're followed for this problem to see if it remains stable. Get the BP down and I'm betting the enlargement will adjust over time. Thanks for updating us.\n\n",

Whatever the answer,  it would seem you passed with no problem. It's true, trivial leakage of one or all valves is not unusual and the doctor is  the best judge of this and seems happy with the result.   As for the \"maintain your blood pressure\" I'm sure he meant  to maintain a normal blood pressure. It's not clear if your blood pressure was already normal or was low. The doctor wouldn't have told you to \"maintain\" a high blood pressure, so I'm guessing it was probably a little low and what you need to do to  keep it normal is, foremost, to remain properly hydrated. Drink plenty of fluids. That's as much as I can deduce from the information you've provided, but it sounds like a very good result from your exam.  Good luck to you. If you have further questions, don't hesitate to ask us.\n\n",

I did not know I had anxiety until one day my breathing became difficult, my heart raced, and I passed out.  When I awoke, my heart still felt like it was beating hard and fast, and I felt faint, dizzy, and tingly.  I basically thought I was having a heart attack.  After a complete work up of my entire body I was diagnosed with anxiety disorder.  Panic attacks can make you faint because your breathing becomes shallow, and they are very scary and feel very physical.  I am now on anti-depressants along with Xanax for when I feel one of the attacks coming on, and they have all but stopped.  Just a thought, your wife my have anxiety and not even know it.

    "content": "Hi, Priyadarshan.  I take 300 mg of Wellbutrin per day, 80 mg of Prozac per day, and 1 mg of Xanax as needed for attacks.  I take the Xanax as soon as I feel an attack coming on, then sit down, breathe deeply, and relax.  I also go to counseling once per week, and this has helped me learn to cope with my anxiety mentally and not just with medication.  The combination of all of these things has pretty much stopped the attacks, they are very few and far between, and a lot of times I can breathe through them.  One breathing exercise is to breathe in through your nose for a count of 4, hold the breath for a count of 6, and exhale for a count of 8.  This relaxes you almost as much as the medications do.    I'd have your wife ask her doctor for a referral to a counselor who can help her determine the best medications for her to control these attacks, because they are horrible.  Take good care!  Tara\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Short breathing with occasionally getting unconscious",
    "content": "Hello Priyadarshan -   Since your wife has been cleared of any potential heart or respiratory problems it does sound like an anxiety-mediated problem, and many anxious people concentrate on their breathing in a way that causes the exact symptoms you describe. It is called hyperventilation  syndrome and can actually cause the patient to pass out.   jandksmom1 has given you one of the greatest tips to pass along to your wife regarding this problem, and that is to breathe slowly and  through the nose (if at all possible, realizing some people have allergies or deviated nasal septum that can interfere with this). I  always encourage anxious hyperventilating patients to try and breathe through their nose and it almost always shortly has a calming effect. When one breaths too much (hyperventilates) too much carbon dioxide is thrown off, which is the thing that triggers the normal urge to breathe. When it is gone, the person feels as though he or she cannot breathe at all (because the brain believes they don't need to), so they try harder, til they actually pass out or have muscle spasms in the hands.   If you can at least get this across to your wife you may be able to help her break the tendency to do this. If not, there are anti-anxiety medications which might help, and also specialized types of psychotherapy.   I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I was diagnosed w/ MVP around 1995. I had felt my heart beating irregularly especially at night time. Then I started working out by lifting weights, w/o cario exercises.  That was when I first got a checkup.  1st doctor told me my heart wasn't getting the correct signal. Then after ultrasound, he said it was MVP and told me to stop working out. So do my dismay, I stopped working out.  A second doctor told me I had MVP, but working out should be okay, even w/ weights. But I had stopped working out just in case.  Until recently, my heart seemed okay, but since about 2 years ago I've been getting  out of shape w/ my belly growing.  I've been snoring louder (snoring started around 1995).  I'm constantly tired.  So I started working out again, this time w/ 20 min. of cardio everyday, and lifting weights for about a month now, resting about 2 days a week.  I am having small throbbing, annoying left chest pain area and a bit on the left arm and sometimes at finger tips - usually in the morning.  And my irregular heart beat has started up again.  I am 33 yrs old.  I lost about 5 lbs in the last month of workout and have been told that I've been snoring less. I've also been watching my diet.  I weigh about 165 lbs now at height of 5'8.  I will be going to get a checkup.  I'm worried about the chest pain, and whether I should stop working out again.  I love working out and having to stop again would depress me (it depressed me the first time).  Is the pain related to my heart/workout, and should I stop the work out?  I would hate to just do cardio workout and not do any heavy weight lifting. Your advice would be much appreciated.  My apologies for such a long post.  Thank you in advance.  I\n\n",

    "content": "Hi trojan -  Your follow up deserves a follow up. Here it is: your doctor is correct that the finding of mild mitral regurgitation without valvular malfunction is extremely normal, as the mitral valve has rather large leaflets. A little jet of blowback is perfectly normal,  but is noted, along with everything else that's found to be less-than-perfect. The problem is the patient somehow finds this out and starts worrying about it. Trust me, this is also very common, but you have no need to worry about it, and this is why lay people really ought not be handed clinical reports unless the doctor has the time to spend explaining all the normal stuff in them.   As for your heart \"acting up\" it sounds as though you are having occasional premature beats, which are also absolutely normal and have no diagnostic value at all, especially in a heart found to be otherwise normal. However, they can be very unsettling because of the sensation. What may surprise you is that some people have these very frequently and don't feel them at all, while other people have them rather rarely but feel every one (and there may be some rhyme and reason in that, since the more often a thing happens the more likely we are to tune it out). At any rate, I hope this clears up some of your lingering concerns about your heart's health. It sounds as though it is itself very healthy and the  things you're feeling are also, oddly enough, totally normal (and almost universal as well).   Enjoy your good health.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: LVH on EKG?",
    "content": "Hi 2gayle -   There are a lot of things that can cause what are called \"deep\" waves (QRS complex representing the heartbeat's electrical sequence), and not always an enlarged heart, although this is one thing we do look for. However, in your case I suspect you hit the nail on the head when you mentioned being nervous during the exam. This can actually cause a dramatic temporary increase in cardiac output, which can, in turn, produce the deep waves normally associated with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH). However, the echo is an actual moving picture of the internal structures of the heart and if that looked normal then you don't have LVH.   The fact that your arm and leg pain go away during exercise should have been explained to you as a positive thing, that heart-related pain never goes away during exertion but usually gets worse. Also, since your  legs are tied into a different branch of sensory nerves, heart problems will never cause leg pain. Since vascular problems seem to have been ruled out for you, it would seem most likely the arm and leg pain are coincidental, as the arms also use a different set of sensory nerves. The leg pain sounds like it might well be due to pressure on a low back (lumbar or sacral) nerve or even sciatica, pressure on the sciatic nerve. However, sciata doesn't usually go away during walking either, and in fact usually makes walking difficult. For that reason it sounds more and more benign as  we rule out potential causes. In no case would the arm and leg be tied together where pain is concerned.   Hopefully by now the problem has resolved itself. Please feel free to follow up with us.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chest Pain/Hard Heart Beats",
    "content": "Hello Matt -   The  inhaler was probably a part of the problem for sure. The other things you describe relating to bowel movements, gas, etc., would explain a lot of the chest discomforts you feel, as with gas comes bloating or at least distension of the bowel, so that it presses upward, often at one of the flexures on the left or right side, which can irritate the diaphragm and, well, things just kind of work their way up to where you feel the pain in your chest or even your shoulder. It seems like a long way to travel, but this can happen in moments and can be quite disturbing. The gas and other bowel activity can also stimulate your vagus nerve, which probably explains at least some of the occasional \"skipped\" (actually premature) beats your doctor heard, which really are of no consequence.  Hopefully this helps some. If not, please feel free to ask further questions. Hope you are feeling fine by now.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ontopwater2 - Even though you apparently had a scope done of your espohagus at the time of the original incident and nothing was found, I am suspecting that most likely you have one of two problems (or possibly both): One is an esaphageal diverticulum, a little pocket that forms in some peoples' esophagus and often catches food particles, causing   coughing, discomfort, rumination, etc. The other is achalasia, a motor nerve disorder which can cause problems with swallowing and so on occasion choking on bits of food. The likelihood of you being able to feel the same bits of food you swallowed 18 months ago, while not imossible, is at least improbable. However, with either of the above two disorders there is the possibility of an unpleasant awareness of the presence of \"something\" (usually assumed to be a bit of food) stuck somewhere in the passage.  The fact that you have a sensation of something being down there (and duplicating the sensation you had when you choked on food previously) suggests achalasia. This is usually the result of the lower esaphageal sphincter not working correctly - more precisely, it not opening sufficiently when it is supposed to, and so trapping bits of food inside the esophagus. It is treated by passing increasingly large, egg-shaped objects through it in order to force it to open up more. This is usually effective, and is not much different than having a gastroscopy such as you probably had done during your visit to the hospital. It is done under moderate sedation.   Another possibility is that you actually have gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD) and a bit of food has found its way back to the original location, which would probably be a small pocket high up in the esophagus.  Sometimes achalasia is accompanied by a sensation of a lump in the throat although nothing is actually there. Called \"globus sensation\", this is usually seen in conjunction with some emotional issue, often one of prolonged sadness over some event or situation, or with mild chronic anxiety.   I would suggest a referral to an ENT specialist who would best be able to figure out what is going on. It is awfully odd that the exact same symptoms returned after such a long time.  You certainly shouldn't have to deal with this sort of thing indefinitely.  Best of luck to you and please let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Based on the echo and doppler study results you've posted here I would say it didn't seem, at that time, that mitral replacement was yet indicated, although your daughter certainly would have needed to be followed to be sure the problem hadn't progressed. You don't mention symptoms or limitations, either, but with an EF of 48 it is entirely possible she could have been functioning normally. Hoever, since the malfunctioning valve had already caused some dilation of the left ventricle (LV) I am going to assume the problem has been going on for some time and is therefore progressive. There isn't a lot of wiggle room at this point, so if your daughter hasn't already had the valve replaced by now, I would be surprised if replacement wasn't in the planning stage at least.  We'd like very much to know how things have gone since this post. I hope you will get back to us and that your daughter is doing well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 24 year old female with no health problems until recently except hypothyroidism which I was diagnosed with almost 6 years ago. I've been tested numerous times for that and take Levoxyl 100 mcg. One c-section 8 monts ago. I've got all kinds of things going on including abdominal pain, yeast infections, back pain, rapid heart rate, chronic diaherra, chest pain, prickling in my body all over, headaches, burning sensations in my face and arms... I saw my gastro specialist . He ordered a whole chemistry panel and a upper gi series and small bowel with barium contrast. I had that done and waiting on the results.  I've been to the ER 4 times in the past two months, my ob/gyn and GP a least a dozen times. Four nights ago I went to the ER  with a racing heart rate about 120, which is high for me. And for the past few days I can see my pulse very clearly through my stomach, had back pain, and sore ribs. My heart rate once I calmed down has stayed at around 100. It's been around that for weeks. Well, since I have had 2 cat scans done on my abdomen and  one ultrasound on my pelvis, 2 ekg's, one chest x-ray,  and tons of bloodwork, they sent me home from the ER, saying that my heart rate was up and was I dehydrated and to follow up with my GP in the morning. I was concerned about an abdominal aortic aneurysm. The ER doc said no not to be concerned because I have had 2 cat scans done it would have shown up. The most recent one was done with contrast a little less than a month ago. She said that aneurysms don't just show up overnight. They are gradual things that grow in size over time. Then my GP said this morning the same thing and not to worry about. However she said she heard a click in my heart, possibly a mitral valve prolapse that she's sending me to a cardologist in a couple of weeks to see. So can y'all help me a bit. I am so afraid that I gonna have something life threatening even though I've been told that it's not and I've had all these tests. Any knowledge would be helpful. I have no realt family history of heart disease or aneurysm. I had a great uncle who had heart problems and my grandfather died of a heart attack but he was an alcholic. Thanks so much!!![/b]\n\n",

If you have not had your thyroid levels tested recently I would recommend you do so to make sure you are not taking too much Levoxyl.  Mitral valve prolapse is extremely common, especially in women.  In general it is an incidental finding.  Seeing a cardiologist is important just to know about it.  If you do have mitral valve prolapse that causes a leaky valve, it is recommended to take antibiotics before surgery, etc. to help prevent bacterial endocarditis.  I would agree with your doctor that an aneurysm takes time to form.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks Dr.Lowe! Yes, I do need a thyroid check soon but my veins are all shot. My doc said to hold off on taking the Levoxyl till I get the test, but now I'm worried that's gonna throw it off. We'll see how that goes. I just went to the cardiologist and he said I was fine except I have an unconditioned heart, basically I'm out of shape. He said I was just suffering from anxiety. My barium x ray results came back and they said everything was normal. My bloodwork was normal for celiac and other food allegries as well. The gastro doc said I just probably have IBS. But he said we'll see how it goes and do further test if needed. I'm so confused. I still have headaches and tingling going on and constant diaherra. I go for a cat scan of my head sometime soon to see if there is anything going on there. My regular GP gave me some anxiety meds (vistaril) to see if that will help but I haven't taken them yet because my gastro guy gave me Levsin and you aren't supposed to take antihistamines with Levsin. I haven't even tried the Levsin because I'm not sure I have IBS. I have a bad pain in my stomach that is very tender to touch, hurts when I move sometimes and is always there. Sometimes when I eat it helps, sometimes not. I have diaherra with mucus most days. Can't pass gas unless right before a bowel movement.  I've got back pain, chest pain,joint pain, but my cardiologist said to check for RA or lupus since my mother and other family members have that. Could that pain also be from dehyrdation due to the diaherra? I still see the pulse in my stomach. But now I've had my gastro specialist, cardologist, regular GP, and an ER doc say no to an aneurysm. They all say they don't form over night and since I've had a ct done just over a month ago, stop worrying about it. So basically after all this rambling I'm asking 1) can you have celiac disease and it not show up on a blood test? 2) should I get the test done for RA? 3) can dehyrdation cause all kinds of pains as well as a fast heart rate? 4) do my symptoms with my stomach fit IBS?  5) should I drop the whole worrying about aneurysm? how likely is it that someone at my age of 24, and a ct scan done a little over a month would have developed one in such a short period of time? I'm such a worry wart! Thanks for your time and advice!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possible aortic aneurysm? All kinds of gastro problems too..",
    "content": "Hi redheadedmom -   I just noticed you had some loose ends dangling here with this thread so will try and answer the rest of your questions.  First of all, anxiety can cause a whole host of symptoms as it disturbs the normal workings of the  autonomic nervous system. However, it can also become a too-easy scapegoat for everything, so I want you to understand that while many of your complaints have been explained already (and some concerns definitely ruled out), IBS is often secondary to anxiety, and you would appear to be an anxious person, so if you can get a handle on one, the other may well resolve with it. IBS is also something of a catch-all diagnosis, when everything else has been ruled out, so one should be glad to wind up with that diagnosis, except, of course, that it's sometimes difficult to treat and is no fun at all.   You definitely should be tested for both RA and thyroid disease. Many people are told their veins are \"shot\" but it's not really true (except in certain chemotherapy patients) and a good phlebotomist can find a vein and draw the small sample of blood that would be needed to help rule RA and thyroid disease in or out.   It is absolutely true that aortic aneurisms develop over a long period of time and one wouldn't want to be having a CT every month just to make sure one hasn't popped up. The only way one of those can develop suddenly is in the event of major abdominal trauma (as in an auto accident) and nowadays the mechanism of trauma is always taken into consideration at the time and patients have these things ruled in/out on the spot.  A \"natural\" aneurism can take years to develop,  and usually only in the presence of known vascular disease, usually starting at middle age or older, so you can let go of that worry for sure.  Vistaril  (atarax) is a very old, minor antianxiety/antihistimine that could well be replaced with something that would work better, since Vistaril depends upon its  sedative properties to relieve anxiety and sedation isn't the best way to treat chronic anxiety -- there is a whole world of anti-anxiety medications (as well as some antidepressants that also work well at suppressing anxiety) that work without making the patient drowsy and drying the mouth. I'd look  into both a replacement for Vistaril and also perhaps consider a referral to a psychotherapist who specializes in cognitive therapy (CT), a form of therapy that does not go on forever, but has a definite course and is interactive and often very helpful in actually getting rid of anxiety instead of just treating its symptoms.   Regarding celiac disease in the absence of lab findings, this is probably possible but is virtually unheard of. I think your doctor has this one right on the money.  Finally, no, not all ulcers and bowel problems can be visualized via barium x-ray studies (although probably most can). The ultimate solution for the ulcer (or gastritis) question is  to have a gastroscopy, wherein you are actually sedated and a slender tube with a small scope is fed down your esophagus into your stomach so that a GI specialist can actually look at the stomach lining. The equivalent bowel study would be a colonoscopy, but it would be hard to justify one of those given your youth and the fact that there is a convincing diagnosis already made regarding the lower GI complaints.   I hope all this helps ease your mind some and gives you some ideas as to how to proceed from here. Good luck and please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "am a nurse inquiring about my husband:  60 years old, past history includes well controlled Hypertension since early 20's; severe gallstone pancreatitis about 4 years ago with development of type II diabetes (diet/exercise) about one year ago secondary to above.  Echo about one year ago (59 yrs )showed probable BAV; echo results included following: aortic root 3.43 cm; ACS 2.06 cm; LA size 5.0 cm; LVID end systolic 3.9 cm; end diastolic 5.6; IVAd 1.05 cm; LVPWd 2.05 cm; M-mode showed aortic root and aortic cusp calicification; systolic excursion somewhat limited; mitral leaflets some sclerosis with calcification of mitral annulus; no evidence of MV prolapse or stenosis; IV septu;m/posterior wall contracting fairly well.  2-D echo - LV normal size with LV hypertrophy/adqeuate EF.  moderate/marked LA dilitation; RA normal; again MV some sclerois with calcification of annulus; tricuspid valve normal; considdrable aortic root and cusp calcification with somewhat limited systolic excursion; structure of valve not adequately id'd but BAV cannot be excluded. Doppler:  mild mitral and tricuspid regurg; systolic flow velocity across AV 282 cm/sec may correspond to max. gradient around 32 mmHg and valve area of 1.4 cm2.  Conclusions pretty much as above:  concentric LVH, MV as above; moderate to marked atrial dilatation; possible BAV with considerable aortic root and aortic cusp calcification; suggestion of moderate AV stenosis and moderate insufficiency.  Mild tricuspid regurg.  My husband is essentially asymptomatic at this point. Had normal stress test.  Where do you think we stand at this point?  Sees an internist regularly.  In past few months, BS's have been increasing and I believe he will be starting oral meds at next visit this week.  How significant is \"considerable\" aortic cusp and root calcification.  I know the root dimensions are WNL but does the calcification have any implications?  Should echo be repeated annually?  Should my daughter and son be screened for BAV?  Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sue26 -  Sorry to be so late in replying to this post, but I am trying to get the topic caught up and thought that while you probably know where this was going by now (hopefully in a good and stable direction), other readers might benefit from there being an answer posted.   Last things first: your daughter and son probably should be screened for BAV, which is a fairly common familial trait. It doesn't always deteriorate and become a problem, but if it's present one ought to know about it so it can be followed over time.   As for the  patient himself, what I am most curious about is the reported \"adequate\" ejection fraction (EF). At 48 it would be adequate, and would probably be a major factor in follow up exams. So long as it could be maintained at or near that level and nothing else needed work, the valves (aortic and mitral both) probably would be maintaining adequate function. The \"considerable\" calcification of the aortic root and cusp, as well as additional calcification of the mitral annulus, would require close monitoring, especially since the calcification would appear to have been limiting the excursion of the leaflets of at least one of the valves. Calcium deposits build up over time, and this would have to be monitored regularly from here on out. Given the overall health of the heart muscle (based on the echo report) the diminished EF is no doubt due to calciferous stenotic disease of the aortic valve and eventually this may also cause some problem with the mitral valve as well, although it is a more flexible apparatus and not quite as prone to calcification in most patients. If the aortic stenosis becomes significant enough to warrant some sort of intervention it may be possible to open it by means of balloon dilation, but if not (and with calcium this is not usually a good option), if surgery for replacement becomes necessary at some point, it may be suggested that both aortic and mitral valve be replaced at the same time. This is a call that would depend on the condition of the mitral valve at that time, as it seemed to be functioning pretty well as of your post.  Please update us on things since your post.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: bradycardia and mitral regurgitation",
    "content": "Hello dadof6 -  All in all the findings you report seem to be near-normal, the only concern being the fact that almost every valve shows some regurgitation; however, in each one the regurg is minimal. The ejection fraction (EF), which is one of the most important indicators of healthy heart function, is very well within normal limits at 64; the  right ventricle may be slightly dilated, but the measurement of 3.3 cm is confusing, as it is unclear if this is intended to suggest the degree of enlargement or the internal volume. In either case it would be rather small, so I am wondering if that number is either misplaced or misinterpreted.  It is not at all unusual to find some degree of regurg in the three valves as you seem to have, and all three are minimal. Mild mitral regurg is very common and is no contraindictation to exercise. Because of your history and your history of relatively sedentary lifestyle, any exercise program should be started slowly and progress according to exercise tolerance. The ideal way to do this is to follow the same protocol as the Cooper cardiac rehab program recommends. You can likely find this on line by doing a simple search, and it is only a suggestion.   Your bradycardia seems to be due to dominance of the vagus nerve in your autonomic nervous system. Some people are vagatonic (rate is normally slower) and some are sympathomimetic (normal rate is faster than \"normal\"). Since this  has been a lifelong feature of yours and causes no symptoms, I would strongly recommend you ask your doctor for a specific exercise prescription to get you started toward cardiovascular fitness.   The insignificant degrees of abnormality you mention will not necessarily increase with age unless your cardiologist has since found some actual disease process. In all likelihood all your measurements are tolerable and within \"normal abnormal\" range.   Please do follow up with us, since by now you no doubt know a lot more about this. Hope this finds you in good health.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Willprid,  Mitral regurgitation [MR] has several causes. Mitral Prolapse, rheumatic Mitral Regurgitation, Ischemic [Papillary muscle dysfunction], Dilated cardiomyopathy are the main ones. If it is ischemic [history of past heart attacks or frequent angina] it is imperative that a coronary angiogram be done first.  If it is mitral valve prolapse, the degree of prolapse and the degree of MR has to be severe to warrant a valve repair surgery.   Rheumatic Mitral regurgitation is often associated with Mitral stenosis and sometimes with other valve involvement. Here also if MR is severe does valve repair become necessary.  In Dilated cardiomyopathy MV repair alone almost never suffices and some form of LV volume reduction surgery is indicated.  It all depends what is your degree of MR from color Doppler report. Also, is LA [Left Atrium] grossly enlarged? Is there a clot in the LA? What is the size of the LV? What is the ejection fraction?  These are the variables that will affect the outcome of the surgery. By the way 50 units of alcohol a week is on the higher side. What are you taking Viagra for? Is it for Pulmonary Hypertension? Because in that case your heart is in gross failure and surgery may be counter productive.  Best wishes,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Bobo49,  Mitral valve prolapse leading to OHS for mitral valve repair. This indicates that before surgery the Mitral Prolapse may be associated with significant Mitral Regurgitation, i.e. leaking back of blood from Left Ventricle to left atrium due to incompetent mitral valve. You are 58 and MV Prolapse is generally of a long duration illness. Thus your Left Ventricle could be dilated due to years of mitral Regurgitation and its pumping power [Ejection Fraction or EF] would be low. This low EF in turn activates the sympathetic nervous system in such a way that the heart rate would be remaining high to compensate for the low EF.   I do not have any first hand data on your case in my hand but if your Echo shows that your EF is significantly low, then, if your cardiologist agrees, a medicine called Digitalis may be in order to reduce the heart rate and improve the EF, if you have no contraindication to this medicine.\n\n",

I have dealt with cyst all my life, but as far as my heart, I will give a summary of the echo in 2005 and then 2006 and please advise me of the progression of the disease.  2005  Mild-aortic regurgitation Aortic valve is thickened Pseudonormalizied pattern of Lve diastolic filling.(grade 2 diastolic dysfunction) Lv ejection fraction 55 to 60 %  2006 Now Moderate aortic regurgitation Restrictive pattern of LV diastolic filling (now grade 3 or 4 diastolic dysfunction) Mild tricuspid regurgitation Mild mitral regurgitation Dilated right ventricle Mild pulmonary regurgitation Mildly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure  LV ejection fraction 60 to 65% No LV thrombus  The measurments of the heart also increased.  All were still within normal ranges but the size of the heart did increase.  The fatigue is almost unbearable.  After this echo I was give Clonidine HCL 2 mg and Hydralazine 10mg, to take.  My concern is besides the way I feel, the fact that the regurgitation went from mild to moderate in one year, and now that all all my valves regurgitate.  Also the diastolic dysfunction going from grade 2 to grade 3 or 4, what is the signifigance of that?  I don't have insurance so it is very difficult to keep my appointments as most of my doctors are specialist of some kind.  And my health problems are to many to list here.  Thanks in advance to any comments that you can give me.  I guess I wonder just how serious is all of this, as far as family history, my dad's heart stayed in atrifubilation (spelling), he had a massive stroke and passed away last year.  My brother's has 3 stents in his heart because of major blockages, this happened when he was 37 years old.  My sister has mitral valve prolapse.  Sincerely, Rounds girl\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Rounds Girl,  The progression of your aortic valve leak and your symptoms suggest that this is now becoming an issue for you.  The leaking of the other valves may be due to the increased pressure from the aortic valve leak.  If the aortic valve improves I suspect that your other valves will as well.  I would recommend you talk to your cardiologist about this.  You may need to begin taking some medicine to help reduce your blood pressure some (even if it is normal) to help reduce the back pressure on the aortic valve.    In some cases this is not enough or the aortic valve begins to leak more.  In these cases, valve replacement may be necessary.  If you get to this point you will need to discuss the options with a cardiothoracic surgeon since there are a few different types of valves and each have their own benefits/risks.  There are some cases that remain the same over time.  However, with your symptoms I suspect that you will require some form of treatment at some point.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your reply.  Although it comes after I've had open heart surgery.  I had the surgery on Jan 3 2008, the valve was replaced with a bovine valve, although we would have chosen a mechanical valve, but due to some bleeding issues it wasn't an option for me.  I hate it because the surgery has been no walk in the park, doctors tell me it will probably last approx. 10 years, they said they don't last as long in youger patients as they do in older patients.  Anyway, thanks again for the reply.\n\n",

Keep in mind that in 10 years, treatments are likely to be very different than they are now so there may be more options once this valve begins to have trouble.  Recovery from open heart surgery can be slow but in the end I think you'll feel a lot better than before the surgery.  Thanks for the update.  Best wishes.\n\n",

All went well, I start Cardio rehab next week, so hopefully this will aid in my recovery.  The depression has been an issue for me, but as I understand it that is pretty common after OHS.

She also had some sort of procedure in the past but I don't know what it was. She is 36-years-old and in good health.  She was in a car accident ten days ago and is in a lot of pain. She doesn't have medical insurance so she's having to wait for an appointment with a doctor provided by the car insurance company. I've recommended to her that she start taking 2400 mg/day of ibuprofen for pain and reduction of inflammation, but she's not sure if ibuprofen at that dosage would present a problem considering her heart condition.  Is there any danger for people with mitral valve prolapse if they take prescription dosages of ibuprofen for short-term pain and inflammation?  Thanks!\n\n",

If something has changed (the murmur now sounds different, etc.) then doing the echo again may be indicated to see if there are new findings.  If nothing has changed there is unlikely to be any changes on the echo.  Depending on what the cause of your families' aortic valve problems was, regular screening with periodic echo's may actually be indicated.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was active and played sports in highschool and during all my physicals for school doctors ruled it as a \"functional heart murmur\" and never restricted my activities.  I have never had any symptoms, until somewhat recently.  I was also diagnosed with panic disorder back in 2002, since then I notice from time to time shortness of breath and dizziness.  I have gained a substantial amount of weight since highschool and it seemed the heavier I became, the more symptoms I noticed.  At my last trip to the doctor he listened to my heart and stated that he did not detect any noticable \"clicks\" or murmurs.  I found this kind of hard to believe.  Should I push to get more tests done on my MVP, or do you think that most likely my symptoms are coming from weight gain and anxiety?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi BGSUJen,  Mitral valve prolapse is incredibly common, particularly in women.  In fact, in one study they evaluated college girls and upon becoming dehydrated almost all of them had MVP.  We should distinguish between MVP and mitral valve regurgitation.  MVP is when the valve flips backwards a bit but does not leak.  MVR is when the valve flips backwards and does allow a leak of blood backwards through the valve.  MVP is really a symptomless condition for the most part.  MVR can cause some symptoms if the leak is severe enough (which isn't necessarily a major leak).   With MVP a click can sometimes be heard but not always.  With MVR a murmur can be heard but not always.  Increased weight can worsen the problems from MVP and MVR.  Unfortunately, the symptoms you are describing are somewhat nonspecific.  Significant mitral valve regurgitation could cause them, as can panic attacks or a few other things.  If you are concerned it is reasonable to see a cardiologist.  Follow up with your doctor can help determine if this is necessary.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vishan_ag2k2,  This is a difficult question to answer because the answer depends on many factors including: how large the holes are, where the holes are and if there are any other complications.  Often, these holes can be closed via catheterization if necessary.  This procedure is done by catheterization of the vein or artery of the leg in the groin area.  Recovery from this procedure is much faster than when the holes need to be closed by open heart surgery.  When holes are closed, or if holes are very small there is generally no impact on length of life.  I would recommend you follow up with a cardiologist to discuss the details of your situation more specifically.  This will give you much better information.    Best wishes.\n\n",

When I was younger (middle and high school) I use to have frequent chest pains.  I do not have them as often but they range from sharp pains, sharp pains that run from my chest to back and left arm, dull to moderate constant pain, and dull pains when I breathe.  The worst was in 2001 when I experienced a lot of chest pains combined with vertigo, and feelings of fainting.   Typically, the pain will come and go, but will not last extended periods of time. Currently, for the past 3-4 days, I have had constant chest pains.  Starting on Thursday and really painful to now, where it is not constant but periodically have pain in my chest, lung, and arm.  Again, while it is not typical, pains lasting over an extended time period has happened.  This time I can say that my chest pain started after (while) I smoked marijuana. I haven't smoked in about 2 years, and that may have been the 5th time since I started smoking about 3 months ago.  I haven't found much on the effects of marijuana and MVP. I also, I have not been able to find that much about MVP except for general information.  Any information would be appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Well, you do sound  like a classic MVP person! That doesn't mean you are, but it's a good possibility and one worth exploring. It is easy to do and can help ease one's mind a great deal. I'd bring the  chest pain issue to the attention of a doctor directly, since significant pain in any area, and especially the chest, warrants a look, even though yours does not sounds especially like coronary artery-related pain. It does sound a lot  like what many MVP patients experience, but it also could be any number of other things. The main thing is it is pain, and who needs that?  While marijuana smoking often triggers \"first time\" symptoms which persist later, it is usually not the actual cause of them. On the other hand, if you're taking birth control pills and are having chest pains, it is well worth a trip to the doctor's office, just to rule out anything worrisome, since these hormones can predispose to any number of problems. Yours don't, on the surface, sound serious, but the do warrant an exam. You'll feel better knowing nothing is wrong, or if there is something you'll feel better knowing you've acted on it. (Odds are great it is nothing, but that's impossible to know at a distance).  As for MVP, I'm surprised you haven't been able to find much info on it, but I'll be happy to give you a crash  course right here: MVP is one of the most common conditions in the general  population and is believed to be 5 to 10 times more common in women than  men, but that may be just because men are such great deniers and ignorers of stuff. At any rate, it is very common and almost always benign. However, the  symptoms and sensations can often be so unnerving that the end result is a lot of anxiety which, in and of itself, can be \"lifestyle threatening.\" People begin to limit their activities out of concern that  they may have a \"heart  problem\" and so become more and more focused on vague symptoms  and  at the same time become less active and so more out of shape, resulting in reduced exercise tolerance, which only serves to convince them there is something \"wrong\" with them.   The  actual phenomenon of MVP is often no more than what is called redundant mitral leaflet. One or both mitral valve leaflets is a tiny bit longer than it should be, and so bulges slightly when in the closed position. The  failure to close neatley can cause a classic \"click\" murmur which can come and go and is not always found. Echocardiography can usually, but not always,  demonstrate mild MVP in many otherwise \"normal\" persons.It is, in fact, so common as to often be called \"a variant of normal.\"  It is, though, often accompanied by other, seemingly unconnected symptoms including migraine, optical migraine, anxiety or panic attacks, depersonalization, episodes of lightheadedness,  dizziness, sharp chest  pains in the vicinity of the left breast (almost  never indicative of actual heart disease), and a host of  other annoying and disturbing, but ultimately harmless symptoms.  All  this, hopefully, helps  the  person with MVP to cope better with the crazy-making stuff that sometimes  happens. And no, we do not  know  what the connection is with a lot of these things, but it's been observed so often over the years that even when actual MVP cannot  be proven (and you may, in the future, be told you don''t have it) there is still a Mitral Valve Prolapse Syndrome, also known as dysautonomia, which means misbehavior of the autonomic nervous system. Much of this can be managed by working on the anxiety aspect, staying fit even when it seems counter-intuitive, drinking  adequate fluids, and knowing that the condition is almost always benign.   You are in very good company.  I would, however,  be sure to bring the matter of the chest pain issue to the attention of your doctor promptly, as pain does serve a function (to let us know something isn't right) and also it hurts!   Good luck  to you and please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "Where is the stopping point for heart tests?",
    "content": "Hello,  Im a 25 y/o white male that's in \"okay\" shape. Im about 5'11, big boned, 250 lbs., and I suffer from some kind of severe vertigo that seems to be positionally related.  I have lived a hectic life style in the past. I used to smoke  a lot of marijuana, experimented with cocaine to the point  of feeling like I was going to die, did mushrooms.....and other stuff. Please do not shake your head at that, in reality, out of a lot of people I have been around, I wasn't that bad of a \"party animal\". When it came to drugs, other than marijuana, most people were usually doing more than me.  However, I have been away from that lifestyle for 3 years now.   I do not smoke, drink, or even eat unhealthy or consume cola's and junk food.  I have been having chest pains for a while now. I do know that its closely related to anxiety, which I struggle with, but I also have Hypertension. My Hypertension is something I usually can't control, because sometimes I can take it and it will be close to normal, and at other times it can be 150/105. I've even seen it at 145/112 before. Yes, my monitor is working correctly.  However, when I go to the doctors, they say I have a normal resting blood pressure thats just \"a little high\".   I've had a few ECG's, 2 echo-cardiograhms 2 years apart, a treadmill stress test.... HOWEVER, I still have left sided chest pain that seems to be right in my breast bone. In comes on especially in periods of stress (as my BP is very high), or after I've eaten a large meal. But its not limited to those circumstances.....I can have it first thing in the morning when I wake up, or hen Im laying down reading a book at night time.  The pain is usually felt on the left side, and doesn't feel like a burning, but more like a sharp, twisting, cutting pain. I sometimes feel pains like that in my arm, around my elbow, and in my shoulder. I don't really feel them in my neck, although my neck feels like is just \"blocked up\" sometimes, like my pulse or blood can't get through and is straining.   The doctors say Im fine......but my heart can give me some really weird responses. Usually after walking a long distance really fast, I feel tightness in my chest. But I always compensate by breathing deep.  When I studied martial arts, I learned the effectiveness of breathing deep. So I always breathe ddep, but it doesn't seem to help. Sometimes it feels as if it makes my heart beat double, or skip.  The doctors say Im fine. They said on my first echo that I had \"a little leak that everyone has\". Okay, I was 200 lbs then, in great shape, I didn't worry too much about it. THen when I went just a month ago, the nurse doing it said \"looks like your arteries are thickening up some....you have trouble with HBP?\" and I said \"yeah\".....but when the doctor looked at it, he, and another doctor said the numbers were just \"slightly elevated\".  My question is.......would it be beneficial and lifesaving to my health if I got a cath done? Because Im getting mixed up results from all these tests, yet Im still having chest pains.  Chest pains that seem to have NO origin....they just come and go when they want to.  And it seems as if a baby asprin usually eases my chest pains within a few minutes of taking it.   Something beneficial to note: Ive struggled with weight my whole life. When I was 17, I weighed 280 lbs. Ive also been very inactive my whole life.... I didn't play sports, I haven't always had a job, I dropped out of school. And pressure situations like jobs and school seems to make my chest a lot tighter.  When I envision the pains Im having....it feels like behind my chest plate, somebody is cutting a line that leads into my arm. And I feel little stabbing points at places in my arm.  So in the end point, my question is what tests are sufficient for showing artery disease and heart problems?   Also, doesn't the heart have many electrical malfunctions that doctors cannot yet detect and figure out?  How safe statistically is the cath? And can my head be elevated, because I suffer from vertigo when laying flat?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - Lots going on here, but maybe not as much as at first it appears. Let's break it down.  First, the weight problem: you are well aware of it, and have been in \"great shape\" in the recent past, so what you really need to do now as a life-saving measure is to get back into \"great shape\" and stay there. That's a fact. I know you know this, but I'd be remiss to not hammer it home. It's Number One. You may not feel you \"eat unhealthy\", but if you eat enough to maintain your current mass, that's not healthy enough.   Second, while I certainly won't shake my head at your past drug use, I will at the reasoning used by you to minimize the importance of it. Using relativism to minimize something problematic is dishonest. If you traveled in really fast company that doesn't mean what you were doing was just fine. Ever hear of Len Bias? First time, last time. One never knows. Don't go back down that road.  Now then, regarding the current complaints: the blood  pressure of any individual will vary quite a bit during the course of a day. Yours would be likely to be slightly elevated at least, due to your weight vs. height. It is probably your relative youth that has kept doctors from treating this. Keep checking it, to be sure, but don't obsess over it. Look  for spikes or sustained, marked increases, and if you find either, bring this to the attention of your doctor. Losing the 50 lbs you've put on would undoubtedly bring down the BP markedly and reduce a lot of other risk factors.  The pain in your chest: While it is in an unfortunate location, and while it does seem to occur in more than one place along the classic nerve pathway, the description of the character of the pain suggests something other than cardiac disease, most likely either Tietz' Syndrome (costochondritis) or some other musculo-skeletal irritation. If it were reproducible through exercise in a consistent way  (and especially during a stress test) then it might warrant an angiogram, but that is an invasive procedure which must have its risks weighed against  its benefits. Right now I doubt many doctors would want to go this route unless there was a lot more corroborating evidence suggesting a heart problem. While the risks are small, they are very real. If you don't have any classic signs or symptoms (and  it seems you don't) then it would be foolish to waste the resources and take on the (very small but very real) risks associated with a cath.  Your statement that you often feel the pain when lying down or when reading in bed strongly suggest some sort of orthopedic rather than cardiac origin. An antiinflammatory agent such as ibuprofin (Advil) could well relieve it or even make it go away. The fact that one  baby aspirin seems to relieve it is strongly suggestive of a somatic disorder (a form of anxiety) since a single baby aspirin would not relieve heart-related pain and is only recommended for  people as a preventive maintainance measure.   The deep breathing, without proper yogic training,  can lead to irritated chest wall structures, and it can also cause one's heart to fire off the occasional premature beat. It's probably better to not rely too much on the practice, except insofar as it affords you some sense of relief. It may be causing your chest pain!   I hope this all doesn't come across as negative, as what I am going for here is a wake up call to you regarding selective attention to issues. I'll repeat: you do not sound as though you have heart disease, although you no doubt will  if you continue to maintain your current BMI; your blood pressure is probably tolerable right now, but in time, for the same reason, could become chronically and significantly elevated. Those both can be  altered dramatically by a determined weight loss and fitness program.   The jump from vague symptoms to wanting an angiogram is not unusual among anxious patients, especially those with cardiac concerns. Try and gear back your expectations as to what can be \"found\" and what you'd actually want to \"find.\" There is an algorithm that should be followed, which would lead to an appropriate train of diagnostic procedures. You're not yet at the point  where many doctors would even consider a heart cath.  The anxiety problem is a biggie and needs to be worked through, as it can adversely affect your health and most of all your quality of life. The same holds true,  on a purely physical level, for your weight. Those two things, once under good control, may well cause all the other complaints and concerns to disappear.  My best to you. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "title": "RVSP Calculations From Echo -- Are They Accurate?",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 41 year old female who recently had a Doppler echo done of my heart.  The findings were a myxomatous mitral valve... with thickened/redundant leaflets and trace regurgitation.  (Left ventricular size and function were normal)  And mild to moderate tricuspid regurgitation.  EF was 70% and the other numbers were normal.  Anyway the cardiologist mentioned that my RSVP was elevated at 30 - 40 mm HG.  RSVP calculation was 34.  I was concerned about that number and asked my GP about it.  He said that he \"sees those numbers all the time\" and that it is \"very rare\" to have pulmonary hypertension.  I told him that I was still concerned about it and so he ordered some chest X-rays.  Should my doctor be doing more?    BTW... I had a bad case of \"white coat syndrome\" the day of my echo exam.  The Echo tech mentioned that my heart rate was high.  It was around 110 BPM when it normally is only in the low 70's when I am sitting or lying flat.  Could this have affected my RVSP?  When I have \"white coat syndrome\" my BP also climbs too.   For example when I visited my doctor today to go over the echo results, it was 150/88 when other times it is below the 120/80.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - The combination of the RSVP number, which can, indeed, be pretty vague most of the time, and your \"White  Coat\" response together could easily account for your concerns.  Your primary has been appropriately conservative in the absence of any symptoms suggestive of Cor Pulmonale (CP), aka pulmonary hypertension. The condition is fairly rare, and is almost never uncovered by accident, but rather as a result of marked and often debilitating symptoms.  To determine beyond a reasonable doubt whether or not someone actually has this condition, the  risk of invasive testing in an asymptomatic person would far outweigh the usefulness. In other words, it would  seem you are in pretty good health. Since you've been  diagnosed with a myxotomous mitral  valve you will  (or certainly should) be  followed for that with periodic echocardiography, and this would also show any truly suggestive changes.   It sounds as though your heart and lungs are, in all important respects, functioning remarkably well. Do be sure to have a re-check for the mitral valve in no more than a year just to be prudent,  or sooner if symptoms should develop. (This last should be a rule to live by,  really,  for all of us).   Good health to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vickie,  Many people will pass out during blood collection.  It is a condition known as vasovagal syncope.  Basically, an experience (for some people having a blood draw) can cause the brain to signal the vagal nerve too much.  This causes the heart to slow down and decreases blood flow to the brain.  Then the person passes out.    This isn't dangerous because it is very short termed and clears spontaneously.  The fluttering in the chest may be a nerve twitch that can occur or may be a heart rhythm such as supraventricular tachycardia.  If it gets worse or more frequent you should have it checked out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If large pieces of organic matter stay in the airway they can cause inflammation and give areas for pneumonias to start.

    "content": "Hi,  My husband has been having CT scans twice a year for the past seven years since being diagnosed with MCL. He had chemo, Rituxan and radiation therapy and has been in remission for seven years. An EKG after chemo showed he had experienced a heart attack which we were not aware of. He had surgery for an abdominal aortic aneurism three years ago, a shoulder replacement and has high blood pressure which he has been on medication for and in control for years. He also has sleep apnea and used a CPAP His last CT scan this past July showed an enlarged heart for the first time and it was recommended he have an echocardiogram. He is 65 years old. The interpretation is as follows: 1.  mitral valve shows minimal regurgitation 2.  aortic valve has 3 cusps, is not stenotic, there is      mild to moderate regurgitation 3.  the left ventricle is dilated, there is no regional wall      wall abnormallity, the ejection fraction appears      normal, there is hyperotrophy 4.  the tricuspid valve shows mild regurgitation 5.  there is biatrial enlargement 6.  the right ventricular systolic pressure is estimated      to be 20 mmHg plus the right atrial pressure We were told these results all look okay and there is no recommended follow-up. We do not have a cardiologist in the area to interpret the results. Do these indeed fall in the normal range or should we be going elsewhere for an opinion.                       Thank you, Joe's wife\n\n",

    "content": "Hello - The results, while not textbook  perfect, do seem, in and of themselves, pretty innocuous. The reports generated by technicians and doctors can be terribly intimidating and almost all of them sound ominous when read by a layperson. However, there is nothing in there that would of itself set off any alarms. There are some things which probably bear prudent follow-up in a year or two and thereafter, but nothing that sounds grossly abnormal (the tricuspic aortic valve duly noted).   Regarding what may have been a \"silent\" myocardial infarction, not only do these events sometimes take place during a vigorous course of chemotherapy, but they can also show up only to normalize later (whereas a true heart attack will leave permanent changes in the EKG and echocardiogram). If one did take place it seems not to have caused any major damage.   Hopefully Joe is doing well on all fronts and it would seem the echocardiogram allows one less thing to worry about. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sbRN - Since each echocardiogram must be evaluated in light of the patient's age, sex, BMI, etc.,  there is a great deal of latitude depending on your doctor's estimation of how your results match up with your physiognomy. However, nothing in the report jumps out at me. Your symptoms sound as though they may well be due to something not directly related to your heart, but which affects the heart. You might be subject to dysautonomia or your could simply be sympathomimetic, especially if you are petite or thin.   The symptoms should be followed by a GP at least, since  the cardiologist seems to have exhausted the  limited avenues available  re: your heart.   I wish I could give you a more specific response, but the sort of symptoms you describe can be attributable to so many different causes, most of them benign, and the echo results seem unremarkable.The history of self-corrected VSD suggests perhaps some mild electrical derangement or perhaps simply an adaptive response which causes some discomfort. If the symptoms are terribly bothersome or actually limit your ability to function then I would suggest persuing them, but it seems not  to be a directly cardiac-related problem based on the little evidence here.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

While subacute endocarditis (SBE) used to be a common sequel to rheumatic fever, valvular damage was still relatively rare. It can happen, though. It would be wise to rule out any lingering effects of the original bout of RF. Even if it is still active a course of antibiotics would be likely to reduce if not completely avoid any significant damage.   Please do follow this up and also please keep us updated. You're likely in the clear, but there could easily be something else going on that needs addressing. Good luck to you!\n\n",

No insurance, so I haven't been to a doctor in six years.  No money, really.  My life is strange - but probably not relevant to this.  I'm overweight, but excercise a lot (light stuff - walking, bicycling) almost every day.  A bit of yard work.  Sex life good.    In fact, I feel fine.  No real complaints.  No coughing, no blood, no out of breath (considering my age) when I exercise.    Especially in the middle of the night I get this dull pain once or twice a week, sometimes it throbs a bit, around my right lung, under the right arm, around to my back. It seems to move around - or be more or less intense in different areas at different times.   This has been going on for the last few months (which is why I cut the smoking to almost nothing).  However, my lung 'seems' to feel fine.  It's so strange. I feel perfectly healthy.  Except ...  I can round up a few hundred bucks if I have to - and go to a doctor.  But if there is more than a chest x-ray involved, forget it. No follow up tests and expensive medicine. Can't afford this.    Please give me a hint what this might be.  If not cancer, I'm guessing some sort of coronary, angina thing (although my heart is on the other side).  But who knows.    Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your question.  Since there are literally hundreds of possible causes for chest pain it would be impossible to diagnose this without exam and testing.  So, the real question becomes how to get the health care you need for the necessary testing and care.  I must stress that getting this evaluation is extremely important. It will either ease your mind considerably or help you through early diagnosis.  It could be something annoying but harmless, or it could be a warning sign.    I'm glad to know you have successfully cut down on the smoking.  As you know, this habit carries great risk factors.  Even someone who has smoked for years can benefit by quitting.  But, this fact does put you at a higher risk for such things as emphysema and cancer.    I wonder if you could locate a cancer screening clinic.  Sometimes communities or hospitals sponsor such events where basic screening can be done at minimal cost.  You might try contacting your local health department and asking for their cancer control people who would know of such resources. It is their job to make a difference in the health of the community and chronic diseases like asthma, heart disease, stroke cancer and even smoking cessation are usually part of their efforts.  This might be a place to start.  Explain your situation and financial constraints so they can help you locate the best available program for you.    If this doesn't help you, at least schedule an exam.  You might also inquire about community health clinics that may offer a sliding fee schedule based on income or at least discounts for cash payment for the uninsured.  Private physicians also sometimes work with people like yourself to find affordable ways to get care.  Most hospitals have charity care programs where you apply for financial assistance (this might be helpful if you must have an expensive diagnostic test at the hospital).  But, the place to start is with the doctor - exam or screening - so you would know what additional testing might be needed.  Good luck.  I know this is a very frustrating situation.    I would also encourage you to make every effort to stop smoking completely.  Again, there are community resources to help with this and it would be the best investment you could make to your health.\n\n",

So I'm taking an over-the-counter pill every morning.  And my blood pressure was high - so I'm on a prescribed medication.  A few side effects, but not severe ones.  I guess I'm OK for now.  I feel much better, although there is still a tiny bit of pain (it's not pain, really - just a tad of discomfort, of something 'there' ...).  Thanks for responding - and it's great that there are BBs like this with Doctors and Nurses.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Alphacon,  It is possible that your hip pain is actually referred pain from your testes.  If your testicle or epididymis becomes inflamed it can cause the hip and groin/inside thigh area to hurt.    If your epididymis is inflamed it may be due to infection, repeated trauma (such as pressure from tight clothing, etc.) or a blockage in the draining ducts.  I would recommend you follow up with your urologist for a re-evaluation.  If your urologist agrees, it may be worth a trial of antibiotics to see if there is an infection lingering.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "MVP and high blood sugar",
    "content": "Hi.  I'm 36 years old. I have three children. I am overweight at 173 pounds and 5'4\". I was diagnosed with MVP when I was pregnant with my second child (13 years ago) after having a lot of palpitations. Let me start by saying that my doctor does not believe that MVP produces any symptoms and everytime I ask a question about it he dismisses me. I do, however, believe that from time to time I experience symptoms. They are text book, sometimes chest pain, fatigue and an occassional panic attack. My last echo (4 years ago)showed no prolapse, but when I went in this week for a virus, the nurse practioner said \"wow I can really hear your mvp\". Now  for my question(s). Two weeks ago after my cousin's wedding and much dancing my chest hurt a little. Later that night I got quite dizzy feeling like I might pass out. I chalked it up to overdoing it and having a drink or two. I have felt extremely tired over the past two weeks. This past Sunday I was outside for a very short period of time, about 5 minutes (very hot here in FL) and when I came inside I had the same feeling, my chest pounding and thought I might pass out. I laid down and slept for about an hour and woke up without the dizziness but still felt unbelievably tired. The next day I thought I felt better and went to work. Twice within the first hour of being there I had to sit down because I thought I would pass out. I went to the Dr that afternoon. They found that I had a temp of 100.1 and ketones and something else(whiteblood cells abnormal I think) in my urine. Because of all of my symptoms they took my BP standing, sitting and lying down, all normal. They also did an EKG which looked good. They thought I was having a bad UTI because of the test strip and that I'm having frequent urination.The gave me a Rx for Cipro. I went for labs that came back normal except that my fasting sugar was 102. My urine culture also came back normal. So they told me to stop the Rx. So now I'm left with that I'm exhausted, still having chest tightness/heaviness and I'm wondering what to do next or if this a virus that is exaggerating my MVP symptoms. I'm also wondering if I should be worried about the ketones and my sugar levels. I was gestational diabetetic. I'm supposed to go back to the Dr next Wed. for a second follow up and was wondering what questions I should ask or tests I should ask for. I don't think that I'm having a heart attack, but I'm a little worried that there might be something else wrong with my heart causing the chest pains and dizziness. Thanks if you've read this far. I'm sorry I didn't want to leave anything out.\n\n",

    "content": "Sorry for posting again so soon, but after reading some other posts I was wondering about the possibility of pericarditis? I did a search on the symptoms and it seems as though a lot of them apply to me. I have/had the low grade fever, the chest tightness, worse when lying down, the dry cough and fatigue. It also got me wondering if the \"click\" the nurse practioner heard was the inflammation of the pericardial tissue and not necessarliy the MVP. If this is the case I will definately call my Dr tomorrow and ask for further tests. I read that diagnosis was done by xray and echo among other things. what is the simplest way to diagnose pericarditis and would I have to go to a cardiologist? Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Laurie Ann - Unfortunately, for many doctors MVP and more specifically MVP Syndrome remain controversial. While there is an entire clinic at the University of Birmingham Medical Center devoted to this phenomenon, there are still some doctors who \"don't believe in it.\" It's easy to blow it off as it includes such a broad spectrum of often vague symptoms that are difficult to reproduce.   The truth is around 10-15 per cent of the population is estimated to have either MVP without symptoms or MVPS with no discernable MVP. No symptoms, no complaints, no problem! When the situation is reversed, however, the doctor is often the one complaining, because the classic \"click murmur\" that is often associated with MVP can come and go, and the ability to visualize the prolapse via echocardiogram can also be very inconsistent or even non-existent. The \"gold standard\" for diagnosis of MVP has always been the triad of click murmur, positive prolapse on echo, and non-specifice T-wave changes on EKG. However, most people simply do not meet this standard, yet they all have remarkably similar complaints, and they do begin to fit an admittedly broad, but fairly predictable pattern. You have described it in your post.  While not life-threatening, MVPS can be infuriating at least, both for patient and doctor.   Your glucose level, while technically above the new arbitrary \"high normal\" of 100, is really so close to normal that in past times you might have been thought to be hypoglycemic. That's how much the thinking has changed on diabetes. I don't really think that's an issue in this case.  The finding of an increased white count would be consistent with a fever and a bacterial or viral illness. The positive ketones (you didn't quote an exact level, but that doesn't matter for now) would also be consistent with a febrile illness, as fever has a tendency to cause us to dry out. Interestingly, one of the more controversial \"folk\" approaches to managing MVPS is to drink plenty of fluids. This increases blood volume and presumably keeps one from feeling faint, at least some of the time.   As for pericarditis, you would look for sharp, stabbing chest pain, especially on inspiration, and which might radiate up to one or both shoulder tips. Also sharp chest pain on lying supine and relieved by sitting up. Some fever might accompany this problem sometimes as well, but the \"rub\" usually heard with pericarditis doesn't resemble the click murmur of MVP. That doesn't mean you absolutely don't have pericarditis, something that can be seen on chest x-ray and/or echocardiogram, but it makes it somewhat less likely. Meanwhile the MVP Syndrome begins to sound more likely. It also often blossoms during a stressful period, an illness or, you guessed it, pregnancy.   Following up on the glucose levels and gestational diabetes is a prudent thing to do, but I think it likely you will find everything in order there. Even if that's not the case, your complaints still sound most like someone with MVPS. If it persists and becomes very difficult to cope with, the treatment of choice is one of the beta blockers.  I hope this is helpful to you, and please to keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I'm a 32 yr old male, ex-smoker (smoked 10-15 a day for the last 12 years).  My cholesterol is 5.2.. no family history of heart problems.. anyway my problem started last August, i felt a sharp pain in my chest and got very worked up about it and this made my heart beat go very fast which worried me more, so i called 999 and was taken to the local A&E, there they did some bloods, xray, BP, and ECG and told me that my heart is fine and it was just chest wall pain, the dr said it could be costochondritis.  MY visits to the A&E continued over the following months.. all in all i must have had 20 visits and 20 ECG's for this pain.  Also had a d-dimer test whic camre back positive so had to have a VQ scan to see if i had PE, fortunately it was not the case.  Anyway in January tis year i had an ECHO done and the cardiologist said its fine, he then booked me for a treadmill test which i had last month, i got the results for this last week and the cardiologist told me that its one of the best excercise tests he's seen in his life, he said i have close to zero chance of hav ing heart disease and that my pain is chest wall pain and that me worrying about it all the time makes it worse.  He told me to get my life back to normal and get myself back to work (i have been off sick from work since this started).     He said he will arrange for an endoscopy in case its something to do with my stomach, but he says its DEFINATELY not my heart thats causing the pain.  I'm sat here typing and i have the pain across my chest, its like a dull ache, also got it across my back, if i press on muscle on my chest it feels sore,  i have been using diclofenac gel on my chest but doesn't really do alot.  My question is, what do you think? The tests that i have had, are they enough to say that i'm not at risk?  I really need to know so that i can get myself back to work next week. I'm on 10mg propranolol everyday to keep my heart rate down because i get palpitations because of the anxiety.  (these can't cause me any harm can they? my heart rate drops down to 40-50bpm at resting rate, is this safe?)  Thanks in advance  Shazad Mokhtar\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shazad Mokhtar, It certainly sounds like you have had a very thorough workup that seems to have ruled out cardiac problems as the source of your pain and discomfort.  In diagnostic decision trees, we typically consider several options when it comes to chest pain. Cardiac is the first one we consider because of the potential for high threat to life with a cardiac problem. Gastric problems can cause chest pain, as well as pulmonary ones.  You mention that you are experiencing anxiety.  Are you on any medication to help you control the anxiety?  Believe it or not, anxiety can also cause chest pain symptoms.  You did not mention what kind of lifestyle you have, or what kind of work you do.  The fact that the pain is reproducible (meaning that when you touch the chest it feels sore) may indicate muscle pain or strain.  It sounds like your heart tests are normal, thankfully!  Please talk to your primary care physician about your anxiety.  There are several medicines available to help you feel more in control.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shazad,  A couple things come to mind after reading your feedback.   If the fast heart rate you are experiencing is related to stress/anxiety, then  1.   You may consider exploring with a clinical psychologist, or a mental health support clinic in your area the triggers for your underlying anxiety.   On the surface, it seems like perhaps in your recent past you had an onset of a disturbance to your equilibrium that is now easily fed by stressful issues in your life, causing a flight or fight syndrome in your body.  The best way to tackle and eliminate (hopefully) the reaction is to eliminate the cause. 2.  If the Betablocker (which you had mentioned in your first post was Rx for your rapid heart rate) is not sufficient to control your anxiety, your primary care physician may wish to consider other anxiolytics to replace or supplement the current therapy.  If the heart rate you describe is now simply your body responding to the return to physical activity after a hiatus, then recognize that you may wish to start your routine a little less rigorously, and build up stamina and endurance.   In either event, if the cardiological workup was negative, and you passed your stress test with flying colors, then try to trust them for their expertise and attempt to put your fears to rest about your heart.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shazad, First of all yes, you are entitled to a copy of your test results.  I would like to caution you however, with your deep concerns about your heart health,  it might be wise to hold off getting those results in your hands until/unless you have another healthcare professional who is requesting to see them.  The verbiage in the test results narrative may open up more of a can of worms for you and feed your anxiety with more undefined/obscure terminology. If you believe, however,  that seeing the test results for yourself may alleviate your fears, then I recommend you ask the cardiologist who read them to sit down with you when you pick up a copy and go over it point by point.    It sounds like somewhere in your life experiences some shocking possibilities came to your mind about heart problems that has lit a fire of fear.  If some near 20 plus tests have cleared you of any definite heart problems, then it seems safe to pick up your life and go on, and not let the fear of possibilities hold you back. Secondly, yes a heart rate of 60 is fine. But if the intended purpose of the Inderal is to help your anxiety, somehow it has failed in that task, and it may be of value if you are needing medicinal support to explore other anxiolytics in its place.   I applaud you for setting an appointment to explore mental health options!\n\n",

    "content": "hi I recently saw a cardiologist, the following is what he has written.. is there anything to be concerned about?     \"He has had very persistent and sharp left sided chest pains of sudden onset, seldom persisting for more than several minutes and fairly typical of inter costal neuralgia, with duller chest wall discomfort and tenderness persisting once the sharp pain is relieved. He has lost weight but stopped training, in fact stopped working and has at times been somewhat bed bound so this has had a major impact.     I understand that he has had a recent VQ scan and CXR and that these were allegedly normal so underlying rarities such as chest wall tumours which crop up occasionally seem reassuringly unlikely. He seems very concerned and pre-occupied about havig heart problems so I have given him a thorough cardiac MOT. This may have been exacerbated by the finding on ECG of left axis deviation, probably in association with partial right bundle branch block, these are ECG changes seen in association of atrial septal defect and cardiac ultrasound today reassuringly has excluded this remote possibility which I any case would be painless. We do occasionally see somewhat bright pericardial shadows posteriorly and he has shown this to some extent although I do not think his pains are likely to be due to pericarditis but they have been present virtually on a daily basis without remission.     He also is tall ad slim habitus but has neither features of either skin or joint hyperextensibility nor features of Marfan's syndrome and his aortic root appears to be normal on ultrasound. I think he can be reassured about his heart and given his concern and the impact this has had on his life. I am arranging for a reassuring excercise ECG and shall then encourage him to re-start training. I think he can discontinue pain killers and anti-inflammatories but in the very short term I would be interested to see whether Flecainide 50mg bd has any impact although this may be too small a dose to impact on neuralgic pain, with the intension of continuing this only in the short term and if there is clear improvement in his symptoms.     I shall re-assess in 2 months if his symptoms are worsening and the weight loss persists then I would consider a chest CT scan, hopefully he will get his life back to normal and return to work in the near future.     My provisional diagnosis is that is most likely to be inter costal neuralgic pain. Incidentally he is seeing a physiotherapist and I think deep breathing and general return to fitness and improved posture may also be of benefit\"     The above is what he wrote after seeing me in january... just wanted to know whether I should worry about the pericarditis that he mentioned or whether there is anything else I should be concerned about?     Thanks in advance     Shazad\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shazad, Your cardiologist has beenvery thorough to investigate all potential cardiac related caused of your chest pain. He mentions the possibility of putting you on Flecainide.  This medication is a class IC antiarrhythmic that has had some success in improving myotonia. Myotonia is a neuromuscular disorder characterized by the slow relaxation of the muscles after voluntary contraction or electrical stimulation. I suggest that you ask your MD for further information about the use and risk of Flecainide for you.  It does seem unlikely that you have any substantiated concerns about your heart. You may have the intercostal neuralgia that was mentioned, and it may be of value to pursue that thinking at this point, and find a way to get back into your usual patterns of life. Have you considered consulting a neurologist? This specialist may have other ideas that may help you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi everyone,   Recently, I\u2019ve experiencing strong and forceful heartbeat poundings at the upper back of my body, sometime I could feel my heartbeat pounding on my arms, neck, and head. The strong pounding usually happens in the night time. It is really bothering me now which makes me unable to sleep due to this. It would last for a couple of hours. But, I do feel perfectly fine the next day when I wake up.  (I don't know if it is because I'm too tired or too stressful???)    Is there something wrong with my heart??? I haven't not yet gone to a doctor yet, but I do believe I am a healthy person, 26 female, average weights, no smoking or drinking, and no heart problem in family history.   What are the reasons that make my heart pounding so hard? Do I need to worry about?    Thank you so much :)   Jan\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jan, Stress can certainly contribute to the feeling of pounding with your heartbeat.  Caffeine can also play a role in this - both in the form of coffee and tea, and also in regular caffeinated sodas.  If I were able to triage your symptoms on a face to face basis, I would like to know what your blood pressure and heart rate is at the time you feel the pounding.  The fact that you feel better when you wake up could refer to the fact that you are better rested, or that the offending culprit (soda, tea, coffee) is now out of your system.  Please do talk with your primary care physician if the symptoms do not get better, or go to your local urgent care center.  I appreciate that you are \"listening\" to your body, and recognize that there are some \"not normals\" that need to be addressed.\n\n",

I do feel my heart rate is a bit faster than normal when  the symtons occurr, but it is not like super fast speed pounding. My symptons would last for one or two hours the most in the night time.   I don't know my blood pressure at the time when my heart is pounding really hard. Normally, I do have good blood pressure.  I have noticed that if I get some rest, such as laying on the sofa for an hour in the evenining. I do not feel my heart pounding as hard as without a rest.   I want to know is there anything wrong with my heart?   Once again, thank you.  Jan\n\n",

Online triage unfortunately lacks certain abilities such as auscultation (listening) to your heart, observing your body signals, and moment by moment diagnostic evaluation of your blood pressure, heart rate, etc.  From the basics of what you are able to express, on the surface it does not appear that you have anything serious going on at this time.  However, it would be wisest for you to speak with your primary care MD, or go to a local clinic where trained professionals can do those missing pieces, and best advise you on the concerns you have.

    "content": "I am not familiar with the term cardiocolic reflex; however, there are many \"reflexes\" or cardiac responses that exist.  The most common is often referred to as a vasovagal reflex.  In this case, stimulation of the vagal nerve by many means can cause the heart to slow down resulting in lightheaded feelings and occasionally fainting.  There is another condition known as neurocardiogenic syncope that is not completely understood yet.  It is thought that there are some primative nerve fibers in the heart that sense when the heart is beating too fast.  When this happens they slow the heart down.  In some people a normal increase in heart rate, as would occur with standing to compensate for the drop in blood pressure until the blood vessels can respond, triggers these fibers to react.  They they react over vigorously slowing the heart down when it should be speeding up.  This leads to a drop in blood pressure, lightheadness and sometimes fainting.  It is possible that, in some people, pain or other stimulation may raise the heart rate rapidly enough to cause a similar triggering of these fibers leading to transient underperfusion.  This could cause nausea and lightheadedness and even fainting.  This is not particularly dangerous.  When it happens, the best thing to do is lie down for a moment.  This helps ease the work of blood flow around the body and will help the symptoms resolved.  Even if one faints from this it is not particularly dangerous other than the possibility of injury from falling, etc.  To help prevent this it is important to stay very well hydrated.  If you continue to have frequent symptoms you can talk with your regular doctor about other treatments.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am writing for my boyfriend who is 20 years old. He has been having symptoms that we thought were heart attack symptoms. He has been to the emergency room three times, all of which his EKG's have come back normal, and all the doctors dismiss him saying, \"you're too young to be having heart problems.\" Today he had an appointment with his primary care physician who refused to even listen or give him a stress test with an echo. The doctor had his mind made up that it was in his head before he even got to tell him what was going on. His symptoms are mostly brought on or worsened by exercise, caffeine, smoking marijuana (which he has quit in the last couple weeks). The doctors have tried to say he is having the pain because of quitting, even though the pain is why he quit. He has almost every symptom of MVP, and he had Pectis Excavatum which was corrected when he was 13. Two years ago, he had a follow up surgery because one of his ribs overgrew into bone where it should have been cartilage, and broke while he was exercising. His mother has lupus, has father was prediabetic. I am not sure if either of those could have an effect on the situation. I was also wondering if it is possible to have MVP without having an audible click or murmur. Please help us, we have been getting the run around and no one seems to think he is credible.\n\n",

    "content": "Mitral valve prolapse is an extremely common issue, especially in women.  It essentially is when the mitral valve comes to a close, then buckles backwards a little.  This produces the classically described mid-systolic click.  Most people with MVP will have no symptoms and likely will go their whole life without knowing it.  Generally no treatment is needed and antibiotics are not required before dentist visits, etc.  Occasionally MVP will be associated with a small leak in the valve, known as mitral valve insufficiency or mitral valve regurgitation.  Depending on how severe the leak is, this, too, may be assymptomatic or may have some symptoms.  When MVP is symptomatic, symptoms can include chest pain (possibly due to stretching of the attaching bands, known as chordae tendonae), palpitations, nervous feelings/panic attacks, fatigue, and difficulty breathing with exercise.  If you are able to describe your boyfriend's pain, we may be able to comment more on possible causes.  While the statement about his age is generally true - 20 year olds generally do not have heart problems - this does not mean that they cannot exist.    Unfortunately, many other things can mimic pain that comes from the heart.  I would encourage your boyfriend to continue to follow up with his doctor and discuss his symptoms.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 31 year old female, non smoker with no family history of heart disease.  I am in good health, not overweight and have not had any major surgeries.  I am also not on any medications.  I have had reoccurring chest pains just to the left of the centre of my chest.  The pain comes and goes with no known reason.  I usually notice the pain after a big meal or when I'm resting in the evening.  This pain has been reoccurring for about 8 months or more.  The pain feels very deep and I cannot feel it when I press my chest.  The pain is like a dull throbbing.  It may last for 30 seconds or a few minutes.  I also occasionally feel pain under my arm or at the bottom of my left rib.  Sometimes my throat feels tight when the pain occurs and sometimes I feel numbness in my arm.  I don't notice any pattern to it and don't necessarily notice it while I'm exerting energy.  I do sometimes notice it when I'm walking or if I move a certain way.  If I try to repeat the way I move, I cannot make the pain come again.  I also noticed the pain today when I was walking outside and breathing in cold air.  My family GP did an ECG and I'm assuming it was normal because I never heard back from her.  She felt the pain was muscular because I could localize the pain as it wasn't spread all across my chest.  I did go to the ER about 3 months ago because I was very worried about the pain and getting anxiety from it.  I had a couple more ECGs, blood tests, Xray and was told everything was normal.  I still worry about this pain because I feel it's getting worse.  I now feel a dull ache in-between my shoulder blades, stiff shoulder, sore left calf, sore left hip joint and sore left arm.  My arm muscles do feel sore and when I press on them I do feel muscle pain.  I went to my Chiropractor and she did a thermal scan which scanned my nerves and joints.  She says that the pain is most likely muscle but if it makes me feel better I should check with my GP again.  I've been reading up on angina and read that some form of angina only occurs with rest.  I am not sure if my symptoms are similar to this.  I know that I am young and that this is probaby not a factor however I am still very anxious about this.  I am wondering where I should go from here- I'd like to see my GP and order some tests.  I am wondering what tests to order i.e.. stress test and heart monitor?  And will I be able to get good peace of mind if the results come back normal.  I am not confident with just an ECG test.  I am also wondering how this could be muscular pain?  The pain is very deep, right near my heart and doesn't seem to come and go with stretching, lifting etc.  Can heart pain result in muscle pain of these other areas? Or is the fact that my arm muscle, calf and shoulder sore a good sign that the chest pain is muscular too?  This pain occurs almost nightly now and I'm just concerned that if it's heart related then it's getting worse.  Lately, I've been feeling that my heart beat sometimes beats fast.  I am hoping that this is just stress or anxiety and that once I get checked out I'll be proven wrong.  I should also mention that I am a Stay at Home Mom who looks after a 24lb toddler.  If it is muscle pain I'm assuming it's from lifting him.  However, I am right handed and the pain is only ever on my left side.  My Chiroparactor also feels that my posture at the computer could be aggrivating this.  I am trying to avoid sitting at the computer to see if it gets better.  Thank You for your time, Christine\n\n",

    "content": "Dear xtine,  The chest contains many organs, like the heart, lungs with its pleural covering, esophagus, muscles, ribs, tendons, and nerves.   It is more likely that the pain you feel is of muscle origin.  Overexertion of the chest wall muscles (spasm) or their inflammation as a part of viral infection like flu or cold results also in Chest pain, the pain is usually aggravated with certain moves posture, and is usually associated with tenderness over the affected muscles. Pain due to rib or chest wall bone disease is also another cause of Chest pain.   Muscle spasm is a body reaction to injury in tissues Causes of muscle injury include: Muscle fatigue  Heavy exercise  Maintained wrong postures  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial  Cardiac causes, should be excluded in any case of chest pain as your doctor did. Other tests to exclude cardiac causes include Stress ECG, cardiac catheter and Echocardiography.  Sometimes Chest pain is not originating from the chest itself; instead it is due to problems in the digestive tract. These problems include IBS, Gastritis,  these medical problems are usually related to meals and are not related to deep breath or physical exercises.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.

    "content": "Xtine: I will second Dr. Mahmouds comments.  The most important thing you did was to have this checked.  I would much rather see a patient come in for no (life threatening) reason and get peace of mind than sit at home and deteriorate or die.  Lets talk about this.  1- You did have an exam with GP.  You had an ECG, and I assume that it is normal because your doctor did not call you, but you shouldn't. Since this concerns you,ask.  Maybe he or she forgot.  It never hurts to sleep a little better.  2- You had a cardiac workup at ER, including xray, blood work (which looks for specific cardiac enzymes that elevate if the heart muscle is damaged)  I am sure that you had a 12 lead ECG and the other ECG was probably and echocardiogram.  All normal.  (that is good).  3- As Dr. Mahmoud stated, there are many things that could cause this.  One that you might consider, after talking to your GP is to get some lidocaine and maalox.  WHen this occurs, drink it.  If the pain goes away, then you know its related to the stomach, esophogus, etc.  That would be a clue.  It should go away almost immediately with the lidocaine.  3- You notice this pain when you lie down or eat a meal.  This sounds to me like a hiatal hernia.  This is in the area of the diaphram and can be very frustrating.  I'm sure you can read up online and ask your doctor to examine you for that.    It doesn't sound like anything you have going on is life threatening.  I hope this is helpful to you.  MSTANLEY, MD, FACOS,AAOS\n\n",

Other symptoms related to dysautonomia, ie; shakes,anxiety,tachy sometimes upon standing with drop in b/p.  Family history of high cholesterol, high b/p. Grandparents(maternal)died of stroke, Grandmother(paternal)? My cholesterol without fasting is usually in the 113-130 range with HDL of 40> and ldl and triglycerides in the very, very low range. CRP and homocysteine levels very, very low.  Are/can the leaky valves be a finding seen in normals especially with the sensitivity of equipment and technicians/dr interpretation?  I was told echo was fine. I have had echos since 91 and been followed by the same physician since 1994. Trace pulmonic was a new one added since a new tech took over the test.  These are all stress/echo tests. Echo done before and after treadmill testing.  Just questioning if this essentially a good/normal echo.  Have 3 kids to chase after :)  Thank you.\n\n",

The same rule applies:   If the 2d echo didn't show any valve abnormalities-- there is probably nothing to worry about.     Mild/trivial regurgitation is a normal finding in upwards of 40% (probably higher) of normal population studies.   The only one that would be worrysome is mild aortic (but trace aortic not so much).     Mitral valve prolapse is a pretty benign condition-- so even with trivial mitral regurgitation, it is just a normal variation with a normal person.    Yes, the echos are very sensitive and can easily pick this up.\n\n",

My symptoms are fatigue, palpitations, lowered excerise tolerance. rMy cardiologist watches me closely (I have at least 1 echo and 1 stress test a year). I am active with excercise and relatively healthy otherwise. He has made me aware that the valve is bad enough that I do need to have surgery to most likely repair the valve (and hopefully not replace it). As far as the surgery goes, we are just waiting it out and watching how the condition progresses. I am recently married and want to start a family. This will be the first child for me and my husband. My doctor has some reservations about having the surgery before I get pregnant because of the chance of having to replace the valve instead of repair it and therfore having to take blood thinners for the reat of my life which will greatly affect my chances of becomeing pregnant. I had a TEE and the results were that everything looks fine for now. Should I listen to his advice and hold off on the surgery or should I get a second opinion? I know wheather or not to have the surgery goes on  a case by case basis but I am not sure if pregnancy will be tolerated well with this conditions and my symptoms. Is there  much literature on pregnancy and mitral vavle reguritation?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pregnancy and mitral valve reguritation",
    "content": "Dear Solis,  Pregnancy and delivery both pose a very stressful situation to the cardiovascular system.  The peak stress is around the 26-28th weeks of pregnancy and immediately after delivery of baby and placenta during delivery.  If you plan on starting a family prior to having your mitral valve repaired or replaced, you will have to have an obstetrician who is specialized in high-risk pragnancies and you will have to be followed up by your cardiologist very diligently and you have to be really committed to follow-up appointments.  If you need to have your valve replaced, at this stage in your life, you might want to consider talking to your doctor about a biosynthetic valve or tissue valve. They only require that you be started on blood thinners for 6 months and then you won't need to take any blood thinners. Their draw back is that they don't last as long as the artificial or mechanical valves and they will need to be replaced sooner than a mechanical valve, and as mentioned before no need for blood thinners which is a great advantage for women of child bearing age.  This is one of the most difficult decisions that a doctor and his patient have to make. If your doctor thinks it is better for you to have your valve repaired before your pregnancy, i would say go for it. If he thinks that you can go through pregnancy without having the valve repaired, i will remind you once again that you have to be really diligent about who your obstetrician will be, where you are going to have your delivery and all of your follow-up appointments.

I underwent a stress test and acheived 11 minutes, and was told my ejection fraction was 65, all within normal limits.  Basically, the cardiologist told me I would not need to follow up with him again, to take a baby aspirin a day, and \"have a nice long life\".  Over the past year I have noticed periodic \"flip-flops\" in my chest, like my heart skipped a beat.  They last less than a second, and make me feel like I need to take a deep breath, followed by a very anxious feeling in my stomach.  they are not painful, and don't seem to follow any pattern, they just happen anywhere from 1-3 times a day to 1 time a week. I do have anxiety disorder, obesity, and past surgeries of cholecystectomy, c-section, and breast reduction.  My medications are Xanax, baby aspirin, prozac, wellbutrin, pycnogenol, multi-vit, and nexium.  I am wondering if the flip-flops could be PVC's, and if so are these related to my PFO?  Lastly--should I be concerned about this even though I've had a cardiac workup a year ago telling me I was fine?  Thank you so much for any information you can provide.\n\n",

Unless, they are really and i mean really bothering you, most doctors would agree that they don't need to be treated.  You might want to have some blood tests, make sure your blood chemistry is in order, check your thyroid functions. If everything checks out ok, no need to worry.

    "content": "Thank you for taking my question, and those that you have previously taken.  I was diagnosed at a PH clinic (a long way from my home) in mid-2005 with Exercise-Induced PH. This diagnosis was made by exercise stress test with an IV contrast agent, on a supine bike. I also did 6-minute walk achieving 1580 feet. My PH was described as being caused by my high blood pressure being inadequately controlled.   Since then I have been taking diltiazem 120mg, lipitor 10mg, lisinopril 25mg and half a triamterene/hctz 37.5/25 per day (this last med, introduced Dec 05), brought down my BP to normal.). Taking a whole diuretic tablet left me short of breath, hence the half. I am 60, slim, F, non-smoker.   Recently, as a yearly follow up, I had an echocardiogram at my local hospital and this was described as being not significantly different from one I had done at the same hospital just over a year ago. One note, however, was, 'Normal right ventricle with moderate tricuspid regurgitation and significantly elevated pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 65 mmHg. Normal pulmonic valve.' This was an increase from 58 mmHg.  What I am wondering is whether the pressure is normal for my age, and whether I should consider the pressure obtained at the PH clinic as the correct one. Estimated pressure then was 32mgHg with BP 158/90, which increased to 60mgHg with BP 184/82 at peak exercise.   I continue to become more SOB, don't feel like doing much most of the time, occasionally have a sensation of nausea or lightheadedness, no appetite.  I am at a loss to understand it, only to know that my quality of life has decreased. Maybe this is all to do with my age and I should accept this.  Alice\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Alice,  The ultimate test for pulmonary hypertension is having something called a right sided heart catheterization where a catheter is introduced through one of the big veins to the right side of the heart and will be used to measure the actual pressure inside the right heart chambers and the pulmonary arteries. It is also used in certain cases to give medications to see whether or not the pulmonary pressure drops.  In addition to the disease entities that Dr. Madia mentioned need to be ruled out such as bronchitis (where you have to have a lung function test done), there are others that need to be ruled out as well as work-up for pulmonary hypertension to see whether or not pulmonary hypertension is caused by these diseases. The most notorious ones are obstructive sleep apnea (so you have to have a sleep study done) and chronic blood clots to the lung (a condition known as chronic pulmonary thrombo-embolism) so a ventilation perfusion scan needs also to be done. Other blood tests need to be done to rule out inflammation of the blood vessels known as vasculitis as well.  If all of these tests come back negative, then you have pulmonary hypertension of unknown etiology, a condition known as primary pulmonary hypertension.  From your history, i assume that you are following with a cardiologist, if you are not, i strongly urge you to, seeing a lung doctor also, is not a bad idea just to make sure that you don't have a lung problem that is causing the pulmonary hypertension.

I have also noticed that my hands fall asleep when I am sleeping and that my right eye is twitching for the last week.  This may all be nothing but I would like an opinion.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "My 20 year old daughter was just discharged from the hospital today. Initial diagnosis in E.R. was bradycardia (sinus, with resting rates in the 30's) and hypokalemia (level was 3.3). Initial symptoms that sent her to the E.R. were s.o.b., palpatations, weakness, tremors, extreme anxiety, chest tightness, hot flashes, pre-syncope. She had no pre-existing condi tions and took no medications. She was hydrated with IV fluids and potassium was replaced. No improvement in HR. She was admitted for observation. Although she did not have a sore throat, swollen glands, fever, or unusual CBC results, she had a positive result for a monospot. Also a cardiac echo showed she has a small mitral prolapse. This would explain most of those symptoms, but I wonder about the bradycardia and the hypokalemia. Can these be part of the MVP also? By the way, I have a trace mitral regurg myself. Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Pootiegirl, Typical symptoms of MVP are generally speaking, dizziness, shortness of breath, palpitations or arrhythmias, fatigue, chest pain unassociated to cardiac disease, etc. Unless the prolapse progresses, typically there is no required treatment. When this condition worsens medication regimens are generally attempted to decrease symptoms prior to any other intervention. Mildly low potassium levels may be diet related, decreased in certain medications, etc. A heart rate in the 30's is quite low but in my opinion I would not likely associate either the mildly low potassium level nor the decreased heart rate with a slight MVP. Has she been referred to a Cardiologist? If she has not, I would suggest an inquiry about doing so. If no known cardiac abnormalities are found, then there should be an evaluation for any metabolic or endocrine disorders. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

You stated that she has no preexisting conditions which indicates that this episode was the first of its kind for her.  If she had an endocrine or cardiac abnormality it likely would have shown itself before now, which leads me to suspect that possibly an ingested subtance (drug) may have brought this about.  A 24-48 hour holter monitor could be performed to evaluate her heart rhythm but would most likely be normal on this 20 year old.    Karen Marshall RN\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 21 year old female and I have been having my symptoms since age 9.  I have been having really severe and debilitating shortness of breath combined with chest pain, fatigue and even diziness (when my symptoms are at their peak) for all these years.  My limbs also get cold and I begin to urinate more frequently.  These symptoms last for days at a time and vary in intensity throughout their span.  They are so bad that I am scared of dying. They seem to be coming from the heart. I have had some periods where I am constantly bothered by my symptoms and then periods when I am symptom free for three months at a time.  Between age 15 and 17 my symptoms seemed to have receded but then reappeared again.  Ages 12-14 were particularly bad and so have been the past three years.  I had even lost my first-year of college because I was feeling so bad and was scared of dying.  I was so scared that I did not tell my family about these problems until age 12 at which point I started going to cardiologists.  Over the past nine years, I have seen a total of four cardiologists and had all the standard noninvasive, office-based tests done repetitively multiple times.  I was also seen at an emergency room three times at the time of my symptoms.  The doctors do not find anything that concerns them with my heart.  My EKGs are normal, my echos(standard through the chest wall) show trace mitral and tricuspid valve regurge but they seem to be within the normal range and the doctors are not alarmed.  I also have a small PFO but this is again a normal finding.  My 24 hour monitor showed extra beats but I was also told that this isn't a concern.  My chest x-ray is normal.  Could it be that my echos underestimate the extent of my valve regurge, for instance, and that I do have a heart problem?  I am trully feeling really bad and I do not believe that it's of a psychological origin  (I have tried psych medication) and have always had a strong feeling that something may be wrong with my heart.  Do you have any ideas of what it can be and how I should proceed?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "My PFO is estimated to be 4mm through the regular chest-wall echo (I remember reading the report) and it has left to right shunting (not sure if I got the direction correct).  For some reason, I am more concerned that I may have a valve problem than with the PFO.  After all, PFO can be closed with a catheter.  From what I've read on the internet and from what the doctors have told me, PFO cannot cause such horrible shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, etc.  As for my valve, all echoes notice trivial mitral regurge.  I remember that one (I did not see all my echo reports because some doctors don't give them out) said \"trivial mitral regurgitation noted, a variation of normal.  The valve closed in a somewhat flattened fashion but did not prolapse\".  Apparently, the last cardio that I have seen, after looking at my past echo reports in the hospital system said that I have trace tricuspid regurge too.  As I realize, the mitral regurge is usually more significant, especially since it, along with the PFO, are the consistent findings on all the studies.  However, since everything looks mild, the doctors dismiss my symptoms and believe that none of these findings can cause them.  I am very scared, that I may need to have an open heart surgery at the end, and about the consequences, especially given how long my heart may have been compromised.  I realize I sound neurotic, but I have been having TRULLY DISTURBING symtoms for nearly twelve years and actually am having them right now.  Could anyone suggest what's best to do in this situation and whether I should insist on invasive testing (which was never done before) such as the TEE. I am actually scared of having it. Can mitral regurge or the PFO cause incapacitating and prolonged shortness of breath, chest pain, fatigue, etc? Can a TEE reveal something that the regular echo either underestimates or doesn't pick up?\n\n",

They are never consistent and  I forget about them until it happens. All the sudden I will feel the stab and then I cannot breath normally because with each breath the pain gets more intense. I have to breathe with short and fast until it goes away, usually momentarily. I always just assumed this happened to everyone I guess but last night I woke up with the most intense episode to date. It was on my left side right below my rib cage which I think is where most of them are. I never really paid attention to where the pain was but no it is always in or right around my rib cage. I also occasionally will get a piercing pain through my left breast, this too is very occasional and sporadic.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband is 41 yr. old and was diagnosed with WPW at 30 years of age. Ablation was attempted but not successful because the extra valve was too close to the main artery and would have required a pace maker at such an early age. Doctors hopefully damaged it enough that the tacacardia would not happen as often or not ever again. Over the past 5 years he has what we call episodes. During these he experiences the following:  Agitation, Discomfort (pulling sensation) in the chest (left side) that moves over the shoulder to his back and then makes the left arm feel tingly, He suffers from asthma and that gets aggravated by the episodes. His muscles shake. All of the symptoms start gradually get to a peak and then start to subside. Usually lasting about 1 \u2013 2 hours. Once these symptoms subside he feels like he is have hot flashes and the pressure in his head with a tingling sensation at the top of his head.  We have been to the hospital a number of times and seen a cardiologist. Blood tests have been done to check the plat lets and this comes back normal. They do an EKG and that shows the WPW but they are not concerned. Was told this is normal for someone with his condition. Blood pressure is a little off but gets back to normal after a few hours.  Yesterday at the Urgent Care BP was 141/90 15 min after the symptoms stopped and 45min later it was 134/99, 2 hours after that it was 122/78.   Please note that EVERYTIME we go into the Urgent Care or hospital the symptoms stop before he is ever called in to see a doctor.   My concern is that no one seems to know what is wrong and I am worried that it is the WPW acting up again and it might be time for the pacemaker.  There is no history of heart diease. Father died of pancreatic cancer and had diabetes.  He is currently using an abuterol inhaler and advair.\n\n",

The intermittent and sudden onset nature of the episodes makes some rare conditions jump to mind and they have to be ruled out unless they were already ruled out: 1. Pheochromocytoma (a rare tumour that puts out adrenaline in the blood). 2. Carcinoid syndrome (a rare tumour that puts out serotonin in the blood).  Your husband's symptoms can be also caused by an asthma attack in itself. A panic attack can also cause these symptoms. If you can say for sure that the attacks are associated with your husband using his albuterol inhaler, albuterol can cause fast heart rate and muscle shakes real bad in some people.

This is the age for you to study, play, enjoy life in general. Also cholesterol levels at your age cannot be judged to decide whether you have hyperlipidemia. There is no consensus on this as yet. Plus treating cholesterol if any, with statin or other medicines at this age is also highly doubtful.  My general advice to you is divert your mind to more fruitful activities like reading novels, sports, outings and studies. Keep a goal of excelling at you studies and see the result.   I do not advice you to indulge in hard liquor at this age. In my view no one should cosume any alcohol until the age of 21.    Dr. A. Madia\n\n",

Also, smoking can lead to heart disease and poor circulation.  Your mom being obese, she can have a condition called sleep apnea or another one called obesity hypoventilation syndrome and they can cause low oxygen in the blood if very severe.  i know it is not usually that cold in kentucky but cold weather will also make the lunulae bluish  Please, have your mother see her doctor because even though this is a clinical sign of a simple condition yet it can be cause by more severe ones and she needs to be evaluated.

    "content": "Hello,   I had my aortic valve replaced and an aneurysm repaired in 1999.  Prior to my AVR I was heavily into aerobics, but since then my exercise routine has consisted of a daily walk lasting between an hour and an hour and half. I don't \"power walk,\" but I don't just plod along either.  I never get out of breath and always cool down.  I've noticed recently that instead of leaving me invigorated, this walk now almost always leaves me fatigued and in need of a nap! I drink a ton of water throughout the day so I don't think it could be dehydration. My worst sin is that I overdo the carbs, but blood glucose tests have always been normal.  It just doesn't make sense, especially since I've been walking for so many years. BP is fine. Last year's echo was fine.  Any opinions on whether or not this could be a sign of a problem with my valve? Guess I'm just a bit paranoid because fatigue was the only symptom I had prior to my valve replacement.    Your thoughts would be appreciated. Thanks in advance.   Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear DavesMom,  What kind of other medical problems do you have if any. Did you have a mechanical valve or a bioprosthetic valve. What are the medications that you are currently taking and whether or not there was any new additions to your medications.  To begin with, if you have a prosthetic valve and you are taking coumadin (a blood thinner), this could be an indication of a low blood count which means that you might be chronically bleeding (especially if you are taking over the counter pain medications like aleve or advil) which might increase the risk of bleeding, so i would recommend to check a blood count.  This could secondary to a general disease, such as an underactive thyroid gland, so i would recommend checking your thyroid functions.  You should have a new echocardiogram to make sure that the valve is functioning properly especially if your symptoms started to develop after your last echocardiogram.  A new medication could be the culprit behind this fatigue.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped and awaiting your response.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Thank you very much for your reply.  To answer your questions, I have a mechanical valve and take coumadin.  I have also been on 400 mgs of Tegretol for several years due to complex partial seizures. (The seizures have been well controlled with the Tegretol.)  The only other medication I take is 10 mg of Lipitor. I am 49 and not overweight.  I just had a lipid panel done last week which showed no problems with kidney, thyroid, blood glucose, etc.  As mentioned, my BP is always good and my heart rate is almost always in the 60s.  Resting heart rate is sometimes between 55-59 beats per minute.  I have an appointment for my yearly echo in a couple of weeks. Last year's was fine so I would hope that the valve hasn't deteriorated in that short of a time - it needs to last me many more years. : )  (I've already been through two heart surgeries - don't want another!) Are there more subtle symptoms of internal bleeding that I should look out for? I have never seen anything abnormal  in my stool or urine.  It's puzzling but maybe I'm just overreacting. Still, it happens too frequently to be just a fluke.  Again, I appreciate your time.  Any other comments would be appreciated.  Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear DavesMom,  Thank you very much for the update.  Eventhough there is no obvious external bleeding, the bleeding can still be there but it is usually of a small amount and happens over a long period of time so it is subtle and the only symptom that one gets are symptoms of anemia which are fatigue, shortness of breath on exertion, dizzy spells and sometimes blackout spells.  Mechanical valves should last 10-15 years before deteriorating. So, hopefully, your echo will turn out ok.  With the lipitor (and the like medications), there is a chance of muscle damage. Eventhough the muscle damage usually manifests itself with muscle pain. i would not say that checking a muscle enzyme test is unreasonable.  If you have not checked with your doctor, please, do so as soon as possible and i still recommend to check a complete blood count, a thyroid function test, test to check blood in the stools (if your blood count turns out significantly lower than the last time it was checked) and a muscle enzyme test.  Tegretol also can cause fatigue and weakness sometimes, so i would recommend that you have a tegretol level checked to see whether or not the level has been stable.

    "content": "I am a 39 year old female, diagnosed with MVP 20 years ago.  Both of my grandfathers died in their mid forties of heart attacks.  My uncle (father's brother) died of a massive heart attack at 41 while out jogging.  My mother (55) has tachycardia and has had angioplasty.  Recently, over the last month, I've developed numerous symptoms.  The first thing I noticed was general swelling that seemed to happen very quickly.  I was unable to wear my rings and certain clothing.  I was also having some mild chest pain, palpitations, left arm pain and pain in the left side of my neck. I was seen at the local emergency room.  EKG was normal, Cardiac enzymes (normal), C-MET Panel (normal), Platelet count slightly elevated, Urinalysis (normal).  The doctor there told me that my liver was swollen, my spleen palpable and I have pitting edema I went to see my family doctor who did an EKG which he said showed some slight abnormalities but nothing serious.  He ordered cardiac enzymes (normal) and an excercise stress test (normal).  He did say that I had a very significant weight gain since my last appt. 3 wks earlier.  But once he ruled out heart attack he seemed very unconcerned about my symptoms.  My blood pressure at this appointment was 126/72.  He diagnosed me with hypertension????? and put me on beta blockers.  I've noticed a substantial decrease in the chest pain while taking this medication but I still don't really know what's wrong.   My other symptoms include exhaustion after minimal effort or excercise, insomnia, weakness, backache, some nausea, tighness in chest, lightheaded, numbness and tingling in hand, forgetfulness, difficulty concentrating,   Could I have a heart problem that these tests didn't indicate?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bestof96,  You definitely have a strong family history of coronary disease given the fact that your mother developed coronary disease before the age of 60.  It is now the time to try and make sure that all of the other risk factors are taken care of.  If you are a smoker, stop smoking immediately. If you have high blood pressure, it has to be vigorously controlled. Make sure you exercise on regular basis and you have your weight at its optimum. Your cholesterol has to be checked if not already done and if it is high it has to be lowered (exercise, diet and medications if needed).  Some of the symptoms that you had could be attributed to mitral valve prolapse especially that the symptoms improved a lot since you were started on beta blockers.  These symptoms can also be caused by a neck spine problem given your symptoms of neck pain and numbness in your hand.  The fatigue and other symptoms of forgetfullness and being unable to concntrate are non-specific and can be caused by a lot of causes.  i am not sure what caused this sudden \"significant increase in weight\" but i think a cause has to be found. If this was before your period then this understandable especially if you have been gaining weight slowly and then you had this sudden fluid retention prior to your period.  Regarding hypertension, the blood pressure has to be higher than or equal to 140/90 to be classified as hypertension. Previously lower numbers that were not considered hypertension, now are called pre-hypertension as studies have shown that over time even if the blood pressure did not reach 140/90, there was still an increased cardiovascular risk and it was found that these patients are twice more likely to develop hypertension than the patients with lesser values.

    "title": "Aortic valve stenosis?",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 36 year-old male with a long history of exercise (I was a competitor in a couple of sports until my late 20s), but this was all despite sometimes intense PVCs and chest discomfort.  EKG shows just incomplete RBBB, stress test from a few years ago was good, but this week, the echocardiogram came back indicating \"minor\" aortic valve stenosis...the tech said the value was \"just a bit above 1.0\" and that it doesn't get serious until you get to 2.0, and there's no calcification....the valve just doesn't quite open as far as it should.  She made it sound like not a big deal, but for an athlete, I wonder if it makes a difference.  If I'm training intensely but my left ventricle is always working against a mild load, is exercise going to drive me to early decompensation/ventricular hypertrophy? (there's no evidence of it yet...I'm asking a preemptive question); I also wonder if my persistent symptoms of heaviness in the chest at the beginning of exercise may have to do with left ventricular overloading due to the stenosis.  I usually don't feel good for the first 10 minutes of running (various chest discomforts, left shoulderblade pain, etc)...and then sometimes there's kind of like a \"kick\" in the chest, and the heaviness very suddenly clears and I can breathe easier.  Someitmes, while running, I also get a charp, intense pain behind the sternum, but it passes almost instantly....it's extremely intense (like a knife quickly cutting the sternum from the inside) and frightening however...I'm wondering if aortic innervation may be responding to the distention pressures at the valve roots.    Is there a minimally invasive technique that can adjust (not replace) the aortic valve to open more fully if it's not calcified?  I have a very good grasp of the cardiac anatomy, physiology, and mechanics, and I have a deep biology background, so I'd appreciate a comprehensive answer (you won't confuse me).  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Aortic stenosis can cause chest pain on exertion. However for that to occur one must have more than moderate stenosis. Here you have not given details. Aortic stenosis is measured in two ways. One is Valve Area. Normal area is obout 4-5 square cm. How much is yours as per the report? Another way is see pressure gradient. Upto about 10 mm Hg  of peak gradient across the aortic valve is normal. Then also upto 50 mm Hg is mild to moderate. You stating 1.0 and 2.0 does not make any sense.   Secondly even if mild AS is there it would not hamper your physical activity. Moderate and severe AS can easily be opened up with Ballon Vavuloplasty thru the skin, no operation necessary.  Slight chest discomfort at the beginning of exercise is common even in normal healthy individuals, I have noticed. Sometimes it has to do with stomach gasses. As the exercise progresses the gas is burped out and all symptoms are gone and the subject can carry on with the rest of the exericse.   Dr. A Madia\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tightrope, All of your symtoms are due to your mitral prolpase. MVP can cause vague atypical chestpains, tachycardia, fluttering sensations, even dizziness. Your episodes of high BP are due to secondary anxiety caused by the symptoms. MVP itself can NEVER cause high BP. Atrial flutter is a dangerous rhythm disturbance and can definitely be caused by binge drinking especially in the setting of MVP. I strongly advice you against it.   You should take Tab. Inderal 40 md 1/2 twice daily to start with and this should control all of your symptoms of MVP as well as anxiety. Inderal contains propranolol. It should be continued indefinite period of time.  Finally you need not consider yourself a heart patient, MVP is a benign common condition.   A. Madia\n\n",

    "content": "I am 35 year old female. I have MVP, dysautonomia, fibromyalgia, IBS, and GERD. I recently had to go to the emergency room because I was having numbness and tingling in my left foot and toes. Also my lips. I have recently been diagnosed with pitting edema. At the hospital they ran blood work, chest Xrays and did a doppler on my left leg to see if I had any blood clots. The chest Xray I don't know what that was ran for but the blood work was ran to see if I had and enzymes in my blood to see if I might have had a light heart attack. They also ran 3 vials of IV fluid into my body to increase the volume of my blood. That brought on chest pains that ran down my left arm all the way down to my wrist and it felt like the wrist bone was about to explode. I have these kinds of chest pains off and on so I guess they thought nothing of it. My MVP causes me to have light chest pains all the time but sometimes they hurt like they did that night. All the test came back normal and I was sent home with the diagnoses that the MVP and dysautonomia was causing the numb and tingling. My family doctor has put me on Tenormin for the MVP, Zoloft for my depression, and flexiril to help the fibro. Prilosec OTC for the Gerd and Imodium AD for the IBS with diarrea. After the hospital visit the Doctor put me on 25 mg of HCTZ for fluid. And a aspirin everyday. I can't take a strong fluid pill because if I do it will come out in my bowels instead of my kidneys. Needless to say my numbness and tingling in my foot and lips is still going on. As is my swelling in my legs and ankles. They pit and stay for a long time. I also have started to feel  bloated in my stomach at night and I feel like I have this little tickle in the back of my throat that makes me do a little cough once in awhile but mostly at night. I stand all day at my job but I move lot. Sitting don't help my swelling and neither does elevating my legs. Only thing that seems to help is lying in bed all weekend and by monday morning my legs & ankles are normal and then by monday night they are swelled again. I also have shortness of breath when I exert myself and sweat really bad at the back of my neck and hairline. I am tired all the time and never feel like cleaning my house. It is all I can do to get up in the mornings to go to work. Could you please help me. Me and my husband are trying to have a baby. I am also overweight. Thanks any help will be appreciated.

    "content": "Hi Winniethepooh, A chest xray can be used to identify an accumulation of fluid in the lungs or enlargement of the heart. Fatigue may be associated with MVP. The coughing especially at night may be associated with GERD, cardiac origin etc. The Tenormin and Prilosec should lessen these symptoms. Have you been evaluated for Diabetes? Peripheral Neuropathy (numbness and tingling of the hands and feet) may be linked to diabetes. The pitting edema may be related to numerous reasons for example, congestive heart failure, kidney disorders, idiopathic (unknown causes especially in women), etc. My suggestions to you are:Inquire about a referral to a cardiologist to evaluate if the shortness of breath and pitting edema is related to a cardiac origin. Also inquire about an evaluation by an Endocrinologist to rule out any abnormalities such as hormone dysfunction, diabetes, insulin resistance, etc. I hope this information is somewhat helpful.

I would suggest that you inquire with your physician about treatment with a low dosage beta blocker to see if this helps reduce your symptoms, palpitations etc. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Tricuspid valve regurgitation",
    "content": "Dear RubyMarie,  i am not sure from your history what is the cause behind the tricuspid valve regurgitation. What was your pulmonary artery pressures? What did the cardiologist tell you the reason behind the tricuspid regurgitation was?  When tricuspid regurgitation is mild or moderately severe, usually it does cause any major hemodynamic consequences, so there is no need to worry.  But if it becomes severe, it usually gives rise to symptoms and signs of right sided heart failure which are usually lower limb swelling, right sided abdominal pain (because of liver congestion), abdominal swelling because of accumulation of fluid in the abdomen, shortness of breath and indigestion. This being said however, some patients with severe tricuspid regurgitation remain asymptomatic for many years. It remains unclear why some patients tolerate this lesion and others do not.  If your cardiologist thinks it is indicated, you have to be followed by echocardiograms on regular basis and communicate any new symptom that you would develop to your cardiologist.  Treatment for tricuspid regurgitation is usually treatment of the cause if it is secondary to another disease process. If the cause needs to be surgically corrected such as valve repair or replacement, at that time, the tricuspid valve is also repaired or replaced if deemed necessary.

    "content": "Dear Dr. Mokhtar,  Thank you for your reply. My cardiologist never addressed potential causes of the Tricuspid Valve Regurgitation. I assumed it is a byproduct of my ASD and  enlargement of the right atrium. My last echocardiogram was in August 2001 prior to most recent one and at that time there was no mention of valve regurgiation. What led me to see a cardiologist again was a rapid heartbeat, increased palpitations, chest pain, shortness of breath on climbing a flight of stairs and lightheadedness. I have no idea what my pulmonary pressure is but can say I have never had any problems with high blood pressure. I am type II diabetic (though not overweight - 5'3\" 130 lbs - nor sedintary) with some control using oral medications. My husband is concerned our hiking activity (canyons and mountains) will exasperate this conditon. My feeling is the more fit I am the better. Again, thank you for your time.   RubyMarie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rheumatoid arthritis and mvp",
    "content": "Dear wvbound83,  Rheumatoid arthritis even though it mainly affects the joints, yet it can affect other organs of the body as well. Of the organs that might be affected are the heart and the lungs. Chest pain has many causes. The ones that most doctors would like to make sure that patients don't have when they come complaining of chest pain are usually related to the heart (such as a heart attack) and to the lung if they think the symptoms might be suggestive (such as a blood clot of the lung, called pulmonary embolism).  You had a coronary angiography which is the gold standard for diagnosis of coronary disease, and from what you said, sounds like it was negative. Looks like you are wondering about having \"some probable artery problem, nothing severe\" and what it really means. i have not seen the results of your coronary angiogram but what this usually means is that you have very minor narrowing in your coronaries and these narrowings are so mild they can not give rise to any of the symptoms of chest pains that you have been having. These narrowings are not uncommon in patients who are at a certain age.  Besides coronary disease, rheumatoid arthritis can affect the heart in other ways that can give rise to chest pain as well such as inflammation of the membranes surrounding the heart, a condition known as pericarditis and inflammation of the muscle of the heart, a condition known as myocarditis.  Sometimes, rheumtoid arthritis will affect the small vessels of the heart (not the big coronary arteries that are seen on the angiogram) causing them to be inflammed and giving you chest pain similar to the one of heart attack.  By the way, what did the coronary angiography show regarding your mitral valve prolapse?  Chest pain can be caused by lung problems (that can be caused by rheumatoid arthritis) as well. Like the heart, if the membranes surrounding the lungs become affected by rheumatoid arthritis and inflammed, this will give rise to chest pain. Rheumatoid arthritis affects the lungs in a lot of other different manners as well. i suggest that you have a ct scan of the chest to have your lungs evaluated if not already done.  One of the causes of chest pain in any patient can be neck spine arthritis. In cases of rheumatoid arthritis, the neck spine is very frequently affected by the rheumatoid arthritis itself. So, if you were not evaluated for neck spine arthritis whether or not it is caused by rheumatoid arthritis, i suggest that you be.  The way that you described your pain, with pain to touch, makes me think that this pain might be related to affection of the skin/subcutaneous tissues (tissues underlying the skin)/muscles affection by rheumatoid arthritis.  You should be talking to your rheumatologist about these symptoms to see whether he/she thinks that these symptoms might be related to your rheumatoid arthritis and whether or not they warrant treatment with other medications such as prednisone or other newer agents.  Chest pain can be caused by acid reflux disease/heart burn or other stomach problem especially if you are taking lots of pain relievers for your arthritis.  If your blood pressure is high, it needs to be treated.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kris8,  Usually, mitral valve regurgitation is well tolerated during pregnancy especially if the patient has good left ventricular function.  You will have to be supervised by a cardiologist during your pregnancy and you will have to be very diligent about any new symptoms that you would experience and will have to report them to your physician immediately.  After your pregnancy, you will have to be followed-up by a cardiologist and have echocardiograms on regular intervals if your cardiologist thinks it is indicated.  Pericarditis is the inflammation of the membranes surrounding the heart and i don't think it affected the mitral valve in any way.  i can not really tell you which anti-histamine medication you can take for your allergies, there are lots of them out there, i am not sure which one you tried and which one you did not, the best way is to ask the pharmacist and he/she can tell you which ones are the least notorious to cause tachycardia even though the few that i am aware of don't have tachycardia listed as one of their side effects.

Her physician may suggest a cardiac rehabilitation program which by the way is excellent with rebuilding stamina and evaluation of progress. She may also hear a clicking sound much like the ticking of a clock while at rest from the artificial valves (if metal valves) are used and this is quite normal but may take some time getting used to. Your 4 week period stay should most likely be adequate providing there are no complications.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Does this make any sense? I have always been a shallow breather. When I exercise and try breathing more deeply I get palpitations, yet when I continue my shallow breathing (lifetime habit) I don't. I also get them whenever I bend over and stand up, reach above my head and back down, lay on my left side, lay flat, walk up and down stairs ( and feel winded), drink liquids etc. Up until recently I used to always run up and down stairs and had no palpitations I do aerobics and yoga regularly, am slender and have a resting BP that is usually in the upper 90's or low 100's over 60's or high 50's.  My  heart rate had been bordeline tachy for several months but lately has been in the 60's and 70's. Just now 106/66 78 bpm.  Only in the last few weeks have the number of the palpitations, and the number of things that prompt them,  increased. I am off of work for the summer so my stress level has declined a lot. I assume they are harmless and do nothing  My next scheduled cardiology appointment is in August. I am not so much worried ( though I am a tad) as I am curious about these things. It was suggested to me that being slender can accentuate your ability to feel things.\n\n",

    "content": "After some dental work last October I started getting horrific \"spells\" kinda dizziness kinda vertigo but not really either.ENT treated for BPPV, maneuver thing several times and a collar. Did nothing. Months later neurologist had MRI. Nothing (except a brain of course) but Neuro noticed the tachy. PCP got abnormal EKG sent to Cardio. Cardio said MPV with very thin narrow ( I don't know whether she meant the valve or the chodae) and regurgitation that was \"not too bad\". What that means I cannot guess. Does that mean mild or moderate? I should ask for copy of report summary. Anyway the bloodwork was allwithin \"normal\" lab specs and the TSH, I noted was almost boderline high (but still \"normal\") which, if anything, would indicate I might have low thyroid function, yes? Anyway, the dizziness gradually lessened and I was only having it occasionally instead of constantly and the \"hits\" were less powerful. Now it seems to be supplanted by palpitations. Before laying on my left side, right side, reaching overhead etc. etc. would cause the dizziness, now it causes the palps LOLOL I try to agree with the anxiety idea and not complain, and haven't complained about the increasing palps to the doctor, but frankly my job entails handling emergency situations, one of my office lines is literally called \"the emergency line\" LOL and most people who know me would probably see me as quite stable. I guess one can suppress anxiety to the point where  neither you nor anyone else can see it...or maybe I'm just not particurlarly anxious afterall. Sometimes a cigar is just a cigar. It's weird and interesting, but since it is supposed to be harmless I just notice it and wonder. My father dropped dead suddenly from his heart and my mother's brother died young of mitral regurgitation, but that is more common in males I read. It's just interesting\n\n",

    "content": "Mitral valve prolapse is rather common in women, and many times mild mitral regurge goes with it. Regurgitation is the blood from the mitral valve in the  left ventricle (bottom left side of heart) leaks into the top part (atrium).  Severe cases of course are very dangerous and can cause heart failure, but almost all MVP cases have a mild case, and isn't dangerous at all, but with your family history you need to have an echo from time to time for observation, just to be safe.  Since the palpitations are particularly bothersome and frequent, you could ask your doctor about taking a beta or calcium channel blocker to regulate and slow the heart rate.  It can also reduce anxiety.  Your job is extremely high stress; not surprising your level of anxiety.  Anxiety seems to be associated with MVP to begin with, and you are right about some people surpressing it.  That can cause very frequent palpitations.    Increased TSH does indicate hypothyroidism, but borderline cases such as yours are not diagnosed as such and aren't treated medically because it will more than likely cause hyperthyroidism.  Either disorder will cause palpitations.  Just watch the level from time to time and if you start to get abnormally fatigued and/or start gaining weight for no apparent reason, get it checked.  Do talk to your doctor about treating your anxiety, it can even lead to coronary disease down the road, not just palpitations, and take the utmost care of yourself.  I wish you well,  Shannon\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding Shannon.    I appreciate the thyroid warning signs. Palps eventually will resolveon their own or not I suppose. Never had them before (though when I was younger used to get very hard chest pains once in awhile) so can't imagine why I have them now. Stressful though the job may be, the former job was even more stressful and I didn't have any of these problems until last October. I'm on vacation until the end of August and the palps did not become constant until I already was on break. Since they come with the exact movements that the vertigo did, even using the restroom,   I have to think the cause is possibly from a physical source. I understand about the beta blockers, but my last BP was 104/64 and it's a bit scary to me to take a medication that lowers BP when it's already where it is   I will have to live with it until it stops on it's own, the vertigo did.  The better sleep, no stimulants and exercise part I can and will do. Thanks again.\n\n",

Whether you smoke or not, whether you have any chronic disease for which you are treated and whether any of your first fegree family members (mother, father, older brother or sister) had heart attacks in the past or not. A family history of high blood pressure and diabetes should also be considred.   Also you did not mention how long the pain lasts, is it related to exercise in any way and what do you do to make the pain go away.   The symptoms that you are describing could be related to many things.   Chest pain is always worriesome for coronary disease. At young age, it is rare to have coronary disease, but it is not unheard of. Chest pain could also be related to other conditions such as mitral valve prolapse and blood clots going to the lungs among others.   Do you work out? Do you do physical work, lifting, etc.?   As far as carpal tunnel syndrome its pain is usually restricted to the wrist and hand. It commonly presents as pain (usually a burning pain), numbness and tingling in your thumb, index, and middle fingers. Tingling, numbness, or pain, which may move up your arm to your elbow but not the chest. These symptoms are usually worse at night.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I was told about a year ago that I've had a small hole in my heart (PFO, I think the term is) since birth. It was recommended that I take antibiotics before any type of dental procedure. I didn't think much of this until this morning. I was brushing my teeth, and my gums were bleeding. I've actually had this problem for many years (poor oral hygiene, I suppose). Then it hit me.....In brushing my teeth, I am apparently putting myself at risk for endocarditis. Not only that, but every time I've brushed my teeth in the last few years (as long as my gums have been bleeding) I've put myself at risk. Is thinking this accurate? I'm currently quite frightened that I'll get endocarditis. What should I do? My gums have been bleeding when I brush my teeth for several years now, so I don't see that ending anytime soon (I don't think about it often because I don't brush nearly as often as I should). Can anyone at all (prefferably a Dr., but any advice is welcome) give me advice on what I should do or how worried I should be? The cardiologist didn't give me much info on the size of the hole in my heart, unfortunately. All I know about the nature of it is that it's apparently very small. I also have MVP, if that's of any importance. Again, any advice is welcomed. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Of course, we can only speculate here, best to see your doctor for an accurate diagnosis and treatment plan.   Your problems do not sound cardiac in the classical sense (however, we cannot rule that possibility out). It could be neurological (nerve), most commonly associated with neck and back pain.   Have you had any lower back pain as well as neck pain? The neck supplies the nerves that go down the arms, and if there is any pressure on it, arm pain can result. It can be on one side or the other.   Pain down the legs (sciatica) usually results from lower back pain or stiffness. The pain usually travels down the back of the buttocks into the back of the thigh. In very bad cases, it can go all the way down to the ankle. When we are stressed, our natural reflex is to tense the mucles in the neck first, and sometimes the back, making them sore. If we lift something heavy, or sometimes even turn or bend the wrong way, a muscle spasm can result. If you have had this happen, sciatica can result and linger.   Do you have any other symptoms other than the leg and arm pain?\n\n",

It's been about 3 1/2 years since my last trip to the cardiologist.  I was also recently diagnosed with high cholesterol (not sure if that has any relevance).  My question is that recently I've been very short of breath (can't seem to breathe deeply enough like I can't catch my breath), I've been having some chest pains, dry cough at night while sleeping (enough to wake me up), and swelling of my hands.  I haven't told anyone yet because I don't want to upset anyone if it's nothing.  I feel too young to be having these problems and don't want people to think it's all in my head.  I have a doctors appointment on the 24th of June and I would like to know if these symptoms are related to anything with my current heath issues or am I being over sensitive.  More over should I bring up all of these symptoms to my cardiologist, I don't want him to think I'm nuts. Thanks, Tiffany\n\n",

Well anyways I keep having chest pain sometimes I feel like I will pass out and sometimes I get nasueas. So recently I just met my biological father and some sisters from that side and they said I should get checked for MVP cause it runs on that side of the family.So I just got a new doc and I told him he ordered an echo and the results were trace leaks in 3 valves, but he didn't explain much.He just said to take antibiotics before dental procedures.  So I called my docs office the other day cause I wanted to talk with him about doing more tests to make sure I am ok, and they put me on with the nurse and she said I have to go to the ER so I eventually did and they did an EKG which showed abnormal T waves they rushed me right in and put me on oxygen.Then eventually the er doc came to me and said no problem abnormal T waves are no big deal, but why do I have them?I have been looking this up and found that abnormal T waves CAN mean somethings wrong.....I don't know what to do.All I know is this pain isn't in my head,but should I get a stress test or what? Does anyone know why T waves are off and what is my best option? Thanx so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Gwen,  Regarding your chest pain and whether or not it is related to coronary disease, your major risk factors for coronary disease and the characterisitics of your chest pain have to be assessed. If you don't have any major risk factor for coronary disease (including hypertension, diabetes, family history of early coronary disease (in first degree relatives), high cholesterol, smoking, being above 50 (in males) and 60 (in females) and being a male) and your chest pain is atypical as compared to that of coronary disease, then the probability that this pain be due to coronary disease is very low.  Females of the child bearing age are naturally protected from coronary disease unless they have had major coronary risk factors for many years.   Being cheked for mitral valve prolapse was a very good idea. i am not sure whether or not you have mitral valve prolapse but i think minimally leaky valves are usually not a big deal if the valves themselves are not anatomically abnormal.  Chest pain has so many causes including chest wall causes such as inflammation of the ribs, acid reflux disease and neck spine problems, so you might want to talk to your new doctor about his opinion as to what he thinks is causing this chest pain.  About the t-wave abnormality, what exactly is the abnormality that you are referring to? Is it an inverted t-wave? And if yes in what leads? What are the blood tests that you had when you went to the er?  Resting ecg is not the ultimate tool to diagnose coronary disease. That's why other tools have been developed.   In your case, i would suggest that you be evaluated for other causes of chest pain and if by any chance, you end up in an er having an ecg, always tell them that you have chronic abnormal t-waves so that they know that there is nothing acute.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi doctor, I am a 27 year old male who has been at about 280lbs most of his life. I went up to about 350 and under alot of stress.  I started getting heart palpitations and I worried all the time.  I went to the cardiologist and they did a two day nucler stress test on me and said it was great, that was 11 months ago. They also did a holter monitor for 24 hours.  I stopped thinking about it and they went away but when I got under more stress they came back.  I went back to the doctor and they had me wear a event monitor for 30 days. Well after about 12 days or so I had had tons of these things so I went to find out what was up.  I was told that they were I belive premature contractions that everyone gets and some people just feel them more than others and not to worry.  Well I was told to wear the monitor for 15 more days to see if anything raised it's head but I didn't because I had had all the problems during the first 12 days and it got in my way at work.  I am now at 334lbs and loosing when I come back from the gym I feel some of these heart palps.  I asked my doctor if they can make your arm hurt and things like that and she said without question.  Could my weight be causing these palps. I don't really have any family history of heart problems.  I don't smoke nor do I drink.  I don't drink soft drinks but am under stress and I do worry more than I should to be honest.  My dad does get heart palps when he eats alot of caffine.  I don't normaly eat or drink caffine.  What I am feeling is like a flutter almost, sometimes stronger than others sometimes I am tired afterwords.  Sometimes my left arm hurts or pain up my neck.  When this happens I stretch and move around and then it stops after a little bit.  Its almost like I get really tense and worry for a bit about it then I feel better if I can get my mind off it.   Thank you so much for your opinion.  I have read so much about this problem but I want to know about me in general.  One more thing does laying on your lft side do anything for you.\n\n",

To reduce the frequency on your own, cut out any caffeine (you didn't mention if you drank coffee or tea), sugar, stimulants of any kind i.e. sinus and some allergy medications and weight loss \"supplements\", get at least 8 hours of sleep EVERY night and on a strict schedule, continue working out at a reasonable pace, and reduce your stress as much as possible.

    "content": "Dear Doctor, Thank you for time in reading this. I feel comparably ignorant because my cardiologist just diagnosed me with mild MVP (valve deformed and a mild regurgitation). I know nothing else about it while other people here seem to know much more about the details of their diagnosis. I have been getting chest pains once in awhile since adolescence.  I started getting dizziness (constant) palpitations ( occasional). around November last year.  Now, my doctor says the MVP is not sufficient to cause these newer symptoms but since I have been having them it is the only thing that was discovered. Can dizziness, fatigue etc be caused by mild MVP ?\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response. Yes, I  suppose I may be anxious because when I took a treadmill test on last Tuesday afternoon I walked faster than the track on the machine was actually going!  After the test was over, my heart rate stayed up too long I was told. When they took the electrodes off, after I had stopped for several minutes,  it was still 140 bpm. I was given a prescription for half tab daily of a beta blocker, but at the moment my heart rate is only 84 bpm so I am reluctant to take something I may not require. Taking it at home it averages about 100 bpm, resting, and I am not sure that's worth the side effects of a pill..the heart rate was noticed before the echo that diagnosed the MVP.  Is a slightly high heart rate in someone with MVP a greater long term risk than  the same boderline rate in a person without MVP?  I get palpitations when I lay on one side or when I sit in a hot room or hot car or  (LOL)when I sing along with the radio. I don't get them when I am upset about something.  I also always get little ticks, leg or trunk jerking before falling asleep at night.  The silliest symptom is dizziness when, I hate to admit this, when I cross my legs or cross my feet.\n\n",

    "content": "Taking the beta blocker is not dangerous.  In fact, it may help with your anxiety as well as slowing your heart rate.  I don't know of any long term dangers of borderline tachycardia such as yours, but you need to watch it, if it does increase steadily at rest, see your doctor/cardiologist, however, he will probably just prescribe a beta blocker!!!  I recommend giving it a try, it won't hurt you and you may find you just feel better.  MVP seems to have a strong correlation with anxiety.  Most every patient I saw over my years in cardiology had an anxious nature.  Many of them found they did feel better on the beta blockers.  The ticks are quite common in \"higher energy\", hehe, individuals.  I have never heard of getting palpitations from crossing legs or feet LOL!!  Just try the meds - you don't have to stay on them if you don't like them.\n\n",

Test neg., montior showed sinus arrythmia, normal rhythm/rate. Symptoms seem to point to dysautonoma according to one dr. at an autonomic center in Ala., chills, sweats, feel every heartbeat at times, h/r increases on standing quickly, low b/p at times, documented drop in b/p of 10-20pts. during sit and stand test of b/p. Nornal heartrate otherwise.  Another cardio. feels it is just hypersensitivity to adrenaline.  Is there a specific guideline to distinguish IST vs dysautonomia? Also seems to be cycle related.  Any ideas? Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "The echos are not really worrisome at this point, but worth following every couple of years.  Dysautonomia is a very severe disorder, incapacitating much of the time.  Sinus rhythm is very common and I am sure the cardiologists have told you it is nothing to worry about.  People with IST tend to run higher heart rates, especially with smoking or lack of excercise and it usually rises with any activity including rising from sitting position.  The \"tilt\" test you speak of needs to be no less than 20 bpm and usually significantly more with every tilt test.  10-20 definitely does not qualify for disautonomia.  Even eating habits can affect these symptoms easily - too many carbs (even good carbs) eaten without enough protein to balance them a couple of hours later can lead to lowered blood sugar which can produce the symptoms you describe.  Anxiety can also.   Symptoms of dysautonomia can include frequent, vague but disturbing aches and pains, faintness (or even actual fainting spells), fatigue and inertia, severe anxiety attacks, tachycardia, hypotension, poor exercise tolerance, gastrointestinal symptoms such as irritable bowel syndrome, sweating, dizziness, blurred vision, numbness and tingling, anxiety and (quite understandably), depression  IST is most likely your problem; it is usually treated with SSRI antidepressants and beta or calcium channel blockers.\n\n",

I have experienced pac,pvcs over the years as well as fatigue etc, which I was told is part of a syndrome called MVPS. I know many physicians do not subscribe to this belief. The ISt has been debated.  Many feel the necessary criteria is not met, such as high resting pulse rate of 100 or over plus increase when standing and staying increased. I have neither. Usually my pulse remains in the 70's-80's sitting and standing is the same. These \"episodes\"(they have only begun over the past 7 mths)  I have seem to come on with a gradual feeling of increase in rate and almost a drop in stomach feeling, my cardiologist feels sure I am hyperadregernic and it is anxiety(which I have document anxiety/panic attacks issues for many years off and on), I have been in his care for over 10 years. I have also been under care by an autonomic specialist/center for over 13 years that is who diagnosed me with dysautonomia but mild.

I had an echo done on 3/25/04 also. I have listed the results from both:  The recent echo says: 5/16/05  Diagnosis: PHTN, Mild MR/TR  Everything shows normal with the exception of :  Mitral Valve: trace mitral valve regurgitation is seen  Triscuspid Valve: Mild tricuspid regurgitation is detected  Pulmonic Valve: Pulmonic Valve was not well visualized. Pulmonary Pressure mildly elevated 40 mmhg.   the echo on 3/25/04 says:  Diagnosis CP - I have no clue of what that means  All else is normal except:  Right Ventricle: Is mildly dilated  MItral Valve : mild mitral regurgitation is seen  Tricuspid Valve: Trivial Triscuspid regurgitation is seen  Pulmonary pressure: normal   My question is do I have PH? I am so confused and scared to death. My cardio. is acting so cold about this whole thing and when I ask her what we need to do she finally agreed to do a 2nd echo only because my OB called her. Everything I have read says that PH is deadly to a mother in pregnancy, I am 7 mths pregnant and I have a 13 year old and I am not ready to leave this world. Please advise me on what actions I can take to insure staying alive.   Thank you,  Angie\n\n",

Two times she blackout in the Drs Office. At first her Drs thought it might be her high blood pressure medicine. So they made changes but she continued to blackout. Next the Drs decided to give her a pacemaker which she had implanted a month ago. She blacked out in the hospital while recovering from the pacemaker implant. The Drs thought it might be her high blood pressure so they put her on diuretics. And the past Sunday she blacked out again in Church and had to be resuscitated and rushed to the hospital. She went to her Dr on Monday and he took her off the diuretics now we are waiting to see if that helps. My aunt is really concerned so I am putting this post out to see if any one may have some insight into her problem.\n\n",

Conditions that may cause blackouts/fainting/syncope are sudden drops in heart rate (which if her pacemaker is working properly can be ruled out). Sudden drops in blood pressure,(from changing positions suddenly, etc.) irregular heart rhythms, circulatory disorders (carotid artery blockage etc.) hypoglycemia (low blood sugar levels). Many underlying conditions can cause these episodes. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I was diagnosed with dilated cardiomyopathy/possible tachy related cardiomyopathy, anterior mitral leaflet prolapse with significant mr and refractory fasicular ventricular tachy. I had a echo 10 months ago with ej 33% , end diastolic diameter 6.2 with end systolic 5.2cm. My cardio was going to do a mitral valve repair combined with a vt ablation but decided to try the ablation which i had done in jan this year.Up to now we think this has been a success, i've already had two failed ablations, and i was feeling a lot better than before. Had a echo 4 weeks ago and about a week after began getting symptons of sob with pressure on my chest like someone is sitting on me , dizziness, palpitations, swelling in my hands, night sweats, severe fatigue, no energy, no appetite, cough, nausea. Went to see my cardio yesterday for echo results which he said my heart had gone back to normal size, and pumping normally, ef 55% and moderate leaking valve. When i explained about symptoms ,he sent me for blood tests and ecg. Ecg was normal.He now wants to do 24 houe tape to rule out tachy, if no tachy he will consentrate on the leak and may do a tee echo. W ould a tee echo show anything differant to a normal echo.?  Am I a candidate for valve repair considering the heart is almost back to normal?  I have lived with these symptoms on and off now for 7 years and I just want to feel normal again, i am only 38 and feel so old sometimes. Why am I feeling like this still if my heart is working normally?        Thank you for any advice you can give.   I am currently taking Nexium 80mg, effexor 150mg, bisoprolo 2.5mg and irbesartan 75mg.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Arabmare,  Your heart function has improved a lot, even to the lower normal range, there is no doubt about that.   Your symptoms are probably suggestive of still having tachycardia. i agree with your doctor to have the 24 hours heart monitor, if it does not show anything, my personal inclination is to go ahead and have an electrophysiologic study to see whether or not the tachycardia can be induced and may be have a new ablation if thought to be needed and feasable.  tee shows a lot more information about the heart because the view is much clearer than the regular echo. The most important in your case would be evaluation of the mitral valve leaflets to see whether or not they are repairable. Usually, the posterior leaflet is the one that is repairable in most cases, but will have to wait and see.  In your case, i don't think that you should rush for surgery, i think you can wait and see whether or not your condition is going to improve more as it has already started to and beautifully.

    "content": "I am 38 year old female.  I was borm with congenital ASD and Mitrial valve damage which was repaired when I was 4 years old.    I am not having any symtoms but was recently sent to a cardiologist due to an electrocardiogram performed by my regular doctor.  It has been determined that I will need  surgery again in the near future (Cardiac surgon suggested within 6 months).    Valve repair is possible but most likely it will be replacement.  I have done some reserch on replacement valves but am unsure if it should be a mechanical or biological valve.  What are the best criteria to use for deciding? right now it seems to come down to bio valves wearing out and my needing surgery again when I am around 50 or taking blood thinners forever due to a mechanical valve.  Any insight would be appricated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear klb123,  The major disadvantage of bio-valves is that they degenerate and you will need a redo surgery, no doubt about it. Their major advantage is the lack of need for anti-coagulation. Bioprosthetic valves are usually recommended to young female patients who are planning on getting pregnant and they don't to be subjected to the hassle of anticoagulation during pregnancy.  If you are not planning on getting pregnant, it is up to you to decide which one you want to have. If you are a compliant person who will be closely following the blood tests for anticoagulation, then a mechanical valve is ok for you, if you are not, then a bioprosthetic valve is a better choice. If you don't want to be exposed to the risk of a major open heart surgery after a few years, and the surgery technical wise is going to be more difficult because of the first surgery, then the mechanical valve should be your choice.

    "title": "Aortic reguritation",
    "content": "I am a 45 year old woman.  I'm 5'3 and weigh 175 lbs.  I have three children.  I took fen-phen in 1997 and became pregnant later that year.  After I had my last son I decided to get an echo and be sure I didn't have any heart damage from the medication.  My first echo was done in January of 1999.  Here are my first echo results: Lt. Atrium (End Diastole)  - 3.2 Aortic Root (End Diastole) - 2.8 Rt.  Ventricle (End Diastole) - 1.7 Lt. Ventricle (End Diastole) - 4.0 Lt. Ventricle (End Systole) - 2.7 Interventricular septum (End Diastole) - 1.1 Left Ventricular Posterior Wall (End Diastole) n/a  No structural valvular abnormalities are evident by echocardiographic imaging.  Left ventricular size and contractuality are within normal limits. Regional wall motion abnormalities are not detected. Left ventricular wall thickness appears to be normal. The ejection fraction is estimated as 65-70%.  No abnormality of chamber size or function is noted. There is no pericardian effusion.  CARDIAC  DOPPLER:  Color-flow cardiac doppler mapping as well as pulsed and continuous wave doppler interrogations were performed.  Trival pulmonary insufficiency is a normal variant.  Mild tricuspid regurgitation is a normal variant.  Evidence of significant pulmonary hypertension is not noted.  No other significant flow abnormality is noted.  Conclusion:  No abnormalities noted.  Several of my friends also took this diet drug and they urged me, a couple of years later, to contact a lawyer about the class action lawsuit that was being brought against the drug company.  I did so and I was given another echo in August of 2002.    The second echo results are:  LV EDD - 49 LV ESD - 35 ISV D - 7 LVPW D - 11 RV EDD - 33 AR ROOT - 27 LA 34/36 LA/SI - 46 Ejection Fraction (>60%) 63 Technical quality:  Good LV Function/Wall Motion - WNL Pulmonary Artery Pressure - 26 mmhg  Findings and Conclusions: Mitral Reguritation - None Aortic Reguritation - 32% Moderate Ejection Fraction - greater than 60% Left Atrium - Normal Pulmonary Artery Pressure - Normal Other comments:  Trival TR  I obviously have little idea of what these things mean, but having the aortic reguritation go from \"Mild\" in my first echo to \"Moderate\" in my second is somewhat alarming.   My main questions:  Should I be worried?  Do I need to see a cardiologist and have this condition monitored?   I am the sort of person who can literally make myself sick from worrying about things like this.  I had forgotten about these medical reports until I ran across them a few days ago.  I feel stupid going to my family doctor with this stuff.  Thank you so much in advance for any information you can give me.\n\n",

It should start with moderate and then go to mild and not the opposite. i don't think that the effect of the phen-fen combination can last for 5 years before it starts showing a heart effect.  i suggest that you see a cardiologist regarding your aortic regurgitation to have an opinion regarding the aortic regurgitation.

    "content": "Dear alien3d,  Dry cough is usually caused by irritation of the throat, sinuses or the upper airways. This irritation could be caused by environmental causes. If you complain of dry cough mainly when you are at the work place, may be there is something there that irritates your upper airways causing you to have this cough. If you had acute sinusitis that turned into chronic sinusitis with post nasal drip that causes this cought.  i don't think that cough is related to your mitral valve prolapse or your heart.

The reason behind the valve regurgitation has been postulated to be inflammation of the valves caused by the disease itself.  However, the mitral valve regurge can be caused by ischemia affecting the heart caused by coronary artery problems caused by the disease itself.

I then had a TEE done and my cardiologist says I can wait a little while. However he says its in my near future. (Within 6-12 months) All of this has been very sudden, I have known for about a year that I have not felt quite right. Very tired, chest pains, lots of anxiety, and minimal shortness of breath, I never did go to doctor with any of this, I just contributed it to nearing the end of my 20s and 4 children. My gyno found my heart murmur and said I needed to be checked right away. I am an ex smoker, I do not drink, or use any drugs. I weigh 130 pounds.  Is an EF of 55% low for someone my age? My cardiologist says I have myxomatous degeneration, is this the same thing as MVP? Or is this what caused the MVP?  How common of a finding is myxomatous degeneration in some one my age? How will he determine when to do surgery?               Thank you in advance\n\n",

    "title": "Re: mvp, mitral regurgitation, ef",
    "content": "Dear Momto4,  An ejection fraction of 55% is within the normal range in patients with normal hearts. Mitral regurgitation makes the heart beats stronger, so whenever the heart starts to be \"weaker\" than it is supposed to, this means that the mitral regurgitation started to affect the heart.  Myxometous degeneration is the pathology behind mitral valve prolapse. Degeneration causes the leaflets of the valve to be longer and this causes the prolapse.  Indications for surgery in cases of mitral valve regurgitation are either symptoms or a decrease in the ef% or dilatation of the left ventricle. If you already have an ef% less than 60%, i would encourage you not to wait.  It is better to have mitral valve repair, which is done if the leaflets are repairable and this is determined from the tee. This type of surgery needs surgical expertise. i think it is preferrable in your case because you are young and this type of surgery means that you will not have to receive oral anticoagulation for life.  You don't have to blame yourself over not going to the doctor earlier as the symptoms that you were having, the chest pains, fatigue and anxiety (and could be the shortness of breath) are related to the symptoms of the mitral valve prolapse itself even if you did not have any regurgitation.

    "content": "My father has recently been diagnosed with severe Aortic stenosis.  He has been passing out and experiencing shortness of breath with minimal activity.  He was told that he needed a valve replacement.  While attempting to schedule the valve surgery, his cardiologist changed his opinion stating that my dad had advanced Coronary Artery Disease (CAD) which would be a major risk factor and could cause a heart attack on the table if he underwent traditional or keyhole replacement.  He is currently undergoing EECP for the third time, but the relief he gets from his symptoms is only temporary after each course. My question is, Are there any other alternatives to repair his leaky valve in this case, or is it fact that he has advanced CAD, and therefore,a decreased life expectancy, limiting him from receiving additional treatment options?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Bill,  Once aortic stenosis patients start to be symptomatic, their life expectancy decreases. Coronary disease adds to the complexity of the case, and this means that if the decision to go with surgery is taken, then your dad will have to have a coronary artery bypass surgery which adds to the risk of your dad during surgery.  If your dad lives in a small or medium sized city and this is the limiting factor in your dad having this complex surgery, you can ask to have your dad referred to one of the tertirary medical centers in a big city where more complex cases are taken care of all the time.  The only treatment for aortic stenosis is valve replacement.  You have also to put in consideration what are your dad's wishes regarding his treatment options.

    "content": "Dear Adeel,  i think your doctor might be right.  What do you mean by palpitations? Please, describe what you feel to me. With the holter, when you felt the palpitations, there was a button that you should have pushed, did you push it? What did the holter show then?  To decrease the palpitations in cases of mitral valve prolapse, it is better to always eat small frequent meals especially if you notice the palpitations after meals and have enough rest.  To decrease the palpitations in genenral, no smoking, no alcohol, enough sleep and rest and no caffeine (coffee, tea, pop, etc...).  Also, if not already done, it is recommended to have blood tests for electrolytes and thyroid functions.

Also I get palpitations in the morning when I first wake up.  I always exercise yet I have trouble climbing a large staircase - I feel pressure on my chest and sometimes short of breath when I reach the top.  I thought with all my daily exercise climbing stairs wouldn't be difficult.  Is this a sympton of the aortic stenosis?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "R: Help to interpret echocardiogram",
    "content": "Dear Lucky400,  Aortic stenosis has to be followed on regular basis to watch the progress and see if and when the patient will need surgery.  Your echo shows that the function of your heart has not been affected by the stenosed valve to the extent of having heart failure, you still have an excellent ejection fraction 60-65%.   Still, your left ventricle is becoming stiffer (this is what impaired left ventricular relaxation means) which means that the same amount of blood that the heart receives will make the pressure inside the left ventricle increases which means that there will be back up of blood to the lungs and this is manifested by shortness of breath.  The mitral regurgitation could be related to the thickening of the mitral valve itself.  However, you are having symptoms that can be related to aortic stenosis which are chest pain and shortness of breath.  Indications for surgery include: 1. Patients start to have symptoms such as diziness, losing consciousness, chest pain and shortness of breath.  2. Having a very narrow valve (the echo report never mentioned what is the area of the aortic valve).  At this point, my personal recommendation is to have a stress test with nuclear scan to make sure that the chest pain that you are having is not secondary to angina (coronary disease) and to have a coronary angiogram if it turns out to be due to it. And if bypass is incicated, then the valve replacement will be done at the same time. And if it was negative this most probably means that the symptoms are due to the aortic stenosis, so the next step will be an angiogram in preparation for surgery.  i think that you are headed towards surgery, and i would prefer sooner rather than later,  so i think if your cardiologist is not conservative, he/she will most proabably recommend an angiogram and left heart catheterization and then head for surgery.  Keep me posted on how your appointment turns out.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Mokhtar,  Thank you so much for all you sound advice.  I have seen the cardiologist at Penn twice now and  I am much happier with him than the first doc I saw.  My doctor ordered another echo from Penn - he felt too much was missing from the first one.  I got a more detailed report from the second echo.  I wanted to go over a few things with you.    First this echo gave a aortic valve area where the first one did not.  The valve area is 1.01 cm^2 (Peak grad = 45mmHg, Mean Grad = 26mmHg, LVOT dia+ 1.8cm, LVOT FVI =30 cm, Ao FVI = 75 cm)  It states there is moderately decreased valve excursion during systole and it also says \"There is moderate to severe aortic stenosis\".  The first echo said mild to moderate.  What does decreased valve excursion mean?  This is what it said for the mitral valve: The mitral valve is mildly thickened.  There is moderate mitral regurgitation with multiple jets.  The valve has mild myxomatous degeneration.   I don't know what the above means.  Could you explain this and is this something I should be concerned about.  Can this be fixed when I have the aortic valve replaced or doesn't it need to be fixed.?  Tricuspid valve: The tricuspid valve is normal.  There is moderate to severe tricuspid regurgitation which is centrally directed.  There is moderate pulmonary hypertension (PASP=50mmHg, RAP=14mmHg).   Again, is this something to be concerned about and can I have this fixed at the same time as well or don't I need to fix this?  I am having a heart catherization at Penn on 3/21. My cardiologist says this will tell us more and he said to figure on surgery sooner rather than later.    In your opinion do you think I should curtail my exercise program - walking on treadmill for approx. 30 minutes a day - this is getting harder for me to do so I am going slower with no incline.  I have stopped working in the weight room which I normally do 3 days a week.  Thank you for helping to explain all this to me.    Barb\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Follow up on aortic stenosis",
    "content": "Dear Barbara,  Thank you very much for the update.  Decreased excursion means that the aortic valve is not moving enough. During systole (contraction of the heart), the aortic valve has to open all the way so that the blood in the left ventricle is pumped into the aorta easily, decreased excursion during systole means that it does not open all the way, and this is stenosis. This is just a complex way of saying that you have aortic stenosis and that the cause of this stenosis is the valve itself.  The grades of aortic stenosis according to the area of the valve are: 1. Mild: Valve area more than 1.5 cm2 2. Moderate: Valve area between 1.0 to 1.5 cm2. 3. Severe: Valve area less than 1.0 cm2 4. Critical: Valve area less than 0.75 cm2.  Yours is at the very end of moderate, approaching severe.  The heart has four chambers (2 left and 2 right) and each 2 are separated by a valve (door). There are times where the valves have to be closed and times where the valves have to be open. Mitral regurgitation means that the mitral valve is not closed when it is supposed to, allowing the blood to go from the left ventricle to the left atrium (in a direction in which the blood does not normally go) adding an extra burden on the heart).  In your case, this is caused by some kind of degeneration (myxomatous) of your mitral valve. There are cases where the mitral valve can be repaired without the need to replace it. The only person who can decide this is your doctor as he saw how the valve looked on the echo and if needed, to have a better view and make the best decision, sometimes, a transesophageal echocardiogram is done where the ultrasound (echo) probe is passed through your mouth to the esophagus (the swallowing tube) and the stomach immediately behind the heart which gives a far better view than the regular echo with the bones, muscles, fat and lungs intervening.  Needless to say that there is greater risk in replacing two valves more than in replacing one valve.  Regarding the pulmonary hypertension, in most cases, this is caused by other causes than causes in the right side of the heart itself. It is either caused by lungs problems or left side heart problems (which you have). When the cause is fixed, this should be normallized if it is still in the early stages and reversible.  The heart catheterization is definitely needed and let's wait for the results. Usually, a left heart catheterization is performed (with coronary angiogram if surgery is planned), but in your case, i am not sure whether or not you will have the coronary angiogram, but in stead of beating around the bush and have nuclear stress test and the like, i recommend going for the gold standard especially that you are having chest pain (so, i think that you will most probably have an angiogram with the left heart cath). Also, a right heart catheterization would not be a bad idea as well since you have pulmonary hypertension.   Regarding your exercise, i think it would be more cautious if you stopped exercising for now till everything is sorted out. However, if you want to continue, limit it to a minimum and be aware of the alarming syptoms such as chest pain, dizziness and near syncope. If you experience any of these symptoms, stop immediately.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Diagnostic Summary 1.  Hemodynamics (see above) were significant for an LVEDP of 8mmHg.  There was a peak trans-aortic pressure gradient of 12mmHg and a mean gradient of 10 mmHg.  The calculated aortic valve area using the Gorlin formula was 1.7 cm^2.  2.  Coronary angiography revealed luminal irregularities in a right dominant system. a.  LM:  Luminal irregularties b.  LAD:  Luminal irregularties c.  LCx:  Luminal irregularties d.  RCA:  Luminal irregularties  3.  Left ventriculogram in the RAO projection revealed normal systolic function, ejection fraction of 74% and 1+ mitral regurgitation.  4.  Aortography in the LAO n revealed a mildly enlarged ascending aorta and arch.  The ascending aorta measured 3.9 cm in its widest diameter.  There was no aortic regurgitation.  Final catheterization diagnoses:  1.  Aortic Stenosis 2.  Ascending Aortic Aneurysm 3.  Diffuse Non-Critical Coronary Disease  The doctor in the cath lab said that the valve area is probably somewhere in between the catheterization reading and the echo reading.  Could you explain what  hemodynamics means and what luminal irregularties are?  Also I would love to hear your opinion on whether I should be still considering valve replacement.  The docs in the cath lab would not give an opinion.  Also they said my pulmonary pressure was not nearly as high as it was in the echo, it was 50 in the echo.  Could that go down because I have not been exercising for the last 2 weeks?  Also my ejection fraction went from 60-65% in the echo to 74% in the cath report.  Is that increase dangerous?  I am only 4'11\" and should my small stature be considered when trying to find a baseline for the aneurysm and my ejection fraction?  Thank you so much for all  your help.  Sincerely,  Barb\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Barbara,  Thank you very much for the update.  If your doctor thinks that it is still not the right time for surgery, then i would recommend following your doctor's recommendations.  Hemodynamics are mainly the pressures in the heart and great vessels and the relationship between these pressures and the size of the valves, heart chambers and great vessels.  Luminal refers to the lumen of the artery itself and irrgularity refers to the fact that there isn't any localized blockage in any of the arteries. This means that there is no danger of sudden blockage. So, if you were going to have an aortic valve replacement, there is no need to perform a coronary bypass surgery at the same time.  i don't there is anything to worry about regarding this increase in the ejection fraction and i think it is just the way it was measured.  Pressures on the echo are estimates, but with the cath it is actual measurements, so i would go with the cath measurement rather than the echo.  It is not uncommon to have dilated aorta with aortic stenosis, a condition known as post stenotic dilatation.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear crbrooks,  Having a skipped beat every now and then by no means indicates that you have a heart condition. It is not uncommon for young healthy individuals to have skipped beats from time to time.  A murmur means a noise or a sound, so it can only be detected by listening to the heart and it is caused by turbulance of blood. It does not necessarily mean that you have a diseased heart.  Whether having a murmur is serious or not depends on the underlying cause of the murmur  It is not a bad idea to tell your doctor about having these skipped beats from time to time but i don't think that it is an emergency.

My son is in a camp right now so I do not have immediate access to him or the doctors.  I need to know how serious this is or can be?  Also, what questions should I ask???  He was taking Adderall XR, 30mg's a day.  The doctor said he was stopping this medication until they find out more information.  Could this medication cause this kind of thing?  He his also taking Prozac 10mg, once a day.  The doctor said he would continue this medication.  My son is not taking any drugs.  He is drug tested on a regular basis, a precaution.  My son has not been complaining about shortness of breath, chest pains, tiredness, etc.    ANy information will help.  I am very worried about this.    Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Wolfslolo,  Why did your son have the chest x-ray and the ekg in the first place?  i am not sure exactly what an enlarged valve mean on the chest x-ray. The heart would appear enlarged as a whole on the chest x-ray but specific valve anatomy or morphologies are only well seen on echocardiograms (ultrasound of the heart).  The reason you were told to stop the adderall is the fact it is known to have cardiac side effects, as to the prozac it does not have cardiac side effects.  The best way to discover what is going on with your son's heart is to have an echocardiogram.

    "content": "Thank you Dr. for your time!  39yr F/mom of 3. Dx w/MVP over 12 yrs ago. Over the years echo has shown trace mitral regur. some echos show trace tricuspid and more recently the last echo had trace mitral,, tricuspid  and pulmonic regurg. My report always says suggestive of but does not meet strict diagnositc criteria of MVP. I have been with the same Dr. for 10 yrs. (cardiologist). Originally began seeing him for palpitations which I still have occasionaly over the years, pvc pac. I have done several holters and loop event monitors over the years and have been reassured that they are all benign. During these years I have had 3 normal pregnancies. He routinely does ekg each time I am in his office and usually an echo every 1-2 yrs. I am highly anxious by nature and after the last echo/stress echo, he told me nothing had changed, and then upon my seeing the report I was quite upset by seeing the trace pulmonic regurgitation. He said it means nothing, can be seen in normals, is certainly open to interpretation by person performing the sonogram and reassured me again. I still periodically become anxious thinking about this trace pulmonic reurgitation and prognosis.    Are these findings seen in normals? Are the also influenced by the exercise portion of the test? Would/could findings be different if this were just a \"at rest\" echo? Is this also something that may be seen in this echo but not with the next? Any reassurance is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Gino,  Why did you have the echocardiogram to begin with? Was it for palpitations or for other reasons?  MItral valve prolapse is a fairly common condition and from the description of the echocardiogram, the case is very mild.  You have to be followed every 3-5 years.  You did not mention any mitral regurge or insufficiency on the echocardiogram, so, i will assume that there was none. If there was mitral regurge/insufficiency, you should take antibiotics before any dental work and before some procedures. If there is mitral regurge, you should make sure to tell any doctor you go to about it.  It can not be avoided. It is a congenital condition. Persons are born with it.

Hi Dr. Yasser I did not include anymore other conclusion in the 2d echo because my doctor only concentrate on that part. my doc says i have to go with a 2d echo and go back after the results.so what you mean to the one i post was all normal?    i always had a feeling of being nervous when im on a siiting or standing place. it will just come out and start to get worried but not most of the time (about 3-5 seconds then it will go away).  is this normal with the caffeine in the coffee? some says coffee make someone nervous.  my doctor says i also have some kind of acid (is it hyperacidity or acidic?) every time i eat my lower chest (above belly buttom) hurts. it feels like my food wont digest easily.  ive no longer experiencing palpitation, the last was my second time and that was march 18 and the first i experience it was february 15 and just ignored it.   few months ago last July 2004 ive started drinking coffee and smoking during office break and i admit im lack of exercise and my work job is just sitting infront of a computer doing surfing on the net (thats only my job for the newspaper) after my work i don't sleep early, just watch DVD movies until past midnight.   maybe this was the caused of having palpitation and being stress everyday..    thanks for the time reading this.  godbless\n\n",

    "title": "Can mitral valve prolapse go away?",
    "content": "At the age of 13 I was diagnosed with Mitral valve prolapse after a heart catherization.  I had had a heart murmur since birth and the pediatrician felt my heart sounded a bit hyperactive at my annual physical so he referred me to a cardiologist.  The cardiologist did an EKG and echo and from the sounds of my heart suspected that i might have a hole in my heart.  He did a heart catherization and found no hole, but MVP.  I have had no symptoms, yet have followed up with a cardiologist every 3 years as recommended and take antibiotics when going to the dentist.  Over the years it has been described mostly as without insufficiency or with very slight insufficiency.    I am now 33 years old.  Several years ago when I saw the cardiologist he said he could barely detect the MVP and would almost recommend that I not take the antibiotics, but to go ahead and continue to do so.  My insurance has changed and last week I saw a new cardiologist for my regular followup.  He seemed extremely knowledgeable and in fact had had surgery for MVP himself.  After an EKG and echo, he said he saw no signs of MVP, and that I should not take the antibiotics, and do not need to come back for any followup appointments unless some kind of symptoms appear.  After so many years of being told how important is was to take the antiobiotics, I am a bit uncomfortable just stopping and never going back for a followup, but I certainly don't want to take unnecessary antibiotics either.  Can MVP go away, even if it was detected by a heart catherization?   Any advice you can provide would be appreciated.  Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can mitral valve prolapse go away?",
    "content": "Dear Puravida,  Everything is possible, but i never heard of mitral valve prolapse that went away.   My explanation is that you have very mild mitral valve prolapse and that if the echocardiogram technician that did your last echocardiography was less experienced then it is a possibility that he missed your very mild prolapse. Another possibility is that sometimes if the patient is dehydrated, the prolapse sometimes is not detected.  Antibiotic prophylaxis is given to patients who have mitral regurge (whether detected by physical examination or by echo), if you don't have mitral regurge then no need for antibiotic prophylaxis.   Not being seen again by a cardiologist means that your condition doesn't need to be followed up by a specialist but does not mean that you should not be followed up by any doctor. So, i suggest that you be followed up by your primary care provider or family doctor, an echocardiogram every 3 years is not unreasonable or as often as your primary care physician sees fit.

    "title": "Re: Splinter Hemorrhage",
    "content": "Dear Buckeye,  What do you mean by your blood work was positive for strep infection? Did you have a blood culture or you had the antistreptolysin-o titer?  If a blood culture was positive, then you have to have an echocardiogram to rule out infective endocarditis (infection and inflammation of the valves of the heart).  If it was positive antistreptolysin-o titer, this means that you had a streptococcal infection at some point in the recent past (and the infection is most probably already gone), the titer increases within 2 weeks and then goes down.   Splinter hemorrhages can be caused by embolism (which necessitates looking for sources of emboli by excluding infective endocarditis) or inflammation of the blood vessels.  In your case, the cause could be the reaction that your body had to the streptococcal infection. The streptococcal infection contains strange proteins (antigens) to which the body forms antibodies and if the reaction between the antigens and the anibodies get out of the body's control, inflammation and destruction of some of the tissues of the body (including small blood vessels) may happen. Other tissues of the body that might be affected include the heart (in the form of a disease known as rheumatic fever) and the kidney (in the form of inflammation).  So, i suggest that you have a urine analysis and a kidney function test as well as an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) to make sure that your heart was not affected by this inflammation as well.

A year and one half ago I went for a physical and came out diagnosed with MVP with trace regurgitation.  An ECG was done to confirm the initial diagnosis.   My quandry is that ever since, I have been told that I must take prophalactice anti- biotics to have dental work donei.  I do not want to take Anti-biotics unless I absolutely have to.  In my 20's I took 3 courses within one year and it took me 5 years to get my body yeast free/painfree and balanced again.  I suffered with ongoing yeast problems/vaginal infections.... and I never want to go through that again. I never took anti-biotics since and I am doing great.  I get through colds and illnesses without them......My question is this.  Do I have to take them for dental work if I only have trace regurgitation......and why all of a sudden, since I have this diagnosis which is symptom free.....must I take antibiotics for teeth cleaning at the dentist when I never did before.....for 40 years.    I have read a little on the subject and there seems to be conflicting points of view on the ammount of regurgitation that thus requires taking anti-biotics for dental cleaning and scaling.  I look forward to your reply.  Honor Murphy [/i]\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Pink50,  Any degree of mitral regurge warrants prophylaxis for bacterial endocarditis. MItral valve prolpase with mitral regurgitation is a moderate risk for developing bacterial endocarditis.  Regarding dental procedures, if the procedure carries any chance of bleeding (does not make a difference how small the risk is), the patient should receive prophylaxis. Bleeding means that there is an open blood vessel in the mouth cavity (that contains bacteria) and that bacteria can go from the mouth cavity through this open blood vessel to the blood stream to the mitral valve and cause infective endocarditis.  It is a good thing that you did not get infective endocarditis all these years, so i think it is a good thing that you started taking them.  You are at moderate risk of developing infective endocarditis, so, if you need to have any procedure that involves the risk of bactermia, you should receive prophylaxis.

    "content": "I was diagnosed with MVP when I was 9 years old. For the most part, I have not had any \"symptons\". I am now 26 and have been experiencing \"panic attacks\" for the past few years. I went to the Dentist to discuss having my wisdom teeth removed and he refered my to an oral surgeon. Well, i was a little nervous because I didn't know if they were going to pull my teeth that day or not. Well, when the nurse took my blood pressure, she had a strange look on her face. She said that she thought that it was an incorrect reading. She took it again and told me that she wanted to use another machine because there was no way someone as young as me could have high blood pressure. It was 165/95. Well, now I was really scared! When they took it the last time, the room was filled with nurses, and as the results came up, everyone had a long face, including my husband. They asked him not to tell me what the reading was and that I need to see a Doctor right away. The Oral Surgeon wrote the reading on a piece of paper and sealed it in a n envelope and instructed me to give this to the Doctor that I see. Okay by now I am so scared and my poor husband was trying to keep me calm. I just had to know the reading, so he gave in and told me that it was 175/103. To make a long story short, I went to the Doctor, he gave me some blood test. The results were back with in a few days. He said that everything came back normal except my blood count was 199 which meant I was Diabetic. He conducted more blood test to see what my blood count average was over the past 3 month. The results came back to show that I did not have Diabetes! Durring the wait time, he asked that I buy a blood pressure machine and to report back to him what it was. Well, It was very normal when I took it at home 118/72. So his opinion was that I have \" White coat Syndrome\".   After all of that, I find myself worried all of the time about my blood pressure, heart rate etc. My heart races a lot, and I sometimes have palpetations. I know that I should go to see a Cardioligist, but I am scared. I know that when I go, I will be nervous and maybe give an inaccurate reading, or that they might dismiss it as just \"white coat syndrome\" and there really could be a problem. Please give me your advise\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Gemini1978,  There is a well known entity of patients who develop hypertension only when they are at the doctor's office and this is called white coat hypertension.  Stress and worry elevates heart rate and blood pressure because of activation of the sympathetic nervous system which causes increase in the adrenaline in the body leading to the feeling of apprehension, having increased blood pressure, heart rate and blood sugar among many other actions.  When you have high blood pressure at the doctor's office and normal blood pressure readings at your house (and assuming that both your blood pressure machine and the one at the doctors's office are correct), this is a case of white coat hypertension and when someone tells you so, he/she is not dismissing you as just a case of white coat hypertension because this is a true entity.  Having a random blood sugar reading of 199 is not diagnostic of diabetes and a three months average blood sugar test is not used either to diagnose or rule out diabetes. A fasting blood sugar is the test used.  The palpitations and the racing of the heart that you have is most probably related to your mitral valve prolpase if not due to stress. If they are really bothering you, you can see either your primary care physician or a cardiologist and there are medications that can be given to treat these palpitations.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "well it has been a long 18 months since the birth of my 5th child. I had a horrible staff infection that went undetected since I had never had a c-section before I thought the pain was just normal until gangreen set in! I now after several attacks have had an angiogram confirm that I have dialted and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and the onlt treatmant I am receiving is Benicar. I do alright most of the time but I get sooooo tired and I have 5 children, 11,10,7,4,and 18 mo . Is there anything I can do short of wait to see how fast I am going to die by seeing how fast it is progressing? I am only 39. I also have been having bleeding in my urine and frequent urination as many as 50 to 60 times in 24 hours. They give me antibiotics and it is better for awhile but not for long. I am now having these red swollen knots in the veins in my feet and they are painful they come and go every few days, but I am getting tired of being poked and prodded just to be told this is real bad but there isn't much we can do. I am dealing with a reakl small town and am considering going elsewhere. But I have always had insurance until last July when my husband lost his job because I had had too much illness. I was on heparin all during the pregnancy too if that makes a difference. I would just like to know if there is hope out there short of a heart transplant or not? I was not great but I was never like this til the staff infection, but they did not expect me to live and 1 lady who was given one the same day died . There were 6 people given staff that same day. It was unfortunate but that is a risk of surgery. That is why I believe woman should be warned very strongly about elective surgeries. Mine was no choice he was breech 10lbs 10 oz. and 3 weekx early. Anyway if anyone can help please do . By the way I have some strange autoimmune thing going too but first the heart!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Momommy,  What kind of attacks were you referring to before you had the angiogram? What is your current ejection fraction (the strength with which your heart contracts)? When were you diagnosed and how often do you see your doctor or have a follow-up echocardiograms? What did the doctors say the cause of the hypertrophic and/or the dilated cardiomyopathy was?  The ultimate treatment for patients with end stage heart failure is a heart transplant.  Regarding the bleeding in your urine, benicar in rare cases, causes bleeding in the urine and in very rare cases urinary tract infections, i would recommend that you ask your doctor if he thinks that this is the cause of the bleeding and the infection and if he thinks it is then switch to another medication.   If the infection is not responding to the empiric antibiotics that you were prescribed, i recommend that you have a urine analysis and a urine culture and sensitivity test to find out what kind of bacteria you have and be given the appropriate antibiotic.  The severe fatigue that you have could be related to you not using your cpap or bipap mask since you have sleep apnea and could be related to your heart condition of course or just from too much work around the house with 5 kids or other causes. i recommend that you have some blood tests to make sure that everything is in order. Please, check your electrolyte levels, a blood picture and blood thyroid function test.  Were you receiving heparin because of your history of blood clot in 1990? What were the circumstances under which you had the blood clot? How many months you took blood thinners after that? Did you receive heparin with each pregnancy afterwards?  To be able to judge the problem that you are describing in the veins of your legs, i have to examine you.  It is always an option to have a second opinion if you are not satisfied with your care.

I try to ignore them, but it doesn't always work so I take 1/2 of a .25 mg xanax and sometimes it works. Lately, I have taken 1 entire .25 mg xanax because I get extremely anxious when my heart starts to palpitate and it kind of works, even though I think my heart still skips beats, I can feel it less. I have had a stress test with nuclear medicine injection and it came out fine - only thing it said was that there was a mild decreasetracer uptake in the anteroseptum on stress images that does not improve on delay images. Sum stress score is 3, sum different score 2. This is within normal limits. Gated wall motion analysis demonstrates normal ventricular size and left ventricular ejection fraction of 63%. No segmental wall motion absnormalities are noted. Then I had an echocardiogram taken in October 2004 and it came back normal except it said that my main pulmonary artery was enlarged, and I don't know what that means when the test say this is normal. Then I had a virtual physical taken and it indicated minimal to mild stenosis and said that the thyroid gland is mildly heterogenous with hypodensity suggesting thyroid disease, hiatel hernia. I am 57 and weigh 137 and like to exercise, but am now afraid to do so because of the palpitations. Can you help - can I continue to exercise even though sometimes, not always, there is mild chest pain which sometimes stays around for a bit after exercise, sometimes not. My palpitations sometimes occur when I'm exercising or walking up the stairs.   Back to top\n\n",

    "content": "Dear MacTavish,  The chest discomfort that you have could be due to the palpitations themselves.  i suggest that you see your doctor to have an ekg and if you were not having the palpitations at the time (which is most probably going to be the case), a 24 hours heart monitor is the next step in my opinion, so that the exact nature of the palpitations is determined.  If you get the palpitations and they last for a while, i would recommend that you either talk to your doctor to be seen immediately or go to the emergency department to have an ekg.  The chest pain that you are having is most probably not related to coronary disease, you had a negative nuclear stress test and a normal echo as well.

When I was 27 I checked myself into a hospital for these symptoms. The doc checked me out and said I was fine but there was something that may need to be looked at. I stayed over night and did the tredmill the next day.. She said that it looked okay but there was just one thing that maybe looked strange and she wanted me to return for another test.. I never went.. I don't have any money or any insurance so I havent been able to go.. I work in a very strssfull job and it seems am generally anxious more and more in the past few years.. As I type this, I feel the pain.. My left hand is aching.. BUT, because of my job I work on a computer all day and my left hand is constantly performing quick-key commands as I am in Editorial... The pains i feel will occasionally cross over to my right side.. but more often it is my left that hurts.  Any ideas? I appreciate all comments.

    "content": "Hello  To determine whether or not chest pain is caused by coronary disease, risk factors for coronary disease and chest pain characteristics are looked at and then the probability of this pain being due to coronary disease is determined.  Your risk factors include you being a male. Your chest pain characteristics sound atypical, so the probabililty of this chest pain being due to coronary disease is very low.  On top you had a stress test which sounds like it was negative even though there was this thing that had to be looked at further. But, there are some information which could help confirming that it was negative such as the time you spent on the treadmill and whether or not you reached your maximum predicted heart rate for your age and why was the test stopped. If you stayed a long time on the treadmill (generally going for more than 6 minutes without stopping the test or having chest pain is usually a good indication), if you reached your predicted heart rate without having chest pain, it is a negative test.  So, most probably, the cause of this chest pain is not coronary disease.  Your chest pain with the other symptoms sound to me more of a neck problem. i suggest that you have a neck -x ray or even a ct scan to exclude neck problems.  This might also be overuse of your muscles and sitting in a non-haelthy way at the office.

    "content": "I am a 50 y/o female with moderate mitral stenosis and 3+ aortic regurg.  Last night I had my first lengthy bout of atrial fibrillation.  My HR was approximately 145, irregular and it lasted 6 hours. Today my cardiologist put me on digitalis to control the ventricular rate the next time it happens.  My question: once this happens, what indication is it for surgery. I had a mitral valvuloplasty in 2003 which only resulted in an increase in the mitral valve of 1.0-1.2.  It also increased the mitral regurg from 1+-2+.  With mitral stenosis, how likely is it that the atrial fib will worsen or become permanent?  My carido says my condition is only moderate, so not an indication for a double valve replacement yet.  Should I consult a surgeon? Thank you, ~fdeg\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mitral stenosis/atrial fibrillation",
    "content": "Dear fdeg,  Atrial fibrillation is one of the known arrhythmias that occur in cases of mitral stenosis because mitral stenosis causes left atrial enlargement and this leads to increase excitability of the atrium and atrial fibrillation.  If the atrium is moderately to severely enlarged, most probably the fibrillation will be back and one of these times it will not go away sometimes even if the patient is on medications and the only solution then is to take blood thinners.  Regarding when to have the surgery for valve replacement, i think that you can always ask for a second opinion. i don't know you that well and i can't judge as when you can have valve replacement. The best person would be your doctor.  In itself, atrial fibrillation is not an indication for valve replacement.   In your case, with a mitral valve area of less than 1.5 cm2, valve replacement is indicated if you have shortness of breath on minimal exertion or if you have sortness of breath at rest.

    "content": "Dear fdeg,  Normal range for heart rate is 60-90. If you have a slow pulse but are asymptomatic, i think that it would be ok, but if you are symptomatic in any way such as shortness of breath on exertion, dizziness, easy fatigability or fainting, then you should inform your doctor about this slow pulse and the symptoms.  A pulse of 40 in your case could mean that you have a normal rhythm that is slow or that you developed atrial fibrillation. In this case (of atrial fibrillation), you could have either fast heart beats but not all of the beats are transmitted to the peripheral pulse (the pulse that is usually felt at the wrist), or you can have slow atrial fibrillation as you are already taking digoxin.  Digoxin can slow the heart rate even if you don't have atrial fibrillation. Please, inform your doctor about this slow heart rate and the lightheadedness. There is no problem if you stop the digoxin till you inform your doctor about this symptom.

    "content": "I am 47, and three days ago I checked my pulse and discovered it missed one bit (pauses for one bit) almost every time I checked it. Today, I went to the doctor (I also have a flu right now) and he said something about a possible lack of magnesium but still agreed on doing ECG. I am still waiting on the results. About 7-8 years ago the doctors discovered a very high cholesterol on tests and after all other tests and procedures I'd done, they confirm a mild systolic dysfunction and hypertention (sometimes high blood pressure, perhaps, once every month or so, which I control with Altace) and not to mentioned again, a high cholesterol (which I control now with Lipitor)   Since I remember myself my pulse has always been on a high side, around 75-80 bits/min when quiet, and can easily go up to 120-140 bits/min after some physical work. This also can cause a headache and with headache it almost always comes a high blood pressure, that drops back to normal in a day or so (usually after a good sleep).  I also have a family history of heart attacks. My father had one in his 60-s and then died from stroke at the age of 69. My grandfather died from heart attack when he was 72.   I am an active person (so far) but I wonder if, perhaps,  my heart needs more attention than just the regular checks with the family doctor. Please advise.  Thank you,  Victor P.S. I forgot to tell you that last year I had a heart ultrasound done (I insisted on it) and my physician did not call me after, meaning there were no immediate concerns.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Victor,  What did your doctor say when he examined your pulse and listened to your heart? Did he mention anything about early beats or extrabeats? The pause that you felt most probabrly is an early beat.  Lack of magnesium can cause early beats.   75-80 beats per minute is not on the high side. It is in the middle of the normal range. Having a pulse of 120-140 after physical work or exercise if very acceptable.  The mild systolic function that you have should be taken care of by taking the altace, which at the same time takes care of your high blood pressure.  i would like to know the results of the echocardiogram (the ultrasound of the heart) before saying whether or not you need to be seen by a cardiologist. But, i don't see a problem that you be seen by a cardiologist at least once and then he/she can decide whether or not your condition needs to be followed up regularly, unless of course the cardiology practice where you live is very busy and need to see only people who really need to be seen. And i think that if your family doctor thought that you need to be seen by a cardiologist, he would have referred you to one.  Keep us updated on the results of the ecg.

    "content": "Dear Leslie,  i don' think you need additional treatment for the tricuspid regurgitation. Worsening tricuspid regurgitation can be related to: 1. Worsening pulmonary hypertension in your case. 2. Right sided heart failure or dilatation for any reason.  You don't have to worry about tricuspid regurge, most of the tricuspid regurge cases are secondary to other causes, so the treatment is treatment of the original disease process.

    "content": "Hi, I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse when I was 17 years old. I am currently 28 years old and about 6 months ago I started to have chest pain and shortness of breath almost every two weeks.  I get about 7 hours of sleep every day but I always feel lightheaded.  I went to see my family doctor and got echocardiogram done. The result was I have mitral regurgitation and pulmonic regurgitation but no mitral valve prolapse. I am not on any medications but would like to find out if my chest pain and shortness of breath is due to my heart condition and is there anything I can do to have these symptoms go away.\n\n",

What did your doctor think about the cause of the shortness of breath after the echo resutls came back?  Chest pain is a well known symptom of mitral valve prolpase. Not having mitral valve prolapse on the echocardiogram does not necessarily mean that you don't have it.

People are always asking my why I am breathing hard.  I have hypothyroidism.    Heart disease runs on my father's side of the family.  One uncle died of a massive heart attack, another uncle has had two close calls with heart attacks, my grandmother had valve replacement and my father has had blockage removed two or three times.    In August 04, my doctor scheduled an echo which showed mild MVP, and arotic valve suffienency.  He put me on blood pressure meds to see if it would help.  I had another echo done in January 05, the results were the same.  The doctor changed my blood pressure medicine and told me to have another echo in three months.  Meanwhile, I am still tired, hurting and now coughing.  The doctor thinks the coughing is coming from the medicine.  I am a Office Manager and when I get home (6-7pm) I only have enough energy to make it to the bed.   I have tried making myself stay up and do house chores but I usually have no strength and run out of  breath fast.  I also have started taking Tai Chi twice a week hoping it will help.  I do good to make it through the warm ups.  I am worried, due to the family history and concerned because I feel I am too young to feel this way.

    "content": "Dear Laurie,  The cough that you are describing is most probably related to your acid reflux disease.  Shortness of breath can be caused by many things, starting with being physically unfit and ending with heart failure and lung failure.  It sounds from what you said that besides having mitral valve prolapse and aortic insufficiency, there were no other abnormalities. This does not exclude the heart as the reason behind your shortness of breath but makes it very low on the list. Mention the worsening in your symptoms to your doctor in the next visit.  Being tired all the time can be related to you not receiving enough synthroid, when was the last time your tsh was checked to make sure you are taking the right dose?

Having shortness of breath in your case can also be related to your blood pressure not being perfectly controlled, so trying to control your blood pressure better might control your shortness of breath especially during exercise.  You never mentioned what kind of medications you take for your blood pressure control, but like the cough could have been related to the blood pressure medications, the feet swelling and the feeling that you are tired all the time can be caused by some of the blood pressure medications as well, mention that to your doctor as well.

    "content": "Thank you for taking my question. I live in a very small town. I have had two recent echocardiograms with Doppler and color flow at one hospital. Also a pulmonary function test at a second hospital: results follow for all three tests. Now I have been advised to have a TEE. Could you give me your impression, from the results of the echos and the PFT, whether this would appear the next step to be taken and why?  1st REPORT November 2004 Echocardiogram with doppler and color flow:  1.Aortic root: normal in size  2.Aortic valve: no evidence of aortic stenosis or aortic insufficiency. Left atrium normal in size.  3.Mitral valve: mild mitral regurgitation. Mitral valve appears to be anatomically normal.  4.Left ventricle: normal in size. Probably normal wall motion not all myocardial segments are optimally visualized. The estimated ejection fraction is 60%.  5.Right ventricle: normal.  6.Right atrium: normal.  7.Tricuspid valve: trace tricuspid regurgitation. Estimated pulmonary artery pressure is 68 mmHg. Moderate pulmonary hypertension.   2ND REPORT January 2005 Echocardiogram with Doppler and color flow:  1.Aortic root normal in diameter.  2.Aortic valve thickened, trileaflet, without restriction. No significant aortic insufficiency. 3.Left atrium normal in size.  4.Mitral valve thickened without restriction. Moderate (2+) mitral regurgitation.  5.Left ventricle normal in size & function. Normal left ventricular systolic function with an ejection fraction of 58% and no wall motion abnormalities.  6.Right ventricle is mildly dilated. There is mild right ventricular hypertrophy. Normal right ventricular function.  7.Right atrium is mildly dilated.  8.Ttricuspid valve thickened without restriction. There is mild (1+) tricuspid regurgitation. The estimated pulmonary artery systolic pressure is 55 mm Hg.  Other findings: no pericardial effusion or intracardiac shunts.  IMPRESSION:  Normal biventricular systolic function. Moderate mitral regurgitation.  Mild tricuspid regurgitation. Mildly dilated and hypertrophied right ventricle.  Moderate pulmonary hypertension.  PFT Conclusion: 1. Mild restrictive ventilatory defect. Question is this is related to the patient's body habitus/obesity ( height 65 inches, weight 134 lbs). Also noteworthy is diagnosis given for complete pulmonary function test - pulmonary hypertension - question findings related to same. Clinical correlation is suggested.  2. Abnormal at rest arterial blood gas and pH determination with evidence of moderate hypoxemia. Patient's PaO2 was 26 mmHg less than that calculated for her age and position.  Once again, thank you.

    "content": "Dear Alice,  Knowing the results of any test and try to figure out the diagnosis of a case is not enough. A history and a physical exam are the most important steps to do as they direct the course of investigations and which tests to do.  Why did you have the echo to begin with? What are the symptoms that you were suffering from?  i think that the tee was requested to look for intracardiac shunts that were not visualized on transthoracic echo, it is not an unreasonable thing to ask.   Pulmonary hypertension can be primary (no cause is found) or secondary (a cause is found). Causes of pulmonary hypertension are various and a work-up (try to find out what is the cause) for pulmonary hypertension does not just include a pulmonary function test but many other tests as well.  Causes of secondary pulmonary hypertension include: 1. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 2. Obstructive sleep apnea.  3. Disorders of the chest wall, such as kyphoscoliosis. 4. Pulmonary embolism. 5. Collagen vascular diseases such as scleroderma and crest syndrome.  6. Other connective tissue disorders such as rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus. 7. Cardiac causes: a. Mitral valvular disease. b. Constrictive pericarditis. c. Left atrial myxoma. d. Aortic stenosis. e. Congestive heart failure and dilated cardiomyopathy. f. Intracardiac shunts.  Your echo did not show any left heart abnormality, still a tee at this point is not unresonable.  i would recommend that you be tested for: 1. Obstructive sleep apnea with a sleep study. 2. Pulmonary embolism. 3. Blood tests for the autoimmune diseases.  i think that you need to be seen by a pulmonologist as soon as possible to be evaluated.

    "content": "Thank you for taking the time to reply. In reply to your questions:   I had the echo when I was admitted to hospital with SOB and very low BP. A first experience of this. I spent 4 nights there where many different tests were performed. One result given on my discharge from hospital was that I had possibly had a vasovagal episode. However, the results of the first echo were only received FIVE days after my discharge, where moderate pulmonary hypertension was indicated and my primary healthcare provider notified me of this. The second echo was asked for after I had seen the area cardialogist a month or so later; likewise the TEE has been recommended.  I had two separate fainting episodes previous to this trip to the ER; these were put down to a gastric flu. The fainting sensation would bring on either vomiting or diarrhoea.   I am waiting for results of tests for autoimmune diseases, and some others that were done at the same time. I also did a stress test, which I seemed to do quite well on, though I only managed 4.56 minutes and arrmythmia with exercise result : Sinus tachycardia. I don't quite understand if that is good or bad!  You referred to kyphoscoliosis. As per notes from my hospital stay 'Thoracic spine demonstrated degenerative changes at T6-7 and T8-9, with upper scoliosis.) Does that have any relevance to kyphoscoliosis?  I am not quite sure what an intracardiac shunt is, and not too much wiser through looking on the net?  I suppose that I am worried that time is passing and I should be seeing a PH specialist, rather than slowly going through these tests.   Thank you again.  Alice\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Alice,  Thank you very much for the update.  Fainting episodes or syncope usually initiate an extensive work-up to try and find out the cause. In many cases, a specific cause is not found.  In your case, i can't really tell what is causing these fainting episodes because i will obviously need more information but to complete the work-up for syncope, if these tests were not done, i would recommend that you do them even though they might turn out negative. A holter monitor (24 hours cardiac monitor) to monitor your heart rhythm for 24 hours. A carotid/vertebral artery doppler. A test called tilt table test (that evaluates your blood pressure response to standing for a long time and how your body handles it). If there is any indication or suspicion that these might be due to seizures, a ct scan of the brain and an eeg are recommended.   Sinus tachycardia during the stress test means that your heart was beating normally but at a faster rate which is what happens to any person who exercises.  The kyphoscoliosis that i referred to is the severe from of the disease that is seen in some patients and can cause restriction of the chest movements.  An intracardiac shunt is an abnormal connection between different chambers of the heart between which there is no normal connection, example include an atrial septal defect, an abnormal connection between the right and left atrium.  You have been going the right way, there is no doubt about that, but i still think that you need to see a pulmonolgist and i would recommend sooner rather than later because most probably if all of the tests you are waiting for come back normal, this is going to be the next step. So, discuss this with your doctor and see what he/she thinks.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,   I have a few questions for all the cardiac pros out there.  Ok, brief history, I was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse in 2002. I initally sought help when I kept having chest pain and was concerned. I saw a cardiologist who did an echo to rule out CAD due to a family history of CAD.  A stress test was also preformed. All came back normal except for one odd finding. I remember when taking the stress test, I would look down at the pulse ox occassionally and it was in the 80's. Once the report came back on the stress test, that was addressed. I was sent for a pulmonary function test (normal) and a CT to rule out a pulmonary embolism (normal). So they kind of threw their hands up and said, 'Well, maybe the pulse ox was not secure, or it was bumped.\" I think he said this since the echo showed a normal heart with a mitral prolapse (with slight regurg) and the lung test were fine too. But....I just do not get why I get chest pain so often. Sometimes I wonder if it is actual angina and there is depleted O2 to part of my heart...if so, wouldn't that coincide with the pulse ox readings? When I am at work, I check my pulse ox \"just to\" and it is always 95+. I just want to know if chest pain that is frequent is typical of MPV. Also, when should I be concerned and get a second opinion?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shelly,  i don't think that you have anything to be worried about.  Chest pain is a very frequent symptom among patients with mitral valve prolapse.  Regarding your oxygen saturation and the pulse oximetry problem, if you had saturations in the 80's during the test while you were exercising, this would have caused you to have severe shortness of breath and to stop exercise and require oxygen.   There is such a test as to test the oxygen saturation while exercising. If you want you can ask your doctor to have one to make sure that everything is ok. A portable pulse oximeter is placed on the finger as it is usually placed and then the patient walks around. The person monitoring the pulse oximeter has to make sure that the signal of the pulse oximeter is always a good signal, the signal i am referring to is the pulse signal. So, if there is no pulse signal or the pulse signal is distorted then the reading of the pulse oximeter is inaccurate.   Reason being is the pulse oximeter does not measure the oxygen saturation of the blood directly but detects pulsatile flow (which is assumed to be the blood passing through the arteries and arterioles) and then detects the wavelength of a certain color that passes through this one pulse and this is because hemoglobin which carries the oxygen is a pigment that has a color. So, this is a crude method of measuring the oxygen saturation in the blood but it is fairly reliable if the pulse is ok and the patient is not a female who let's say has red nail polish on or something that would preclude the detection of the wavelength of the color of hemoglobin.

    "title": "the reason why I had an echo done",
    "content": "Thanks a lot for your reply, doctors.  I have been experiencing some forceful heart beats since July 2004.  Although it is not very frequent, every time it occurs, it is scary.  Sometimes, it is even painful ( I suspect it is PVC).  That is why I saw a cardiologist and had an echo done.  The results shows there is no other abnormalities than the minimal regurgitation.  I was also on a 7-day heart monitor.  Everytime I feel a sympton, I can push the button.  The heart monitor also automatically detects arrhythmia.  My cardiologist told me that there were no significant findings.   But I somehow still don't feel reassured.  Two days ago, I contacted the company that provide the heart monitoring equipment ( the company name is Cardionet) and asked about the detection of PVCs,  they told me that the heart monitor only detects significant events, such as 3 or more PVCs in a row or several PVCs within a 30 minutes period.    I also asked about the event window, they told me that when I push the button, they will go back 40 seconds to examine my EKG.  My feeling is that I may have pushed the button more than 40 seconds after the sympton occured.  That is why I am still worried, I am afraid that there have been arrhythmia that have not been detected.    By the way, I am 28.  Thanks again for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: The reason why i had an echo done",
    "content": "Dear Vivian,  Arrhythmias can have lots of reasons, having extra beats, or early beats have several reasons including:  1. Thyroid gland disease. 2. Electrolyte disturbance. 3. Mitral valve prolapse. 4. Alcohol consumption. 5. Smoking. 6. Consuming too many caffeinated beverages. 7. Stress. 8. Fatigue and not getting enough sleep. 9. Other heart diseases such coronary disease, etc...  So, you have to have a blood test to check your thyroid gland and your electrolytes. An echo is done to rule out mitral valve prolapse. You have to stop smoking, drinking alcohol and caffeinated beverages and try to have enough rest and get enough sleep. These measures although they sound simple usually help a lot of patients get rid of the symptoms.  In the past, treating young healthy patients with no structural heart disease, who had pvcs with anti-arrhythmic medications was what physicians did. But now after a certain study was done and it was found out that lots of young healthy active people who don't complain of anything have pvcs (they knew that by making this cohort of people wear 24 hours cardiac monitors), and they were absolutely normal and they did not have any complaints and they went around doing their regular activities, a decision was made not to treat these people unless the feeling of the arrhythmia really bothers the patient.  In your case, you had a heart monitor and you are afraid that these might be pvcs. You don't have to worry about pvcs. It seems that you are bothered a lot by this feeling. You have two options (assuming that your thyroid is normal, you have normal electrolytes and you stopped doing all the things that you are not supposed to), first (and this might sound a little bit harsh), learn to live with those beats, second is to take medications to suppress these beats. Like you said, you are 28 years old, and it is going to be a little bit too long to take medications (that might have some side effects and cost you money) for an unknown period of time for something that is most probably not going to hurt you. It is your choice and you have to discuss this with your cardiologist to feel more comfortable about your decision whatever it is.

    "content": "Dear Vivian,  Thank you very much for the update.  When one has an early heart beat (comes before its due time), the heart has more time to reach the next beat, what the heart does is receive blood and pump it out. Since the heart is not pumping, then it is receiving blood, and since there is more time available for the heart to receive blood, there is more blood that accumulated in the heart waiting for the next heart beat (to pump the blood out). Since there is an extra amount of blood in the heart, the heart has to pump harder to be able to pump all the extra blood that he received. That is why you feel this forceful heart beat. This is the normal sequence for a patient who has a premature beat.  There are patients who even notice that the beat that precedes the strong heart beat comes earlier than it should have and they express this by saying that they felt a pause before the strong heart beat.

    "content": "Doctor, Hello and thank you for responding.   I was wondering, why would you suggest that I ask my doctor to prescribe antibiotics that do not prolong the qt interval, if I have nothing to worry about?  I thought that certain medications, including some antibiotics were contraindicated ONLY  in  people who have a long qt interval. So, if chances are that I do not have it, would it be ok for me to take any antibiotics prescribed, including those that may cause a prolonged qt interval?  I had bronchitis  about two weeks, my doctor prescribed tripack (which I beleive is erythromycin, similar to Zithromax) I was already feeling better when my doctor prescribed it, so I didnt fill the prescription because I knew that erythromicn was an antibiotic that was known to cause prolonged qt interval. Now,  I'm beginning to feel sick again, a little cough, slight nasal congestion, sneezing and sore throat. So rather than seeing my doctor again, I wanted to fill my tripack prescription and take that. Is this ok, or should I see my doctor again, just in case its not bronchitis again but something else?  One last question, which types of antibiotics do not prolong the qt interval?  are cephalosporins a good alternative? I'd like to know, so that I might educate my doctor, since I'm not sure she knows.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Emmy,  You don't have to worry because like in erythromycin it is quite rare to see qt prolongation but it happens sometimes, but, it you are still so worried about it to the extent that you are not willing to take antibiotics, then at this point ask your doctor to prescribe antibiotics that do not prolong the qt interval (even if this was a rare side effect of the dryg).  Yes, you can take any antibiotic putting in mind that may be this antibiotic has a rare side effect such as prolongation of the qt interval.  i think you should call your doctor to tell him about this set back in your condition before you refill your erythromycin because she might want to to give another antibiotic.  The antibiotics that can cause long qt interval are macrolide group, erythromycin and zithromax and the like. Some antibiotics belonging to a group called fluroquinolones. But once more it is rare to have this side effect. Penicillins and cephalosporins don't have this side effect.  hank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

In October 2003 I had an EKG done  and nothing was found to be wrong.  In October 2004 I was in a car accident where I blacked out.  My vehicle struck a utility pole.  On inmpact I hit the steering wheel with my chest because like a fool I didn't have my seat belt on.  I was wondering if the MVP could have been a cause of me hitting the steering wheel as hard as I did.  The steering coulumn was totally shattered.  They ran all kind of tests on me to rule out seizures.  Everything came back clear.  All they found was the MVP which has been corrected with the use of Tanormin (25mg).  The Neruo doctor still isn't sure what caused me to black out but refuses to even think that I was able to fall asleep within two blocks from my house.  I was exhausted due to waking at 3am and not getting to bed until about midnight every day for work that week prior to my accident.  I have an appointment with my PCP on Friday and was wondering if he should look for all my other EKG's from the previous year to compare them for just in case something was overlooked then and to rule out the fact that it was caused by my accident.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rhon,  Mitral valve prolapse is a congenital heart disease. The mechanism behind it is yet to be determined but it is said that it is caused by weakness in the fibrous tissue which is the supporting tissue of the body.  The diagnosis of mitral valve prolapse can be suscted by clinical examination and be diagnosed by echocardiogram. An ekg can not diagnose mitral valve prolpase and there are no specific signs on the ekg that mitral valve prolapse can cause. So, i don't think that it would be of value if your doctor compared your ekgs.  Tenormin does not correct mitral valve prolapse.  From what you said, i think that you just fell asleep while driving, as simple as that and happens all the time but i think all other conditions that can cause loss of consciousness have to be ruled out first before saying that you just simply fell asleep.

    "content": "Dear Shane,  What did the echocardiogram that you had show your ejection fraction to be? Have you had an exercise stress test as of yet or no?  Have you had a cardiac cath?  i think that from your symptoms, having an enlarged left ventricle and developing mitral regurge that you are headed down the surgery path. If surgery is thought of, personally, i would go ahead with it earlier rather than later.  You are young and you never mentioned whether you are a male or a female, as it makes a difference in the type of valve chosen for surgery.  There are 2 types of valves, metallic and bioprosthetic (also referred to as tissue or pig valve).  The metallic valve lasts way longer than the tissue valve but it requires that you take blood thinners for life and this is not good if you are a female in the child bearing age as everytime you get pregnant you have to switch from warfarin (the most commonly used and the most widely commercially available blood thinner) to heparin injections, reason being that warfarin can cause problems to the baby.  On the other hand, tissue valves don't need blood thinners except for the first 3-6 months after surgery. Their problem is that sometimes, they need to be changed because they degenerate fast.  If you are a male, there might be a problem as well but from a different perspective. If you are an athletic male, it would not be easy for you to receive blood thinners because of the potential of being traumatized and the risk of bleeding. So, either give up sports or have a tissue valve till you decide that you had enough sports or the valve degenerates and needs to be changed. Or, you can decide to have a metallic valve and take the risk of bleeding.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

Regarding the atenolol, it can cause harm to the fetus. If you need medications during pregnancy, there are other beta blockers that are potentially safer to the fetus than atenolol.

    "content": "Dear Joseph,  Does it happen all the time in the same hand or it occurs in both hands.  The reason behind the numbness could be that you sleep on this arm and the nerve gets compressed and you feel the numbness or you sleep over it and the artery carrying the blood to the hand gets compressed as well.  Not getting enough oxygen during sleep caused by not breathing enough is a condition that is underdiagnosed in lots of patients and is called obstructive sleep apnea and occurs mostly in the overweight/obese population. If you snore, someone has witnessed you not breathing for a while during sleep, if you feel tired and sleepy during the day, then i would recommend that you talk to your doctor about being evaluated for sleep apnea.

    "content": "Dr,  I have some questions regarding long qt syndrome. I am 28yr old female with MVP w/ moderate regurgitation and am rather anxious about potentially having this deadly syndrome. So anxious in fact that I refuse to take any medication, including much needed antibiotics to treat infections, for fear it will  induce a prolonged qt interval and cause a Torsade de pointes. I need to get a handle on this, to make sure that I'm not just being paranoid, for no reason.  I can tell you I have no obvious family history of the illness, I can recall one incident in my late teens when I became light headed and was on the verge of passing out (everything around me was starting to fade to black and I felt like I couldnt stand anymore), but I never lost conciousness. This might be explained by the fact that I have had low blood pressure at times. I have had several EKG's in my life, 3 or so during routine physicals and 1 in June 04 with my cardiologist and was never told anything about having this condition. Also, all of these EKG's were done after the near fainting spell, I mentioned above.  I say this because I know that an EKG can sometimes not pick up a Long QT interval, but I figure since I have had several in my life, that if I did have the syndrome one of these ekg's would pick it up, is this right?  Am I being paranoid? I really need to know, because I can't continue to refuse antibiotics for fear of this syndrome.  P.S. Does a Torsade de pointes always cause fainting and or cardiac arrest? or can you have an episode and never know it.  thank you! emmy\n\n",

My echo showed a arotic \"sufficiency\" ( this is how it was written on the report).   I also have a mild MVP.   I suppose my biggest concern is the high risk because of family history.  Is this genetic.  Should I be worried that I too will have to have my valve replaced?  I just feel I am too young to be tired all the time.  I am not over weight.    My second echo showed no changes even though he started me on blood pressure medicine.  I last visit, he changed the blood pressure medicine and in three months I am schedule to have another echo.   If there are still no other changes, what do you think he should do next?  Thanks for listening!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Shortness of breath",
    "content": "Dear Laurie,  Regarding your echo results, mild mitral valve prolapse (and nothing was mentioned about having mitral regurge) usually needs to be followed up. Regarding the aortic insufficiency, was it mild, moderate or severe? What were the dimensions of the left ventricle and what was the ejection fraction (how strong the heart pumps)?  If this was mild aortic insufficiency and the size of the heart is still normal and the heart is still pumping fine then there is no need to worry and you will be getting echocardiograms anyway to follow your mitral valve prolpase. If the size of the heart has increased and/or the ejection fraction has decreased, in this case, you have to be referred to a cardiologist for closer follow-up and further tests if deemed necessary.  The shortness of breath that you are complaining from can be due to your blood pressure getting higher when you exercise and this poses further load on the heart in addition to exercising so, you feel this shortness of breath.  The chest pain is most probably related to the mitral valve prolpase that you have as this is the most common complaint among patients with mitral valve prolapse.  Coronary disease has a very strong relation to family history. If a first degree relative of yours had coronary disease before the age when one is expected to get coronary disease (50 in men and 60 in women), then you are at a greater risk than another patient who does not have this family history. Women in the child bearing age are protected with their hormones against coronary disease unless they have multiple major risk factors for coronary disease that have lasted for years like hypertension, diabetes and smoking.  In your case, you have hypertension, i am not sure about your family history or whether you smoke, drink or what is your cholesterol, ever been checked for diabetes?  You never described your chest pain, what brings it on (if anything), how long does it stay, anything makes it worse, what makes it go away, how does it feel like?  About being tired, this can be due to many things unrelated to your high blood pressure or heart disease, but the thing that comes to my mind is that there are certain medications that treat high blood pressure that make patients feel so tired so if this feeling started after you were started on blood pressure medications, ask your doctor if this medication can cause this feeling. This could be chronic fatigue syndrome and you might want to ask your doctor about it and see if any blood tests are needed.

    "title": "Re: Pulse is pausing",
    "content": "Dear Ken,  What do you mean by pauses? Split second pauses are difficult to distinguish.  If you feel pauses in your pulse, this could be related to early (premature) beats, otherwise known as extra beats.   There is nothing to worry about and if you don't worry about this feeling, then most probably you don't need treatment.  There are many reasons behind those including: 1. Smoking. 2. Drinking too much caffeinated beverages. 3. Thyroid disorders. 4. Heart disorders such as mitral valve prolapse. 5. Electrolyte imbalances. 6. Not getting enough sleep.  7. Stress. 8. Drinking alcohol.  It helps a lot if you can stop any of the above mentioned activities like drinking too much caffeinated beverages like you mentioned in your profile. You are also taking a medication (lisnopril/hctz) that can cause potassium disturbances and a medication (lexapro) that can cause sodium disturbacnces.  If after you stop all the activities that make the symptoms worse and a blood test for electrolytes (potassium and sodium) proves to be normal then a blood test for thyroid hormones is in order, if it comes back normal, then an echocardiogram and/or a Holter monitor (heart monitor) worn for 24 hours.  Like i said, knowing that there is nothing to worry about, if you still feel them and are still worried, then i would suggest that you schedule an appointment to see your doctor. If you are not worried, then you could mention it to your doctor during your next appointment and let him/her check your pulse and see how frequent these pauses are and what needs to done.

    "content": "I am 27 and was diagnosed with mitral valve prolapse a few years ago.  I am currently not on any medication for this.  I have tried to start working out again and get into better shape.  The first time I went to the gym and worked out on the bike and started getting really dizzy.  I stopped and it went away pretty soon.  The second time, about a week or so later, I went jogging and the same thing happened.  Then recently I was jumping on the trampoilne with my kids for a while and got really dizzy.  However, this time it took quite a while to go away. It probably lasted for about an hour or two.  I used to run cross country and I know what it feels like to be out of shape and winded but this was completely different.  I was wondering if it had to do with the MVP.   When I was first diagnosed they said it wouldn't really affect my lifestyle and was nothing to worry about.  I recently moved and currently do not have a cardiologist.  Is this something I need to get looked into?  If it is the MVP, what other things can I expect from this?  How can I go about starting an exercise program?  If anyone could answer these questions for me I would greatly appreciate it!  Thanks, Renae\n\n",

Basically, they do an Echocardiogram, EKG, test for abdominal aneurysms, aortic aneurysms, hardening of the arteries and osteoporsis. Everything came back normal except an abnormal reading on the echocardiogram. They said to see my doctor for further evaluation. From what I gather from the report, it says mild valvular abnormality of the mitral valve and the tricuspid valve. I have asked dr.'s in the past to check out my heart because I would get flutters or an irregular beat every once in a while, but none would go further than doing an EKG, and when that turned out normal, they said no further testing was needed. I don't know how long I have had this and what it means or how I got it. What am I in for? Can anyone help. I would also like to add that I have been under extreme stress for the past 3 years. I was just getting back to normal and now I hear this news. Can stress cause this? Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I guess it really depends on who did the echocardiogram.   It really needs a doctor to interpret the results.   The full echo report should show more information like how your valves look/and the amount of insufficiency (if noted)   It sounds like they found mild regurgitation of both valves (and again is pretty normal unless the valves/chambers show otherwise)   It's important to have a doctor get the full echo or have them send you the full echocardiogram results-- what you are seeing is most likely not the complete report.   Also on the note of EKG's (and I'm no doctor so this is just my opinion) they will often misinterpret information and the echocardiogram will confirm/deny those results.   A possibility is the echo showed this was denied, hence they crossed it out on the EKG.  Anyways the reason I'm replying is because I was really worried about my echo results at one time.   It listed trivial regurgitation of my aortic/mitral and mild on my tricuspid... however the rest of my echo was fine (normal chambers/valves) so they said this is just something that happens in normal people (and newer echos are very sensitive in this finding)      I would still have a doctor interpret your full echo or have a serial echo done to verify what they are talking about as it is quite vague.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kaka,  i completely agree with what Mike said. Most probably there is nothing to worry about.   If this was mild or trivial regurgitation and as found on the echo (there was no other abnormality found, this means that it is not affecting the heart in any matter. So, there is nothing to worry about.  If this was stenosis (narrowing of the valve), it is still not affecting the heart and it takes a long time to affect the heart as well.  In either case, i don't think that this is an emergency and that you need to run to the doctor right away, i think that this could wait till june till you have your health insurance, but the first thing you have to do, is to get this report verified by a doctor.  If you are really worried and you want to be seen by a doctor, i think that there are free clinics in many of the medium sized towns now to provide health care for people who can not afford it. These clinics are usually affiliated with non-profit organizations such as hospitals affiliated with religious organizations such as churches. i think it is worth a trial to look around for one where you live.  About the thing that you could not figure out on the echo report that followed ejection fraction, most probably, this is the percentage \"%\" sign as in 62%.  About the ekg, computerized machines work according to a mathematical algorithm, many times, it works, many times, it does not. The machine does not put into consideration the other factors that should be considered when an ekg is reviewed. That's why, a doctor has to oversee the report of the machine and then either agrees or disagrees to it. In your case, obviously, whoever reviewed the ekg did not agree with what the ekg machine offered as interpretation.

    "content": "Dear Ashley,  i don't think that there is something to worry about.  Numbmess usually means irritation (and/or destruction) of nerves. Since the distribution that you are describing is not consistent with the distribution of a particular nerve or to the pattern usually followed by nerves when they are affected by any factor that would cause their destruction, i think that this is something not to worry about.  At your next doctor visit, if you still having these symptoms, i suggest that you mention it to your doctor.  If you are worried about these symptoms being stroke symptoms, stroke usually affects half of the body at once, meaning that you would have felt the numbness all over the left side of your body at the same time.

    "content": "Doctor,  Well, I had my colonoscopy done on Friday and all went well.  My doctor adopted the better safe than sorry approach and gave me antibiotics before the procedure anyway.  Only she didn't administer them 30 minutes before had, as is the norm, but just before the procedure using an IV.  I was told I had hemmorhoids and nothing more.  However, now I'm feeling a little fearful of endoacrditis because I've been feeling tired and cold these last couple of days, also I've noticed a red bloch on the palm of my hand a few days ago (Janeway lesion???)  although I confess this may have been there even before the procedure, I'm so nervous, I can't really remember. How long does it take for endocarditis to manifest symptoms? and what are the tell tale signs, one is infected?  I'm not sure if I'm just being paranoid or what.  Before I knew I had MVP w/ moderate reg. I'd gone to the dentist and even had my wisdom tooth pulled without a problem.  Also, I'm confused about how one could contract endocarditis from a colonoscopy? If the reason is that polpys can be removed during the procedure and provide an enterance for bacteria, can't the same be said for people like me who have hemmorhoids?  Please help me put this into perspective.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Endocarditis fear!",
    "content": "Dear Emmylala2003,  Thank you very much for the update.  First of all, colonoscopy with or without a biopsy or a polyp removal is not of the procedures that produce high degree bacteremia incriminated in the etiology of infective endocrditis such as dental extraction for example. That is why it is not recommended that patients at risk for endocarditis receive antibiotics routinely before this procedure.  i don't think that there is a problem if you had the antibiotic just before the procedure as opposed to 30 minutes before the procedure.  i don't think that there is any relation between hemorrhoids and endocarditis unless hemorrhoids get infected and the infection spreads into the blood stream.  There is an incubation of less than 2 weeks in most of the cases between the procedure that caused bactermia and the begining of endocarditis.  Symptoms of endocarditis include fever, chills, loss of appetite, malaise, fatigue, weight loss and night sweats but all of these symptoms are non-specific.   Signs include skin manifestations (such as the Janeway nodules that you referred to which are thought to be due to embolization to the skin), embolic manifestations to major organs such as the brain, enlarged spleen and development of kidney failure. Heart signs include the development of a new murmur or the change in the characterisitics of an old murmur is a very strong indication of endocarditis but don't occur that frequently.  If you are worried, please, start charting your temperature and if at any time you start to develop a fever, call your doctor immediately. If you want to call your doctor now to make him/her aware of what you are thinking, go ahead and do it.

I guess what I was looking for, more than anything, was the likelihood that this procedure could cause endocarditis and if so, would it manifest itself 2 or 3 days after the procedure.  Based on the information you've given me, and the information I have provided you with, it seems that the liklihood of infection from the colonoscopy is very small and that it might be too soon to be exhibiting symptoms, given the fact that the procedure was done only 3 days prior to the start of these symptoms I've described.  Would that be a fair assumption? Also, would it be reasonable to suggest that I wait and seem what happens, and should I develop any further symptoms like fever, weight loss etc... make arrangements to see my doctor?  Lastly, how is endocarditis diagnosed?  Blood test? Culture? TTE?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Emmylala2003,  Thank you very much for the update.  i think the likelihood of these symptoms being endocarditis are very small. First, because colonoscopy usually is not associated with bacteremia. Second, because even though it was not recommended to receive antibiotics for colonoscopy, you were treated as if this was a high risk procedure and you received antibiotics. Third, the symptoms that you are experiencing now are non-specific and are not suggestive of endocarditis.  Diagnosis of endocarditis depends on proving that the endocardium is infected during a clinical context that is supicious of endocarditis. In addition to the clinical context (example patient who had a tooth extraction and has a diseased valve or an artificial valve and starts to have fever), symptoms and signs and then blood tests such as postive blood cultures  (even though in some cases of endocarditis blood cultures are negative) are very helpful. To confirm the diagnosis a transthoracic echocardiogram is done, if it is positive well and good, if negative and there is strong suspicion for endocarditis, a transesophageal echocardiography is done. If the suspicion for endocarditis is low, another diagnosis is to be considered.  If you want to talk to your doctor now about your thoughts, go ahead and talk to him/her and you don't have to go in to be seen now. If you don't want to talk to your doctor, watch your temperature and if you develop fever, call your doctor immediately.

    "content": "Dear Emmylala2003,  Thank you very much for the update.  When a person is considered for prophylaxis against infective endocarditis, two things are looked at:  1. The risk of the patient to develop endocarditis in comparison to the normal population. 2. The procedure that is to be done and whether or not it can bacteremia (bacteria goes to the blood).  In your case, with your history of mitral valve prolapse with mitral regurge, you are a moderate risk and according to the general guidelines, you should always be considered to receive antibiotics before procedures that can cause bacteremia.  Colonoscopy is not one of these procedures.   So, it is not recommended for you to take antibiotics before a colonoscopy.  As regards to whether or not you should have the colonoscopy while you might have a residual or active ear infection, this is a question that has to be asked to the gastro-enterologist who is going to do the colonoscopy.

    "content": "Dear Emmylala2003,  It is unpredictable whether or not and how much mitral regurgitation with mitral valva prolpase may progress. The only way to find out is follow up.  Pregnancy, no doubt, poses a big burden on all the organs of the body including the circulation and the heart. The maximum load on the heart is around the 26-28th week of pregnancy.   You did not mention what was your ejection fraction and what were the dimensions of the left ventricle and left atrium on the echocardiogram. If both were normal, this means that your heart function is normal and your heart has not been affected by the mitral regurge yet. If your left ventricle was dilated anc the ejection fraction was normal, this means that your heart is starting to be affected by the mitral regurge and still your heart function is normal. If your left ventricle is dilated and the ejection fraction is low then your heart function has been affected as well.  How does this translate to your case?  1. If your heart function is normal then there is no need to be worried and you can go ahead and get pregnant but you will have to be followed by your cardiologist closely, so if you live a small town ir far away from where your cardiologist is, it might be a problem towards the end of your pregnancy because you will have to see him more often. Patients who have mitral regurgitation usually tolerate pregnancy well. 2. If your heart function was abnormal, it is not impossible to get pregnant but you will have to be followed very frequently and may be hospitalized towards the end of your pregnancy to be followed up more closely.  About you needing surgery during pregnancy for mitral valve, you have to be elvaluated before conception and if you are thought to need surgery for mitral valve repair or replacement, then it should be done before pregnancy.   From what you said, your cardiologist does not seem to be impressed by your mitral valve condition, otherwise, i believe, she would have taken further steps for better evaluating your condition and making sure that you are going to tolerate pregnancy well without any problems.  Of course you don't have to get pregnant right away, you can always wait for a year or so and see how your mitral valve prolapse and regurgitation both progress and then make your decision.  If you still have more concerns or questions, please don't hesitate to post them.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "Re: Mitral valve regurge",
    "content": "Dear Saphire23,  There is no relation between pcos and mitral regurge.  How was your mitral regurge discovered?  Mitral regurge means that the mitral valve, the door between the left atrium and the left ventricle, does not close 100% when it should. The blood normally flows from the left atrium through the mitral valve (which is open at this point) to the left ventricle during the phase of filling of the left ventricle. The mitral valve then closes and the heart contracts to pump the blood out of the left ventricle through the aortic valve to the whole body. If the mitral valve does not close during this phase of contraction, blood, in addition to going out through the aortic valve, goes back to the left atrium through the shouldn't have been now open mitral valve. This is mitral regurge.   What are its consequences? If it was of hemodynamic significance, i.e. the amount of blood abnormally going back through the mitral valve is quite a bit, then on the long run it might lead to increase in the size of the heart and ultimately heart failure.  According to the reason behind the mitral regurge and whether or not you have symptoms, you will have to be followed up by a cardiologist or at least have an echocardiogram on a yearly basis.  Sometimes, any valve (mitral, aortic) regurgitation, when an echocardiogram is done for any reason, it is discovered by chance that it has mild or minimal regurgitation which is hemodynamically insignificant with no effect on the heart and it was just discovered and this discovery makes the patient very anxious, when in fact there is nothing to worry about.

I will take your advice and get an echocardiogram every year though. Thank you again!   To the woman with pcos and mvr. I have had pcos since I was 17 but I failed to be diagnosed with it until I was almost 24(this year). It was with my pushing for the tests that I was diagnosed. Unfourtunalty and fourtunatly I am fairly well versed in pcos. I have most of the symptoms of PCOS as well. I however am not trying to get pregnant. Loosing weight on the other hand I am trying. It is extremly difficult. Best of luck to you. I have an aunt that is going through the same troubles you are. It may be a very difficult road but anything worth doing is worth all the trouble to get it done!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chalotta,  Was any blood work done when you started complaining of this strange chest feeling? The blood work that is recommended in this setting is to check the electrolytes in the blood and thyroid functions.  As regards to sudden cardiac death, please refer to the american heart association website where their scientific position on sudden cardiac death is explained in a very clear and simple way.  As you are going to see, sudden cardiac death is caused in over 90%  of cases by coronary disease. Being a female in the child bearing age period virtually protects you (as a female) from having coronary disease (unless you have risk factors for it such as smoking, diabetes, hypertension, high cholesterol, etc...)  i don't think that you have arrhythmias (abnormal heart beats) since you had multiple ekgs and Holters which were normal. i think that this is related to the twitches that you have been having. i think that you should seek medical attention to find out what is behind these twitches.

I was sitting on the couch watching the television and I placed my hand up to my chest just to check the rhythm. I could have sworn that I felt a series of beats that were coming in runs of 4? I immediately panicked and started to get lightheaded. I asked the person that I was with to please take me to the emergency room because I felt very tired and sleepy and like I wanted to faint. The whole time that I was driving my car to ER, I kept rolling down the windows to calm myself down. There was no particular reason for me to feel my chest before I panicked, I just thougth I would check it out. It lasted for about  1-2 minuites before I started to feel lightheaded. Once in the ER, they performed the EKG and the Doc said that my heart rate was a little high, which I could understand because I was scared and shaking.  He also told me the I have Sinus Tachycardia and Anxiety reaction with hyperventilation. I have been under a lot of stress this past week with the break-up of my my fiance and I. Since my last letter, my Doctor has done blood work to check my thyroids and my electrolytes, but they were normal. She did tell me that my hemoglobin was very low and prescribed FE SOL for my anemia. I am just so worried that they will never be able to catch on of these things to see what it is. The ER diagnosed me with P.A.T. The serious causes of  P.A.T is heart valve or thyroid related. I am so confused and scared. I am afraid to be alone or to go places alone. He also prescribed Xanax for the anxiety, which I know that I have a problem with. Should I be worried about the presumed feelings of the heartbeats in runs of more than 3? Please help\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Chalotta,   i don't think that it is a good idea to check your pulse, or your chest for any rhythm abnormality as long as you don't feel any abnormal heart beats (without feeling with your chest with your hand).  How about the twitches that you used to have? Are you still having them?  i can't personally say whether what you felt was genuine arrhythmia or not, but it looks that you made yourself have a panic attack.  If you were previously diagnosed with p.a.t., and there was no obvious cause to it, like too much caffeine, smoking, alcohol, lack of sleep, anxiety and stress, and all the blood work (like electrolytes and thyroid functions) came back normal, i think the best thing to do at this point is to have an echocardiogram (unless you already had one) to rule out valvular disease and if this comes back normal, i think you should be seen by an electrophysiologist, a cardiologist specialized in arrhythmias.  Regarding whether or not you should be concerned when you feel the runs of 3 beats, my personal opinion is to keep a diary of what you were doing, whether they went on (the beats in 3) to be more and faster, whether you had any lightheadedness during the episodes or not. But this will make you more aware of a most probably minor problem and you might exaggerate. The second thing is to seek medical advice if you start having chest pain, if you think you are about to lose consciousness or develop shortness of breath (which can also be symptoms of a panic attack as well) and sometimes it is hard to differentiate. i know what i am going to say is difficult to do, but do not convince yourself that there is something wrong if you are not sure what is going on, just calm down and wait and see.  i think the circumstances that you are passing through right now is not helping but once they are over, it is going to be much easier.

I am still having the twitches all over my body. They seem to come and go and some days they are a lot worse than they are on other days. How would my doctor be able to determine if I have some sort of valvular disease? Is it hereditary? I was diagnosed by the physician in ER (who specialized in infectious diseases) as having PAT's.

They are usually caused by either trauma or small emboli that occlude the small capillaries under the nail.  i can not say for sure that what you are suffering from is splinter hemorrhages because i did not see it.  i think your friend is referring to endocarditis (inflammation of the heart's valves) i don't think that you have this condition as if you had it you would have been much much sicker than you sound right now. This is one cause of embolization. Another cause of embolization (or blocking of the blood vessel) is inflammation of the blood vessel itself, a condition known as vasculitis.  Your doctor will see what you are referring to as splinter hemorrhages (if you still have them) and he will give the correct advice on what to do next.

    "content": "Dear jmurd43,  A murmur is basically a noise. Murmurs are heard when there is turbulance of flow across a heart valve.  It could be because the blood is moving faster across a normal heart and this can happen in cases of anemia, fever or hyperfunction of the thyroid gland. This is known as flow murmur. Usually heard at the pulmonary valve.  It could be because the heart is moving across a diseased valve, whether it is narrower or wider than normal.  There are certain characteristics, if present in a murmur, it is not an innocnet murmur. These are usually known to physicians.  If you have any new symptoms, like shortness of breat, i think it would be justifiable to have an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) done to take a look at the valves.   If the echocardiogram is done and you are found to have a valve lesion, then it is important to always tell your dentist (and other doctors as well) about this so that you be given antibiotics before any procedure.

    "content": "Dear Perrydm,  It looks like you already did your homework and even may be made up your mind.  The Ross procedure is a good alternative for the 2 most commonly done surgeries for aortic valve replacement.   You don't look like you have a contraindication for the procedure from what you mentioned. This is assuming that your heart function is good, that you don't have coronary disease and you have isolated aortic valve disease.  Technically, it is a very demanding procedure, it should only be done only by a well experienced surgeon. Its complications are not that different from those of mechanical or bioprosthetic valves surgeries.  The duration of the pulmonary autograft is great with the need to re-operate being rare.  It has a huge advantage over mechanical valves (the ones that last longer than bioprosthetic ones) is that there is no need to take blood thinners (coumadin). So, it is mostly used in young patients, children and very active patients like athletes who want to pursue their athletic carrier.  Everything has its advantages and disadvantages. You have to discuss these with your doctor in depth and know what are the potential side effects for each and then decide for yourself which procedure you want to have.

    "title": "PDA / Issues later in life?",
    "content": "I am 35 years old; I was diagnosed with PDA at 13 years. I had surgical correction and for the most part have been a healthy adult since my heart surgery. As a child I was a failure to thrive, I did not grow, I did not learn very well, and was sick with some form of infection most of my life until surgery. At the time of surgery I weighed around 72 pounds. My question is can these things cause problems later?  I now have a serious case of osteo-arthritis in my feet. It is so bad that I have already had to have joint fusion on my right foot. And will most likely have to have similar surgeries in the future. My doctors can't seem to find a reason for this at my age. I have not had any trauma that would have caused this, and they have ruled out rheumatoid. I have also had every metabolic test known to exist with everything normal. I have seen metabolic bone specialist as well as orthopedic surgeons and rheumatoid specialist. No one has been able to explain why I have this. My theory is that in my first thirteen years I simply did not develop an adequate amount of cartilage. Especially in my feet where I had very little circulation the first part of my life.  My PDA was pretty severe, I was told that only 40% of my body\u2019s blood circulated. That 60% simply went around in a circle never leaving my heart. I was weak, short of breath, blue around the mouth, and had started puffing up around my ankles and face when they finally diagnosed me. I have also had periodic bouts of chest pain and irregular heart beats throughout my life since the surgery.  Usually at night when I am drifting off to sleep. My doctor says this is just stress, but I don't consider myself as someone who is stressed out. So this has always concerned me a little. Is there anything I should watch for or problems that can come out of having PDA for so long? Any advice or input you have for me will be much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nightstarsmom,  Patients with mitral valve prolapse usually have an inciduous course of developing mitral valve regurge.  If you are referring to acute mitral valve regurge which can happen sometimes of course, the onset is not all of a sudden but rather dramatic with need for hospitalization and you would be a lot sicker.  This could be mitral regurge but if it is, most probably it is going to be mild not necessitating surgery at this point in time.  Shortness of breath on exertion has lots of causes begining with being physically unfit up to having heart or lung failure.  The only way to make sure that this is not secondary to mitral valve prolapse progressing to mitral regurge is to have an echocardiogram and compare it to the ones that you had before.  Also, i think it is important to have a follow-up echocardigraphy on regular basis such as yearly.

Today she went into the hospital to have her cardiversion, and this is her third one in 3 years.   This cardioversion did not work, she is still out of rythym, they even went as high as 200 joules, they tried 3 times, but it did not work.   While we were there, I had a chance to look at her chart, and I saw her echo report.   It states they noted  Mild Left ventricle hypertrophy  Moderate Tricuspid and Mitral regurgatation  Small area of Anterior and Posterior Pericardial Effusion  And her ejection fraction was greater than 50%   Because this time she did not have a succeful cardioversion they are sending her back to the Doctor next week.  She has been on Toprol, Lasix, Potassium, 10mg of Coumadin a day,  and Cardiazem.  She previously took Lisinipril and had adverse effects to it.   Now they are saying they may try another arrythmic drug instead of the Toprol.   With her results reg. her Echo, should she be concerned?  She is 5\"3 and 205lbs and 58 years old   Are her results a sign of congestive heart failure?   Thanks for your time!!!!  jenn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jenn,  Thank you very much for the update.  To begin with, the echo findings are not indicators of congestive heart failure. The ejection fraction is in the normal limit. Your mother has most probably long term effects of hypertension on the heart revealing itself as left ventricular hypertrophy.  There is a very important piece of information that you did not say, is how big is the left atrium?? If the left atrium is bigger than 50 mm (5 cm) than even if your mother was successfully cardioverted, she would have most probably reverted to atrial fibrillation.  There is no problem to let your mom be in atrial fibrillation and try and control the heart rate and continue anticoagulation indefinitely.  It is up to her doctor if he/she wants to try another time with antiarrhythmic medications or just continue with anticoagulation and rate control.  From your mother's course, i think that this going to be the final pathway. She will be in atrial fibrillation and will be continued on rate control and anticoagulation.  i personally think that these are the effects of hypertension.

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding so quickly....  I will get the measurements of the heart that you asked for. My mother's doctor called and said they are going to try to cardiovert her again on Friday. This last time when she was scheduled for her cardioversion, her cardiologist had to go out of town unexpectedly, and another cardiologist did her cardioversion. My mom has to have it on the bigger machine they have in the hospital, and she tried to tell this doctor that, but he chose to use the small machine which she had problems with 3 years ago. He would not listen to her, and when her regular cardiologist got back into town, needless to say he was very upset with his colleague.  Ok...in regards to hypertension...my mother has always had low blood pressure, in fact I have hypotension.  Her blood pressure has only been high while in Atrial Fib. She has had 3 atrial fib episodes that she stayed in no longer than three months at a time. How can the left ventricular hypertrophy be due to that if High BP has never been a big issue?  What else causes it?  Also, Could you please address the reason for her small anterior and posterior pericardial effusion? I looked in your last response, but I didn't see that you wrote reg. that. I am very concerned about this...because that is fluid around the heart. What kind of fluid is it? Why also would her tricuspid and mitral valve be in moderate regurg. What could be causing that?  Thanks so much.....you have really helped me alot and my mom.  jenn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Jenn,  Thank you very much for the update.  Do you mean the bipolar machine by the bigger machine, the one that delivers higher charges?  A small pericardial effusion can be caused by lots of things, starting with a mild inflammation of the pericardium (membrane surrounding the heart) to very serious causes such as cancer around the heart.  i can not tell what is causing this pericardial effusion but sometimes it is not that uncommon to find small pericardial effusions on echocardiograms in rather healthy people. The only way to find out what type of fluid is to do a tap and this depends on the amount of the fluid and whether or not it is accessible.  i am not sure how often was the blood pressure of your mother checked but patients with hypertension sometimes have periods where they have a not so high blood pressure. Since you have mentioned that hypertension is episodic and associated with arrhythmias, this could be associated with certain tumours that release adrenaline in the blood and cause hypertension and some times arrhythmias (even though the sudden increase in the blood pressure can cause arrhythmias in itself). This tumour arises in the adrenal gland and called pheochromoytoma. Are there any other symptoms that your mother experience when she develops these episodes? It does not sound like a typical presentation but i think it is worth it.  As to the reason of the tricuspid and mitral regurge, if this echo was done during the period where your mom had the atrial fibrillation it is not uncommon finding because of the loss of atrial contraction in atrial fibrillation which helps the good coaptation of atrioventricular rings.

    "title": "Atrial Septal Aneurysm....Aortic Insuffiency",
    "content": "Last May I was admiited to the hospital presenting syncope 2x, near passing out episodes for over a year, and seeing stars, upon rising from sitting and laying position.  I am a 30 year old female who has been diagnosed with orthostatic hypotension, and Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia syndrome after 2 postive tilt table tests last May 2002.   They also did an Echo at that time which showed an intra atrial septal aneurysm, a trace of aortic insuffiency and tricuspid regurg. I am aware that everyone has some tricuspid regurg, and that is not very concerning, as long as it stays mild.   However, I am concerned about aortic insuffiency at my age, even if it is only a trace. I should not have any at my age. I am also concerned about the atrial septal aneurysm.   I am a Physician's Asst, and I have heard alot of opinion's from the doctors I work with at the hospital. I have been told that I should not worry about the aneurysm....no big deal. And then another Cardio says, I should be taking a baby aspirin daily, and that my doctor should find out why I have even a trace of aortic insuffiency at my age.   I had a follow up echo last month, and everything was noted once again, but this time,mitral regurgation was noted as well.   I have had shortness of breath for 2 months, occasional chest tightness, and rapid pulse. Should I be concerned about an atrial septal aneurysm? And aortic insuffiency?  They have not put me on any meds, their advice was too icrease fluid and salt intake to help with my low blood pressure...usually 90/52, it has gone as low as 60/32 I appreciate any advice you can give me.   My echo from May states...pulmonary artery systolic pressure of 26mmHg Mild tricuspid regurg was noted at the level of the valve with peak flow velocities reaching 1.8 meters per second.   Flow velocities in the left ventricular outflow tract and across the aortic valve appeared to be within normal limits with peak flow velocities recorded of 1.4 meters per second.  Now my echo from Dec 02 says Ejection fraction is estimated to be about 55% Interatrial aneurysm appears to be bowing into the right side consistent with interatrial septal aneurysm change. My pulmonary systolic pressure this time was between 20-25mmHg  Is my ejection fraction normal? Because of the change from May's echo to Dec regarding that they are saying the aneurysm is bowing into the right side, and there is change, is that serious?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Atrial Septal Aneurysm....Aortic Insuffiency",
    "content": "Dear Guinevere,   Thank you very much for using our website.   The reason an echocardiogram was checked in your case was to find out whether you have any structural heart disease that is causing you to faint. It looks from what you described to me that you had an unremarkable echocardiogram.   More and more people are getting more and more echocardiograms done for reasons like shortness of breath, palpitations, etc... without clinical evidence (e.g murmurs) of structural heart disease. Many of these people have normal hearts. There is an increased incidence of discovering trivial valvular insufficiencies like the ones that you described. If there were no structural abnormalities in your valves described on the echocardiogram, i would totally disregard these findings.   As regards aortic insufficiency, since you are very worried about that, although i believe that what you have is to be ignored (followed up by yearly echo at best for your own reassurance if you are still worried), i will mention some points about aortic insufficiency to you.   The commonest causes of aortic insufficiency are:  1. Rheumatic fever.  You did not mention a history of rheumatic fever and the echo does not show any evidence of that.  2. Bicsuspid aortic valve (although with bicuspid valves stenosis is more common).  Should have appeared on the echo.  3. Infective endocarditis.  No history.  4. Trauma.  Do you have a history of severe trauma to the chest?  5. Other less common causes include  a. Marfan's syndrome. Are you tall and thin?  b. Syphyllis. Ever had syphyllis?  c. Ankylosing spondylitis. Any back stifness?  d. Rheumatoid arthritis. Any symptoms and signs of rheumatoid?  e. Hypertension. You are hypotensive. f. Other vasculitis syndromes. You can rule them out by just doing a crp or a sed rate.   To be clinically significant, the regurgitant blood should be of a certain quantified volume on the echocardiogram. The most common finding on the echocardiogram for patients with signficant aortic insufficiency is dilated left ventricle.   Your ejection fraction is normal and your pulmonary artery pressure is normal so even if you had clinically siginificant aortic insufficiency, it has not affected your heart yet.   Having shortness of breath with this normal ejection fraction implies that most probably the cause of your shortness of breath is not related to the heart.   Bulging of the atrial septum towards one of the atrium is not an atrial septal aneurysm by definition. The atrial septum should have a certain minimal excursion or bulging to be considered as aneurysmatic. Atrial septal aneurysms have been incriminated in cases of embolic events without an identifiable obvious cause. They are usually associated with other abnormalities that are also incriminated in cases of embolic events without a cause such as a patent foramen ovale. No strong causal relationship was identified between atrial septal aneurysms and patent foramen ovale and stroke but they were found in people who have cryptogenic stroke (or stroke without a cause) and were suggested to be \"potential causes\". The argument is that they are present in the general population without associated problem. Atrial sepral aneurysm are usually asymptomatic. If you want to investigate this more then the best way to do this is through a tranesophageal echocardiography and an iv agitated saline contrast injection to know what of atrial septal aneurysm you have and whether it is associated with a shunt or not and also to take a better look at your aortic valve.   Having shortness of breath, occasional chest tightness and rapid pulse can be because of the hypotension that you have. i am not sure what was done in addition to the tilt table test to find out the cause of your orthostatic blood pressure such as look for adrenal insufficiency. Are you taking any herbal supplements or any medications that could lower the blood pressure?   This is a very long answer. i hope that i have not lost track of what i was supposed to tell you. Bottom line, not to worry. This is a more or less unremarkable echocardiogram. If you are still really worried, then check some blood work to make sure that you do not have any of the very rare causes of aortic insufficiency (if you have symptoms to suggest that you have any of the causes), otherwise, if you want to be cautious, follow-up this echocardiogram in a year's time. This is my advice to you putting in mind that i have not examined you.   Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and if you still have questions that have not been answered, do not hesitate to post them immediately.

    "title": "Atrial Septal aneurysm",
    "content": "[quote=\"Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\"]Dear   I followed up with my Cardiologist today, and he said I do have an atrial septal aneurysm, and it is bowing toward right atrium, he wants me to take a baby aspirin a day.   He said that there is a higher incidence of stroke with ASA and when combined with PFO's-patent foramen ovale. However, I was seen at The Cleveland Clinic and they did a bubble study, and they said there was no evidence of PFO.  He also said my tricuspid valve has mild regurg, but many people have  minimal leakage of this valve. He also said, that my mitral valve has mild regurg, and he is not sure whether it is associated with MVP. He said there was no significant appearance of mitral valve prolapse. At age 16 I was diagnosed with MVP, but my family doctor in later years had said I outgrew it.  So my cardiologist said he would keep his eye on it.    He also said I had mild  aortic insuffiency (regurg) and he was concerned  and that I should not have any at my age. He did say it could possibly give way to Aortic stenosis in my 70's or 80's.   I told him that over the last month, I have had extreme exhaustion, weakness and short of breath at rest and at bedtime, combined with chest pain. All other tests have been done to rule out noncardiac issues.  Recently I had crushing pain down my left arm, which has never happened before.   Also, when I awake, when my eyes open in the morning, my vision goes black, like I am going to pass out. This is when I am still laying down, and have not even gotten up yet. When this happens, my pulse is at a crawl, Bradycardia, I am assuming. He was quite concerned about this, because I do have moderate sinus arrythmia. He ordered a stress test and a 48hour holter monitor.   He wants me to take my BP with a manual cuff when this happens. My BP has gone as low as 60/32 in the past. The only tests that were done to define my hypotension were adrenal bloodwork, and Tilt.    Cleveland Clinic wants me to come back up for Hemodynamic tests. Cleveland Clinic suggested I may have hypokinetic heart syndrome....do not know what that is? They also wondered if I had a early mild form of peripheral autonomic insuffiency...do not understand that either. If you can shed any light on those, it would be appreciated.   He said my echo was pretty clear, because I am 139lb and he does not foresee a TEE procedure anytime soon, unless a neg. stress test. I have never had any of the things you stated in your post that would cause aortic insuffiency.   However, I have had repeated strep throat infections, with 3 documented last year alone. So, as far as rheumatic fever, I am sure I would have known, I had that. also had a root canal on a first molar done 2 years ago, I did not follow up and get a crown. The tooth broke a year and a half ago, and it became infected.  I did not have it pulled, and neglected it. I recently went to the oral surgeon, and he has just gotten clearance to pull it with prior antibotic therapy. My one concern is I had Bronchiectisis for 6 years, with repeated medrol use and antibiotics. My body is practically immune to pencicillin, amoxyl, and the like. The last time I had strep, after a week of anitbiotic therapy, it had not helped. How do I know, it will protect my heart with this oral procedure?   You stated:'' If there were no structural abnormalities in your valves described on the echocardiogram, i would totally disregard these findings.\" What kind of structural damage are you referring to?   You also stated \" No strong causal relationship was identified between atrial septal aneurysms and patent foramen ovale\" I did some research over the last year reg. this topic, and the journal studies I looked at stated otherwise, they said that when ASA and PFO are combined that there is a higher incident of TIA.   I hope to hear from you again, thank you for your time. I appreciate it. guinevere\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guinevere,  Thank you very much for the update.  About atrial septal aneurysm and patent foramen ovale and the risk of stroke. There were no patients who were followed because they had asa and/or pfo and then they devellopped a stroke, patients had strokes and there was no explanation for their stroke and during the search for a cause asa and/or pfo were found. i am not saying they are not related, they could very well be, but a sure causal relationship has not been proven yet. About my quote, you did not complete the quote till the end which is \"No strong causal relationship was identified between atrial septal aneurysms and patent foramen ovale and stroke but they were found in people who have cryptogenic stroke (or stroke without a cause) and were suggested to be \"potential causes\". \". Taking an aspirin a day i hope is not something harmful for you and you can continue taking that if it does not cause you any problems.  Regarding hypokinetic heart syndrome. i have not heard about it unless it is a fancy name for a common condition.  About you taking steroids for bronchiectasis, if you have taken those for a while and then stopped them suddenly you might have adrenal insufficiency and this could be the reason behind your orthostatic hypotension. What is the cause of your bronchiectasis?  About the autonomic neuropathy, there are two types of nerves in our body, the ones that we can control like the nerves going to our muscles and the nerve that carry sensations and there the nerves that control the involuntary functions of the body like heart beating and movements of the stomach, etc... When these nerves are destroyed, then the control of these functions fail. One of the functions of these nerves is holding blood pressure by vasoconstricting the arteries when the person stands up and the blood is shifted downwards by gravity. If the nerves are desroyed then the patient develops hypotension when he stands up (orthostatic hypotension).  About aortic stenosis in the old age, this is a not uncommon occurrence in the elderly and many of them require valve replacement and it is related to degenerative changes of the valve because of age.  The structural abnormalities that i was referring to are fibrosis or valves with 2 cusps (not 3) or destruction by previous rheumatic fever, that type of thing.  The chest pain that you are describing could be worrisome, so i guess having a stress test is not unreasonable. Although, if you do not have any major risk factors, the results of the stress test most probably will be negative especially that you are a 30 years old female, naturally protected from heart disease by your hormones unless you have strong risk factors such as a first degree relative with heart disease, smoking, diabetes or high cholesterol. If the stress test came back negative i would encourage you to do an x-ray of the neck as sometimes neck stiffness and arthritis of the neck can give symptoms to chest pain radiating to the arm or neck and even back.  If you have structural heart abnormalities like the ones i have mentionned, then you have to protect your heart against bacteria that gets access to the blood and the commonest way the bacteria gets to the blood is throguh the mouth and teeth, gastrointestinal tract and genitourinary instrumentation. You have to be given antibiotic prophylaxis in that case and this can be always through your cardiologist if he thinks that you need it.  Once more thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and i really enjoyed this conversation and please, feel free to update me and if you have any questions please post them immediately.

    "content": "I had blood work done to rule out adrenal insuffiency. My doctor said the tests came back negative-no adrenal insuffiency.   I had Bronchiectisis for many years, one infection of bronchitis and or pneumonia after another. I have gone through over at least 50 to 60 courses of antibiotics in the last 6 years.   The only thing that works is Levaquin. Amoxil and any form of pennicillin-I do not respond. I am allergic to the enitre Eurythromycin class of drugs, so I can not take those.  They are not sure what caused the bronchiectisis, but my dad was a heavy smoker, and I moved out when I was 25 years old. So his smoking may have been a major contributing factor. My grandfather died of lung cancer, he also was a heavy smoker.  I find it odd though, that as a child, I only got occasional colds, with sore throat.  I never had bronchitis or any lung issues until my middle 20's. Until that time, my health was impecable!   I worked in the Pathology dept at a hospital for a year, and that is the time I started to have all the problems with my lungs. A good friend of mine who is a doctor, suspects I may have been exposed to something in the Pathology dept, that may have contributed. However, I find that rare. I would like your thoughts on that.  My father has had 2 heart attacks, and he is only 56 years of age. He has heart damage from the first one, and has 2 or 3 stents as well. He also has high BP. He is not overweight.  My mom has had 2 episodes of atrial phib with successful cardioversion. She is on high doses of coumadin. She also is 56 years old, and she is overweight-210lb's Is atrial phib hereditary?   I think my dad's heart attack and high BP happened because of his lifestyle.He smokes Lucky Strike nonfilter ciggarettes since he was 9 years old, and he is an alcoholic, he has been drinking since he was 11 years old.  I do not believe I am in any way a candidate for heart disease. I excercise regularly, and eat well, I do not smoke or drink. I would not say that heart disease runs in our family. I truly believe that if my dad did not smoke and drink, he would not have the issues he has today.  In regards to your statements about peripheral autonommic insuffiency, does this refer to Lupus, Multiple Sclerosis, etc? Is that why Cleveland Clinic want to do Hemodynamic tests to rule any autonomic disorder out?  My main concern is when I awake in the morning, and my eyes open, my vision goes black, and my pulse is in a state of bradycardia. I am concerned I am not getting enough oxygen when I sleep. I am not sure why that happens. This has been going on for 2 years, and has gotten worse.  I also started having episodes during the day where my right eye would go completely blurry. I went to the opthamologist and he said my eyes were fine, and he believed I was not getting enough blood and oxygen to the brain and eyes.  He told me to get my blood gases checked, they still need to check that. However, I am scared about getting blood taken from my artery, to check that.  Perhaps you could share your thought on that as well.  Thanks again!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guinevere,  Thank you very much for using our website.  By now, i guess that you already know what is bronchiectasis. It is permanent dilatation and destruction of the bronchi leading to infections leading to more dilatation and destruction of the bronchi and lung.  Bronchiectasis has many causes including: 1. Infections with viruses (influenza virus for instance) and many bacteria. Your first attack of pneumonia could be the one that initiated the whole thing. 2. Congential (you are born with it). Many mechanisms could cause that. 3. Aspiration of stomach acid (ever lost consciosness??). 4. Exposure to certain toxic gases (you worked in lab for a while).  Sometimes, doctors start patient on antibiotics like the first ten days of each month as preventive measures against recurrent infections. Some doctors agree to it and some not. The reason that the antibiotics that you mentionned are not doing the trick is because the bugs that cause the infection in your lungs most probably developed resistance to them, so they became ineffective.  About heart disease, if your dad had his first heart attack before the age of 50 years then you have a family history of coronary disease meaning that you as a person has a higher chance than any person (whose father did not have a heart attack before 50). The lifestyle that you mentionned (eating healthy, exercsing) is a very good one. You have to continue to live it. i do not think that atrial fibrillation is hereditary.  About autonomic neuropathy, it can be caused by lots of things, if you were diagnosed with it, then the doctors will have to find out what caused it.  Let me ask you if you take any medications or herbal remidies that you have not mentionned before.  Now to your questions about blackening of vision when you wake up, if you have when you wake up and try to stand up then you feel that your vision is going black, this is related to the orthostatic hypotension that you have. If not, i do not have any explanation that comes to my mind for the time being.  About bradyacardia, it is normal that you have slow heart rate while you are asleep and the lowest is usually immediately before you wake up because this is the time of the night where the parasympathetic nervous system (the one that causes your heart to be slow is at the top of its activity).  About your concern that you might not be getting enough oxygen during sleep, this could be a possibility especially that you have a chronic lung disease. About this causing the blackening of vision in the morning, i can not really say that i ever heard of it as the results of night time hypoxia are well known and their effect is on: 1. Heart (in the form of pulmonary hypertension. Your echo showed normal pulmonary pressures) 2. Energy level (feeling tired and sleeping during the day a lot). 3. Developing hypertension (you have hypotension). 4. Others.  About the right blurring during the day, the opthalmologist who examined could have given you the right explanation.  Abou the blood gases, it is considered a very safe procedure and it is done daily to lots and lots of patients.  Once more thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and waiting for your reply.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

She has never had high blood pressure until her first episode of atrial fib. She had her second episode of atrial fib last year, followed by another successful cardioversion- but they had to shock her twice to get her heart back in rythym.   She had a recent echo showing moderate regurg in her mitral valve, and they prescribed her lisinipril. She took it for one month and had many side effects.

    "title": "Re: Atrial fibrillation",
    "content": "Dear Guinevere,  Was the cause behind atrial fibrillation ever sought? Were thyroid function tests done? Does she have lung disease? Any reason for the lasix (i assume it is used for treating high blood pressure)? Has a magnesium level checked? Does potassium level get checked every time she develops atrial fibrillation? Did the echo suggest that she might have coronary disease? What was the left atrial size on the echo?  Atrial fibrillation can be caused by several things including  1. Increased activity of the sympathetic nervous system which can be caused by stress, a hyperactive thyroid gland or a tumour of the adrenal gland called pheochromocytoma. 2. Heart disease including hypertension and coronary disease. 3. Lung disease. 4. Electrolyte imbalance. 5. No known etiology, called Lone atrial fibrillation.  If the atrial fibrillation has a treatable cause, then it is going to be of extreme difficulty to keep her in sinus rhythm without treating the cause. The cause has to be treated first.  Since there is a correlation between her blood pressure being high and developing atrial fibrillation, i think there are two possibilities. 1. Your mother has high blood pressure and is not adequately controlled and since your mother's heart is not accustomed to such high blood pressure, her heart goes into atrial fibrillation. 2. There is one thing that causes both of them every time and this can be explained by a tumour of the adrenal gland called pheochrmocytoma. High blood pressure in this case comes in attacks and otherwise, the patient does not have any problems. The attacks are usually associated with sweating, tremors, headaches and pallor. This is a long shot because metoprolol should have caused worsening of the blood pressure if this was the case, but i think it is worth it to check for its presence or absence.  If the left atrial size on the echo is increased upto 5 cm (50 mm), the chances of your mother remaining in sinus rhythm are not high and every time cardioversion is performed, your mother will go back into atrial fibrillation.  If the left atrial size is normal and your mother does not have a cause for atrial fibrillation and every time she is cardioverted, she flips back to atrial fibrillation once more, i think it will be beneficial if she is started on an antiarrhythmic medication to help her stay in sinus rhythm.  i am not sure what kind of work-up besides the echo was done, but let me recommend some tests i think should be done if they were not done. 1. Thyroid function tests. 2. Electrolytes including magnesium, calcium and phosphorus levels at the time of atrial fibrillation. 3. Work-up for pheopchromocytoma if her doctor thinks that this is a reasonable thing to do as checking for this tumour is not easy and i think is not cheap as well.

    "content": "Dear Tracy,  During pregnancy, the female's body undergoes several physiologic changes, of which are changes of the circulation and the cardiovascular system. These changes pause a stress on the heart. There is also a load on the heart during labor and even after delivery of the placenta for a limited period of time.  With your history, i think i will agree with your cardiologist.   But you have to remember that there is nothing without risk and there is no 100% guaranty. You have to know and fully understand what are the risks that pregnancy carry in your case, and you and only you should decide whether or not the gains outweigh the risks and whether you (and your other family members if you wish) are ready to take those risks.   If you decide to go for it, then you will have to be followed up during pregnancy very strictly, there are medications that you will have to stop before getting pregnant like the captopril.  During labor, i am not sure what your ob/gyn decide whether or not to have a c/s versus normal delivery, but if you have a normal delivery, the stage where you push the baby out has to be shortened and after delivery of the placenta you have to be watched for fluid overload. i would prefer also that labor takes place in a hospital where there is ample experience with patients like yourself, cardiac patients going through labor.  Good luck.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sloudermilk,  The combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine, is notorious for cardiac complications.  The use of phentermine alone is not known to cause the same complications, this being said, however, there are very rare reports that it can cause the same complications.  These complications include  1. Increase in the pressure in the pulmonary circulation (blood vessels of the lungs) known as pulmonary hypertension which usually present as shortness of breath, chest pain, loss of consciousness and lower limb edema. 2. Diseased valves of the heart.  The chest pain that you are describing does not sound that it has the characteristics of chest pain typical for coronary disease.  At this point, i would recommend stopping the medication, get in to see your doctor to make sure that everything is ok.

    "title": "Re: Valve Regurgitation",
    "content": "Dear Doris,  It looks that you have mitral and aortic valves regurgitation.  Valves are basically one way doors. They have to open to pass the blood and then close so that the blood does not go back (regurgitates) in the direction it should not.  Your valves are leaking blood and the blood is giong the wrong way.  The effect that this has on the heart varies from patient to patient depending on the cause of the regurgitation, the severity of the regurgitation and the underlying co-morbid conditions that the patient has.  In your case:  1. The left atrium is dilated (bigger than normal), which has the hazard of blood being stagnant and a blood developping in the left atrium. Also, an abnormal heart rhythm may arise.  2. The left ventricle is normal. The left ventricle is the main chamber of the heart. It is the chamber that pumps the blood to all the organs of the body. It is not bigger than normal. The thickness of its wall is normal. This is what the expression without hypertrophy or dilatation implies. And this is what the abbreviations lv diam dias 4.45 cm and lv diam sys 2.51 cm mean as well. They stand for left ventricle diameter in diastole and left ventricle diameter in systole and these measurements are normal.  3. Fractioning shortening and ejection fraction are measures of how well the left ventricle pumps and in your case, both are normal.  If you are not seeing a cardiologist, i think it is time that you start seeing one, specially if you have new symptoms like shortness of breath when you exercise.   You have to be evaluated and followed up by a cardiologist who along the years and according to the progress of your regurgitation and overall symptoms, will decide if and when the valves need to be changed surgically.

    "content": "My husband has a \"severe aortic stenosis\" which was detected several years ago and has been progessing. Unfortunately, he is also fighting metastatic gastric cancer, which returned only recently, five years after a curative gastrectomy. The cardiologist was waiting for symptoms before performing a valve replacement. Oddly, despite these problems, he is living a relatively active life--still playing 18 holes of golf without a cart while on chemotherapy! The doctors can hardly believe that he has no symptoms from the stenosis--the fatigue he feels seems to result from the cancer and the chemotherapy, not his heart. He has always been very strong and physically active. I am afraid that if he does start to feel short of breath, or dizzy, that they will not do a replacement, since he will \"probably not survive the cancer more than a couple of years at the most.\" I guess this will be a question for our HMO. But if symptoms do develop, will he be able to function at all without surgery, or is he likely to become a total invalid at that point? He is responding already very well to the chemo, after only one cycle. But they say \"there is no correlation between remission and survival\" so I am at a loss to know what is likely to happen, with either condition. Harriet\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Harriet,  If your husband starts to have symptoms of critical aortic stenosis, then at this time surgery has to be done. It is not an easy surgery and it will depend on the health of your husband at the time and whether or not he is fit for this kind of surgery. If he is judged to be fit for surgery, a coronary angiogram has to be done as well and if a bypass is needed, it will have to be done at the same time.  There is another alternative, balloon dilatation of the aortic valve. It is not a substitute for surgery but it is used in cases where surgery is not feasible. Its main problem is recurrence of stenosis in 50% of cases within 6-12 months and recurrence of symptoms in 30% of cases within 6-12 months as well.  Nobody can predict when your husband is going to need surgery for aortic stenosis and when he does will he be fit or not for surgery at that time and where his cancer will be, so i would recommend that you deal with one problem at a time and not worry about the crossing the bridge before reaching it because you have too much to worry about now already.  But personally, if your husband starts to have symptoms of aortic stenosis and proves to be fit for surgery then, i would recommend going with surgery.  i wish you and your husband well.

For the last 5 I have been having frequent chest pains and shortness of breath. It happens at least once and up to 10 or so times a day with sharp or aching pains on the left to middle part of my chest. I can sometimes relieve it by pushing very hard at the point of discomfort. The shortness of breath is somewhat constant and I am continually taking deep breaths . I also have quite a lot of dizziness at rest or standing. It makes no difference. My father had a mycardial infarction at age 42 with undiagnosed diabetes. I am constantly checking my blood for diabetes and my most recent tests said i was good. But my cholestrol was elevated to 217.  Trigliserides 99. My problem is I have no insurance and was wondering if there may be a place that would check to see if my heart is getting very sick or not. I have 3 young children ages 1 , 4 and 13; I am getting kinda nervous with the chest pains all the time. I also am a very busy person with a type A personality. I cannot afford at this time to go to a cardiologist in a private practice and get all the test. Is there a place where they might be investigating this disorder that maybe I could get some help with? Thank you for your patience with this long letter.\n\n",

The charateristics of the pain that you described are close to those of pain of mitral valve prolapse.  i would personally recommed that you see your regular doctor so that he can send you to have a new echocardiogram to see how the prolapse has progressed over the last ten years. You don't have to see a cardiologist now at least.  You are doing a good job by checking your blood sugar and cholesterol levels regularly. You need to know what is the level of your low density lipoprotein (ldl)=bad cholesterol and high density lipoprotein (hdl)=good cholesterol because they are more important than the total cholesterol.

My question to you is: does this chest pain occur during physical activity or can it happen while sitting down? Is it related to your palpitations?

    "title": "Re: 28 year old with chest pains",
    "content": "Dear Khailey,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Chest pain has lots of reasons. It is not easy sometimes to differentiate between them or decide for sure whether the cause is indeed related to the heart.  First thing that would lead us down the correct path is the character of the pain itself and its associated symptoms in addition to the risk factor that the patient has for heart disease.  Polycystic ovarian syndrome is part of a metabolic symdrome where the patient usually has predisposition to being diabetic and having high lipids in addition to obesity.  At a young age such as yours and being a female, you should be protected by your female hormones, but since you don't have enough of your female hormones then this protecting effect is doubtful to say the least.  The most feared cause of chest pain is usually a heart attack, that's why whenever a patient comes complaining of chest pain, our first concern is to make sure that this is not a coronary event. And the process starts by analysing the risk factors of the patient (for developing coronary disease), chest pain characteristics, do an ekg and some blood tests (to detect heart muscle damage) and of course the possibility that this might be secondary to other causes.  The risk factors for coronary disease are: 1. Family history of early coronary disease. 2. Hypertension. 3. Diabetes. 4. Being a male. 5. Age. 6. Hyperlipidemia. 7. Smoking. 8. Sedentary life style.  As you can see, smoking is on the list, coffee or caffeinated beverages are not on the list.  You did not mention anything about coronary history in your family so, this is negative, you don't have hypertension, you are not a male, you are young, don't know about your lipid profile (but should be checked), you smoke and from what you said one can conclude that you have a sedentary life style.  Back to the pain characteristics, the pain that is typical to coronary disease occurs usually behind the breast bone, patients can sometime feel the pain in the left shoulder or arm, the back and the neck. The pain is usually described by patients as sharp, pressure, stabbing, etc..., usually lasts a few minutes, usually brought up by some kind of activity and relieved by rest. It is sometimes assoicated with nausea, vomiting, shortness of breath, dizziness, sense of suffocation amongst others.  In most cases, after analysing the data, the health care provider can say whether or not the pain is of coronary disease. If a decision can not be made then other tests are usually done, like stress tests.  In your case, it looks like your doctor voted against this pain being of coronary origin. i would recommend that you wait for the results of the echocardiogram as mitral valve prolapse is a well known cause of chest pain and palpitations.  To reduce your risk of coronary disease, you need to live a healthy life style. Stop smoking immediately, check your blood sugar and your lipid profile and try to lose weight and exercise.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

The symptoms are continous tightness and pressure that will last for hours at a time 3-5 hours long. The pain can be unbearable and  I find my self hyperventatling. Any type of movement makes the pain worse, the only relief I get is when I sit up but the pain is still there.

The doctors say my heart and lungs are clear and are unable to refer me to a specialist because they can't diagnose me. They say that it may be my chest muscles and have given me motrin.

You never mentioned whether you had an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart) or not. The echo should show whether you have mitral valve prolapse or not. This is a condition that was found in about 15% of healthy females and was associated with atypical chest pain although the characteristics of the pain that you have, are not typical for the chest pain most of the persons with mitral valve prolapse experience.  Chest pain has so many other causes begining with skin causes and ending with the heart and other organs inside the chest like the lungs. If your chest pain is not of heart origin then i would look for other reasons. One of the common causes of chest pain is people confusing it with pain originating from the gastrointestinal tract like heart burn for example. If everything turns out to be negative, the most likely diagnosis although i don't like to pin anything on it is panic attacks.  At this point, i would suggest to start an over the counter medication for heart burn and see if it makes any difference. If it helps then most probably this is the correct diagnosis and you will need to use and may be have some kind of investigation like a stomach scope to make sure that there is nothing wrong.  The investigations that i would go for in your case is to check the gall bladder with an ultrasound and do a pancreatic enzyme check. Also, have liver functions tested.  Although it does not sound like it, and if this was not done, i would check an x-ray of the spine regardless or not you have a history suggestive of spine injury. Although it is a long shot, and surely it does not sound like it, some patients who develop shingles will get chest pain continuously and this is a nerve type of pain and treated with specific medications.  You can take these thoughts to your doctor and see what he thinks.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "I am a 32 years old and a marathon runner. Recently, I had chest discomfort. Visit a local cardiologist, who did Bruce Protoccol (Stress Threadmill test).The test show an exaggerated heart rate response. I completed the test in 11 1/2 minute with maximum heart rate attained 215 per minute.He further did an echocardiogram.He said there was nothing wrong with my heart and prescribe 20mg Inderal daily to control my heart rate.We have no family heart related cases before. I have been having chest phlegm quite occasionally.  i)What is wrong with me? ii)If I stop Inderal for a few hours, I have rapid heart beat.Why? iii)When should I stop using inderal? iv)Can I continue with my running? v)Is inderal habitual?   Here is his report on me.  1. He has been a marathon runner for years and still exercises daily running on a treadmill for almost one hour. Recently he has noticed exaggerated heart rate response with a feeling of tiredness after exercise. He also feels vague chest discomfort related to exercise.  2. He was able to complete II 1/12 minutes of Bruce Protoccol without any difficulty. But you will see that he has an exaggerated heart rate response. The maximum heart rate attained was 215 per minute which is 114 % of his predicted maximum heart rate. Heart rate recovery after exercise was also delayed.  3.The exaggerated heart rate response during and following exercise is extremely unusual in an apparently fit and exercising individual. I cannot explain why this is happening.  4.I therefore did an echocardiogram which shows LVH but no evidence of hypertrophic cardiomypathy.  5. My advice would be for you to use a Beta Blocker such as lnderal 20mg daily to control his heart rates. I have also advised him to reduce his exercise levels.  6. I do not know whether we should call his LVH a cardiomyopathy. This is because some degree of ventricular hypertrophy occurs with endurance exercise.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dave,   My best guess is that since you have left ventricular hypertrophy is that when you exercise, your left ventricle does not accomodate as much blood as it should during relaxation (as it is stiff), so it needs to beat faster to compensate. Did you echo mention that you have something called diastolic dysfunction? Inderal and the like medications can help with diastolic dysfunction.  There is nothing wrong with your aerobic capacity. Your physical fitness is great.   Your maximum predicted heart rate for your age is 188. This should be your 100%. Rarely, we see people go above their 100%.   i am sure that the cardiologist who was supervising your stress test made sure that this is the normal rhythm of the heart but fast. This being said however, a heart rate of 225 is a little bit too fast for a normal heart rhythm (even in such young healthy people like yourself). So, i would like to advise you to see to an electrophysiologist who is a cardiologist specialized in abnormal heart rhythms, if after you discuss it with your doctor, he thinks it is a reasonable idea.   Inderal is a medication that is given heart rate, so if it is stopped, you will feel that relatively your heart rate is fast.  Regarding stopping inderal, you will have to consult your physician and never stop inderal suddenly on your own unless approved by your physician first.  Inderal is not habit forming.  Unless you have a problem with running, you can to run, you have a very good aerobi capacity as evidenced by your stress test.  Other things i would like to add is to check your electrolytes and a thyroid function test.   If it is ok with your primary physician, would you also have a Holter monitor (which is a 24 hours heart monitor).

However, we don't do these tests for everyone. We only do them to patients who have symptoms and risk factors suspicious enough to warrant further investigation. Check our page on risk factors for heart disease: Click here!  Although your symptoms are not characteristic of chest pain due to a serious cause such as a heart attack, your family history and your smoking raise your risk of heart disease and warrant a clinical exam and performing a few tests.  You are right about abstaining.\n\n",

Last year due to the similar problems, I had approached a Urologist and he prescribed me Andriol for 3 months after a boold test for hormones.  During the treatment the erection were reasonably ok.  But when I discontinued it after Doctors advise after three months, it has been returned to its normal stage.  I am having lot of mental tensions because of this.  I am a married person and my wife's age is 29.  After the blood test, I had been told that the required hormone level was very low.  I hope I will get a favourable advise through this esteemed site.

Regarding your sexual problem, i can not claim to be a specialist in this kind of diseases but you have to see a specialist in endocrine glands and/or if available a specialist in male reproductive system.

    "content": "Dear Abdul Nazer,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Do you have any other health problems like high blood pressure?   Has your father had a heart attack before he was 55 years old or has your mother had a heart attack before she was 65?  Do you smoke?  A fasting blood sugar of 113 mg% means that you are not diabetic but according to the most recent definition, a fasting blood sugar between 111-125 is considered pre-diabetes. Any body in your family has diabetes?  Your lipid profile obviously has high cholesterol, high triglycerides and high ldl (which is called bad cholesterol by some), and good hdl (called good cholesterol by some).  And i guess you want to know whether you need to be treated or not and what are the ultimate numbers that you should have.  What matters in the treatment is the level of ldl (bad cholesterol).  The rules are the following: - If a patient has coronary disease or is diabetic then ldl cholesterol must be kept below 100. - If a patient has 2 or more risk factors for cornary disease then ldl cholesterol must be kept < 130. - If a patient has 0-1 risk factors cornary disease then ldl cholesterol must be kept < 160.  Risk factors are: 1. Cigarette smoking. 2. Hypertension. 3. Low hdl cholesterol (<40 mg/dL). 4. Family history of premature coronary disease (coronary disease in male first degree relative <55 years; coronary disease in female first degree relative <65 years). 5. Age (men 45 years; women 55 years).  So, according to your profile, you don't have hypertension, assuming that you don't smoke, you hdl is above 40, you are less than 45 years and assuming that no one in your family has premature coronary disease, i don't think that you need to be treated as your ldl level is already below 160.  From a previous post where you mentioned your eating habits and assuming that you are still sticking to the same habits, i think you are doing a fine job, i would add that if you want to eat meat, i would go for white meat such as poultry and/or fish.  i would encourage you also to start an exercise program as this will help lower your cholesterol and at the same time help prevent diabetes (if there any body in your family who has diabetes).

If you start having this irregular heart beating for longer periods of time, i would recommend that you have an electrocardiogram (electrical drawing of the heart) checked.  Causes of extrabeats are: 1. Too much caffeine whether coffee, tea, too much pop. 2. Too much alcohol. 3. Too much smoking. 4. Hyperactivity of the thyroid glands. 5. Disturbances in some of the body salts. 6. Mitral valve prolapse. 7. Stress. 8. Lack of sleep. 9. Severe fatigue. 10. Many others.  If this starts bothering you or become more frequent or starts to be associated with dizziness, more shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, i would advice you to see your doctor then immediately.  i would encourage you now to get enough sleep and rest, cut down on caffeinated beverages, smoking or alcohol that you might have been drinking. If this problem persists, then you might be up for some blood work to check your body salts (electrolytes) and thyroid gland function.

    "content": "Dear Bykegyrl,  Pulmonary hypertension is defined as: - Systolic pulmonary artery pressure of more than 35 mmhg (some define it as more than 30 and some as more than 40). - Mean pulmonary artery pressure of more than 20 mmhg (every body agrees to this one).  This has to be a direct measurement using a catheter placed in the pulmonary artery and not using an echo. The higher the pulmonary artery pressures the higher the sensitivity of the echo regarding how well it can estimate the pulmonary pressure.  i think that if you have pulmonary hypertension it is most probably mild.  In your case, It looks from your history that you don't have any symptoms that patients who have pulmonary hypertension usually have.   i would follow up with an echo as your primary care provider adviced you. In addition to that, if at any time, you started to have any new symptoms such as new onset shortness of breath, then call your physician to have it looked at.   Regarding your heart rate reaching 160-165 (assuming that this during exercise), your maximum predicted heart rate for your age is 182, so during peak exercise it is expected that your heart rate reaches this high level normally.

He has a little less than a month until then and is having very painful  chest pains and arm pain, the doctor tell him there is nothing they can do until the surgery- is this true, do they think he is lying?  Now as hard as it is to get him to go to the doctor anyway, he almost has to pass out to make him go, he says that he will go if it gets any worse. he is in a lot of pain but says that if he goes the doctor will tell him the same thing as last week.  What could this be?? please reply asap  thank you April in NC\n\n",

Do you know what was the function of his heart like?  Usually when a surgery is scheduled at a later rather an earlier day, it is because it is thought that most probably the patient has to recuperate from some kind of event before going to surgery or they are waiting for the patient to gain more strength that would help him going through surgery.

    "content": "Dear April,  i don't think that big toe numbness has ever been described as a syptom for coronary artery disease.   Your dad has to have a coronary angiogram before he has his mitral valve replaced because of these ongoing chest pains to evaluate his coronaries as this ongoing chest pain might mean that he has significant coronary disease for which he should have a coronary bypass. i understand that he is still a little bit (not too) young for coronary disease but in my personal opinion i think he should have an angiogram.  Keep me updated with the results of the ekg and the blood work.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "title": "I could use some advice from a doctor",
    "content": "I am not sure what to do here. I will start off I guess with all that has happened. I got really ill in Jan. 2002. My fiance took me into the hospital due to shortness of breath. I was swelling allot in the hands and feet. had chest pain. They admitted me and never really did anything, hooks me up to pain meds, and O2, but never did nay tests. I still had allot of fatigue, and swelling, went to a new doc, who ended up doing an EKG, it showed that there was some type of damage, but she said nothing to really worry about at this point. She put me on diuretics, and BP meds. I had severe problems with BP meds dropping my BP to low, and I was on a very minimal dose. so she took me off. Still having the same problems thru out the year, my fiance takes me into the ER again shortness of breath, chest pain, palpations. They only due an Xray, give me O2 then send me on my way... I end up back into the ER a few months later this time smae symptoms but worse. My blood gas is at 42% and BP is up and Pulse racing. they told my fiance that I must have pnuemonia, all tests came back negative, then they said must be bronchitis, negative also, then they say she has to have a blood clot in the lungs, this was also negative. Now comparing the Xray form a few months before my heart is allot larger, no one ever checks this until I insist on it. So my doc orders an echo and finds MVR and TVR (mild) and Septum enlarged 1.4, EF 62% so EF is good, but why am I so sick, and now I am experiencing the same sypmtoms.... A year later but my swelling in allot worse, now my hands legs feet and abdomen.... I have had every blood test you can think of done to rule out Hepatitis, and ANA testing to rule out auto immune diseases, and the only thing now is that I have fatty liver form Syndrome X, ALT is 101, AST 47, and red blood cells are elevated. Is there something missing here,, do I need to get a second opinion maybe from a cardiologist, I am currently seeing and Internal Medicine Doc. He says well I think all your swelling is from fibromialgia, and chest pain and palpations are from this too, when I went in to see him Tuesday my BP was 90/62, now I'm just so fatigued and swollen all over, I can't work due to being exhausted, and swelling more being on my feet, my BP goes from 150's/ 90's to low BP??? My heart at times feels like it is going to come out of my chest, I started having pressure in my neck, and in my chest, light headedness, I just need help.. Can my heart be causing all this to happen to me. To top it off we have a fm hx of major heart issues, my 11 yrs old daughter has been having the same problems as I and just been dx's with cardiomyopathy. What do you think is happening here?? Please help me....\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Memorylane4ever,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Shortness of breath can be caused by either heart problems, lung problems, both or others.  In your case, all the major lung problems have been looked at and it looks like you have healthy lungs.  Regarding your heart, shortness of breath originating from the heart can be related to: 1. Worsening of cardiac function (systolic dysfunction of the left ventricle): You mentionned that your last x-ray showed that your heart was enlarged compared to a previous x-ray, and although you mentionned that you have a good ef%, yet you have not mentionned what are the dimensions of the left ventricle or was it enlarged or not.  2. Right ventricular dysfunction: You have not mentionned anything about your right ventricle and what was the function of the right ventricle, was it enlarged? and what was your pulmonary artery pressure (although i think it is not going to be abnormal since you have mild tricuspid regurge only).  3. Diastolic dysfunction (abnormal relaxation of the heart): Easily detected by echo and can be related to: A. Long standing hypertension: leading to development of a thick septum (you have a thick septum on the echo). Yet a thick septum could also be an abnormal congenital disease (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy) or could be secondary to other diseases. B. Cardiac ischemia (Coronary disease): You mentionned something about your doctor telling you that you had \"some type of damage but nothing to really worry about\". Has this been looked into further? There are some changes that sometimes appear on the echo.  4. Tachycardia: How about the palpitations that you have been having every time? Was any abnormal rhythm ever recorded?   What about syndrome x, are you taking any medications for syndrome x? Are you trying to lose any weight? Are you taking any formulas or other products to help you lose weight? Are you following-up with an endocrinologist? Was your cholesterol checked before?  If your left ventricle and right ventricle are normal and you don't have diastolic dysfunction. You can have a holter monitor to see whether you have an abnormal rhythm that correlates with your symptoms. You can also have the \"heart damage\" that you had investigated by having a stress test. If all of these are normal, then it could be either your fibromyelgia that is giving you all these problems, other diagnosis like chronic fatigue syndrome or may be you are having panic attacks (although i don't like to say that a lot) as it is obvious that you are under a lot of stress because of your daughter and son's illnesses.

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding to my questions. I will type in everything that I have in front of me as far as the last echo done in March of 2003: IMPRESSION: 1) The left atruim is 3.8cm. The mitral valve appears to open well. No significant mitral stenosis. Trace of Mitral reguritation on color as well as doppler. 2)The aortic size is normal. The aortic valve appears to open well. The gradient is normal. No significant aortic stenosis or regurg. on color as well as doppler. 3)The left ventricular size is 4.8 in end diastole. The is some evidence of septal hypertrophy. The septal thickness is 1.4cm. The left ventricular contractility appears to be normal. EF62%. 4)The right ventricular size is 2.4 high normal. Trace of tricuspid regurg., on color as well as doppler. 5)The right ventricular systolic pressure is normal. 6)No eveidence of significant pericardial effusion.  I don't really know if this can help you or not, I am just 28 yrs old and shouldn't be having all the problems I have ...... I used to be in every athletic thing that was out there, I don't have asthma, or anything else going on with the lungs, no one has ever put me on any med's for Syndrome X, just watching my diet. My weight as far as legs arms well everything on my body has been great except with the abdomen area swelling up, and ultra sound everytime says there is fluid??? But no one has ever looked into where this fluid is coming from...... Muscle weighs more than fat,, I am very muscular, My weight only went up with this swelling I am 163 and holding haven't changed any in 2 yrs.. I was 124 before all this started happening.... So I don't know why all this is happening... The only stresses in my life are of course my childrens illnesses, but not really to much,,, and the fact that my husband died in 2000. I am happily remarried, I work 12 hr shifts on the MED/SURG floor, I get lots of exercise as far as walking, I really only eat about 2x a day, Very healthy due to diabetic son.... I do not drink alcohol due to growing up with an alcoholic father... And I absolutely do not allow drugs anywhere around me or my family... So as far as why I am even having all this happen I really do not know.. Do you think I maybe should have a stress test done,, and another echo of the heart to make sure there have not been any changes? Please let me know what you think,, thank you very much LYN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Memorylane4ever,  Thank you very much for the update.  Your echo of march 2003 is normal. However, it does not mention anything about the diastolic function (how the heart relaxes), but, i would assume that if there was something wrong with it, they would have mentionned it. If your condition has been essentially the same since you had this echo, there is no need to repeat it (and if you want to repeat it just to make sure, i would leave this to the discretion of your doctor).  You have not mention anything about the palpitations that you have been having and how frequently it happens and whether you have any associated symptoms? About the chest pain that you have been having, if you don't have it during exercise, most probably it is not of cardiac origin (young females are usually protected by their hormones) and i would suggest not to pursue it unless your doctor wants to see what was the \"some type of damage that you really does not need to worry about\".  When you mentionned the fluid that is found every time an ultrasound is done, is it in your abdomen or in your legs because i did not really get this part straight. If it is in your abdomen, it has to be looked into. Unless the liver imaging that was done and showed that you had fatty liver was to look into the cause of the fluid (in addition to the high liver enzymes that you had of course) and only fatty liver was found. Also, the weight gain that you had, is it all attributed to fluid?  From the echo results, it sounds that the origin of your shortness of breath is not from the heart.  Otherwise, i would suggest to have a thyroid test, complete blood count and a c-reactive protein done (unless already done).

If you have not had any trouble with running like shortness of breath, dizziness, near fainting, chest pains, palpitations that are new to you, i think it is ok to practice long distance running on a condition that you be checked every year at the most with an echocardiogram and you report any new onset symptoms to your doctor.

    "title": "Re: Chest pain",
    "content": "Dear Cindy,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Chest pain is usually worrisome for coronary disease. Coronary disease has factors the presence/absence of which can usually predict fairly well the probability of the person complaining of chest pain having or not having coronary disease.  These risk factors include family history, smoking, hypertension, diabetes, high cholesterol, sedentary life style and obesity. You did not mention your family history and whether it is positive for coronary disease (first degree male relative with a heart attack before 50 years and/or first degree female relative with a heart attack before 60 years) and whether you smoke or not, whether you excercise regularly and how much do you weigh.  Chest pain caused by heart disease usually has certain characteritics. It usually occurs on exertion, lasts for a few minutes and is relieved by rest. Its location is usually behind the breast bone and can move to other places like the left arm, the back or the neck. If severe enough it can be associated with nausea, vomiting and sweating.   Its character is usually a sharp pain, but can be perceived by patients as pressure, burning or stabbing sensation.  You did not mention under which circumstances do you usually get the pain, how long does it last and whether or not you have any associated symptoms.  The answer to all these questions makes it most of the time easy on the physician to decide the origin of the chest pain and whether it is cardiac in origin or not (from the heart).  Obviously if the only source of chest pain was the heart, it would have been very easy for doctors to diagnose all patients who present with chest pain, but there are other sources and the symptoms are sometimes vague enough so that doctors resort to other resources to try to diagnose the source of the pain.   And here comes the role of investigations such as ekg and others. An ekg showing septal infarct in females is sometimes not specifice as the placement of the leads on the female's chest is sometimes not accurate because of the breasts. And you did not mention whether the infarction on the ekg was acute or old.  Your doctor did the right thing by sending you to the emergency department and my guess is that they thought the pain that you are having is most probably not heart related and that is why they did not admit you to the hospital. And you did not mention what they thought was the reason behind the chest pain.  Your history of dvt (deep vein thrombosis) is very pertinent to the development of chest pain. Of the causes of chest pain is pulmonary embolization which is travelling of a blood clot from veins in the legs and pelvis to the blood vessels of the lungs and this is common in patients who either have or had dvt before.   However, you did not mention what were the circumstances under which you developed dvt as dvt is somewhat expected in patients who have had surgery, or had a prolonged illness and had to remain in the hospital in bed for a while and were not given prophylaxis against dvt or if you have taken contraceptive pills for a while (particularly if you were smoking at the same time) and then you developed dvt and you had to stop them. You also did not mention what are the treatment that you received and for how long. If you had dvt under such circumstances then most probably there will be no need for you to be checked for a hypercoagulable state at this time.   Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com, i hope that this information helped and waiting for your response..   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jc10fc,  Mitral valve prolapse is a very common condition.  In many cases, it is associated with mitral regurge.   The natural history of mitral valve prolpase with mitral regurge could stay the same for ever or progress to severe mitral regurge which necessitates mitral valve repair or replacement.  In your case, you should have echocardiograms done every year at least to make sure that it is not getting worse. In case of development of new symptoms like worsening shortness of breath you should call your doctor.  Also, if you are going to have your teeth worked on you have to tell your dentist about your condition as some dental procedures should be accompanied by antibiotics given to the patient before hand.

    "content": "I have written several times before with questions about mitral and aortic valve surery. I had surgery to repair both valves 10 weeks ago and havce several questions. The mitral valve was very detoriated and one of the leaflets was completely curled under. He was able to repair the valve and insert a ring to hold it. The aortic valve was less severe and only needed minor repairs. the surgeon told me that the left atrium was enlarged but the venttricel was okay. Before the surgeon began the surgery he said that the valve could fail on the table, in 2 months, 2 years or never.   I am still having some symptoms which concern me. I am still out of breathe going up and down stair and when I bend over to tie my shoes or whatever. Is this normal and just takes time or does this indicate a problem. What are the the implications of an enlarged left atrium? Will the atrium return to normal size, is there any reason to be concerned? I am no longer on coumadin and am taking lopressor 2 times a day. I quess my real questions is, is the mitral valve failing?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sharon,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Happy to hear that you are doing well after surgery so far.   It is still a little bit too early. i think you should give yourself a 6 months period to judge your symptoms putting in mind that you have to go through extensive postoperative cardiac rehabilitation since most probably you were out of shape before surgery.  If you are concerned about failing of the mitral valve, the best thing to do is have an echocardiogram and see whether there is any complications or whether the mitral valve regurgitation is still present at the same degree before surgery.  A dilated left atrium in your case is caused by the abnormal large amount of blood that it was getting from the left ventricle because of the incompetent mitral valve. Since the valve has been repaired there is no more blood going to it and its size should go down in 6 months or so.   The other thing is that sometimes patients who are on beta blockers (one of them is lopressor) get short of breath if they have a history of asthma.  i think that you are going to see your doctor soon for follow-up anyway and you can raise these concerns and suggest that you have an echocardiogram if you are not already scheduled to have one and may i suggest a transesophageal echocardiogram not a regular transthoracic.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I have had a heart murmur since I was a child, I can remember my doctor telling me I had  the murmer everytime I went in to see him, I had step throat a lot as a child, about monthly.  I had begun to have dizzy spells in 1999 with the shortness of breath, finally my FP doctor sent me to a cardiologist in 2001 I have had symptoms on and off since my diagnosis but over the last two weeks I havent been able to shake the symptoms.  I have had constant shortness of breath and dizziness, blackouts, chest pain and pressure, pallipatations and some svt.  I went to the hospital two weeks ago and my ekg was \"normal\" but I had the bradycardia present and my blood work was normal.  My HR was in the low 40's, I was sent home.  I had a followup with my family practice doctor one week later, still feeling the same symptoms, and my BP was 111/53, I was given an ekg and it showed the bradycardia, I was given 60 of Toridol for the chest pain and had an echo later that afternoon at my cardiologist office.  I am still waiting for my echo results and have and appt with my cardiologist tomorrow, but I am concerned with my symptoms.   What are the typical considerations for valve repair and do my symptoms seem on course with my diagnosis?  I am worried about diastolic heart failure because of my symptoms but have very mild edema in my legs and and wouldnt an ekg show if that were the case?  Thank you for your time.

    "content": "Dear SunnyGirl,   Echocardiography gives a lot of information about the valves that the cath can not provide like how does the valve actually look like, what is the exact velocity of the blood at the valve and is there any stenosis or regurge at the valve and others info. That's why evaluation of valves by echocardiogram is preffered. If the cath did not show the regurge i would think that the regurge is not that significant but i suggest that you have to follow up with an echocardiogram and if you start to have symptoms it would not be a bad idea to be started on medications.  You have to remember that all tests are not 100% sensitive nor 100% specific meaning that sometimes you will have the disease but the test will not detect it and sometimes you do not have the disease and the test will say that you have it.  We have to use our clinical judgement in addition to the test results always.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Hello, I need some info about mitral valve repalcement or repairs. My father in law had open heart sugery 13 years ago and had three major blockages and had his aortic valve replaced. He is the hospital right now in ICCU on oxygen. Yesterday morning he felt as if he was having a heart attack and couldn't breath but had no chest pain but did have nausea and vomiting. For the past 2 months he has been on a waiting list to have his Mitral valve repaired or replaced and a double by-pass because two of his arteries are badly blocked again. He has a lot of swelling in legs and stomach and is taking medication to reduce it, so far in the past two weeks he has lost over 20 pounds of fluid but he is still very bloated looking. He hasn't been able to sleep and is generally ill. He cannot lay back on his bed completley because he loses his breath and nods off while sitting up and cuts off breathing when his head falls forward. He feels he is on a need to know basis and won't let the doctor tell him anything becasue he worries to much which is understandable, but his children need and want to know what is the outcome if he goes in to have this sugery done or what will happen if he doesn't . We walk on egg shells around him trying not to get his blood pressure up or to worsen his Asthma. He is 60 years old right now and we need to know if the rumors we heard are true, they are as follows:                    If he does have the emergency surgery , will he die from it ?                    What will happen if he doesn't have the surgery ?                    Can they operate if he is still taking his blood thinners ?                    Should the family (his children) come home from out of the provience right away ?                    What are the chances of him having the surgery and having a complete recovery ?  Please, anyone who has any information pass it along. It would be greatly appreciated, we don't want to lose our father but we certainly don't want him to suffer.   Tahnk-You so much and please feel free to email me anytime at my email address but please put in the SUBJECT LINE \" MITRAL VALVE SURGERY\"  Thanks again and best wishes and good luck to everyone out there with any problems, God Bless.\n\n",

From what I know of her condition, she had high blood pressure which was under control and congestive heart failure which was getting progressively worse. When she went to the hospital the last admission, she was sent because her lower abdomen was swollen and my sister thought that her urinary catheter was blocked and she had no urinary output. My grandmother was in severe pain. The surgeon called and said that an immediate exploratory was necessary as he suspected a blocked intestine. She came out of the surgery and the surgeon said she was fine and would probably go home in five days ( the intestines weren't blocked- she was impacted). The next day when I visited, I noticed that there was not any output in the catheter bag. The surgeon said she was fine. Shortly after the hospital called me at home and she was put on a ventilator because of fluid around the heart(?) She passed away the following day after having some heart rhythm problems. My question has to do with the cause of death on her death certificate. Number one is Acute and Necrosis Secondary to Hypertension and COPD. I am doing genealogy on the family and forty years from now someone will be puzzled as to what in the world she died of. What is Acute and Necrosis? I would like to put it in terms someone in the future can understand. Thank you for your help. Cookie\n\n",

They are recommending repair or replacement, but have first put her on Altace for one month, then a follow-up visit.  She has no idea of the degree of regurgitation and did not quite understand much of what the doctor told her.  Except to hear those dreaded words \"open heart surgery.\"  I live 10 hours away and cannot go with her to the doctor.  I also have been diagnosed with mitral valve prolaplse, mitral regurgitation, & tricuspid regurgitation by echocardiogram.  I am 44  years old.  All I was ever told about the results was that  I have 2+ mitral regurgitation & 1+ tricuspid regurgitation & the prolapse.  I had the echo because of palpitations I was having. The family doctor then put me on Inderal LA 120mg.    My question is....What is the varying degrees of severity?  And how do they decide who needs surgery?  Also, should I contact my HMO doctor and asked to be referred to a Cardiologist?  How often should I have an Echo?  It has been 3 years since I had mine.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  Regarding your mother, i think if the doctor who told that she needs replacement or repair was a cardiologist then i would assume that there are indications to do so. Starting altace might indicate that she has some degree of heart failure and the altace is being used to try to decrease the load on the heart and having heart failure would be an indication to operate.   Usually the patients who need surgery are the ones who have severe mitral regurgitation and the decision of who should go to surgery puts several factors into consideration: 1. Presence or absence of symptoms. 2. Function of the heart. 3. Whether the mitral valve could be repaired or not. 4. Presence of abnormal irregular heart beats and/or elevation in the pulmonary pressure.  About your condition, yes, i think that you should be followed by a cardiologist and be seen according to the current recommendations at least every 6 months and have an echocardiogram at least every 12 months.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  An ejection fraction of 70% means that your heart function is normal.   Mitral regurgitation causes an overload of blood on the heart. It differs from person to person how long can the heart take it.  i do not think that there are specified time frames to decide when to interfere surgically. Meaning that i can not predict when the patient might need surgery to replace the valve. It all depends on the patient's symptoms. At this point you mentionned that you have a 35% damaged valve but you did not tell me what is the degree of regurgitation. Is it mild, moderate or severe? Also, you have not said whether you are suffering from any symptoms such as shortness of breath, chest pain, palpitations, dizziness, swelling of the ankles and if yes how severe and how long have you been suffering.  If you have clinically significant mitral regurgitation, i think you should be started on medications that would decrease the overload on the heart and thus slow progression of the disease.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped and if you still have any questions, please, do not hesitate to ask.

    "title": "Mitral valve and aortic valve surgery",
    "content": "I went to see the surgeon on Friday and a 3-D echocardiogram was performed. The doctors suggested that different drugs be used to decrease the down load in my heart. When I told them that had been done before but my blood pressure had dropped to very low levels they suggested that I try diuretics. I believe that the thought was to buy me several more months, possibly 6 before they do surgery. But why do I need to \"buy more time\"?If I feel tired most all of the time, and have for so long, what kind of time am I buying. Is there something more that I don't understand? I was also told that if they cannot repair the mitral valve then if will need to be replaced with a mechanical valve, because I am too young (52 years) for a tissue valve. Can you tell me how long a mechanical valve last? The surgeon thought that he could place several stitches in the aortic valve and that should take care of that problem. Since the surgeon would do both valves an incision of 6-8 inches would be needed...is that still considered minimally invasive?  I have a \"crazy\" history of immune disorders. I had transverse myelitis, years back, after suffering from the flu. I was paralized from the neck down and stayed in the hospital for close to 3 months. It has left me with weak legs and a neuro-genic bladder. So going on lasix sounds like nightmare to me. Somehow I think that running to the bathroom all day is going to be tiring. I all ready get up during the night to go to the bathroom 4 or 5 times, and that is without lasix! 6 years ago I had a bad sinus infection that just didn't want to go away. My immune system decided to attack my optic nerve and rendered me totally lblind. After 7 months of treatment, 6 months on chemo-therapy drugs to depress my immune system, I was able to retain some vision. I am telling you these things because I think that time is not always in my favor and \"wierd\" things seem to happen quickly in my case. Is my thought process \"off base\" with this kind of thinking? My neurologist thinks that a valve repair may give me a new lease on life and just generally make me feel so much better.  Perhaps I didn't fully explain my history well to the surgeon. It can be difficult talking with them, especially when they start running the test, because it feels like I would be interupting while they were doing the echo. I think this is a problem for most patients. So I have a date for surgery BUT I also will start on lasix this week. The worse part is that there are still unanswered questions and I don't know how long they will wait until they decide to do the surgery. All the labs were done, as they recommended, and they are only good for 1 month. I sure would just like to get this over and go on with my life...am I wrong to feel this way...am I over-looking a benefit? I would appreciate your thoughts on this. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sharon,  Thank you very much for using our website and for the update.  Decreasing the load on the heart can be done with various medications including lasix, but usually lasix and other diuretics are used when the patient has fluid overload (like swelling in the ankles and legs, fluid in the lungs and around them and so forth). If you do not have excess fluid in your body you could end up with dehydration.   Of course, i have not seen or examined you and i do not know the dose of the lasix that is going to be started but unless you have excessive fluid i suggest that the dose would be small. If you do not have any excess fluid then the best step is to give the medications that take the load of the heart in the least tolerable dose for you.  About mechanical and tissue valves, it was found that mechanical valves survive longer than tissue valves so it makes sense to use mechanical valves in younger patients. The drawback as i already mentionned in a previous answer is that you will have to take a blood thinner for life.   i think the you ought to ask the surgeon the question of why does he want to postpone the surgery unless you are in obvious heart failure and he is giving you the lasix to make your heart failure improve and then wait till your condition stabilizes completely and then proceed  with surgery.  About the minimally invasive surgery, minimally invasive means either having a smaller incision or not using the bypass pump. An incision 6-8 inches sounds to me a little bit generous for a minimally invasive procedure as the incision is usually somwhere between 4-6 cm (Still i am not a surgeon and the field of minimally invasive surgery is changing all the time and i am not uptodate on it).

    "content": "Dear Sharon,  Thank you very much for using our website and thank you for the update.  Minimally invasive cardiac surgery is a new technique develloped in cardiac surgery like coronary artery bypass and valve repair and replacement. It requires certain expertise on the side of the surgery-anesthesia team. It is not widespread and not every body is familiar with it.  As the name implies the incision done is smaller. Surgical technique is somewhat different and there are more technological tools used to aid the team during surgery.   Visualization of the mitral and aortic valves is adequate but limited and surgery is more technically demanding.  It has certain advantages and has its disadvantages as well.  Advantages: 1.   Patient being taken off the breathing machine earlier. 2.   Less blood loss. 3.   Less postoperative pain. 4.   Lower incidence of pericardial effusion. 5.   Lower incidence of abnormal cardiac rhythms. 6.   More complete and rapid recuperation. 7.   Decreased risk of sternal infection and instability. 8.   Fewer postoperative lung complications. 9.   Superior cosmetic result. 10. Shorter length of hospitalization.  In cases of aortic valve surgery using minimally invasive technique, comparison done between conventional and  minimally invasive technique was encouraging. On the other hand, in cases of mitral valve surgery, comparison has been more controversial (meaning that it did not offer much benefit and may be same rate of complication and it is more difficult technically).  If your doctor wants to wait and there is no pulmonary hypertension as you mentionned, then i guess you should be started on medications (unless you are already on them) that will help with your symptoms, make you feel better and improve you heart function as well. In addition, you have to be under good supervision and follow-up.  Regarding replacing the two valves in the same time or repairing one and replacing the other in the same procedure, or doing each procedure separately, i guess this goes back to the surgeon and whether he is comfortable doing both procedures in the same time or he would like to do each on separate occasions.

    "content": "Dear Natalie,  Thank you very much for using our website.  A heart attack in a female at your age is extremely rare unless (as females are at your age are protected by their hormones against hardening of the arteries [atherosclerosis] which is the number one cause of heart attacks). Although that rare it is not unheard of. It happens in cases where the patient has many and severe risk factors for coronary atherosclerosis like high blood pressure, diabetes, high cholesterol, smoking, strong family history of coronary disease.  Coronary disease due to causes other than atherosclerosis are also very rare and for example include an embolus (blood clot coming from somewhere else not originating from the coronaries) to the coronary arteries.  An ecg with an old inferior infarct could just mean that you are short and stout or the simple fact that you were not taking an enough deep breath while the ecg was recorded.  15 minutes on the treadmill   wow, touch wood, i have only seen few people who went that far.    And what do you mean by abnormal stress test    Going 15 minutes on the treadmill means that you reached stage 5 if you were exercised according to the standard protocol. Any body who reaches stage three and even has a real abnormal stress test then treatment would only be by medications and not by surgery. Also, going 15 mintues on the treadmill means that you have excellent physical fitness and aerobic capacity.  About the echo findings of mitral incompetence, how severe it is?? My guess it is not, as if you really had severe mitral incompetence you would have not be able to go that much time on the treadmill. My guess it was just an incidental finding. Since the echo was evented many otherwise healthy normal people were found to have trace or mild mitral incompetence.  Unless you have mitral valve prolapse which could be the cause of mitral incopetence or have a history of rheumatic fever.  About heart failure in young patients, there is an entity called viral myocarditis which is a disease that be caused by nearly any virus and this virus causes damage to the heart and subsequent heart failure and the ecg can give the same picture as an old heart attack.   You did not mention anything about your heart function on the echo but my guess it is normal.  What do you do? i guess you have already been seen by your doctor who ordered all those tests. If he is not a cardiologist, then i would recommend that you see a cardiologist who can assess you and decides whether or not it is worth your while and money to be followed up by him.

I do have a family history of heart problems, and that is one thing that does scare me. I have no other heath risks for CHD.     I took 2 ECG tests prior to going to the cardiologist that both should the 'old inferior infarc'. I believe that it was on the 3rd line of the ECG at the QRS section. I'm not sure right now as I don't have a copy. When I did the stress test ECG, the cardiologist said that I had great aerobic capacity, but there was some abnormal sections on the ECG. He said that it might be my heart that isn't sitting properly (perhads, slightly turned).    As far as myocarditis, that is what the doctor at the clinic and the cardiologist said that I may have had 3 weeks ago when I was complaning about chest pain.

In cases of mitral regurge caused by rheumatic fever, the condition of the valve is the major factor to decide about wether reparing or replacing the valve. With rheumatic fever, the valve could be firbosed or calcified to the extenet that it can not be repaired. For younger people (like yourself), most of the people agree that mechanical valves last longer than tissue valves, although they have the drawback of having to be on blood thinners and watched real close.  Yes, the chest has to be cracked to replace and repair the valves. Both valves could be replaved in the same procedure but  it depends on the surgeon and what is more comfortable form him to do.  You mentionned symptoms like fatigue and shortness of breath. You have not mentionned about swelling of the legs and belly distention. These symptoms mean that you have developed right sided heart failure which means that you might have developed pulmonary hypertension which if irreversible then replacing the valve will not help. Having had a cath means that most probably had been ruled out.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Dear Gabby,  Thank you very much for using our website and welcome.  Using fen/phen combination was found to be associated with problems with the heart valves in the form of aortic, mitral and tricuspid involvement (less than aortic and mitral valve though).  In most of the patients, it was found that the lesions of the valves become stable and even regress.  Your echocardiogram shows that you have aortic regurge, pulmonary hypertension and tricuspid regurge.   The cause of aortic regurge could very well be caused by the fen/phen combination. In aortic regurge the ejection fraction is affected very late. The important things on the echo (in addition to the ejection fraction that they mentionned) are quantification of the regurge (and i assume that they did that based on the degree of regurge that they mentionned on the report) and the second thing is the size of the left ventricle which you did not mention in your message but that i am sure is present in your report. If the size is bigger than normal then most probably unless you have another disease that could affect the heart like coronary disease or others then this means that the aortic regurge is affecting your heart.  The tricuspid regurge could be because of the pulmonary hypertension Pulmonary hypertension in itself can be caused by many causes.  My advice to you is to be under medical supervision. If you have any sypmtoms, you should be seeing a doctor the sooner the better because aortic regurge has to be treated by medications. These symptoms actually you might already have some of them like shortness of breath on exertion, some swelling of your ankles, some headaches and low energy levels.  In addition, if you are about to have any invasive medical procedure including but not limited to dental procedures, you have to take antibiotics before any of these procedures to protect posible infection of the valve if bacteria reaches the blood by any chance. In addition you have to have follow-up of your aortic regurge by echocardiogram every 6-12 months to make sure it is not progressing. Also, the cause of pulmonary hypertension has to be investigated and found and treated if possible to decrease the chance of progression of the pulmonary hypertension.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope you find this information helpful and waiting for your update.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again Doctor,  I am sorry that I didn't mention the Left Ventricle  function, which is normal at this point.  I am having symptoms.  I have swelling in my ankles and my calves get hard as a rock, but I attributed that to sitting at my computer for long periods of time.  I have complete tiredness, and am sleepy much of the time during the day.  A sleep study was performed a few years ago, that was basically uneventful, so the doctor I had at the time said I didn't have sleep apnea.   So I take naps that leave me feeling refreshed for a short while.   I am having breathing difficulties, especially with climbing stairs and fast walking.  My chest feels tight, and when I am lying down and turn to lay on my left side, my heart just pounds.   I do have headaches more frequently also.  Pre Fen Phen I had no heart murmer,  because I was given an EKG, before being treated with Fen Phen.   Post Fen Phen use, I was found to have a systolic ejection murmer which was put on my report at the time, which would be spring 1997, as probably benign.  In Oct. of last year I had an asthmatic like episode, that sent me to a clinic to see an FNP.  She said I had very little air circulating in my lungs.  When she had me breath deeply I got very faint.   She thought it was an asthma attack, but I have never had asthma in my life, and there is no family history of it either, but what I learned Doctor, from other women who have been diagnosed with Pulmonary Hypertension, is that most of them were diagnosed with Asthma to start with, before they had further testing to determine that they indeed had Pulmonary Hypertension.  I will be calling my state's Department Of Social Services, to see if I can qualify for some sort of medical coverage.  I hope so!  Thank you so much for replying to my post.   It was a great help to me.     Gabby\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Gabby,  You mentionned the function of the left ventricle in your previous reply. i meant someting else, the size of the left ventricle, is it enlarged or normal.  Regarding the symptoms that you have, they could be because of physical unftiness, obesity itself, your heart condition or an undiagnosed lung condition.  Lung conditions that can give rise to pulmonary hypertension are many and here are some few examples: 1. Emphysema (in cases of smokers). Are you a smoker? 2. Repeated blood clots of the lungs. 3. Fibrosis of the lungs. 4. Prolonged severe asthma. 5. Sometimes pulmonary hypertension is found and a reason is not found for it and is then termed primary pulmonary hypertension. 6. Sleep apnea.  You have to be medically evaluated in order to determine where is the origin of your symptoms and then treated accordingly.

Though, the thickness of the posterior wall of the heart and of the septum between the two ventricles is a little bit over the limit and this means that there is a strain or pressure against which the heart is pumping which usually means that the person has high blood pressure (you did not mention anything about it) or aortic stenosis (you have regurge as you mentionned).  About sleep apnea, it can develop at any time especially if you have not lost weight. And it is a good thing that you do not smoke (unless you were in the past).

The thing that was found to be most consistant though was the neck circumference, meaning the thinckness of the neck. So, it depends on how thick is your neck.

    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.   The mitral valve apparatus is composed of mitral annulus, leaflets, chordae tendineae and papillary muscles.   Acute mitral regurgitation caused by acute damage of the mitral valve can be caused by several reasons including:   - Ruptured chordae tendineae whether because of mitral valve prolapse or not.  - Papillary muscle rupture or malfunction from a heart attack.  - Infection of the valve by bacteria.  - Trauma to the valve apparatus itself.   In cases of mitral valve prolapse, the abnormality is thought to be secondary to some kind of a degenerative process.   In cases of mitral valve prolapse, rupture of the chordae tendineae is more common in males over 50 years who actually have chronic mitral regurge and this leads to worsening of their already present mitral regurge.

There is no contraindication in using actos if you have mitral valve prolapse.   Actos side effects on the heart include hypertrophy of the heart muscle and gaining fluid and weight. So if you have heart failure and symptomatic it is better not to use it.   The most common side effects though and the one any patient who will be using actos should be monitored for is liver problems and the liver enzymes have to be monitored regularly every 2 months during the first year of therapy at least.

Are the valves anatomically abnormal (meaning is there a specific valve disease like rheumatic heart disease or mitral valve prolpase?)   Some people will just be discovered to have these leaking valves on echocardiogram without any clinical significance. If there are no symptoms, then i would totally ignore those findings because many cardiologists think that there is nothing we can do if there are no symptoms. Once symptoms start then the patient has to be re-evaluated and followed-up closely.   The only thing to take care of here is if you are going to have any kind of medical procedure including dental work, you have to tell your doctor about this for the probability of receiving antibiotics before the procedure.

    "content": "Dear Susan,   Most of the congential heart defects alter the normal lung circulation. Many of them will increase the blood going to the lungs. The lungs have to protect themselves from the extrablood they receive, and the way they do it is by constricting the arteries going to them (pulmonary arteries). Unfortunately, if this constriction lasts for a long time, it becomes irreversible (a process known as Eisenmenger's syndrome). And irreversible means that even if the congenital defect is corrected by surgery, the pulmonary vessels will remain constricted for ever and there is nothing that could be done except lung or heart-lung transplantation to cure this.

    "content": "Dear Nancy,  Thank you vey much for using our website.  Having a dilated left atrium is a reflection of one of two things, either a dilated left ventricle or a disease of the mitral valve whether stenosis or regurgitation.  The left atrium being dilated carries several risks including: 1. Blood stagnation inside the atrium, blood clot formation inside the atrium and the risk of this blood clot breaking and causing a stroke if it travels to the brain. 2. Heart rhythm becoming irregular.  Dilatation of the left ventricle usually means that there is a burden on the left ventricle in the form of more blood coming to it and that the left ventricle has to provide more space for this blood so it dilates to accomodate it. The left ventricle and atrium being dilated are two different clinical settings but are both considered clinically significant and have to followed.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

I don't do all the excercises every day and try to alternate. I work out about an hour to an hour and a half during the excercise days.

    "content": "Dear guest,   Thank you very much for using our website.   After echocardiograms were discovered, mild cases of valve regurgitation especially aortic and mitral have been discovered. Regurgitation might be so mild that it does not have any significant hemodynamic effect on your heart.   A person that has hemodynamically significant mitral regurgitation can not exercise the kind of exercise that you describe simply becuase his heart can not take it.   i have not seen you or examined you personaly, but it looks that even if you have mitral regurge, it looks that it is not affecting you in any way. You also did not mention what was the size of your left ventricle and the size of your left atrium and the ejection fraction percentage on the echocardiogram, did you have mitral valve prolapse? because some of these paramaters help with the assessment of the case in general. Other consideration is why did you have the echocardiogram? Did you have any symptoms? Do you have any chronic medical problems?   Regarding the progress of the disease, it is according to the cause of the regurgitation. But if you are concerned, you can have a follow up echocardiogram every year to make sure that you are following the regurgitation or at the first symptom of unusual (to you) shortness of breath for your usual exertion, you have to call your doctor to arrange for another echocardiogram.

    "content": "Dear Teresa,   Thank you very much for using our website.   You have mitral regurgitation and you have symptoms.   You did not mention when did you start to have symptoms? And were you diagnosed with mitral regurgitation before or after the echocardiogram?  And if i understood right, you had the echo very recently.   The use of the combination of fenfluramine/phentermine was associated with valvular regurgitant heart disease especially of the aorta and the mitral valve. Yet, on discontination of the medications, it was found that the patients stabilized and that a percentage of them actually improved.   If you do not have any left ventricular or left atrial enlargement with good ejection fraction and no pulmonary hypertension, being so short of breath could be the result of the mitral regurge or could be the result of you being non-physically fit (as a result of your weight if you have not lost enough weight after using the fen/phen combination) or at least the weight could be a contributing factor meaning that this shortness of breath could be caused by the combination of you having not the perfect heart and being overweight (if you are).   i think that an echocardiogram is a good tool in good hands. But if necessary a cardiac cath could be done to assess the left ventricle volumes and the ejection fraction as well.   If the symptoms that you have are related to mitral regurgitation then you will have to be started on medication to decrease the amount of blood that regurgitates back into the lungs so that you feel less short of breath particularly during exercise.   If there is a place for repair of the valve, then the best thing to do is to repair the valve as many doctors prefer this to replacement of the valve particularly in younger patients.   If your symptoms are ruled to be because of the mitral regurge, i think five years are sufficient for the effect of the fen/phen combination to improve and my advice to you is most probably to have repair of the valve if possible.   You have to understand that i have not seen you or examined you and that the best thing to do is to wait for your cardiologist to give the final word.

    "title": "Re: Mitral regurgitation and pregnancy",
    "content": "Dear Nancy,   Thank you very much for using our website.   Answering your last question about dilatation of left atrium and when should a cardiolgist should be concerned. Your left atrium is not terribly enlarged. The reason that the left atrium is enlarged is that the blood goes back from the left ventricle to the left atrium (up the wrong way) and then the left atrium already has blood coming to it from the lungs so it has to get bigger to able to accomodate the extra amount of blood and then the same thing happens with the left ventricle, it enlarges to accomodate the extra amount of blood coming to it from the left atrium (although it will occur to you but this is originally the amount that the left ventricle gave back to the atrium), but let's leave it here.   Anyway, if the mitral regurge becomes severe and the patient becomes symptomatic then the left atrial dilatation will progress. The dangers that dilatation of the left atrium carries is development of an abnormal heart rhythm and stagnation of blood with development of blood clot in the left atrium that could brake down and cause blood clots anywhere in the body and the commonest is the development of stroke. The best way of course is to make sure that the mitral regurge is not progressing and if it then the best thing to do i guess is to go for valve repair if the valve is repairable and most of the cardiac surgeons now prefer repair because it prevents long term anticoagulation if you have a mechanical valve.   Now about pregnancy, mitral regurge is usually well tolerated during pregnancy unless very severe, because of some hemodynamic changes that occur during pregnancy. Regarding the medications there are medications that could be used during pregnancy safely without affecting the fetus. The problem is usuallu during labor because of the effort that labor pauses on the heart. But this can managed safely in the hands of an experinced doctor without problem and with good medical supervision.   You never said how your pregnancy went as it is usually the rule if the first pregnancy went fine and the mitral regurge has been more or less stable then the odds that your second pregnancy will pass without problems are usually very high.   Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that i will not create any conflict between you and your husband regarding this matter as it seems i said what he wanted to hear. Good luck, and do not hesitate to post further concerns.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Shane,   Thank you very much for using our webiste.   How old are you? How tall are you and how much do you weigh?   Was the echocardiogram that you had through the chest wall or through swallowing something like a scope (called transesophageal).   How long have you these symptoms of shortness of breath and by saying you get them often what do you mean? How frequent, how far can you go on ground level before getting short of breath and how many flight of stairs can you climg without problems?   Do you have any other medical problems? And why do you follow-up with a cardiac surgeon?   In layman's terms, you have 4 chambers in your heart, 2 left and 2 right. In between these chambers there are doors (called valves), some of these doors (valves) like the mitral valve are kept in place by strings or ropes (called cordae tendinae). The doors have a function of closing and opening to keep blood going in a forward manner all the time.   What you have is that the miral valve is not closing when it should causing the blood to go in the wrong direction. And from the echo report, i assume that reason is that the ropes attached to the valves (cordae tenindae) are torn from the valve. This looks like it is severe to me until proven otherwise. If this continues for a while and it is not corrected especially that you are stating to complain of shortness of breath, you run the risk of developing heart failure that could be irreversible at one time.   My advice to you is to seek help at a cardiologist and he can tell you exactly what to do and he might also ask to undergo catheterization of the left side of the heart to assess the severity of the condition.

    "content": "Dear Gigget,   Thank you very much for using our website.   You got this one right.   If you give a patient with fixed obstructive (stenotic lesion) like aortic stenosis a vasodilator like an ace-i, the patient will have vasodilatation with decrease in blood pressure but he will not be able to increase the cardiac output because the door is closed.   The question is why do you want to give these patients ace-i and the answer is because some of them have heart failure, so ace-i should be given.   Some authorities do not recommend giving people with heart failure secondary to aortic stenosis or with associated aortic stenosis ace-i because of the problem of developing hypotension and syncope. On the other hand some say it could be given in addition to other heart failure medications but you have to be very very cautious.   The best treatment for these patients (of course that is if they can tolerate surgery) is valve replacement once there is an indication.

    "content": "Dear Andrea,  Thank you very much for using our website.  My sympathies and condolensces about your brother.  Bacterial endocarditis means infection of a heart valve. It is not something that is picked up along the years and can be detected by regular check-ups. It is something that happens acutely like any other infection. Infection of a heart valve usually has a bad prognosis and in most of the cases the prognosis is worse if the patient has an artificial valve because it is usually more difficult to treat infected artificial heart valves.  The case presentation could be very acute like with your brother and could take few days to few weeks even.  It is usually treated with hospitalization and big doses of continuous iv antibiotics for a long time. If the patient does not respond, espeically if there is an artificial valve and if his medical condition allows according to what his doctor thinks, change of the valve and putting a new one in is the treatment of choice (if patient can to go through such a surgery).  i do not know about your brother's condition and the word \"suddenly\" means different things to different people on time frame basis so if you could elaborate more on what you mean by \"suddenly\" would be helpful to me to try to interpret your brother's case.  Cardiogenic shock means simply that the patient's heart was very weak because the infected valve was not working  the way it is supposed to because it was infected.

The best way to really find out what happen to your brother is to perform an autopsy. i know it is a very difficult decision to make, but if you are too worried and want to find out exactly what happened then this is the way to go.

I also have an interatrial septal aneurysm, that is bowing toward the right atrium. Is this serious? I have heard of associated stroke with these. Should I be concerned? Thanks, jenn\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guinevere,   Thank you very much for using our website.  Since i addressed nearly every thing in your first 2 messages except for the mitral regurge, i will tell you my thoughts in this reply.  Once more, if there is no evidence of structural abnormality. One of the most common abnormalities now readily identifiable on the echocardiogram is mitral valve prolapse. If you have mitral valve prolapse then this could be the cause of your mitral regurge. The things that need to be done then is to follow-up with an echocardiogram and make sure that you receive prophylaxis against infective endocarditis when appropriate.
