    "title": "Possible bat exposure, should I get shots?  Worried!!",
    "content": "On my way home 2 days ago, this tiny thing (approx 1inch long, 1.5 inch wide) burst out and fluttered all around me (at me). It may have brushed against my bare hand, but I felt nothing, so I don't THINK it bit, but I hear they can do it without you noticing... (I managed to shoo it away and I escaped. lol)  My question is, if it did actually bite me, would I have felt it for sure? Would I see any marks? I hear they have very fine teeth, and you can be bitten and not know it. Also, I had no open wounds on my skin, but what if there were microscopic cuts?  I went to my doctor because I was so worried, but he thinks that the chances are nil, and he strongly recommended that I don't even go for the shots.  However, I don't know if I can trust him, because he thinks that bats are natural reservoirs of the virus, and that they don't suffer from it themselves (which is proven to not be the case).  That, and the fact that a dead rabid bat was found a block from my house last year...  I just need other opinions.    This happened in San Francisco, CA around 8:00PM (almost dark, but not quite). And if I do have it, it's probably too late to get the shots!! =(  I can't sleep because of this.  I'm wondering if I should get the shots anyway.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Some important information to our readers.Never handle a Bat.Even if it is dead do not touch and handle bats.It should be done by professionals or vaccinated personnels.Also do not keep Bats as pets.Recent data suggest that transmission of rabies virus can occur from minor, seemingly unimportant, or unrecognized bites from bats. Postexposure prophylaxis should be considered when direct contact between a human and a bat has occurred, unless the exposed person can be certain a bite, scratch, or mucous membrane exposure did not occur.Postexposure prophylaxis can be considered for persons who were in the same room as a bat and who might be unaware that a bite or direct contact had occurred (e.g., a sleeping person awakens to find a bat in the room or an adult witnesses a bat in the room with a previously unattended child, mentally disabled person, or intoxicated person) and rabies cannot be ruled out by testing the bat. Postexposure prophylaxis would not be warranted for other household members. If you woke up because a bat landed on you while you were sleeping or if you awakened and found a bat in your room, you should try to safely capture the bat and have it tested. The same precautions should be used if you see a bat in a room with an unattended child, or see a bat near a mentally impaired or intoxicated person.  The small teeth of the bat can make a bite difficult to find. Be safe and in these situations, try to safely capture the bat, have the bat tested, and seek medical advice.http://www.cdc.gov/rabies/exposure/animals/bats.html. Non-bite exposures to rabies are very rare.Almost all cases reported a bite or handling bats.People usually know when they have been bitten by a bat.The principal source of rabies exposure from bats is through careless handling. According CDC, people cannot get rabies just from seeing a bat in an attic, in a cave, or at a distance.In your case it is most unlikely to have had an exposure For all that you know it may not be a bat, and there was no indication of any contact or injury.Most contacts happened indoors. Always consult your doctor in doubt and CDC for details.Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Is Rabies only transmissable during the symptomatic stage?",
    "content": "Hi there, new here but really in need of some advice here.  My dad  has just got back from a  4 week holiday in  the guangzhou province of China.  Whilst visiting a cemetry there he says he stroked a feral cat and it nipped him ( but he claims it didnt draw blood) it also nipped my 2 year old half sister.  Because neither drew blood he was not worried at all.  Also he claimed the cat 'looked fine' so was nothig to worry about.   I however am not so sure as if the virus is present in saliva surely it could pass to him if he then wiped his nose or touched his mouth with the cat saliva, same with the baby.  Knowing that I am a bit of a hypochondriac he  dismisses my concerns, so I have now turned my attention to making sure I could not get it from him if he did  incubate it.  My main question I would like to ask is.  Is Rabies only contagious   when symptoms show in the individual or animal? Because I read that human to human transmission directly has never been recorded, surely there would have been some  people who incubated it without knowing and shared cutlery and cups,  or kissed their family, wouldnt they then transmit it if  it were contagious before onset of symptoms?  Because of this I am  attmepting to avoid contact with him for a while.  Personally I am annoyed at the niavety in touching a feral animal in  a country where this diseases are prevelent, but its done now and my concern is what happens now.  Can  a professional please tell me, if t is contagious before onset of symptoms and help me out here a bit please.  Thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is Rabies only transmissable during the symptomatic stage?",
    "content": "Hello,First and the most important is that your father must contact your heath providers,and you should see to that both  receive post exposure prophylaxis ,if necessary, after discussion with the authorities medical and in municipal.Though non bite exposure rarely transmits the virus yet is no reason for taking it easy.Unprovoked bites are more dangerous than provoked ones. The incubation period is 1 to 3 months but could be less.The virus multiplies early near the area of injury in the muscles.Once it reaches the peripheral nerves then it can not be contained.Injuries near the brain are more dangerous since the travel distance is less.After the CNS is involved only it reaches the salivary tissue.Post exposure Prophylaxis is effective so long as the virus has not entered the nerves. If the animal is observed for 10days and found healthy PEP is not necessary  .Like what you learned human transmission is most unlikely except in organ transplants.There are no instances of healthcare professionals acquiring rabies from infected patients.Being a fatal condition if diagnosed as rabies and there being safe prophylaxis available do promptly attend to this. Thus it is of paramount importance not to waste any time.Do consult your physician as to whether they need PEP.Ok?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Hand foot and mouth disease is a viral condition mainly of childhood.While adults could get it this is more easily transmitted in children.Sometimes adults may carry disease but may not experience symptoms. The most important thing here is to give adequate fluids to children.Otherwise there are chances for dehydration.If the oral and throat lesions are severe, intravenous fluids may be needed. There is no specific treatment.Mouth washes may be useful.milk based foods may be easier to take than fruit juice.Recovery is generally a rule in a week or so. Best wishes\n\n",

    "title": "Exposed to CMV in early pregnancy - really scared",
    "content": "Hi there  A close friend of mine lost a baby at 18 weeks (around march this year) due to contracting primary cmv infection in early pregnancy. I was not around her much from when she fell pregnant until she lost the baby. It is thought she contracted the virus around conception. I have since been in contact with her about once a week for a few months and our kids aged 20mths play together.  I'd never heard of cmv but thought as I hadn't been around her much when she contracted it that my chances of contracting it were slim. I was also told most people had it anyway and it was unlikely that wouldn't have been exposed.  I am now 13 weeks pregnant and went back to check my my routine bloods which were done at 4weeks, and I came back cmv negative for recent exposure and antibodies for cmv. I've been doing research and am now extremely worried I may have contracted this virus in the past few months since this test was done. I keep thinking of all the times our kids have played together, shared food and drinks and the times my son has taken a sip of my drink or sneezed on me or given me a big sloppy kiss. My husband and I also had a sore throat and cough and were run down a few weeks after I found out I was pregnant which are symptoms. They are also symptoms of early pregnancy for me, plus it is flu season here too. I'm hoping that it is a common cold and not a sign of cmv infection.  All I seem to read are ways to minimize exposure, but i'm terrified it may be too late for me. Of course I know now how to avoid it, and I'm doing all those things. I'm worried sick and my ob is not keen to get me retested as she thinks the results aren't accurate and may worry me more. She thinks the chances are slim that I would have acquired it. I am due to have a scan on Monday for the NT test.   I am so scared and don't know what to do. What are my chances of having contracted this virus? What is considered close intimate contact as this seems to be used commonly to describe how it is transferred. How much saliva would you need to ingest to be infected? What should I do? Please help me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you are worried about having acquired the disease since the testing, your doctor could always test you again for antibodies and recent exposure.  That might be worth it to put your mind at ease.  If you typically use good handwashing and hygiene protocols, you are likely safe even if exposed.  There is no way to say how much of an exposure would be needed but if you handle bodily fluids from a person who has the virus and then it gets in your mucus membranes such as mouth and nose, you could become infected. Symptoms may or may not be present and would seem similar to mononeucleosis - tired, fatigued, with fever, swollen glands - not a typical \"cold\" and less severe than influenza.  Keep in mind that stress hormones are not good for you and your baby either so try to relax and not worry excessively about this very slight risk.  There is nothing you can do about it now anyway and it really is a small risk.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Some people develop chronic fatigue syndrome following infection - sometimes called chronic EBV infection.  This can linger for quite a while.  Rest and good nutrition are the best things you can do.  Reduce stress and don't overexert yourself.  Moderate exercise can be good for you such as stretching and gentle movement.  If sleep is interrupted you may need medication to help since this can make symptoms worse.  A good daily multiple vitamin is a good idea but I know of no quick fixes for this condition.  Apparently it's an exercise in patience so I'm afraid monitoring your activity and taking it easy is the best therapy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

But the other day I added St Johns Wort to my regimen, and later that evening I took around 3000mg L-tryptophan.   I couldn't sleep the same night, until about 7am...very weird, but I later found out that mixing MAOI's (St Johns Wort) with L-tryptophan is not advisable and could cause Serotinin Syndrome.  I had one of the worst days of my life that day. I am better now, but I have a hand rash from my little finger to wrist  plus the area at the bottom of thumb, the \"fat\" part of the hand....It doesn't scratch extremely much, but enough to make me scratch it almost all the time...  My question is, is this a sympton of serotinin syndrome and should I just wait some more days to see if the rash disappears, or could it be something entirely else, like scabies or bedbugs....? Or could it be a result of taking too many supplements(since i added 3-4 new supplements about a week ago to my regiment), I heard many supplements can put a strain on the liver, etc...\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Possible date of cocci ingestion",
    "content": "Hi, Coccidioidomycosis is a fungal infection caused by Coccidioides immitis, a fungus that thrives in the soil in some geographic areas(with  suitable rain fall, ambient temperatures and humidity) and releases spores into the air where they can be spread by inhalation. Endemic in some parts of South America, Mexico and in the US, Texas, Arizona and california. HIV infection and other immunocompromised states have greatly increased risk of contracting Coccidioidomycotic infection.   Coccidioidomycosis affecting the bone(extra pulmonay involvement) usually indicates a disseminated disease.  Dissemination of the disease is more common in Filipinos, other Asians, blacks, during pregnancy and men in general.  Coccidioidomycosis,  can develop 20 or more years after the initial infection, which may have gone unnoticed by being completely asymptomatic or being minimally symptomatic.  In parts of the world where it is not common, lack of familiarity with the disease is perhaps the main cause of significant delays in diagnosis.Some case series have reported average delays of about 4 years. Also, its latent period can be upto an year or more causes inevitable delays in diagnosis.  Delayed diagnosis generally correlates with a worse outcome.  As explained, certainly there is a possibility of the disease manifesting  4 years following inhalation of the spores. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rabies: Can you get it from swallowing animal saliva?",
    "content": "Hello, It would be extremely unlikely you would pick up rabies in this way.  First of all the animal would have to be infected with rabies, the infected saliva would have to get on the item and you would need to be exposed all within a fairly short period of time.  However, germs are everywhere and putting things in your mouth and not using good handwashing can expose you to any number of infections.  But usually these would have noticeable symptoms (like the cut in the skin would become infected or the food would make you vomit and/or have diarrhea). Most germs are handled by our body's immune system and we are able to survive exposure to many if we are otherwise healthy.    Try to improve your hygiene and avoid putting dirty things in your mouth, including fingers but don't stress over this if you have had no symptoms of illness.  If you find yourself worrying excessively about germs it could be a sign of another disorder such as a phobia or obsessive compulsive disorder and should be addressed with a therapist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I know MRSA infects when there is a break in the skin, so I am wondering if i should cover whatever breaks in the skin he gets during play as he is a child? Secondly, they prescribed Clindamycin, and I've noticed since he's taken it that he sometimes goes cross eyed for a few seconds or his eyes roll in the back of his head- and this is not usual at all for him, never seen him do it before..And he quickly snaps out of this, but it is cause for concern to me!!

    "title": "Re: MRSA infection in 4 month old son",
    "content": "Hi, Your son had a methicillin resistant staph aureus(MRSA) infection while in hospital, was treated successfully and was discharged home.  Infections with MRSA, in the not so distant past, had been limited primarily to  hospitalized patients or patients in long-term care facilities. However, recent reports of increasing \"community-acquired\" MRSA infections are causing concern. These infections, reportedly occur in otherwise healthy, non-hospitalized persons without known contact with healthcare personnel or other colonized patients.  Colonization is the presence, growth, and multiplication of the organism in one or more body sites without observable clinical symptoms or immune reaction. A \u2018carrier\u2019 refers to an individual who is colonized with MRSA.  One of the most common sites of colonization is the anterior nares. While health care personnel may become colonized with MRSA, they rarely develop infections with the organism.  Community based studies show that approximately 20% of individuals almost always carry one strain and are called \"persistent carriers\". A large proportion of the population (60%) harbors S. aureus intermittently, and such persons are called \"intermittent carriers\". Finally, a minority of people (< 20%) almost never carry S.aureus and are called \"noncarriers\". Persistent carriage is more common in children than in adults.  Because your son had an MRSA infection while in hospital, it does not automatically mean that he is at a perpetually increased risk of MRSA infections in the future. Everyone in the community (including your son), are at an ever increasing risk. Ofcourse, if your son happens to be a carrier, his theoretical risk certainly increases and risk also potentially increases if a member of the family (includes yourself) or a person who comes into close contact with your son also is a carrier.  As to how long a person in a community will remain a carrier (and which type of a carrier) is a matter of conjecture.  Nasal carriers in the hospital setting are generally treated with may be treated with topical Mupirocin used as short courses (application to the nares twice daily for 5 days). Results of administration of systemic antibiotics have been generally disappointing. I hope this information is helpful. Best wishes!\n\n",

Over the last 2 months I have been experiencing fatigue and slight swelling in a lymphnode on the left side of my neck near to the base of my ear (only on the one side), after approximately 2 months of these symptoms waxing and waning I experienced a sudden massive growth in the same lymphnode (accompanied with extreme tenderness, the lymphnode was large, approximately 2\" x 3\").  A monospot was done which came back positive.  My concerns are as such:  - I was under the impression you could only have one positive monospot in a lifetime (you may have symptoms again, but only one positive test) - I am currently serving as a volunteer overseas (I have been here for almost two years), they put me on antibiotics twice in the last 2 months, once Oflaxacin (200 mg 2xd for 5 days) and then Zithromax (500 mg 1xd for 3 days) and I did not have a \"mono rash\" - The lyphnode is slightly smaller now, but swelling is still present with no tenderness, I am having tenderness (but no apparent swelling) on the right side of my neck now, is it common for acute symptoms to last this long?  I do receive adequate medical care here in-country, but I am concerned that they are missing something.  Any suggestions for further tests or ideas would be welcomed.  For background, I am a 26 year old female in good physical health (bp 100/70, 5'6\" 124 lbs, no family history of cancer other than skin cancer in my father)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have been having symptoms of sightly painful and slightly itchy reddish areas of my vagina near the vaginal entrance and a small bump that is a bit sensitive to the touch, which is also right next to the vaginal entrance. I have had these symptoms almost consistency for three months now (not including a very short period of time of maybe about a week at the most in which the area felt better).   On the third month after intercourse with a person who has no symptoms, I got tested for HSV1 and HSV2 by my gyno and there was a culture and a blood test taken. At the time, the mild pain and itchiness was mostly gone, but the bump was still there. From what I can tell, the bump has never gone away at all in these past three months which doesn't seem typical of herpes from what I've read.  Anyhow, I got the test results yesterday and they came back negative for both the culture and the blood test. After that week of comfort, the slight pain and itchiness has recently returned and the bump is still there as it always is.   I'm going to get myself tested again sometime very soon, but I'm just wondering how likely it is that this is herpes even with those negative tests and considering my symptoms seem a bit off from typical outbreak symptoms (especially considering the very long duration of my symptoms which seem longer than most outbreaks). I'm also wondering if there are any over the counter medications I could use in the meantime that may help me. Also, are there any other conditions that this sounds like it could be?\n\n",

Lately, I had been spending most of my day daydreaming and looking at Playboy magazines.  As a result of which I had began on an endless cycle of feeling even more so worthless.  As a remedy for my troubles,  a friend of mine suggested that it would be a good idea to illustrate how good my life is, by trying to show me that I am not a sexual compulsive  person-just lonely, lazy, unhappy, spoiled, and out of touch with the world. Furthermore, he decided it would be entertaining and productive to attend a Sexual Addiction 12 Step Meeting at a local YMCA, after all of this 'Tiger Woods' media. Feeling like my life couldn't get any worse I agreed to accompany him. Well, in one sense, my freind was right, and after the meeting I realized that the people at the meeting had lives a whole lot worse than mine. Some spoke of having HIV and other STDs. It also seemed apparent that many of the individuals were homosexual and bisexual deviants looking to meet others like themselves and were in denial. Afterwards, my friend thought the whole thing was pretty entertaining and funny. I guess it did enlighten me of how good my life actually is, and how sick this world can actually be. I do value my life and well being. Though,for the past few days I have been experiencing post traumatic stress, guilt, and a bit of paranoia from the whole experience.  I was unaware that at the end of a 12 step meeting people hold hands and in a panic I complied with the tradition. So my question is, should I be worried that I have contracted any diseases such as Herpes simplex 1 or 2 or HPV(warts, fungal, skin disorders...?) by making  hand contact and talking with these individuals? I made sure to wash my hands and take a shower the minute I returned home. I may have touched my face prior to washing my hands, though.  I feel as if I shouldn't have put myself in such a situation. In a rational mindset I wouldn't have agreed to go.\n\n",

    "content": "I had unprotected sex awhile back and a few days afterwards I had what i think may have been a herpes outbreak: First a red, pimple-like bump on my left buttocks cheek, followed by 4-5 small red bumps later on, spaced out about 1/2 to 1 inch apart. They hurt slightly.  The bumps started drying up 1-2 after they appeared and by day 3 or 4 they were almost completely faded.  Now, however, *after* they faded (they can still be seen but mostly gone), i'm developing flu symptoms. Today after lunch i started feeling feverish, achy and got a sore throat.  I'm scared to death that i have herpes. I've read that flu symptoms usually precede outbreaks, is it possible that my flu symptoms are connected to herpes or could it just be a coincidence? Thank you for reading!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,While herpes simplex is a sexually transmitted disease and could occur in various locations, buttocks are not the preffered site and commoner in the genital area.Also the characterestic feature is recurrence.Since it is only a single episode and not vesicular ie fluid filled the chances are that it is only a bacterial folliculitis. The fever following again is unlikely to be related to this episode. If there is a recurrence you should get tested,and it is unlikely to be herpes with your presentation. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Starting in Jan 2009, I began to have sinus, ear, nose, and throat problems.  I have been to both an ENT doctor and an Allergist.  I have had 2 CT scans and 1 set of blood work performed.  The allergist has me on Flonase and Allegra D 24hr.  My sinus scans were clear and the flonase and allegra have relieved my issues with pain and breathing through my nose.  My continuing problem is with a salivary gland on my left side of my jaw and also my left ear.  The scans did not show any stones or tumors.  The blood work was ok except for high levels of indicator for having had mononucleosis. This pain with my gland, ear, and fatigue have been going on for months now.  My ENT has referred me back to my primary for chronic mononucleosis.  I believe the problem with the gland occurred first before the mononucleosis.  Now I am left to wonder if a chronic infection of the salivary gland is hindering my recovery from the mononucleosis.  Is removing the gland a good idea given the fact I don't know if that is the main problem?  Should I ask to see an infectious disease specialist?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: salivary gland problem and Mononucleosis",
    "content": "Hi, Infectious mononucleosis, which is caused by Epstein-Barr virus can present with swelling in the parotid region due to  - a parotitis - an acute parotid lymph nose enlargement (acute lymphadenitis) or - as certain parotid tumors.  Parotid lymph node enlargement in Infectious mononucleosis may occur in two ways.. - as part of generalised lymphadenopathy or  - secondary to 'membranous tonsillitis' which is known to occur in this condition.  Lymphomas of the parotid gland and undifferentiated carcinomas lof parotid gland are thought to be associated with Epstein-Barr viral infection. Clonal EBV genomes have been detected in undifferentiated carcinomas of the parotid gland exclusively in Alaskan natives and inuits. Both groups are also at the highest risk for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.  There is some evidence that the Epstine-Barr viral genome can persist in salivary glands and in saliva for many years following the initial infection.  Checking for the viral genome in saliva is not very useful as many normal healthy people can carry and spread the virus intermittently for life in their saliva.   Direct detection of EBV in blood or lymphoid tissues is a research tool and is not available for the clinical situations. Instead, serologic testing is the method of choice for diagnosing primary infection. An acute-phase sample should be tested for  antibodies to several EBV-associated antigens(the early antigen, EBV nuclear antigen (EBNA) & the viral capsid antigen) simultaneously.This may provide evidence for re-activation of the infection.  However, i must warn you that finding an answer to your question is not that simple, and interpretation of laboratory results is highly complex and should be ideally performed by physicians who are familiar with EBV testing and who have access to a given patient's clinical condition. I hope i have clarified some of your doubts. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It is probable that your daughter has what is known as a 'Thyroglossal cyst' (A thyroglossal duct cyst) which is a remnant of the thyroglossal tract (duct) which is an embryologic structure concerned with the development of the thyroid gland.   A thyroglossal cyst usually presents between ages 2 - 10 years.   The majority, are found at the level of the thyrohyoid membrane, just below the hyoid bone.They are generally seeen in the midline or just off the midline, and move up and down upon swallowing and on protrusion of the tongue.  Incidence is equal in both girls and boys.These ysts are usually asymptomatic The main risk of a thyroglossal duct cyst is infection.Infected custs may drain their contents to the outside and present as an opening in the skin (sinus or a fistula).  Management is generally by surgical excision (by what is called as the sistrunk procedure). This involves excision not only of the cyst but also of the path of the thyroglossal tract.Removal of the central part of the hyoid bone is indicated to ensure complete removal of the tract.  In selected cases, before planning surgery, radioisotope scans may be needed to make sure that a 'normal' thyroid is in fact, present. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, A 'golf ball' sized lymph node is certainly quite big.Not all lymph nodes assume this size acutely.The 'jugulo digastric' lymph node is one that enlarges acutely to fairly large sizes in response to infections in its drainage area (sore throat, tonsillitis, acute pharyngitis etc).  It is quite possible that the lymph node that was enlarged in your instance is a 'jugulo digastric' lymph node.Even after adequate therapy, this lymph node often does not competely disappear and remains palpable (although smaller), only to enlarge in the face of yet another infection in its drainage area(infections in this area are fairly common).  However, it is best for you to consult your doctor who will be able to clinically assess the node better as well as look at the drainage area  for any lesions. Best wishes!\n\n",

Now this last week or so the 2nd son complains of leg and joint pain, migraines (no light or noise allowed), abdominal pain (when asked to point to the pain he draws an imaginary circle reaching from the bottom of his rib cage to his bladder), some dizziness, very tired early morning and evening and seemingly normal on/off throughout the day.  My 11 y.o. had these same symptoms but after the symptoms of bad throat infection and swollen glands subsided.  How likely is it that my 9 y.o. has the same dx?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Symptoms of Infectious mononucleosis('mono') are varied and non-specific.I do not know if your second son has any lymphadenopathy,splenomegaly or petechiae.  Splenomegaly, posterior cervical adenopathy, axillary and inguinal adenopathy if present, are extremely useful to suspect a diagnosis of infectious mononucleosis.   Without assessing for the presence or absence of these signs, it may not be possible even to hazard a guess about this being 'mono'.  Elevated hepatic aminotransferase levels are observed in about 50% cases.Differential leucocyte count usually reveals presence of >50% lymphocytes with at least 10% atypical lymphocytes.  As you children have been in close contact, there is an increased risk for your second child.So, it may be better to consult a pediatrician to sort this out. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Blade, The difference between the nasal spray form of the H1N1 vaccination and the injection form is the nasal spray vaccine is made with a weakened form of the virus while the injection form is an inactivated virus. The recommendations from Anthony Fiore, MD, the medical epidemiologist for the influenza division of the CDC is the nasal spray can be given to the healthy population ages 2 to 49 who are not pregnant, otherwise the injection form of the vaccine is recommended. So essentially people who have underlying health conditions such as asthma, heart disease, kidney disease, or any condition that compromises the immune system should not take the nasal spray form. You may also want to discuss this with your primary care provider. I hope this information is somewhat helpful. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My wife and I live in Ban Klong Tong Nuea, a tiny village in Southern Thailand near the Malaysian border.  Recently (within the last four months) the Chikungunya virus swept through our village and other local villages nearby, infecting almost everyone, my wife and I included.    My wife was asymptomatic after two and a half weeks.  I however, still have lingering joint pain in my ankles and sometimes my hands, for which I am taking medication (see my listed medications).    My question is regarding further immunity from Chikungunya now that I've been infected.  I've read of different strains of Chikungunya virus in Reunion Island and parts of Africa which were fatal, and I'm wondering if by having been infected by a non-fatal strain of the virus, would I be immune to other strains and if so, how long does the immunity last?  Will the antibodies I have to this particular strain cause me to be immune to other strains of the virus?  I am considering travel to an area near Madagascar that may very well be a hot spot for the virus, possibly the fatal strain.  Being that there are no vaccines for this virus, should I avoid travel or am I good to go since I've already contracted a similar strain of the virus?  Thank you for any help you can give me, Jim\n\n",

    "title": "2nd bout of mono and liver--did level stay at a normal rate?",
    "content": "I am a 26 year old male.  About 3 months ago I was diagnosed with EBV mono via a blood test.  The Dr. confirmed my liver enzymes were at a completely normal level (which apparently is rare for mono I think), and said after I feel better it would be okay to drink alcohol.  Three weeks after my first bout of mono symptoms, I had the feverish symptoms return.  This time I did not have my liver enzyme levels tested and my doctor said it\u2019s not abnormal for mono symptoms to return like this at my age over the course of a month or two.  After my symptoms passed, I resumed drinking alcohol.   It does seem like my body reacts worse to alcohol now than before I ever had mono, sometimes getting hangovers unpredictably the next day.  Used to I could go out and know pretty easily if I drank too much and would feel bad the next day.  My concern is that the 2nd bout of mono symptoms may have caused my liver levels to be elevated unlike 3 weeks prior when the last blood test was performed.  This makes me think drinking in the last 6 weeks since I had symptoms last has negatively affected my liver\u2014is this a valid concern, or is it more likely that the first test showing normal liver levels was true even when the 2nd round of symptoms became present?    I still have slightly elevated lymph nodes 3 months later which bothers me as well, and I don\u2019t know if that is normal after 3 months since having mono, even though I feel fine otherwise.  And I guess if it is normal, it proves mono is still in my system and that drinking may still be something I should not do, or at least not that much.  Unfortunately my doctor seems to not be the best source of information on this, so I wanted to try elsewhere.   Thank you.\n\n",

I usually get these outbreaks 1-2 times a year, and they are specific to the one spot on my elbow.

    "content": "Hello --  You're having symptoms of a recurrent viral infection. Either you've contracted one of the persistent, slow-to-leave viruses like mononucleosis/Epstein-Barr, or your immune system has been compromised (by burnout perhaps -- stress can do this) and the only way to be certian which it is would be to have the appropriate blood tests to rule out mono/EB virus. If neither of these is present then you may have a stress-related adrenal exhaustion with concomitant immunity compromise,  which often will respond to the same measures as mono, which are rest, special care to insure good nutrition, and sometimes megavitamin therapy, even though this last is not medically recognized generally. But first you have to determine if it is a single virus or some underlying disorder that's compromising your immunity. There are a number of these,mostly autoimmune diseases,  and sometimes they, too, can be triggered by prolonged stress.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Swine Flu Outbreak/Risk of Travelling to \"Uninfected\" Mexico",
    "content": "Hello, Since this strain of flu is popping up in many countries (21, with 1600 ill from it; 500 in the U.S.), there is no way to know when it will strike in any particular place.  It does appear to not be as deadly as it might have turned out to be - this is good news when fears like this are not realized.    SkyNews responds to this type of question: \"Q: Have there been any confirmed cases of swine flu in Mexico's tourist resorts? A: No. \"Q: I intend to travel to a country where swine flu has been confirmed. What precautions can I take? A: If you are traveling to an affected country you should consult your usual healthcare provider for travel medical advice and further guidance if you have specific concerns. You should check the FCO's travel advice for the relevant country before traveling. General infection control practices and good respiratory hand hygiene can help to reduce transmission of all viruses, including the human swine influenza.  This includes: covering your nose and mouth when coughing or sneezing, using a tissue when possible; disposing of dirty tissues promptly and carefully; maintaining good basic hygiene (for example washing hands frequently with soap and water to reduce the spread of the virus from your hands to face or to other people); cleaning hard surfaces (e.g. door handles) frequently using a normal cleaning product; making sure your children follow this advice.\"  What this says to me is that the resort areas have not been affected so if you don't intend to do much traveling to other populated areas, you may well be at no greater risk than you would be staying home.  This is partly because the resorts bring in clean water and typically use good, hygienic practices, more like you would see in other countries.  There is no way to be positive you will not have exposure to the flu.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason for the concern is because it is a new strain and there is no natural immunity or effective and available vaccine to prevent it.  Therefore, the potential is there for it to spread rapidly.  We always worry about another flu similar to the \"Great Flu\" of 1918 that killed between 70 and 100 million people worldwide.    If the strain turns out to be particularly dangerous and spreads rapidly throughout a continent or the world, it can have huge repercussions from a health standpoint, mortality statistics, and financial impact.  So far, people in Mexico seem to be getting a particularly bad reaction from this virus and so far other countries are handling it better.  We don't know why this is the case.  We have to wait and watch in order to see what this one will do.  The flu of 1918 (also called the Spanish flu) waned a bit in the summer, then returned in the fall with a vengeance.  We should be vigilant and people who are ill should stay home.  It is better to err on the side of caution.  Try to avoid being around sick people and be vigilant in hand washing.  Only time will tell how dangerous this will be.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, TB activation may occur when your immune system is depressed.  Active TB usually manifests with feeling ill, fever and night sweats are common as well as a serious cough.  But, it's easy enough to diagnose so you need to see a doctor or public health department.  TB is a threat to the community so the local health departments are actively involved in diagnosis, treatment and prevention of spread to others.  You can probably schedule testing there, though I do not know your location or the specifics.  It is a place to start.  There are many viruses that can cause a persistent cough and pneumonia is one possibility.  If you have a bacterial infection, you definitely need antibiotics so it is important that you see your doctor soon.  TB cannot be self-treated and if there is any chance you may have it, you must get treatment.  It is a slow-growing organism so don't panic, but do follow up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I agree with your doctor and I would not worry about it.  Some form of Infection is always a possibility with an animal bite but you would have had symptoms had you gotten some bacteria in there.    A bite by an infected animal is a concern only after the virus is in the saliva and this happens late in the disease after the virus has reached the brain and multiplied after which time it causes inflammation of the brain and moves to the salivary glands and saliva.  So, a normal pet without symptoms is not a risk to you.  The greatest fear comes when the animal is not to be found and identified so the status is unknown.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My mother is currently dealing with some odd symptoms.  This has been going on for about 3 weeks, give or take a few days.  We got back from a week in Cuba (we're Canadians) a little over a month ago.   Mom is 65 years old, 5'7\", 98lbs, and tends toward anemia.  Lately, she's been hugely fatigued, spending most of her days in bed, sleeping.  She is experiencing nausea and vomiting, diarrhea and stomach cramps, fever and fairly profuse intermittent sweating, headaches and bad muscle pains.  She says her stomach feels like its overly-acidic and roiling around.  Emotionally, she seems depressed, too.  She often says the same thing more than once, and just doesn't seem like she's really 'with it'.  She hasn't even left the house for over a week.  This makes me really nervous, since she's usually a rather active, type-A personality, and it is really against character.  She barely gives her 2 dogs any attention at all, and they haven't been for a walk in a week and a half.  I've been taking them out for pit stops.  The younger of the two dogs recently developed a case of intestinal parasites and both dogs are on meds to resolve that.  I am concerned that this could be either a viral/bacterial/parasitic infection that she picked up in Cuba, or a parasitic infection she got from the dog, since she allows it to lick her face and isn't as scrupulous as she should be about washing her hands after the dog has been mouthing them.  Can anyone help?\n\n",

She hasn't had the persistent diarrhea or the sweats for a few days, and while she still has the fatigue, she isn't giving in to it as much and has re-started her life, taking the dogs for walks, taking care of the house, etc.  I'm still doing the stuff that involves lifting, like laundry.  She isn't as achy or stiff.  Her mood seems brighter, and while she still sleeps more than most people do, she is more active than she was.  One thing that is very strange is that both her feet have bright red colouration from the tips of her toes to about midway up her feet.  She believes it is the residue of a sunburn received during our Cuba trip, but that was almost 2 months ago!  No sunburn lasts, in the bright red stage, for 2 months, especially with zero pain.  I can't help but think that this odd symptom is related somehow to her other symptoms.  She does not think it important, and I do.  I've been after her to go to the doc, but she won't.    Does anyone have any idea what is causing these odd symptoms? She did have the dogs treated for the parasites, and they're now completely clear of them.  Thanks, S.\n\n",

My stepdad has left to see his brother who has glandular fever, though it's in it's incubation stage so it's less likely he'll catch it it's symptoms look horribly painful, so I'd like to avoid it.

    "content": "Hello, Good handwashing can go a long way to avoid disease transmission.  Your brother and all household members should practice good hygiene, not share food or drinks from the same container, toothbrushes, washcloths or towels.  Sharing saliva or mucus is the route of infection.  This is commonly called mononeucleosis or \"kissing disease\" (because of the saliva sharing) and it is caused by the epstein-barr virus.  It most often affects young people - teens to young adults.   Your body must fight it alone since it is viral in nature.  In most people this means 2 to 4 weeks until their body clears it.  Some cases are more persistent.    Chances are with good sense, you will be able to avoid this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you are still having lingering symptoms, which often last for weeks.   Mononucleosis can take a long time to resolve and it's important you get adequate rest so your body can heal.  You do not need to be quarantined during this time, however.  If your immune system is not compromised from medications, cancer or other problems, you should recover.  While resting, you should not do strenuous activities and since the liver can be effected, you should not use alcohol or risk trauma to the liver or spleen.  Report any sudden, severe abdominal pain.  I'm glad you have been checked for secondary infections that can complicate this disease.  Good luck in your recovery.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response. It matches all the information I have \"googled\" lately. However, you and the rest of the literature I have read talk about recovery in weeks and months - I am now headed towards two years. I did rest - one solid month in bed with absoultly no activity, and I was on steriods. After 4 full weeks in bed, I returned to work on half schedule, and dropped all other activities. I kept this up for 4 months. During this time I rested or slept 10-14 hours a day - all the time I was not at work. After 6 months, I returned to some activity but still limited. I did start to feel better for a few months, but in the last two months have had a return of the extreme exaustion I had felt a year earlier. I have a standing doctor's apointment every 6 weeks and am closely watched. My physician won't give me any time frame. I was hoping to find someone who can give me a timeline or let me know how unusual this protracted recovery might be. I need a light at the end of the tunnel. I want off the coach and back into my  lilfe. Any suggestions besides rest? Or, at least a time estimate. Again, thank you for the response.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, At 13 days, chances are the flu is on its way out without any intervention at this point.  You should be able to just rely on your immune system to continue to heal.  In future years, I would recommend an influenza vaccine before flu season.  Often one year of actually getting influenza makes a believer out of people on this prevention.  People often discount the vaccine because they think flu is no big deal.  As you have learned, the two weeks can feel like forever, cost you a lot in lost work, etc.  Good luck on your complete recovery.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I didn't have a lot of pain and as soon as I started taking Valtrex the pain went away completely and the sore has since healed completely. This weekend I am going to visit some relatives.  My cousin is about 10 weeks pregnant and very concerned.  She had complications in her previous pregnancy and lost both babies.  Now she does not want me to stay at their house and she wants to keep her distance, since I have had shingles.  I tried telling her that I am in no way contagious, and since she has had chicken pox, there is absolutely nothing to worry about.  I don't have any more sores or symptoms; it's like if I had a cold 2 weeks ago, but now I am healthy, I am not contagious any longer.  My question for you is there any risks involved here?  For her or her unborn child?  I would like a medical answer to pass onto her. :-) Thank you.\n\n",

If you are unable to swallow then hydration becomes a problem.  Chest pain due to cough in a young person may cause some secondary problems like costochonritis or pneumonia. It would also be prudent to discuss recurrent viral infections with your physicians.  He may advise some general health measures (eg diet, exercise, tobacco cessation) or order some blood work during your non sick days to get baselines of your blood cell counts.    Hope this helps and hope your illness subsides in a prompt fashion.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear sir,  1)   I had an exposure ( not risky or unsafe though ) on dec 1st. I got a handjob when fully clothed n it was over the clothes, and in the past one year have got the same thing done around 5 or 6 times from diff ppl. But, among those only two times i was not clothed. But, it was nothing other than hand job. THere was no intersection, or oral sex or anything else. I was getting pissed off now if there are any chances for me to have caught any std or hiv infection. Coz two weeks after dec 1st i got cold, cough, sore throat, fever and fatigue and one swollen lymph node in the groin.  After a week everything was normal except slight throat pain and cough. But, i have been outside travelling these two weeks at late nites coz of my professional work. So, it mayb coz of cold too. Now( 2 weeks after getting cold), all symptoms are gone and i only have some cough which the doc says will go away and the lymph node swollen ( this i have not discussed with doc )  but, my concern is : is this something to do with my act? was it a risky exposure first of all?  2) Now i don't have any problem apart from little cough. So, i thought i will get a cbc done and following are the results. Everything looks normal except the little high count of lymphocytes.   as on jan 7th 2009  heamoglobin 15.3 total blood count -   5300                lab normal range was 4000 to 11000 neutrophils  - 46                                                              45 - 75 lymphcytes- 49                                                                20 - 40 monocytes-  02                                                                 02 - 08 eosinophils - 03                                                                 03 - 06 basophils - 00                                                                    00 - 01 rbc - 5.31                                                                           4.5 - 6.5 platelet count - 2.79                                                          1.5 - 4.5   however the worrying factor to me is : i had got a cbc done an year ago, and the values are as below. This when compared to my current cbc values, its a concern to me, coz one year back it was 8600 and now its 5300 and also lymphocytes count is high now and before it was normal. neutrophils now is  on the lower margin though within normal range, but last year it was on the higher range though within normal range. Does it say my immune system has weakend or is it just coz i am recovering from the common cold or should i go for other tests like hIV etc?  last year jan 15th ( jan 15th 2008)  heamoglobin 15.6 total blood count -   8600                lab normal range was 4000 to 11000 neutrophils  - 70                                                              45 - 75 lymphcytes- 27                                                               20 - 40 monocytes-  01                                                                 02 - 08 eosinophils - 02                                                                 03 - 06 basophils - 00                                                                    00 - 01 rbc - 4.86                                                                           4.5 - 6.5 platelet count - 2.05                                                        1.5 - 4.5      pls help me\n\n",

STD risky behavior involves touching of genitalia to: genitalia, mouth, or anus.  Masturbation with one's own hand or that of another does not increase risk.

    "content": "Hello, Belching foul smelling odor with the stomach flu is not commonly reported but despite the inconvience to loved ones, is not too alarming... unless any amount of stool comes with it.  In this case, there is blockage in the intestinal tract and needs to be addressed by a physician. The odor and frequency of the belching should subside as the body clears the infection.   If your symptoms worsen then seek medical attention. Take care and keep us posted.\n\n",

    "content": "This last summer I was very sick- syptoms including instense stomach pain, low fever during the day, high fever at night, some respiratory problems at the beginning, swollen lymph nodes, etc.  I was very sick for a couple months.  The doctors ran a lot of tests.  However I came up positive for mono and hantavirus- the doctors tested me for mono once and hantavirus twice and all tests returned positive.  (I have weekly contact with small wild animals- rabbits, mice, etc)  I was wondering if it was possible to test a false positive for one of these caused by having the other virus or if I actually had both of them (i.e. if I had mono would I also test positive for hantavirus even if I only had mono?) I know you don't know the details of my specific case, but if you could give me any help on this matter, I'd appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I suspect that antibodies showed up in your blood indicating your body had fought off both of these infections sometime in the past.  But, it would be impossible to say which was the problem last summer vs some other time.  When the tests were done they may have been able to distinguish recent from remote infection.  The important thing is that you are treated for any acute infection; not worry too much about those you had in the past.    If you need clarification on your lab work, please call your doctor and explain that you do not fully understand.  It is part of their job to be sure you understand what they do and get the full disclosure on your health.  They also realize that many times people are very stressed during the acute phases of illness and they don't absorb all the information they receive so the doctor knows it is often necessary to revisit the subject for further explanation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "As a child I was diagnosed with brochitis and asthma. Around 10 years ago I got a bad flu. And for the first time I noticed a very small amount of blood in my phlegm. This startled me and so I went to see a doctor who prescibed me antibiotics which helped. A few years later I caught another flu and had the same symptoms as before. This time I saw a different doctor who recommended that take a tb skin test to make sure that it was not tb. The test result was negative. (I've taken 3 skin which all came back negative).   Ever since then, whenever I get cold or flu I automatically assume that I have tb. I have done alot research on tb and never had symptom of this disease, such as night sweats, coughing blood, etc. On all the reseach I have done on tb I cannot find any information on the progression of its symptoms.   Hopefully you can help ease my mind by explaining the symptoms and how it consumes the human body. Also, can active tb go away on its on without taking any medication?\n\n",

    "content": "Tuberculosis used to be quite common, but now it is becoming less so.  It is generally not a big concern unless you are in an area where there is still a lot of TB around.  For example, our southwestern states still see TB occasionally as it is still quite prevalent in the climates of Mexico.  Other possible exposure places include hospitals, prisons, and really anywhere that close contact with lots of sick people is possible.  Symptoms of tuberculosis include coughing, coughing up blood, night sweats, and fatigue.  Many of the symptoms are fairly nonspecific.  The currently accepted way to screen for TB is via a ppd skin test.  If one has a positive ppd test, the next step would be to check a chest x-ray (CXR) to see if there is active disease.  Generally if there is a conversion from a negative test to a positive test and the CXR is normal, one would be treated with medication presuming they have innactive disease in hopes  of keeping it from becoming active.  If you had a negative ppd, there is very little to worry about.  There are rarely cases where people will not react to the skin test.  These people are not known at first, so if there is significant concern for TB there are some other diagnostic tests that can be used.    If one has active TB, it can occasionally become dormant without treatment, but almost always the ppd test will still be positive.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor regarding your concerns.  This way you can be evaluated directly and your doctor can give you a very solid assessment of your risks of TB.  Although, from what you describe I think it's unlikely.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

However, my problem is why didn't I have any symptoms when I was diagnosed with TB. It was just founded that I had a spot on X-ray.  Is is really possible to have TB but no symptoms?  Is it really a big issue with regards to employment when you had history of TB?  It reallly bothered me a lot. And also why is there an issue on discrimination during job employments since I always fail medical exams because I had a history of TB. Even though, I defended that I was already cleared and treated for that. Different countries have different whereabouts on TB that is why discrimination occurs since different doctors treat different ways.  Thank you and regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I've been diagnosed with acute hepatitis b, symptoms of which started about 2 months ago and subsequently identified as hepatitis the first week of December.  The recovery seems to be going as expected, most of the harsh jaundice issues abating and a diet that's more tolerable to 'unrestricted' foods.  ..In other words I'm feeling well on the way to better, but am still being careful.  But I've noted the last couple of days the appearance of dark, granular specks in my stool....like coffee grounds.  Acknowledging the notion it could be something I've been eating, it doesn't though really line up with anything I can remember consuming.  I am concerned with the possibility of some sort of bleeding issue, and though now feeling better but being still a bit lethargic from having hep it would be difficult to assess another issue by my energy levels.  I am seeing my doctor next week, but am wondering if it's an issue worth pulling alarm bells over before then.  And if it's not digested food, is there a 'typical' occurance while the liver heals which would explain the observation?\n\n",

    "title": "Yellow Tongue due to common cold?",
    "content": "27 year old male living in greater Minnesota (the northern part).  On Monday the 29, I noticed my tongue was yellow! I have a dentist appointment in about 2 weeks  Background: I have always had sinus trouble since I was a child and usually missed about a month of elementary school due to sinus infections with raging fevers, requiring antibiotics to defeat. These days I get sick a lot less often, 2 or less times a year, and always get the flu shot but the point is I am quite familiar with sinus problems. Anyhow, the last few weeks I have been somewhat congested with a runny left nostril (right side was clear). About a 8-9 days ago I started to get some sinus drainage in my throat and it began to get quite sore about 7 days ago. On saturday night/early sunday morning the cold became full blown resulting in massive, massive congestion (severe enough to cause me a moderately painful headache on 28-29) and a very bad store throat that mostly abated only today (Tuesday the 30th). Based on previous colds, I am getting better--I feel less sick, and while my nose continues to dribble I feel less, germy I guess you can say in my sinuses. I took my temperature both on the 29 and 28, and it was normal for me (in the 97s) during the day though I had light fever both evenings. But on the 29 I noticed my tongue was yellow when I took my temperature!   I have been drinking a LOT of chamomile tea, and that is a yellowish shade, also I have not brushed my teeth since Sunday at about 11am (I was so congested and spitting up mucus that I did not think it would do much good). Looking at my tongue itself, the yellow is not coating the entire tongue, only the center portion leaving the outer areas their regular pink shade. In addition it doesn't seem any more furry and there are no bumps or anything on the tongue, it looks stained yellow.  Is this yellowishness probably due to the cold and congestion? The mucus I am spitting out is ranging from clear to very light brown.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, as you are aware the yellowish eyes/skin/urine are all the manifestations of the jaundice, which is nothing but a liver disease where because of the malfunction in the liver laboratory ,the increased level of bilirubin is seen in the blood. The same gets deposited in the white of the eye-the sclera, the layers of the skin , the urine and hence the unwanted yellow colour. Once the jaundice recovers, the bilirubin level comesdown automatically and everything changes to normal. There are no suggested eye drops available but I suggest you to take plenty of fluids, good amount of physical rest, restrict your fatty diet including non-veg, where the recovery can be faster. You can use tinted goggles to cover your jaundiced eyes, if you want. Thanks, Dr.Ramamurrthy M G\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  HPV is transmitted via genital contact. The lesions (genital warts) by definition only occur in the genital region. Therefore, there's little to no risk of you transmitting HPV to any family members. It isn't transmitted via saliva, and the environmental risks of transmission as seen in certain other viral diseases (such as herpes) are not a consideration with HPV.   You needn't be concerned about sharing this virus with anyone you don't have genital contact with, and for those cases, the only way to be absolutely certain you won't transmit it is to avoid sexual contact. Since this is usually an unrealistic expectation, the other two things one should do out of consideration for any sex partner would be to either a) explain in advance and insist on a condom or b) just insist on condom use. Oral sex won't cause oral  lesions, so the protection needs to be concentrated on the genital area. If you're intimate with one person with whom you share a committed relationship,  this is one of those things you might eventually want to discuss with that person. Otherwise, just take the standard precautions. Also, please continue  to follow up with your healthcare provider to be certain you keep ahead of this very noxious virus.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

I recently have had throat, tonsil, and roof of mouth pain and it's worse when I eat(anything)...haven't started the acidoupholous yet...my primary question is can my tongue still have viral infection or is that even possible and has anyone heard of loss of taste and on and off redness on left side of tongue from nerves healing brough on by Bell's Palsy--7th nerve I believe?? any comments/suggestions would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Yes, it is believed (strongly) that Bell's palsy is likely caused by a virus, and the herpes simplex virus is the prime suspect.   The effects of Bell's palsy can be diffuse and can last for indeterminate periods of time. While there is a statistical average recovery period, it is drawn from many different reports and a variety of outcomes, so it's still pretty difficult to predict how long it may take for any given individual to fully recover all functions. While the tongue itself is not likely infected with the virus, the 7th cranial nerve (facial neve) takes its sweet time in recovering its function, whether the virus is active or not. The virus may lie dormant indefinitely, but only recurs in a very low number of patients. The recovery period, in 2/3 of patients, is complete at some point within a year or less. The rest take longer.   Given there is visible and localized inflammation and pain in your tongue, you may have active herpes simplex (or other) viral infection of a branch of the nerve still, which is somewhat different from typical Bell's palsy. I'm unfamiliar with the acidophilus therapy, but if your doctor recommends this, I'd get started quickly in the hopes of gaining whatever benefit it may offer.  Best of luck to you with this. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

Many people do this and are totally unaware of it. This is one of the lesser-recognized causes of trigeminal neuralgia (and although they're both very painful, if one must have an inflamed nerve, that one is preferable to the glosspharyngeal one, which could have been involved instead, but now definitely sounds like it's not).   It will be interesting to see how much and how quickly the bite guard causes improvement. This would be a great discovery for you if it pans out.   Good luck with this, you're very welcome, and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I have had recurring sore throats for at least 2 years and all my doctor says is that its a virus and nothing he can do.  I get them at least once a month, often once a week and they can be so painful that breathing hurts.  Most of the time I self medicate with throat losengers and it helps a little but it takes a couple of days to go and wonder why I get them all the time?  Currently I am travelling so can't easily pop into a doctor without having to go through my travel insurance and pharmasists in Asia just offer antibioltics without even looking at my throat so I stay well clear of them. Should I take a course of antibiotics ?  And would they work on a virus anyway???  And what is the difference between a virus and bacterial infections and why do I get them - I wonder if something is staying in my body and I am not completely fighting it off. I have never had any tests or swabs or anything else like that and wonder if I should - or should I wait until I get back home in 5 months and stick it out until then.    Oh and if I am tired or run down or have any other illness, my throat is always painful.  My glands usually are slightly swollen, and often I have problems hearing people talking if here is any background noise.  Not sure if this is related... Hope you can shed some light for me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Recurring sore throats for 2 years and no diagnosis",
    "content": "Hi there -  While many sore throats are viral in origin, once a month  for two years suggests there is some sort of chronic infection or disorder that should be uncovered via blood tests (Epstein-Barr virus comes to mind, especially what with the swollen  glands as well). It could be an allergic problem, but it's a rather unusual manifestation unless you have also chronic post-nasal drip (PND) irritating your throat.   If it is a viral problem antibiotics won't do anything. If it happens to be a recurrent bacterial infection (possibly due to a deep sinus infection), antibiotics should  make a big difference. Viruses are much smaller microbes than bacteria and are structured very differently. They are unfazed by antibiotics. They usually run a course and then move on or die. However, some types (like E-B, mentioned above) can take up residence and keep flaring up. There are blood tests to uncover these, although there isn't much in the way of medical treatment for them. If  you do have a long-lived viral infection you should at least know so that you can take the appropriate measures to boost your immunity, get rest, and keep the virus suppressed as much as possible. Rest, good nutrition and lots of patience are sometimes required.   I'd ask to have the problem  diagnosed, since it really shouldn't be happening so frequently nor for so long.   Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It does sound viral, however, and there are varieties of flu that can make one feel absolutely horrible. One of the hallmarks of influenza is body aches such as you describe. The eye pain also is often reported (it also can occur with some sinus infections, which may be what your doctor meant by a \"cold\" and is treatable with anbtiotics). This could be flu with an opportunistic sinus infection, or perhaps a severe sinus infection with flu-like symptoms.   Please let us know how things go. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Part of your symptoms is related to the cervicitis like lower back pain, the discharge, and the fever while headache, dizzy, hot and cold flashes, emotional changes are likely to be related to the contraception.  Cervical erosion is a clinical term refers to chronic cervicitis that is one of the most common types. Cervicitis is caused by infection with different organisms or due to Injury or irritation (a reaction to the chemicals in douches). The most important part in diagnosis is to exclude STDs (e.g.gonorrhea and chlamydia) and to treat that properly considering also the other partner in treatment approach.  Cultures from cervical and/or vaginal smears or discharge and Pap smear are commonly recommended tests for diagnosis. Based on the cause treatment is prescribed. Cervicitis usually shows excellent healing once infection is controlled.  Prolonged cervicitis results in abnormal mucus production which interferes with the ability of the sperms to ascend into the genital tract. Prompt eradication of the infection is essential to avoid its spread to the uterus or the fallopian tubes leading to the ovaries which may also result in difficulties to have a normal pregnancy.   So, I advise you to follow up with your doctor, and to update him with your symptoms for proper evaluation to make sure the needed tests are done.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

It is in this case, because there are so many types and causes of meningoencephalitis, and some are more likely than others to recur. We therefore need to know what sort of infection you had, if it was viral, bacterial or amoebic in origin. The last one, parasitically caused, can sometimes recur because the causative organism is better at \"hiding.\" Viral types usually run their course, although it can be a fairly long one. Bacterial ones are resolved when the bacteria are all killed.   If you can provide this important detail, I'll at least be able to hazard a guess at what's going on. In any case you should check in  with your doctor because these symptoms should be addressed even if the original problem has truly gone away.  I hope  this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Lymph nodes enlargement can occur due to many causes: of them infections and inflammation in the area drained by them.  Following infection or inflammation lymph nodes become enlarged, painful, and tender; they then regress in size but never disappear upon recovery. So they usually remain palpable but less than 1cm, soft and mobile.  Lymph nodes that continue to grow in serial clinical examination are alarming and should be properly investigated. The same is applied to nodes with abnormal characters like being hard, fixed or of considerably large size as well as those of uncommonly involved site.  Infections and inflammation in the upper respiratory tract and the oral cavity result in enlarged lymph nodes mainly those felt on both sides of the neck. They are commonly seen in the submandibular and the cervical group of lymph nodes.  Supraclavicular lymph node enlargement is not commonly seen to be enlarged after infection in these areas although possible.  What you felt might be also a lower cervical lymph node, a thyroid or just a fat tissue. The supraclavicular nodes are felt just above the inner one third of the clavicle in the supracalvicular fossa. It commonly enlarges due to problems (more seen in malignant diseases) in the lung or upper GIT, and the breast.  So, its enlargement mandates more meticulous investigations.  A thorough history and direct clinical examination are essential. I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: is it anemia or viral infection?",
    "content": "Hello chintana -   Your symptoms certainly could be due to a viral or, perhaps, bacterial infection. It is impossible to guess based on the general nature of the symptoms. The doctor's having ruled out apparent heart disease is great, and having nothing suspicious showing up on a chest x-ray is one more good thing, but if no laboratory blood tests were done then the issue hasn't really been adequately addressed. There are also some other systemic diseases that could be causing your symptoms. If it is an infection it will probably have run its course before long, but if this continues for weeks or months it is important to know the cause and  start treating it. I'd either go back and restate the complaint or else find another doctor. I'm very surprised there was no blood drawn for the lab to test.   I hope this is helpful and that by now you are feeling better. Please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Sorry for the delay in response and hope your husband is feeling better now.  These symptoms and signs are concerning and direct clinical examination is essential. Gastroenteritis and electrolyte imbalance seem to be the likely causes of his symptoms. Gastroenteritis is mostly due to viral infections although bacterial infections are not uncommon.  Fever in general causes acceleration of the heart rate but if it is out of proportion exclusion of cardiac affection is essential. ECG and echocardiograph are of choice.  Metabolic disturbances due to vomiting, diarrhoea, or inadequate intake or supplement for the loss would make him generally very weak, can not concentrate well and loses his muscle power. In addition dehydration may have a bad effect on his kidney . Electrolyte imbalance has an effect on the heart rate as well as the CNS. But proper neurologic examination is important.  Direct clinical examination is essential as well as thorough history to identify specific exposures that may give idea about of the possible source and the possible site of infection.   His doctor may recommend blood or stool culture based on the examination results. Other blood tests to check for electrolytes and CBC are important too.  Broad spectrum antibiotics may be initiated till the final results are out (even if he thinks it is viral, he may start so). Adequate fluid and electrolytes replacement are essential.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chicken pox and shingles",
    "content": "Hello Mamaboys321,  This is a good question.  Once a person has had chicken pox, the varicella virus never actually leaves the body.  Instead, it becomes dormant because the immune system essentially fights it down until it hides away.  Shingles occurs when the virus subsequently reactivates.  The virus hides in the nerve roots.  When it reactivates, it follows the nerves and causes blisters to form in the distribution of that nerve.  Shingles tends to occur when the immune system is weakened for some reason.  It is not a \"reinfection\" with the virus again.  So, being exposed to chicken pox again would not be expected to be significantly affected by this.  There is likely to not be any significant danger from being re-exposed to the chicken pox virus.  If, however, there were a reason for his immune system to be weakened there is a chance that he would develop shingles.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Am I still contagious with Mono?",
    "content": "Hi there -  When a person has mono he or she may remain contagious for up to four to five months after the symptoms have subsided. It is such in insidious disease that it's not only hard to realize something's wrong and be tested for it,  but it's hard to tell when it's really gone as well, since one may feel tired, weak, etc., for weeks or even months after an infection.   The majority of the general population is immune to mono (Epstein-Barr virus) but many may be carrying it, even when not actively infected. The main concern is that the patient who has it is well enough to return to normal activities. The disease is difficult to spread except by direct contact with bodily fluids, including saliva (the most common cause of its spread anyway, although tracing the source of infection can be very difficult). Once you're feeling well and normal again, you can return to all your normal activities including dating, although for the next few months it would be considerate of you to mention, in the course of conversation,  that  you've recently had mono (it makes for great conversation anyway). Most people won't (and should not be) turned off by this knowlege. It's not a plague, and the statistical chances of \"sharing\" it are relatively low to start with and continue to become lower as time goes by and the patient begins to feel better. You will always test positive for the E-B virus anyway, as do most of us, so that's no help in determining whether you have it actively or not.   Again, the main concern is getting yourself feeling perfectly well again. You're doing all the appropriate things at work, and are very unlikely to infect anyone else as a result. Just make sure you get plenty of rest and don't push yourself when  you're feeling really tired, as this can bring about a relapse. Other than that,  just treat it as the nuisance it is.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.  Feel better soon!\n\n",

    "content": "February of 08 I came down with the flu.  That same week I noticed a swelling under my arm similar to what I sometimes get do to deodorant.

It has shrunk and enlarged several times and now I have two tiny, red bumps that almost appear like blood filled boils.  This is only happening under my right arm.  It is mildly irritated, but nothing that affects my movement.  I feel pretty good and healthy.  I'm a college student so I'm always a slight bit tired do to long hours, but when I'm rested I feel great.  I haven't had a fever or had a sore throat recently.

    "content": "Hi there -  This sort of thing does occasionally happen due to deodorant use. The best way to prove that, of course, is to stop the deodorant  altogether, see  if the problem improves, then try using the deodorant again. If the problem flares back up, it's almost certainly being caused by the deodorant, and you can then experiment with other types to see if you can find one that doesn't cause the problem.  This also could be due to one or more ingrown hairs, in which case the deodorant still may be contributing to the aggravation of it. If it doesn't resolve with discontinuation of all deodorants within a week or two, you probably will need to be  seen by a doctor and have the area evaluated and treated. In the meantime, while stopping the deodorant, you might also try applying warm, moist local heat via a warm, moist washcloth. Don't make it so hot you burn yourself (I only say this because so many people  actually do make that  mistake).   I hope this is helpful to you. The  condition sounds fairly typical and is  probably not a cause for concern, except insofar as it is uncomfortable. Best of luck to you. Keep us updated.\n\n",

Problems in secretory glands (sebaceous glands) at the junction between the lips and the skin sometimes give similar picture.  Vitamin deficiency is also known to cause these skin changes.  Post dermatitis especially in delicate skin parts can result in skin changes that may mimic yours.  Viral infections like Herpetic lesions (thrush) typically present in the form of blisters on a red base and are associated with itching. These blisters dry up rapidly and leave scabs that disappear in a few days to a few weeks, depending on the severity of the infection  Direct dermatological examination is essential to exclude also skin diseases like vitiligo (although unlikely) or dysplastic skin changes (leukoplakia).   So, I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

They did not believe me that I was not sexually active.  That was eight years ago and have not had another lesion until recently.  A few weeks ago I began getting the skin rash (furunculosis), and a few days ago the mouth ulcers, and yesterday a lesion in my genital area.  I can't help but to think that they are all related.

    "content": "Hello -  If  the skin lesions you describe are actually furunculosis then the chance of these, the gential herpes and the mouth ulcers (aphthous stomatitis) being related is lessened. However, since furuncles are universally referred to as \"boils\" means these skin lesions may not in fact be true furuncles but skin lesions similar to what shows up with smallpox, chickenpox, and other forms of herpes. Given your history and the fact that you developed herpetic lesions in the genital area (I hesitate to call them genial herpes because they may not be type II but simply part of a systemic viral infection) also argues for this. It is an unusual presentation, but your theory that they are connected makes sense and at least warrants some investigation. Assuming they are, in fact,  all related, they can be treated with the same therapy. If the mouth ulcers and genital ulcer clear up but the skin lesions don't, then you could assume you've suffered a strange coincidence. Somehow I doubt that's the case.  Best of luck to you with this.\n\n",

My question is therefore, how can the monospot be positive if there are no IgM heterophile antibodies?

My doctor wasn't sure and diagnosed it is a 'glandular fever type illness' following negative HIV, HCV and liver screening tests. I am unable to shift form my mind however that this was a false positive monospot and therefore one of the horrible and scary false-positive causes could be the problem. I am not ill currently but have frequent flare ups of glands - I have always been like this however and strongly suspect I have had mono in the past.

    "title": "Re: Positive Monospot Test but no IgM Antibodies??",
    "content": "Hello -  It is very unlikely that a monospot test would come up false positive once, let alone twice. It is fairly unique and few other diseases (all within the Epstein-Barr family) can mimic it. There are additonal  tests to confirm or refute the finding, but two consecutive positives would seem to seal  the deal. The igG often doesn't show up anyway til later, when the infection is  beginning to resolve. While you don't mention having had any specific symptoms of  mono, there often are none (and those infected without symptoms are very fortunate), so that in no way indicates you don't have mono or one of its close relatives.   The test for mono is pretty specific and the positive finding is based on a unique blood cell morphology, so I think you can safely accept this diagnosis, especially since nothing else shows up to contradict it.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband age 65 has been dealing with this problem over a year now.  Last year he was having trouble sleeping, night sweats, fatigue, change in voice, depression, anxiety, bloodshot eyes, conjunctivitis, rash on leg, etc. and  also his blood platelets dropped to 19,000 at one point.  The doctor thought for sure he had either erlichiosis or babesiosis.  He was treated with 30 days of doxycycline and recovered almost fully.  But this spring these same symptoms occurred again.  We live in the country and get tick bites all the time.  After several blood tests have come back negative the doctor proclaimed my husband to be cured and that there is nothing wrong with him.  Yet he has this miriad of symptoms.  We saw a hemotologist who did a thorough work up and found nothing but that he has a platelet count that goes up and down.  Not as dramatic as last year.   He calls it itp, an autoimmune disease.  But this doesn't explain the other symptoms.  We have done our own research and think he is still suffering from one of the tick borne diseases.  Most likely bartonella by the symptoms.  But with negative bloodwork, how can he get treatment?  Is there anything else with this presentation that we are overlooking?  What can we do? He can't go on without doing something.  Please help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lyme/tick disease  treatment",
    "content": "Hello -  This must be terribly frustrating for your husband and for you as well. It's probably got your husband's doctor frustrated too, or soon will. It does sound as though your husband might well have had one (or more) of the tick-borne diseases you've listed as possible diagnoses, since he initially responded wll to doxycylene, which is indicated (either alone or with an anti-parasite medication); however, after having got better, he now does seem to fit more into the picture of ITP, which may possibly have been triggered by the bout with a tick-borne disease. While not specifically caused by tick-borne diseases, ITP can be \"turned on\" by any one of a number of systemic infections, stress, etc., for reasons not entirely clear.   There is treatment for ITP, if, indeed, that's what's going on now. While  it's not as simple as taking an antibiotic, a positive response to treatment would certainly help solidify the diagnosis as well as help your husband to start feeling better. Methylprednolisone (a steroid) or intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) are the two most common treatments for ITP. Of course, first other blood diseases must be ruled out, so comprehensive lab studies should be done before treating for ITP, and also certain tick-borne diseases should be ruled out as well, which it seems they have been. No doctor is likely to treat a patient for something for which there is no basis for a diagnosis, so treatment for a tick-borne disease is unlikely. If ITP can be supported as a diagnoses, perhaps secondary to a tick-borne disease, then the abovementioned treatments are often quite effective.   I hope this is helpful to you and that your husband is soon on the road to a complete and lasting recovery. Meanwhile, I hope you're both doing your best to reduce the likelihood of tick bites, since these little pests  are second only to mosquitos as far as insects spreading disease and/or toxicity.   Best  of luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lyme/tick disease  treatment",
    "content": "Thank you for your reply.   We searched out other doctors.  A hemotologist who sent my husband for a cat scan and took lots more blood for tests.  The only thing he came up with was that his immunoglobulin m count was very high.  He said showing that his body was fighting off probably an unknown virus.    He said my husband should just deal with it and come back in a month.  We also found another family doctor who sent more blood to California.  Finally, a positive report for lyme.  After a very long time, searching for help, we found a doctor who followed through for us and my husband has begun treatment.     Lyme and tick disease is at epidemic proportion on the east coast and especially in eastern suffolk county on long island.  The DEC is so busy protecting the salamanders and preventing any spraying for ticks or even EEE mosquitoes which are also multiplying alarmingly, that the human population is in danger.   The medical profession isn't keeping up with this problem either and too many people are going untreated.  The tests are not reliable and when a patient has symptoms, why does a doctor deny something may be wrong?      I pray my husband will eventually get well.  But the delay in treatment absolutely made his symptoms worse and will make his recovery longer.     What can be done to bring this to the attention to the medical profession?  Too many government agencies have their heads in the sand.   Thank you for letting me vent a bit.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi and thanks for writing back. I'm so relieved to know someone finally had the conviction to follow through and figure this thing out. It's rarely an easy diagnosis, but sick people are still sick and deserve the same standard of care they'd get anywhere else in the world. Your \"vent\" is appreciated, if for no other reason than that it will help bring the problem to the attention of more people.   As to how to help focus attention on the problem, there's no simple answer, but what you and your husband have done -- not give up nor accept second-rate care -- forces a part of the problem to move toward the solution. We all have to be advocates for ourselves and when we do we are also functioning, in some small way, as advocates for others.   The environmental part is even more tricky, as it is highly politicized. Writing editorials to newspapers and otherwise bringing the issue to the attention of the public is probably the most effective thing, but it won't yield results overnight.  Again, I'm happy to hear your husband has finally been dianosed and is receiveing treatment. Hopefully he will recover without any residual problems and meanwhile the issue will become lodged in the public's awareness.   My best to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "My hubby, 2 babies and me just got back from a week in Mexico!  About 4 days into the trip (of being in the sun about 8 hrs a day) my bottom lip became red, swollen and a bit sore.  I just thought it was sunburned.  A few days later we returned home and I developed a blister on my bottom lip.  Someone said that looks like HERPES!  I FREAKED out as I have never had a cold sore, fever blister or any of that.  I did catch Mono about 2 months ago and the dr said maybe because I am around a lot of children.  Not sure.  Anyway I went to Care Now and they did not do any testing but said yes its just a fever blister.  They gave me zovirax and abreva.  The blister was not a cluster, not on the lip line, did not look like the fever blister pics online.  The day before I went to the dr. I was intimate (in every way) with my husband and have been so worried about this ever since.  I am just waiting to see if I spread it to the rest of me, my husband and maybe my babies from sharing drinks, food and suckers...and of course the million kisses I give them in a day.  The blister went away in about 3 days but I still have really chapped lips and sore throat.  Should I get some sort of blood test or just let it go?  How could I have possibly gotten a fever blister when I have never had one before?  I am scared to even kiss my babies anymore!!!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Does it for sure have to be HSV-1?",
    "content": "Hello -  It doesn't for sure have to be HSV-1, but it would be prudent to assume it is and act accordingly. Fever blisters are one of the most common ailments afflicting humanity,  and are generally not serious but are extremely annoying and can be highly contagious,  which is why it is so very common.   Even though you've kissed and otherwise come into physical contact with family members (also very common and totally normal), for the duration of this outbreak you probably should take care to not do this, and it is entirely possible no on else has caught the virus. If they have, well, odds are they would have eventually anyway, as the majority of people do.   You mention having been out in the sun prior to the outbreak, and  there are some people  whose fever blisters are triggered mainly be exposure to sunlight. The National Institute of Dental and Craniofacial Research have determined that  sunscreen applied to the lips prior to exposure to sunlight can prevent outbreaks. They used a #15 block in their study and it was very effective. This is, of course, for future reference only, and won't do anything to make the current lesion go away. Still, it is useful to know.   The good news is the problem  is rarely serious  and is extremely common. If you continue to have the sore throat with this you probably ought to have it cultured by a doctor to make sure you don't also have, coincidentally, a strep infection which is also contagious and is potentially more serious than a fever blister.  I hope this helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Mononucleosis and mitochondrial damage?",
    "content": "I am a 27y female, was diagnosed with mononucleosis in Nov. 2006--I had severe fatigue, malaise, swollen axillary lymph nodes, fever and joint pain. Everything seemed to resolve in about two months and I went back to normal work and activity schedule (before getting sick I was running 3miles 3 times a week). By May 2007 I had gradually worked my way up to running a mile 2-3 times a week and thought it was all over, until one day I collapsed after running.   My energy level got worse over the next 2 months and I had a complete mono relapse in June 2007, with the same symptoms like the first time, and also headaches, insomnia, anhedonia, and irregular periods. Both times I was tested for mono, Lyme, CMV, thyroid and autoimmune disorders, also electrolytes, liver enzymes, CBC. Both times I was only positive for mono, everything else was normal. I slowly got better over several months, with all symptoms resolving except that I still have low stamina a year later. It's not that I'm tired all the time, in fact I feel completely back to normal--as long as I don't do any activity that requires sustained effort. Even just walking I can only last about 15min or so before I get very tired, and less on a hot day. Several doctors have told me I don't have CFS, and I also think I don't match the list of recognized CFS symptoms. Once I get tired, it doesn't take hours or days to recover, but the transition from feeling perfectly fine walking to feeling completely drained and having to sit down is very abrupt. I feel like I've completely run out of energy, even though I don't feel I've exerted myself in the sense that my heart isn't pounding and I'm not short of breath, which is what I would expect if this was due to simply being out of shape. The low stamina has been consistent over the past year and doesn't seem to have got better even though all other symptoms are gone.   My question is: could mono cause mitochondrial damage or otherwise disrupt the biochemical processes in the body responsible for making energy? It literally feels like I have a finite store of energy which normally would be replenished at a rate close to the rate of being used up with a moderate activity, but in my case it's not getting replenished at the normal rate and so every time I hit a wall when it gets used up. I've spent this past year trying to get in shape and being prevented by this consistent pattern of getting tired after only 15min or so of even a low-intensity activity. What kind of tests can I have done to determine whether I have mitochondrial damage? Is mitochondrial damage reversible? What kind of specialist should I see?   Other background: History of occasional tachycardia and PVCs since 1996, diagnosed with a form of dysautonomia (mitral valve prolapse syndrome, except that my valve isn't prolapsing). In fact I first started running at the advice of my cardiologist who said cardio exercise would help--and did it ever!, to the point where all palpitations and PVCs completely disappeared once I started running regularly. Now that I haven't been able to do it for more than a year, they have come back, so I'd really like to know what I can do to be able to exercise again.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mononucleosis and mitochondrial damage?",
    "content": "Hello -  Your mono history, unfortunately, sounds rather unremarkable. It's a really abrupt energy drop, almost like someone's pulled a plug. You'll have to be patient and work at it slowly to get back to feeling normal again.  I am aware of one study which might back up your idea about viral damage to mitrochondria, and it is the first, I believe,to yield fairly convincing evidence that this may be the case. There is, however, as yet no universal agreement on it, since most studies have shown no similar results. I also don't know what you might do to ameliorate this effect. Many people suffering from post-viral fatigue syndrome (PVF) claim to have benefitted to varying degrees from mega doses of vitamin C and extra A and E, but this is mostly based upon anecdotal evidence. So long as the C is kept to a reasonable level (to avoid forming kidney stones) and the A is kept within usual and customary doses, it may help some. Good nutrition and lots of rest are both important, but I think most helpful of all is patience, which can be tried very much by this problem.  I'm really not sure what the most appropriate type of specialist would be for this problem -- maybe a nutritionist.   Regarding the mitral valve  prolapse syndrome (MVPS) without evident actual prolapse, this is extremely common and people  who suffer from it often are prone, as i'm sure you know, to unaccountable fatigue, yet, as you've discovered, tolerate exercise really well and even thrive on a regular exercise program. Do the best you can with that under the current limitations, and with any luck you'll start to feel like yourself again before too terribly long -- although it would be very foolish of me to try and predict a timetable for that happening. Everyone is different in that respect.  Best of luck to you. Hang in there and just do as much as you can. Stay in touch, too, and let us know how things go.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Red dots Everywhere!",
    "content": "Hello -  I hope you won't be offended by my first thought on this, but given that you have had chickenpox already (even though your roommate has not), which makes chickenpox a less likely explanation, there is an odd but very real possibility that is often overlooked: bedbugs. These pests are making a comeback in the US and are not necessarily due to anyone's personal hygeine. They are usually inherited, in apartment buildings, dormatories, etc. They are small, nocturnal, and leave little red dots (bite marks) which can cause itching.  Of course the problem could be something viral, and in any case most annoying problems like these will wind up being shared by roommates one way or the other. Bedbugs are actually a major problem right now, mainly because people are unaware of them and also feel they somehow reflect on their lifestyle, which they usually don't, any more than mosquitos do.   If the dots increase or spread, and especially if other symptoms begin to show up, then something viral is more likely. In the absence of any new symptoms the pest explanation seems fairly likely. Usually the bites are treated with topical steroid creams, which help reduce the itching and somewhat reduce the redness.   It's just a guess, but since there's been such a comback of these little pests I think it's worth considering. Since they are nocturnal and are very good at hiding during the day, they're not usually spotted by their victims, who wind up wondering if they're coming down with chickenpox or measles (not unreasonable guesses unless ruled out by history, as in your case).  If anything more develops please let us know. If the problem continues, by all means have a doctor look at the bumps and maybe try a hydrocortisone cream to reduce the rash.  Good luck to you. Stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Richard5 -  It does sound like a parotid gland, and sometimes these can become enlarged because of a cold or at least a sinus infection following a cold. They also are just prominent in some people for no apparent reason, but only a doctor can tell for sure which it is via a hands-on exam. If this is all that's going on right now you might want to wait a while and see what happens, and mention it at your next regular physical. If new or different symptoms develop, however, it would be wise to bring it to the attention of a medical provider sooner.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sarabeth,  There are a few possibilities for your symptoms and they can all potentially be tied back to the influenza virus.  The rapid heart rate may be due to some mild dehydration.  Influenza can cause inflammation of the muscles leading to cramping.  It can also cause some inflammation of the kidneys and bladder (basically similar to a urine infection from the virus rather than a bacteria).    If your symptoms do onto begin to improve in the next few days or if they are getting worse I would recommend you see your doctor for re-evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sarabeth -   You've really been through an ordeal, and as of this most recent post of yours, it seems something has been exposed but no one is ready to give it a name. Enlarged liver and spleen are often seen together, and there are over 500 possible causes of this highly unpleasant combo. Some of those potential causes are serious, but most are not. The challenge here is to figure out which one is causing your particular symptoms, and since so little has apparently been done in terms of lab work. While  imaging (CT scan, etc.) can show the \"What\" of a problem, you need the lab involved to help find the \"Why.\" Since this all has followed a bout of inflenza, and since there are often sequalae which follow flu (sequelae meaning things that follow -- didn't mean to be redundant) it's important to find out just what's going on so it can be addressed. Have you had any blood drawn during these medical encounters? I would hope so, but if so then it would seem nothing significant has turned up yet. If that's the case then I suppose the least that could be done would be to follow it and see what develops, but meanwhile you are in a great deal of discomfort. One big possibility that jumps out is mononucleosis (mono) which is easy to test for, often either follows the flu or is mistaken for it in its acute phase, and will certainly cause enlargement of both organs as you've experienced. Usually there will also be some discomfort due to the organ enlargement and often extreme fatigue as well.   The palpitations don't seem to fit the rest of the picture, at least on the surface, but if you have a deficiency of something due to inflammation of your liver or spleen, or because there is something not quite right with your blood cells, then this could possibly cause the palpitations. Then again, they often occur for no apparent reason at random times, or because of things we ingest (caffeine, nicotine, etc.). Hopefully by now someone has gotten a better idea of what is wrong or, better yet, perhaps it has run its course and you're feeling better.  Please keep in touch with us here. Hopefully by now the picture is clear and you're feeling a lot better.\n\n",

This past Sunday evening, I had a meal that I believe gave me some bad heartburn (lasagna).  I took Pepto Bismol 3 times that night; however my sleep was spotty at best (probably a total of 3 hrs sleep).  I went to the gym at around 5:20 AM and came back home afterwards.  I was not feeling well, but nothing serious.    I went to bed Monday night, still somewhat difficult to sleep because at this point, my entire body was aching and I also had a runny nose.  I slept on my side, with my face pointed down.  I did this because I have had several incidents in the past where a runny nose has led to nasal runoff and a sore throat in the morning.    I successfully avoided the sore throat, but felt worse overall Tuesday morning.  Again, I did not have a lot of sleep.    It is now Wednesday.  A few more things, first, I have had rectal bleeding for the past three BMs, the first had blood specifically on one side of my stool (indicating that it might be a tear on one side of my intestinal track.  The last two have been completely covered in blood.  While I have listed a family history of hypertension & high cholesterol, I do not think these would be the cause.  I had my blood pressure taken almost 10 times this past October (2007) and each time showed me as 120/80 (note: diastolic pressure may be higher, I do not remember).  While I have not had my BP taken recently, I have not had a significant change in diet, exercise routine, etc.  I eat (for the most part) very healthy.  For the past 3 days I have been having a very high fiber diet (almost no protein).    I believe that I have caught the flu that has been going around here in Miami, FL.  I am in constant contact with students (I am an instructor of adults), several of whom have had similar circumstances (at least missing a day or two of class & feeling overall just drained).  I have also had a small, consistent headache (nothing debilitating) in the frontal lobes of my brain.  Just a constant annoyance would best describe it.  Lastly, I have purposely been driving my body temperature up (by wearing extra layers of clothing to bed & going to the sauna).  Usually, I feel this need to warm myself only when I am truly sick.  I facilitate it to help denature any possible viruses (something I learned about in class).  I have ensured that I am drinking a lot of fluids (with electrolytes) to maintain my body's water level.  While I have not been having a diarea (except for a very small amount today (Wednesday) I do not believe that I am loosing any more fluids othe than urination.   Any help would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

It progressed like this into Wednesday, where I again awoke with a sore throat with the absence of a fever or any other symptoms really. I did notice I had some swollen either lymph nodes or glands in my neck that sort of hurt to the touch. Well on Thursday, I still had the sore throat, and I decided to take a look at my tonsils with a light. My right tonsil has some white lumpiness on it. My lymph nodes in my groin were also noticeable, not too swollen, but raised. Well it's Friday, I still have a sore throat, a little less painful though. My temperature is 97, so that's normal. My lymph nodes are still swollen, though I still don't know where my lymph nodes are on my neck, I'm assuming the things I'm feeling are in fact lymph nodes. The whiteness on my tonsils seems to have mostly gone away, although a little bit remains. I also have had slight pain in my abdomen, on and off. That could just be other things, though. What the heck is going on with me? The fact I have no fever is perplexing.\n\n",

I have not had unprotected sex since getting my period.)  It is now 9 days later, and I am still ill.  Mainly, I wake up in the middle of the night (I'm having extreme difficulty sleeping) a bit nauseated.  Usually get up with extreme nausea and dry heaves (though no dry heaves this morning for the first time, just nausea).  The past two days, the nausea subsides by 10:00 or so and I'm just a bit belchy.    Because of nausea, I'm not eating much (5-6 small, bland meals).  Am drinking water and tea and occasional sports drink or popsicle.  I have very little energy, especially when I first wake up.  Doctor suggested avoiding eating too much, but I'm afraid that might be contributing to my nausea and weakness (as is my sleeplessness).  This is not like any \"stomach flu\" I've had before.  Also, I've been pregnant before and it wasn't like this, either.  My questions:  I'm just getting kind of desperate.  I've been sick for 9 days, which is exhausting and a strain on my family.  Are these symptoms normal for the flu?  Why would I feel so much worse in the morning?  What is it okay for me to eat/drink (e.g. is there dairy in things like Ensure shakes that would be bad for me)?  Can I take something to help me sleep?  If the hospital pregnancy test was negative, is that reliable?  When can I expect to feel like myself again?  I just don't know what to do--doctors won't open up \"new patient\" appointment for me for weeks yet.  Please, any information you can give me would be so helpful.  Thank you.\n\n",

If, in fact, you had the flu, it is not uncommon for it to last 10 days to two weeks.  Flu can make you most miserable and can result in dehydration.  It usually involves fever and often respiratory symptoms as well.    I can't diagnose this over the internet, especially when the doctor who saw you couldn't say for sure, but you should know there are thousands of viruses and each person can respond in their own way to this invasion.  I suspect this is the case for you and that your body will get a handle on it and you will heal.  If it continues, you may as well keep the new patient appointment and let them evaluate your symptoms to see if there is an underlying problem.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with mono about two and a half weeks ago, after almost a week of a sore throat. The sore throat, it turns out, was an ulcer back there; it took another week to go away, but there are plenty new ulcers/canker sores in my mouth, rather large and painful ones. Besides that and steadily increasing fatigue (I didn't even realize I was tired before the mono spot test, but after that I got more tired every day), I haven't had any problems. No spleen enlargement or anything as far as I can tell.  Five-ish days ago, I woke up with a very stiff neck. I had to keep my head cocked to the left; I couldn't even make it straight. I figured it was because I slept strangely on it. It got better -- now I can tilt my head most of the way to the right with little pain. But then I saw on all the major medical websites that, if one has mono, developing stiff neck is problematic and should be followed by a call to 911 or an emergency room visit.  So.. I still think I just slept on it funny, because I haven't had any emergencies lately.. but could it be encephalitis/meningitis/some other mono-induced complication?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mussavcom,  Your neck pain can be from a few different things associated with mono.  Commonly with acute mononucleosis, the lymph nodes in the neck will become quite enlarged.  They can cause a sore neck and pain with movement.  Meningitis is also possible though less common.  If you have a persisting stiff neck and a severe HA you should follow up with your doctor for further evaluation.    It may also be that you slept wrong and had a sore muscle.  If your stiff neck is improving, meningitis or one of these severe complications is much less likely.  If, however, your neck pain returns or you are not overall getting better you should follow up with your doctor.    Full recovery from mononucleosis can take 6-8 weeks so hang in there.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have suffered from genital herpes for about 10 years, and as it was not diagnosed at the beginning, I transferred it to my lips and eyes. I now take 400mg of aciclovir twice daily to avoid outbreakes - before starting on the aciclovir I had an outbreak (in the genital area) once every month, about 1 week before having my period, so I assume it is triggered by hormones.   Now I am at a point in my life where I would like to try to get pregnant, but am worried about how to manage my herpes outbreaks during pregnancy - especially considering that the outbreaks seem to be related to my hormone levels, I am worried that it will get a lot worse during pregnancy. I am particularly worried about the herpes in my eyes, as I already have a few small spots blurring my vision - it is not much now, but I am obviously afraid that my vision could become impared if I have further outbreaks there.  The question is whether it would be safe for the fetus if I took aciclovir during pregnancy? If not, are there any other ways of managing my condition?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The antiviral medications available to treat genital herpes are acyclovir, famciclovir, and valacyclovir. Acyclovir has the most data on the safety of use in pregnancy. A registry of over 1000 pregnant women who were exposed to acyclovir during early pregnancy suggests that acyclovir is probably safe as there were no increases in birth defects.  You should be able to manage your herpes infection throughout your pregnancy.  Make sure your doctor is aware of your health history so you can get the best care possible.  It is even possible to have a vaginal birth if you do not have an active outbreak at the time of delivery.    Otis pregnancy organization is a teratology service and they offer the following information in PDF format.  http://www.otispregnancy.org/pdf/acyclovir.pdf  This should be encouraging to you.  Good luck.\n\n",

And now she's very paranoid and worried. She has really dry hands and fingers, so she thinks there was a cut there and she may have Hepatitis C now.  Her co-worker said she's been through all sorts of instances where she was exposed to blood for years, but she's fine.  My mom thinks that she may have cuts on her hands due to her dry skin. She washed her hands. She also put alcohol on her exposed finger several times to see if there was a cut. She never felt a sting, so no cut.  She wanted to see if she felt a sting if she put a cut on her leg. She didn't feel a sting. (I think she's forcing her mind to not feel a sting, causing her to worry).  I told her that it has to be a deep cut for the infected blood to enter her bloodstream and that she definitely would've felt a deep cut when she put alcohol on it.  She's a very worrisome person. And now I'm really getting worried, even though I believe she doesn't have Hepatitis C.  Can you please tell me what the odds are she may have Hepatitis C based on the situation? Do you think she may have it? I REALLY appreciate the help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The incubation period for hepatitis C ranges from 15 to 150 days with the average around 50 days.  You didn't mention how long ago this exposure was.  I assume you mean she knows the patient had hepatitis C and worries because she came in contact with the blood when not wearing gloves.  If this is a particular patient and she knows she had not previously been infected with hepatitis C, she can be tested now and maybe even repeat the test at 150 days after the exposure.  If she shows no hepatitis C by then she can assume she was not infected.    If she works in a facility and the exposure was reported as an incident, they will probably provide testing and I would encourage it for her peace of mind.  I would not rely on the alcohol test to determine if cuts are present but at least that would imply any abrasion she had would have been minimal and it would lessen the risk of blood to blood transmission of infection.  (Additionally, as for sensitivity - legs have fewer nerve endings than fingers).  Deep body fluids, IV exchanges, dirty needles, sexual contact, sharing toothbrushes when gums may bleed, etc. are the likely modes of transmission.  Encourage your mother to always wear gloves when doing patient care or handling contaminated linens and supplies.    Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I are travelling to Egypt in April, 2008 and see that it is recommended to be vaccinated for Hepatitis A and possibly B and get an adult polio booster.    We were both vaccinated for Hepatitis A and B after Hurricane Katrina in 09/2005.  We never went back for the booster shots.   There is very little information on the internet addressing the effectiveness of the vaccine without the booster shot.   I found one article that said there is evidence of immunity without the booster shots for Hepatitis A.  I can't really find anythng about continuing immunity for Hep B.  Also, we were both vaccinated for polio as children and received the OPV.  We are in our fifties now.    After Katrina we could have gotten these boosters free of charge, but now we would have to go to the Ochsner Travel Center/Infectious Disease Department to get the shots and they are very costly.  We are travelling to Cairo, going on a Nile Cruise and then to Sharm el Sheikh on the Red Sea.  These are mostly tourist areas.  Do you think we will be protected against Hepatitis A and B without getting  the boosters?  Do you advise getting the polio booster?  Thanks for your help.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hepatitis A & B Vaccination Without Booster Shot",
    "content": "Hello, The information on Hepatitis A indicates that immunity with the first dose is probably good for somewhere between five and eight years so you could probably pass on the second dose for this trip.  However, it is recommended for long-term immunity.  Hepatitis B is one that is recommended for travelers to Egypt but your risk is not great unless you plan to stay there for at least six months or work in a situation that might put you at risk such as health care.  You do not need a booster at all if you completed the initial series.  But, if you only had one, long-term protection will require the second and third doses.  Hepatitis A is transmitted sexually and through blood or other deep body fluids.  Contaminated/shared needles used for drugs, or accidentally injected are a cause of the disease.  So, consider your risk and you may opt out assuming there is no other requirement for you on this.   Polio boosters are usually only given once if you travel to a place that is currently at risk for polio.  This is where the travel clinic comes in.  They monitor diseases throughout the world and could advise you on this.  The information changes so I can't say for your situation at present.  You do not have to have another booster as an adult if you get one.  So, if you travel again to a country at risk you would not need to repeat the booster.  You may inquire at your local health department if your insurance doesn't cover hepatitis or other vaccines.  They may have reduced cost vaccines when not given as part of the travel clinic.  You do not have to go to the travel clinic if you know what it is you want/need to have.  Just go to the health department and ask to be immunized.  Inquire about cost.  This could be lower than the travel clinic or private physician can offer.    The travel clinic personnel are the most qualified to evaluate your particular situation.  I hope this helps a bit.\n\n",

    "content": "Typically a low-grade fever such as you describe is associated with a viral infection and you just have to give your body a chance to heal itself.  It is possible to develop a secondary bacterial infection so if symptoms get worse, you spike a high fever, have any deterioration of mental state, consciousness, trouble breathing, or other significant symptoms you should see a doctor.    I'll use this opportunity to also push flu shots.  You can prevent the most debilitating flu forms this year if you get this immunization.  I would encourage it, especially for anyone living with or near someone with a suppressed immune system (as with chemo, pregnancy, infants, etc.).  This could last a week before you get well but if it lingers or additional symptoms, don't hesitate to get medical attention.  Do not take antibiotics for a viral infection.  Not only is it a waste of money, it doesn't work and can do harm.   Good luck.\n\n",

So, even though you had a cut lip, your friend was just exposing you to saliva.  I would say it is unlikely you would get it from this encounter.

Regardless of what others do, you put yourself at risk in sharing personal things with those you know little about.  You can't expect your acquaintances to tell you their medical history before your social encounters.  We just don't drill people like that or feel the need to disclose our past history.

I was getting lower back pains and nausea. I went to the ER and got a ct scan of my kidney because it felt like I had a kidney stone again. That came up clean. Blood test nothing. The sick feeling never seemed to go away and i got much worse later on realizing it was my stomache bothering me. I went to see a gastro MD and after a upper endoscopy and colonoscopy I was diagnosed with H. Pylori. And finally treated for it. I was finished with meds since early feb. My stomache issue is fine now. However other symptoms never went away. I was still rather fateagued and still had sinus pressure. Everything seemed to get worse as time went on. Randomly my mid back lower neck would go numb in the middle and my left arm would begin to numb also at night when trying to sleep. When I had the H.Pylori it was  very hard to distinguish what symptoms were from what. I went back and forth to the doctors she kept prescribing me cipro for the sinus. Cipro apparently has no effect on me after 2 prescriptions. My sinus pressure had not improved, I had yellow green colored mucus, headaches every day that tylenol would not help, chest tightness fateague and feeling of a fever but I had a normal temp. I also had random sharp pains in my ears. I went back to the Dr's He gave me a CTscan of my head, they found nothing. I was then put on cephalexcin after first prescription I was actually feeling better but it wasnt gone yet so I got an extended prescription. With 4 days left I was feeling rather better the headaches had subsided, but my chest was still tight and I was coughing up clear mucus from my lungs. I did not have cough I had to force it up myself. I do have asthma so I did have an inhaler that I was taking twice a day ever day durring all of this. Which is rare because I hardly have to use it. I returned to the doctors, they gave me another blood test and a chest xray. Nothing came up. Doctor suggested this may be viral. My symptoms as of now are Head ache, sinus pressure/swelling, getting another sore throat I feel, Fateague, low grade temp of 99.8 in the evenings (normal 98.6) when the headache gets worse. Chest tightness, still feel like there is stuff in my lungs every now and then I can get stuff up. I am taking right now Claritin D ever day x1, Prilosec x1, Albuterol inhaler 2x. I have charity healthcare so I am stuck going to the ER every time, the clinic is near impossible to get an appt to. I don't think the ER doctors understand how long I have been going through this because each time I go I see a different doctor. I have literally gone to the ER about 10 times because of this all since  November. The clinic 3x. I have no where to turn, they arent finding anything with the ct scans, xrays or blood tests. They have not tested me with cultures or bacteria of any kind. I think this is the only route I have left. I lost my job because of this, I havent worked since November! I feel absolutely horrible physically. I have been off and on antibiotics of all kinds since November. I could really use your opinion on this I would be greatful. Med History: -Lyme disease (8yrs old) bit again 2 years ago but tests come up neg. -Asthma (mild) -Kidney stone 1x 5 years ago\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms may be related to a viral infection but it sounds more suspicious for severe allergies.  I did see that you are on Claritin; however, sometimes Claritin simply isn't enough.  You may want to consider using a nasal steroid spray as well as considering starting an inhaled steroid to suppress any asthma symptoms.  You may not need to stay on the inhaled steroid for a long period of time.    It sounds as if you've had enough antibiotics to cover essentially every possible infection, except perhaps an atypical pneumonia but this should have shown up on a chest x-ray.  I would not recommend further antibiotics at this point unless something definite is identified.  You may wish to see an allergist for testing to help determine if this is the issue, or just try being treated more aggressively.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your reply. I've had allergies before but this does not feel like allergies. My sinus mucus is green/yellow as well. I'm still feeling something going on in my chest and still have to use my inhaler every day. I feel so weak and I have a constant headache now. My vision has also started to seem like a fog off and on with a odd feeling in my head.   There's nothing in this house to be severely allergic to, no pets or mold. I feel so sick every day I really don't know what is going on. There literally hasn't been one single day that I've felt well since Halloween. Is it possible that I could have aquired something else from this guys water as well as the H. Pylori? I'm planning on going back to the Dr's in the next two days something definitely isn't right. Are there particular tests that I can request that would bring up any bacterial or viral infection? I know something is going on, I've never felt this sick before in my life. I really would like to find out exactly what. I had an old prescription of amoxicillin that I recently started taking and I noticed that it has been keeping my temperature at a steady 97.6 - 98.5 and for the first 3 days of taking it I started to feel somewhat better however about 5 days into it I'm feeling worse again. Previously when I was on nothing I would have constant 99.9 temp when I was feeling bad every day, every single day for about two weeks straight.   on a side note: When I had the H. Pylori I started taking the amoxicillin and my stomach was in such bad shape that it made me feel really bad, so I figured I was allergic to pennicillin, now after all that nonsense I started taking the amoxicillin and i'm fine with it, I'm not feeling any side effects at all, so i'm not allergic to it.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all thank you very much for your input. I've gone to the ER twice since your last post, I keep getting the same answer, blood test is fine, there's nothing wrong with you. When I request to be tested for viral or bacterial the last DR said \"there's nothing to culture, your blood test is fine\"  So today I called the coworker I believe i contracted HPylori from to see if he is having anything close to what I'm going through. I have not seen nor talked to him since the beginning of November. I was shocked! He is having the same exact symptoms I am!! Even better he is getting the same answers that nothing is wrong with him as well!! This only further makes me think that I definitely have something parasitic or viral goin on. I called the clinic to go back to my Gastro Intestinal DR that found the Hpylori in the first place today as well, I was told I needed a referral, they said I have to wait until the 22nd to see the DR at the clinic to get this referral!! This is rediculous, then to see the gastro and have to wait for an appt with him, even more extra time! I really can't take feeling like this anymore. My temp has been fluxuating from 97.6 - 100.2 now every day for the past month and I'm having problems breathing like I have a chest cold but worse. I plan on going to the ER tomorrow and seeing if I can get the required tests and tell them about the recent call to my coworker and see if I can at least get an immediate referrall. How do you go about telling a DR that he is looking in the wrong places!!!???  I know I'm just venting but honestly, Over the past months I have become an investigator of myself to try and figure this all out.\n\n",

I just took one dosage of the Cephalexin and about an hour later was trying to sleep, woke up feeling like I could not breathe and felt anxious and confused so I don't think I'm going to continue taking it anymore because of the side effects.

To find out exactly what you had been exposed to.    There are many independant water testing companies in every city. They could tell you how to obtain a sample, but generally it would be directly from the tap- since that is how you would have been drinking it. Contaiminated well water can harbor numerous things that can make you very sick and explain your variety of symptoms. They can usually get the results to you in a few days. You can also call your city and have them test the well water (may take longer). I hope you are better now!\n\n",

    "content": "This is good advice to have the water checked.  As for taking the antibiotic, this should not be a problem since you were so close to the full dose amount, but taking just a partial prescription of antibiotics is always a bad idea because it can leave bacteria just knocked down; not eliminated.  This can result in mutant bacteria that will make you even more sick and be less responsive to antibiotics because it has become resistant.  Misuse of antibiotics is a great threat to our health with superinfections emerging that do not respond to the available treatments.  It is everyone's job to not take antibiotics incorrectly in order to preserve their value in the future.  Much of the resistance has occurred because over the years people took antibiotics for everything - viral as well as bacterial, thinking it would not hurt to take them \"just in case\" it was bacterial.  Now we know better.  The miracle of antibiotics is not without it's potential ineffectiveness if overused.  The switch from one to another was probably not the reason for your symptoms but you might have been having an allergic reaction so it's good you stopped it and you should be cautious in the future.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  25 year old male, based in UK.  In the past year I have had frequent colds - just under one a month on average (mostly at the front end of the year). Although prone to the odd cold, I have never had so many in a single year.  I went to my GP, who did a CBC, liver function test, diabetes test. All came back within the normal ranges.  In addition, my tongue has had a white coating at the back for over a year. A swab for thrush came back negative. I also have skin problems, including a weird single red patch (only very mildly itchy) on the sole of each foot lasting for a few months.  At what point should my GP assess my immune function, igg levels etc?  Could I have just had a bad, unlucky year? My health has previously been fine up til now.  I have had a full STD panel, including numerous HIV tests, which were all negative, but I am concerned any problem with my immune system could prevent these tests from being accurate.  Thanks for the help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Hughgrant,  By far the most likely cause is that you simply were unlucky and have gotten back to back infections.  Actually, luck may not have had much to do with it.  When your immune system is fighting off one viral infection it is more likely to be able to catch another one before it has had a chance to recover from the first infection.  Additionally, there are generally more viruses around during the winter season.  Keep in mind that most immune defects would have presented much earlier in your life as well.  If you feel this is atypical and are concerned there are some very simple screening blood tests that can evaluate for many of the more common immune defects.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Your barber should be sterilizing his shaving equipment and changing blades between patients.  I'm not sure about hair clippers and what precautions he might be taking there.  You pose a good question.  I doubt the barbers are especially diligent about using antiseptic solutions between patients as they should be but I doubt the risk is huge or we would be seeing patterns to that effect.  You can raise these questions with your barber and if he doesn't answer to your satisfaction, keep looking.    I suspect this could be one possible mode of transmission, though the greatest risk is IV drug contamination and sexual contact.  There are a good number of cases with unknown sources of infection.   Hepatitis does have a long life even without a host.  Hepatitis B can live for seven days outside the body.  At least hepatitis B can be prevented with vaccination.  It's too bad we don't yet have such protection available for hepatitis C.  In this world we live in, getting immunized makes sense.    Thank you for writing.\n\n",

About a month ago I had a severe sore throat, cough, fever, etc. My doctor just looked in my throat and said it was pharyngitis, and prescribed me a Z-pack. The Z-pack did nothing, so we called her back and she prescribed Amoxicillin. After finishing the Amoxicillin I felt better for a few days, but now I feel weak, my throat has white in it, my lymph nodes are swollen, my temperature is 101, and I have body aches. I looked up the symptoms and thought I probably had mono, so I went back to the doctor today. She felt my lymph nodes, took my temperature, and took a throat culture, and told me I was right. But then she prescribed me more Amoxicillin.  My question is, will Amoxicillin help in any way? I know mono is a virus and I'm very against taking unnecessary antibiotics. Is there any possible way more antibiotics could help with mono?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Storaged,  If your infection is mono antibiotics will not help.  In fact, taking the amoxicillin may cause a rash.  Mono is caused by ebstein-barr virus (EBV).  There is an interaction between EBV and amoxicillin that causes a rash to develop all over the body.  EBV can be tested for with a blood test called a monospot.  If the sore throat is caused by the group A strep bacteria, the amoxicillin is appropriate.  Strep can also be tested for.   I would suggest you talk with your doctor about having these tested for.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Switz2001,  First, let me congratulate you on getting into medical school and choosing medicine as a profession.  It is an incredibly rewarding field.  Regarding shingles, it is possible to have more than one outbreak.  Shingles is caused by the Varicella Zoster virus (chickenpox virus) and represents a reactivation of this virus.  The virus hides in the nerve roots until it reactivates, accounting for the dermatomal distribution of the rash.  Shingles often manifests when the the body is stressed and the immune system is weakened.  If you continue to get these outbreaks it would be a good idea to see your doctor.  Using a suppressive medicine may help keep the virus down until your immune system has a chance to recover.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am 22, Male. I don't have any allergies, I'm not on any medications. I do have eczema which I inherited from my mom, but it only shows up when I am stressed and only on my palms. I've never had any surgeries, in fact I've never been to the hospital for even a stitch.  Up until recently I never had a cold sore either. I got one, which I've been treating very successfully with OTC Abreva topical cream and L-lysine (amino acid) supplement. I woke up with a somewhat swollen eye today, and mildly itchy now and then and I'm hoping it's not an ocular version of the cold sore infection.   My big problem, though, and why I'm writing, are these stinging/itchy red spots on my penis that are freaking me out. Here's what they look like:  http://www.nkusigep.org/db/themes/darkb ... ection.jpg  I can't identify them from online research. Hydrocortisone cream is somewhat effective at releiving the burn/itch from it. It doesn't look like the herpes blisters photographs online, nor yeast or what have you.  I'm really worried, without insurance, and though I know there is no substitute for a doctor's examination, I am hoping to get some direction. I really appreciate this site and anyone who could take a minute to give me their best guess. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jrcnyc,  There are a few issues here.  First, if you suspect that the cold sore virus (herpes virus) is causing the eye infection it is crucial that you have this evaluated right away.  Herpes infection of the eye can quickly become very serious and endanger the eye.  This is uncommon but must be taken seriously due to the severity of the outcomes.  Regarding your penile issues, I agree that it does not appear to be a herpes blister.  It's a little difficult to say from the picture.  It may be still be a fungal skin infection.  It may also be a contact irritation.  If STD's are possible I would recommend you be tested for them because they are commonly assymptomatic in men.  The picture doesn't make me think of any particular infection but testing is important.  There are often clinics that can see patients on a free or reduced fee basis for those that do not have health insurance.  Your local health department can help you find these clinics if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your mothers condition. Coudl you please provide us with more information.   How was her brain swelling diagnosed? Did the doctors tell you of her diagnosis? What else was she treated with besides the steriods.  Brain swelling often refers to edema of the brain (fluid accumulation in the brain matter). This can result from many conditions.   Commonly this is caused by stroke / a mass lesion. If a CT / MRI was done then these conditions would have been excluded right away.  An infection of the brain matter (also known as encephalitis) is usually viral but is accompanied by fever and is diagnosed by lumbar puncture.   One possibility, given her history of hypertension, is that she had a hypertensive encephalopathy. This is a rare condition in which the blood pressure rises uncontrollably above 180/110 and causes brain edema as well as increases the risk of stroke. It can lead to various symptoms such as altered consciousness and can be fatal. Treatment of this condition would include an IV hypertensive and in some cases a steroid.   This is my best guess, please ask her doctor and post and update here and I would be more than happy to further assist you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello marybuff,  I am so happy that you are feeling better. Thank you very much for posting your update. I am sure this will benefit our viewers.   Lyme disease is caused by infection from a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi and is transmitted to humans by the bite of infected blacklegged ticks. This can happen while camping.   There are generally three stages of Lyme's disease. Milder forms of the disease would manifest with a target rash, neurological abnormalities such as Bell's palsy or a more severe type which affects the brain.   Minor disease is usually treated with doxycycline while the more severe form would require hospitalization and is treated with ceftriaxone.  This disease is usually suspected when a patient presents with headache, fever as well as stiff neck (meningitis). The appearance of rash as well as joint pains in your case would make Lyme disease a possibility. That said, its not an easy disease to diagnose.  Diagnosis is done by serology (IgM and IgG).  Good luck and wishing you a quick recovery.\n\n",

    "content": "As my wife does not use the computer much, I am sending this question for her. She has no adverse medical history other than perhaps mononucleosis when she was in her teens. She is currently 55.   She has had a fluctuating temperature 97-104+ for over two weeks now. She has no pain, however is extremely fatigued. She wakes up drenched with sweat.   The Doctor said he was concerned about something he heard when he listened to her breathing. She does seem to have a tight feeling in her upper/center chest.   Tests have indicated normal white cell counts and no sign of infection. Liver function is somewhat high ( 250), however may be caused by the Tylenol, Ibuprofen and antibiotics she is taking.   She has had no change in these conditions. Additional blood tests have been ordered. We live in Arizona where Valley Fever can be a problem also. Test for it was negative. While awaiting the next Doctor visit in a couple days, I thought I would see if anyone had any thoughts on this condition. Thank you in advance for your input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi WilliamAZ,  I, too, live in Arizona and am quite familiar with Valley Fever.  Her symptoms do sound quite consistent with this.  If her first tests were negative for valley fever but there continues to be suspicion of valley fever the tests should be repeated in 6-8 weeks.  The tests for valley fever are blood tests that look for antibodies against the cocci fungus responsible.  It can take several weeks for these antibodies to form during an acute infection.  Typically valley fever does not require treatment as it often will resolve without incident.  If the infection is severe there are antifungal medications that can help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I didn't use any vaccination afterwards, and the dog seemed fine after around 12 days, when we got back to the place.

You have had quite a number of these, though, so it may be helpful for you to see an Ear, Nose and Throat doctor for an evaluation.

    "content": "I am a 25 yo, white male, with no history of medical problems before this began.  Also have no family history of medical problems that resemble what is currently happening to me.  This problem began in January of 2005 with a primary infection of herpes simplex 1 with flu like symptoms and a sore on my middle finger, right hand (I bite my fingernails and infected my finger while biting them during the virus's initial onset.)  Was told it was the herpes virus and was told not to worry as it was a very common virus.  A few months and cold sores later I developed a stinging, burning pain around my penis.  No sores were present yet this pain persisted, non-stop 24 hours a day.  I went to the doctors to get it looked at and was provided with no diagnosis and no relief to the problem.  April 2005, woke up with a very red right eye.  Went to the doctors, ran some tests, and again got no diagnosis.  Was told to rest and see if it would resolve on it's own.  Three days later it was gone but other problems began to arise.  I would wake up every morning afterwards to flaky skin under my right eye.  A slight tingling sensation also began, though it was nothing compared to the pain around my penis.  Cortisone cream was prescribed and the flaky skin under my right eye went away and never came back.  The sensation slowly progressed into a burning, stinging pain that resembled the pain around my penis.  This is when I went to my doctor and told him I was really starting to suffer.  A long road of visits to specialists began...neurologists, opthamologist, virologist, pain management doctors...and two years later I still have no answers!    The pain has been controlled with narcotics and lyrica but how long can that continue?  I'm 25 years old and don't want to become dependent on these pills just to get around day to day.  I can't believe that in this day and age I've gone two years without getting any possible diagnosis or plan to treat the underlying problem.  I'm desperate for help.  All anyone is focused on these days is getting me off the painkillers without giving me any alternate plan to treat my pain.  I apologize for the length of this post but my problem seems to be more complex than most that the doctors around here are used to seeing.  It's really had quite a devastating effect on my life.  I used to fly for the Air Force, a life long dream of mine, and because of this I have had to give it up.  I have been through serious bouts of depression and hopelessness through all of this and would give anything to be free of this pain.  I have great medical coverage because of the military but have yet to find anyone that is willing to go the distance to help me or send me in the right direct to get the help I need.  Any suggestions or avenues to pursue would be GREATLY appreciated!  -Hopeless in Oklahoma\n\n",

    "content": "I am a female in mid-30's and recently received the first of two live chicken pox vaccines for a medical program I'm entering for school.  I had chicken pox exactly 30 years ago, but was told I needed the vaccine's anyway. Ten days afterward, I started having genital discomfort, but I thought it was from shaving my genital area.  By the fourteenth day after the vaccine, I had mucosal discharge coming from my rectum along with an itchy rash.  And my entire vulvar area was extremely swollen and painful with needle-like stabbing pain.  I wasn't able to get in to see the doctor until the sixteenth day after receiving the vaccine.  That day, she diagnosed me with shingles and also did the HSV-1 & HSV-2 blood antibody tests, which both came back positive for exposure.  I've never had an outbreak before this, but I went to also see my OB/GYN as well.  She said she has seen about eight other cases like mine over the last five years, but couldn't be exactly sure by the time I had seen her which viral outbreak I was experiencing.   But I was wondering with the symptoms I am experiencing, even still (twenty-six days after the vaccine), is it more likely shingles that HSV-2?  I never got any definite confirmation, just more like guesses from the doctor.  Also, I am still experiencing the agonizing needle-stabbing pain as well as the rash (a bit milder) and it feels like I am excrementing sandpaper when I have to have a bowel movement.\n\n",

If you have been infected with HSV II, you could receive treatment to help you, especially for the problems of future outbreaks.  If it is a reaction to the vaccine, it should be self-limiting and no ongoing medical treatment would be indicated as this would most likely be a single event. Did your doctor indicate anything along these lines?  Were any samples taken to examine microscopically?  Good luck with this frustrating problem and please let us know how things progress.\n\n",

    "content": "I greatly appreciate you're help. I am in severe pain and would appreciate any information you could provide on what it may be or what specialist to see. I have already seen a few regular doctors and they are only prescribing Norco. Thank you for your time. Here are my stats/issues:  23 year old female - not pregnant, not sexually active, no diseases. 290lbs. Perfect blood pressure (usually 107-110/80) Great cholesterol levels. Family history of high blood pressure and many different female cancers (breast and ovarian) and other cancers (brain and leukemia) in aunts and siblings.   Only pre-existing condition is PCOS (poly cystic ovarian syndrome) diagnosed in 2002.   From January to March 18th of this year I had a prolonged non-stop period. I resumed treatment for the PCOS - metformin and YAZ.  I had previously stopped taking metformin over a year ago because of continual stomach upset. I saw my gyno 4 times from March to the 1st of May. My period ended after 2 weeks on Metformin and Yaz. However, at that time (early april), I began to notice severe breast tenderness. This was followed by several lumps or inflamed tissue in the breast. The lumps come and go and about 2 times a week the lumps are about an inch around and you can feel the easily and see them by just looking at my breasts. My gyno told me to take Evening Primrose Oil and said they were just inflamed from hormonal changes. I took 3,000 daily of the EPO and still I presented the same lumps. My breasts have also grown 1 whole cup size. They have become very very tender.   Now this past weekend (5/11/07) I began to have severe chest pains and difficulty breathing. I had been on metformin for 6 weeks at that point. The chest pain became extreme and I stopped taking the metformin fearing that it was the cause. The chest pains continues along with severe back pain  (in the middle of the back about 3 inches below the shoulder blades).   Furthermore, over the past week and a half the breast pain has spread through my armpits and down my arms. It appears all of my lymph nodes are swollen. It hurts to raise my arms or turn my head. Below my collar bone is where it hurts the most.  And when I am not just suffering from this regular soreness and burning pain through my nodes, I get a gripping terrible pain between my breasts ...it feels like my heart is being squeezed and I have difficulty breathing.   The pain became so bad on 5/15 that I went to the Emergency Room. They suspected a pulmonary embalism or heart attack and performed an EKG, Chest X-ray and Nuclear Chest Scan. All tests came back normal -- lungs \"unremarkable\" and perfect heart rhythm. They did a blood workup and found everything to be normal EXCEPT - raised Alkaline Phosphate at 124 H  on a scale of 33-115 and High White Blood Cell Count of H14 on a scale of 4.2-11. Also, Absolute Neut of 8.8 on a scale of 1.8-7.7 and raised Absolute Mono of 1.1 on a scale of .03-,.09.   They diagnosed it as \"Acute Chest Pain\" and sent me home with Norco and Naproxen. Today  5/17/07 is the third day taking these medicines and I show no improvement. I still can not sleep. I am still doubled over in pain. I am constantly sore..I can feel pain with simple acts like washing my hair or raising an arm. And every 2 hours or less, I have SEVERE back and chest pain that makes it difficult to breath. I passed a kidney stone 4 years ago and the back pain I am suffering rivals the pain of kidney stones -- it is miserable.   I made an appointment this morning with a general practitioner and I have just arrived home from that meeting. He listened to my chest, checked my ear nose and throat, and poked me until I was crying on the table from him touching my chest. He said he agreed it was acute chest pain. He saw the lumps in my breasts and said I had poly-cystic breasts and that was the cause of the back pain. He said because my white blood cells are elevated I have an infection in my upper chest (collar bone area where the tenderness is the worst) and that I should take the norco and anti-inflammatories until it ends. He said I may end up taking these pills for up to a month. He could not explain why I developed a viral infection. He could not explain why I have constant pain marked with regular (every hour or two) of severe, gripping pain. He said if I have the pain in a month he would recommend a mammogram.   I am writing because I can not imagine this pain continuing for 1 more day let alone weeks on end. I have difficulty believing that someone with otherwise perfect health and perfect breast health has suddenly - simultaneously developed poly-cystic breasts and a random viral infection that is so severe is is affecting lymph nodes from my neck to my thighs -- such swelling and pain that I can neither sleep nor at times even catch my breath.   Quite simply, I am desperate to know what is wrong with me. I am worried for this lymph issue that is not localized to one area..I fear immune disorders like lupus. I of course -- given my extensive family history -- fear cancers. They are ruling out breast cancer because it is in both breasts, but it is my understanding some breast tissue cancers can present some uncommon symptoms. I understand I am not a doctor, which is why I appreciate any help you can provide about what this may be, what additional tests might help, and what sort of doctor/specialist would best help me. I am so scared -- I have had so many relatives die from a variety of cancers. I don't smoke. I don't drink. I don't even touch caffeine. I have been a vegetarian for 12 years. I make sure I stay fully hydrated and drink a minimum of 64oz of water each day.  I have never in my life experienced such severe pain. Thank you again for your time and your help\n\n",

To start off, I think breast cancer is fairly unlikely, although there is a type of breast cancer called inflammatory breast cancer that can spread quite quickly.  It gets it name of inflammatory because it causes the breasts to become red and inflamed looking.  I would be more suspicious of an infection given your acute onset and severe pain.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor.  Given your extreme situation, a trial of antibiotics may be indicated for mastitis.  It may be viral but a bacterial infection is also possible.  Also, your doctor should be able to give you a stronger pain medicine if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I suspect that EBV is not causing your current symptoms.  To my knowledge it is not associated with gastroparesis (but I'm not 100% on that).  If you have a problem with your immune system, an immunologist is the correct person to see.  I would recommend you continue to see your primary care doctor and work up your fatigue and other symptoms.  I would also recommend you have your thyroid levels checked.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "HTLV is a virus that can cause a form of leukemia known as Adult T-cell Leukemia.  However, infection does not mean that one will develop leukemia.  From the statistics I have found there is less  than 5% chance of developing any symptoms from the infection.  Reactive lymphocytes are sometimes called atypical lymphocytes.  They are essentially young lymphocytes that the bone marrow is sending out quickly to help fight an infection.  In the case of lymphocytes, it is generally a viral infection.  Reactive lymphocytes are generally not a sign of leukemia.  Had there been evidence of leukemic cells on your peripheral smear (known as blasts) the report would most definitely have noted this.  I am not aware of any other needed tests at this point (although there may be some that I do not know about).  Best wishes.\n\n",

Nothing in the head. As for the neck, the result was, \"No cervical adenopathy. \"Shotty\" lymph node enlargement\". After the CT scan results, my GP thought it was swollen parotid glands. They are still slightly swollen after a month. I have also noticed a lump in my left armpit, but haven't said anything to my GP. I am just going to wait till August for the specialist, unless any lumps start getting larger. Thanks again for your reply.\n\n",

    "content": "You may want to find a self-testing blood pressure monitor like they sometimes have in drug stores and pharmacies.  By watching the pattern of your blood pressure you will be able to see if the treatment is bringing it down or not (without spending any more money).  You could also check to see if there are any clinics in your area that offer reduced charges for people without insurance.  You may have to call a local health department to ask if they are aware of such facilities.    Your problem may be as simple as needing to find the right blood pressure medication to get it in control but you will need to have some ongoing care with a physician to accomplish this.  If something else is going on, you need a doctor to diagnose it through a thorough exam so I would continue to search for some kind of agency that can help with this.  If you live near a teaching hospital they could also help you find a facility.  Good luck.\n\n",

The diagnosis was by accident; I wasn't at the health center to get tested for mono but to have a swollen lymph node on the back of my neck inspected due to its odd presentation.  Anyways, the point is I am *now* experiencing the symptoms of mono, except fatigue.  In particular, I have a nasty soar throat, and upon inspection, I see white streaks decorating the siding of the back of my throat.  This soar throat is extremely right-sided; the left side of my throat is painless.  last night I discerned  white streaks on the left, painless side of my throat; much to my surprise.  This morning, however, s the pain increased, I found that the white streaks had spread to the right side now.  And this evening, there appears to be white cold sores (I can't describe their appearance any better than that) on the right side of the back of my throat.  and it HURTS. I can't rest like I'm supposed to because it hurts so much.  I can't swallow.  Again, no fatigue.  The health center gave me these stupid lozenges EVEN though I told them I had a festering sore throat.  What should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "well thanks for the advice .. i've completely recovered from mono but there is something I am wondering about that I would like information on.  Durign the worst of mono, I took 24 mg of oral steroids one day to reduce inflammation (and then just 4 mg the next; i.e. I (intentionally) did NOT complete the steroid pack).  I understand there is controversy with using steroids because they can compromise your body's ability to fight off mono permanently, i.e. it could COME BACK!  Well, to be honest the sole reason I took steroids (I was prescribed them, by the way) was because my sore throat was blocking me from sleeping.  I figured that, althought the steroids suppress the immune system, sleep does as well, so I took the less painful route to supressing my immune system.  I tried many alternatives, lozenges, tylenol, ibuprofen, lidocaine, with little success.       My question is, given that I took only 35% of the amount of steroids I was prescribed, what are the chances that I can get mono twice?\n\n",

It is just the right side, So I went to a Urgent care hospital and got myself examined. He took a cotton swab test, came back negative for strep. Then he tapped on my stomache with his fingers seeing if my liver or something down there was swollen. There was nothing swollen down there. So they took my blood. I showed the doctor in the back of my mouth how I had like a hole in the side of my mouth. He said it was very common and it is from the tonsil's getting swollen and it will do this to you.  He told me over time that it would heal itself. But I have had that hole above my tonsil for the last two years at the least. I get my results back from the Blood test. And they said I had a Viral infection. They gave me 20 vicodin to help me sleep. I'm six days into now and I've done nothing but sleep and take warm showers. Today I wake up to my fever being gone and something feels better I can tell, like I can breathe better. The swelling has gone down on the node that was sticking out my neck. But that hole above my tonsil where it all started from is very white and I have started to get these sores on my tongue. They almost look like little zits, but they hurt when I go spit out any fluids or if  they touch anything.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear HelpMe2334, You did not mention what kind of job you do, and I am also curious as to the type of environment you work in.  It is possible that these symptoms may be linked to your new job. There have been cases of either inhalation exposure or topical exposure to an allergen/toxin that can cause both the symptoms you are referring to.  Sometimes businesses do their whole site cleaning at night time - including floor stripping/polishing, carpet cleaning etc.  You may have allergies to some of the cleaning solutions being used.  Again, I do not know what kind of work you do. Is it possible that you are working with groups of chemicals or substances in your job that you may be allergic to? The fact that these symptoms seem to dissipate on their own without intervention, just by you being away from the site lends also to suspicion that you may have some kind of exposure on the job.  You have the right under OSHA to have access to the MSDS (Material Safety Data Sheets) for all the substances found in your environment that you have potential for exposure to. Please ask your supervisor where these are kept and what substances you may be exposed to on your shifts. Then if these symptoms persist, see your doctor, if a plant/facility employee health care clinic is not available.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have a really bad cold, and I get the same cold year after year, usually just the one, and I take tylenol cold severe to help with the nasal congestion.  However, it doesn't even touch the fluid buildup in my eyes.  My eyes run consantly for days when I have a cold, and my eyelids and beneath my eyes get red and really swollen.  It is unsightly, not to mention, makes it difficult to concentrate at school and now work.  Can you recommend a product I could take or at least tell me what ingredients I should be looking for in a medicine?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a few thoughts for you.  First is the likely reason that you are experiencing the watery eyes is because the lacrimal duct that drains the eye into the nose gets blocked with congestion.  This does not let the tears drain properly from the eye.  Using techniques to help minimize congestion will help.  A medication called pseudoephedrine or phenylephrine are generally the decongestants that help the most.  Also, you may have a component of allergic conjuctivitis or rhinitis (seasonal allergies), especially since you say the cold happens at about the same time of year each year.  You may want to try some antiallergy medications to see if these help some.  Last, you may be experiencing a direct infection of the eyes.  This is common with viral colds.  In these cases, symptomatic care is about all that can be done.  If there is discharge from the eye and lots of redness, there may be a bacterial component to the infection that will be helped with some antibiotic drops.  I hope this helps a little.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The following is a quote from the CDC website in an article regarding emerging diseases: Borna disease virus, a newly classified nonsegmented negative-strand RNA virus with international distribution, infects a broad range of warm-blooded animals from birds to primates. Infection causes movement and behavioral disturbances reminiscent of some neuropsychiatric syndromes. The virus has not been clearly linked to any human disease; however, an association between infection with the virus and selected neuropsychiatric disorders has been suggested.  It's an interesting virus that is still being researched to fully identify its resulting illnesses.  It has been implicated in causing illnesses similar to depression, affective disorder and schizophrenia.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Colleague,   This is just my personal opinion.  i don't think that your health status should direct your choice of what field you want to go into.  How about if you were not a heaptitis carrier or you did not know about it and you went into the field of your choice and then you acquired an infection (not necessarily hepatitis) that is transmittable to others or discovered that you are a carrier, would you leave your field and go into another field?  You can use universal precaution measures when getting in contact with any patient, and these measures will protect the patient as well as you.  There are of course medical fields that you don't get in contact with the patients or have minimal contact with patients such as pathology and radiology, or if you want, you can have a research rather a clinical carrier.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm sorry I won't be able to be very specific to your situation at this point; however, if you can provide a few more details, such as what the actual bone infection was (osteomyelitis, etc.) I may be of more help.  IVIg essentially antibodies (immunoglobulins or Ig's) that are given intravenously-hence IVIg.  The antibodies are pooled from donors and concentrated.  They are essentially a mix of antibodies that the donors had and are thus not specific to any one type of infection.  Often these are used when there is a suspected antibody that may be running around the body causing problems.  The IVIg can help bind up the unwanted antibody or confuse the body's normal immune system so that it stops attacking itself.  That's a little simplified but basically how it works.  Your uncle's doctors may be using the IVIg in an attempt to bind up what ever is causing the infection or to help prevent/treat any autoimmune effects that can follow an infection (basically an antibody is formed against the virus or other microbe that then \"coincidentally\" also binds something in the body that is supposed to be there-essentially attacking itself).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have question about my symptoms and health. There is something very troubling with my symptoms that I have and am possibly spreading to my fellow co-workers. I seen quite a few doctors who have not really been very helpful. When I try to explain my symptoms they just shake their heads and tell to take some decongestants. They pretty much ignore me and say that my fellow co-workers have allergies.   They are professional doctors and that they know more than I do, but I know that I think they are wrong. When a doctor tells me that i am healthy and it that I am not communicabe it gives me hope and some reassurance. However, I know what is going on.   This may seem very far fetched but it is true. For about a year now I have had post nasal drip which has produced very thick phlegm. This has caused me to constantly clear my throat many many times a day. I have no other symptoms. However, it seems as if I am spreading this around to my fellow co-workers. All I have to do  is sit next to them, no talking nor am I coughing or sneezing, and they too will begin clearing their throats. This is a fact. Many of them first get a stuffy nose and within a couple of days, some earlier, they will to begin to clear their throats.   Earlier today I heard a woman, who I sat next to yesterday, clearing her throat and making terrible sounds while trying to do so. That is just one example. I have heard more workers do so to. How is this possible?   I took blood tests and had a chest x-ray this past friday and will get my results this friday (the doctor has a very busy schedule). However I have become impatient and hopefully you can shed some light onto my situation. Again this sound very wierd but it is true.\n\n",

Some people may have a genetic predisposition to mold related illness just as some do to allergies and many other health issues. Short term very high exposure to toxic mold, or for people who are particularly sensitive or vulnerable, protracted toxic or allergenic mold exposure, even at what we consider rather low levels, can be a serious problem.   When you're exposed to large amounts continually over a long period of time, eventually your immune system becomes hyper-acute. It begins to over-react to the mold and when that happens, symptoms ensue.\"   it can cause a variety of stubborn symptoms ranging from flu-like runny nose, tiredness and migraine headaches, to conjestion....\" antibiotics don't work on fungus related allergies\n\n",

Around six months ago I noticed a couple of my friends also got stuffy noses. Then I thought nothing much of it. However, it seemed very odd since it happened during a brutal heat wave. Not everyone ends up clearing their throats just a few. Although some do up getting a cough with mucus. Which I have told my doctors about.  I should have been more specific with my symptoms. The phlegm that I produced is not normal. It is very thick and at times sticky which makes my mouth feel slimy (strange feeling). I have been told me that I have chronic sinusitis. Currently I am taking a nasal spray and loratadine for my allergies. Although I do not think that I have any.  On a side note: I feel very guilty. Just knowing that I might be spreading some kind of virus or disease to innocent people (unintentionally of course).\n\n",

    "content": "Encephalitis is inflammation of the brain.  There are many causes of encephalitis.  The most common causes are infection related.  Most likely viruses top the infectious list.  There are several including enterovirus, the well known but not as common West Nile Virus, several varieties of encephalitis viruses, herpes virus and many more.  There are bacterial infections that can do this as well.  Two other somewhat common causes include mycoplasma and bartonella (the bug that causes cat scratch disease).  Beyond infections there are other causes such as acute demylenating encephalomyelitis and several other neurological causes.  Did she have cold type symptoms before all this started.  In addition to actual infections, some infections can lead to a post-infectious syndrome that can be deceptive in that the actual infection may have been several weeks before hand.  If they are not already involved, I would suggest considering asking for an infectious disease and neurological consultation.  These specialists can guide which tests to do next.  An MRI of the brain may be helpful as well as a lumbar puncture to obtain spinal fluid for testing to look for many infections.  Several of the infections can be detected via blood antibody tests.  Keep us updated.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

I've pretty much felt fine, besides maybe a little fatigue. Thing is, during the time that my symptoms were present I would lay on my left side when sleeping, and wake up with pain (not severe by any means, but still some pain) in my left side and up into my shoulder. So, I assumed that my spleen was enlarged. This is really the only evidence I've had for that being the case, besides feeling like there is something in my left abdomen, which may or may not be in my head... I'm slightly paranoid. My dr. tapped on my spleen area and said it didn't feel enlarged, and I didn't feel any pain.  So, I said all that to say this: I'm planning on going snowboarding over spring break (the week of March 12) and I was wondering if I should not go because of the chance of rupture. I've read that you should refrain from strenous activities for 4-8 weeks, and it would be a little more than 2 months from my diagnosis. If there is any chance of rupture I don't want to risk it.  Thanks, and sorry that this was so long.\n\n",

    "content": "I slept with a std infected man about a year ago, and I got hpv (and have a vagina full of genital warts that I'm treating with tea tree oil and garlic oil) and recurrent herpes that I'm decently controlling with herbs, diet, and vitamins.  At the same time my lips became chapped and they've hurt bad ever since.  With heavy amounts of aloe vera (freshly harvested) and vit E I'm able to keep them from hurting too bad.  I quess I think it's oral herpes, but I don't know.  I don't know what to do to help it.  It hasn't healed itself ever, but there are periods when it seems like an outbreak is happening and my lips get real chapped in the corners of my mouth.  Is there anything I can do to help myself.  I can't kiss anybody can I?  I'm 23, F, tested positive for herpes and have hpv, no real surgeries, No std's in the family, no prescriptions.\n\n",

    "content": "There are two types of HSV.  HSV type 1 most commonly infects the mouth and lips, causing sores known as fever blisters or cold sores. It is also an important cause of sores to the genitals.  HSV type 2 is the usual cause of genital herpes, but it also can infect the mouth.   If you have small warts, your health care provider can remove them by one of three methods.  Freezing (cryosurgery)  Burning (electrocautery)  Laser treatment  If you have large warts that have not responded to other treatment, you may have to have surgery to remove them.  Although there is no cure for genital herpes, your health care provider might prescribe an antiviral medicine to treat your symptoms and to help prevent future outbreaks. This can decrease the risk of passing herpes to sexual partners. Medicines to treat genital herpes are  Acyclovir (Zovirax)  Famciclovir (Famvir)  Valacyclovir (Valtrex)   Some health care providers inject the antiviral drug alpha interferon directly into warts that have returned after removal by traditional means. The drug is expensive, however, and does not reduce the rate that the genital warts return.  Although treatments can get rid of the warts, none get rid of the virus. Because the virus is still present in your body, warts often come back after treatment.  PREVENTION The only way you can prevent getting an HPV infection is to avoid direct contact with the virus, which is transmitted by skin-to-skin contact. If you or your sexual partner has warts that are visible in the genital area, you should avoid any skin-to skin and sexual contact until the warts are treated. Genital herpes is an infection of the genitals, buttocks, or anal area caused by herpes simplex virus (HSV).    You can transmit herpes through close contact other than sexual intercourse, through oral sex or close skin-to-skin contact, for example.   Reduce your risk of spreading herpes People with herpes should follow a few simple steps to avoid spreading the infection to other places on their body or other people.  Avoid touching the infected area during an outbreak, and wash your hands after contact with the area.  Do not have sexual contact (vaginal, oral, or anal) from the time of first genital symptoms until symptoms are completely gone.   Recurrences are generally much milder than the first outbreak of genital herpes. HSV-2 genital infection is more likely to result in recurrences than HSV-1 genital infection. Recurrences become less common over time.  Sometimes, the virus can become active but not cause any visible sores or any symptoms. During these times, small amounts of the virus may be shed at or near places of the first infection, in fluids from the mouth, penis, or vagina, or from barely noticeable sores. This is called asymptomatic (without symptoms) shedding. Even though you are not aware of the shedding, you can infect a sexual partner during this time. Asymptomatic shedding is an important factor in the spread of herpes.  Coping with Herpes A diagnosis of genital herpes can have emotional effects whether or not symptoms are present. If you have genital herpes, you are probably concerned about the effect of your disease on personal relationships. In addition, your sexual partner may be concerned about their risk of infection. Proper counseling and treatment can help you and your partner learn to cope with the disease. Cautions Do not have oral genital contact in the presence of any symptoms or findings of oral herpes.  Using barriers such as condoms during sexual activity may decrease transmission, but transmission can occur even if condoms are used correctly. Condoms may not cover all infected areas.   Cervical Cancer and Oral CancerThere are other forms of HPV which are also sexually transmitted, and are a serious problem. These are; HPV-16, HPV-18, HPV-31, and HPV-45. These cancer-associated types of HPVs cause dysplastic tissue growths that usually appear flat and are nearly invisible. Dysplastic tissue is the presence of abnormal cells on the surface of the skin. Dysplasia is not cancer, but it is a tissue change seen prior to malignancy. A highly studied topic is HPV's ability to cause cervical cancer. . The most dangerous HPV's, 16 and 18, which are transmitted through sexual contact are known to cause up to 95% of cervical cancers. Now these two HPV's are also being linked to oral cancer.   This information I am providing to you is to make you aware of the diease (HPV) And the possible long term effects it can cause on your body.  It is imperative that you speak and keep in contact with your physcian on a regular basis in order for your doctor to give you the best treatment possible to help elimate any future potential health problems.  Keep In Touch  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "title": "Lump in throat?",
    "content": "Hi, I'm a 23 year old female and have had a very sore throat for just a few days.  I was sick about three weeks ago with a sore throat, went to the doctor, and was given amoxicillin, which, like an idiot, I took for three days and then left on vacation and forgot it.  But I felt better, so I didn't think it was a big deal to not finish the prescription.  Now, I have a sore throat again, which at first I thought was the same thing, but today I noticed that I have a big bump in front of my right tonsil, just a little farther forward onto my soft pallet than my uvula.  This sounds gross, but it's about the size of a pencil eraser and basically looks like a big white pimple. It hurts really bad, especially when I swallow, but only in that spot (the other side is fine, and I'm not coughing or having a typical sore throat, it just hurts around that area) Two questions: 1) What is wrong with me??? and 2) would finishing up my amoxicillin dosage (I have enough for probably about a week) be a helpful idea?  Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities for your sore throat.  Several viruses can cause sores in the throat.  They generally last a few days, then begin to get better.  If the area you are describing is near the tonsil, you may also be experiencing a small abscess known as a peritonsilar abscess (clever name).  These require antibiotics to recover.  From your description, I suspect that you are likely dealing with a virus rather than an abscess.  I would recommend NOT taking your left over antibiotics.  If you aren't getting better in the next day or two you should have your throat examined by your doctor.    Also, some of the sore throat medications that numb the throat can be helpful for pain occasionally.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Every year the flu hits the facilities I work at and whloe units become quarentined yet I never get the flu. Oh, I'm not complaining!!! But I find it odd that without even a flu shot every year I still don't catch the nasty bug. Oh, i did have the \"body flu\" once in 1992. I remember this because as I lay recovering on my couch, my two year old swung her baby doll like a bat and hit me square in the face.    My daughter is the same way. Once in awhile we will get what I call the stomach flu. Nausea,vomiting and diarrhea that lasts no longer than 24 hours.    Could we be immune somehow? Doesn't seem possible but what other reason could there be?\n\n",

    "content": "It is quite possible that you are fortunate enough to have your antibody memory cells making an antibody that protects you from influenza infections.  Often people who work around viruses a lot end up with lots of immunity built up.    The aim of the flu shot is to make the body create antibodies against the influenza virus to protect against infection.  Generally, the flu virus is a little different each year, necessitating a flu shot every year.    If you happen to have an antibody floating around that binds to the influenza virus, you may receive some protection against infection even without the flu shot.  While this doesn't guarantee against infection, it certainly doesn't hurt.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

The dog was trying to catch a ball.  The bit was not significant at all, did not bleed. It was on my arm and left me numerous scratches but no bleed or wound.

Few hours later I cleaned with alcohol.  IS IT ENOUGH FOR RABIES TO MIX WITH MY BLOOD STREAM?  since the blood contact was very small, if I have the virus it should probably reach my central nervous system after many months. I read that rabies can start with it's lethal symptoms after even a year. If it were my case, PEP injections would last so much time?  what should i do?  PD I cant visit easily the dog again to see appearing symptoms on it because i left the beach.\n\n",

    "content": "I did not see any symptoms on the dog though; no saliva and not so aggressive behavior. The dog was trying to catch a ball.   Thats a good thing for you. One of the most important factor in rabies is unprovoked bite by a seemingly ill dog. 95% chance is that dog wasn't rabid. Not sure about frequency of rabies in Chile, else I'd say 98% !  2% risk is a small risk only if its not your risk. But then, you never know if you belong to 2% category or not! So you need to go for post exposure immunization. I have assumed that Chile is not a Rabies-free country. But then I started searching for any bleeding more closely and I found 2 very tiny spots of only 1mm wide where I could see blood, but it wasn't coming out.  In some cases, even licks by rabid animal on abraded skin is sufficient for transmission of virus.    I could see blood, but it wasn't coming out. I washed my arm with sea water. Few hours later I cleaned with alcohol. IS IT ENOUGH FOR RABIES TO MIX WITH MY BLOOD STREAM?   Yes.   Good thing is you didnt cover the wound (I hope). It wasn't a big wound anyway.   I read that rabies can start with it's lethal symptoms after even a year. If it were my case, PEP injections would last so much time?   Thats why they are meant to be. All you have to do is follow the proper schedule.   Code: Select allwhat should I do?   PD I cant visit easily the dog again to see appearing symptoms on it because I left the beach. Passive immunization (immunoglobulin) - Will take care of current infection, if any.  Active immunization :- Rabies vaccine. These are of various types and their availability differs from country to country.  HDCV immunization is given on following days :-  Shots on Days - 0, 3, 7, 14, 28          and a booster dose on 90th day. These are intramuscular injections on deltoid (around shoulder).  If the dog is healthy and normal after 10 days (if you can keep a watch), no need to take further doses.  Doses schedule may vary according to type of vaccine used.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  The submandibular lymph nodes are located along the underside of the jaw on either side. They drain the tongue, submaxillary gland, lips and mouth, conjunctivae. Common causes of enlargement include infections of head, neck, sinuses, ears, eyes, scalp, pharynx.  Sulfamethoxazole and trimethoprim (Nu-Cotrimox) an antibiotic that is most commonly used to treat infections of the bladder, ear, sinus, skin, intestine, and lung. I am sure your doctor is aware of all the side effects of this drugs. If he prescribed it then I think you should take his advice.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Tonsillitis on genitals?",
    "content": "I'm a 17 year old female and i have only been sexually active with two males. One was a long time (4 years) ago and the other is currently going on. 2 weeks ago he performed oral sex on me and found out a few days later that he had tonsillitis. He said that his doctor mentioned its a viral disease and can be transmitted to genitals. I'm a little bit worried because for the past day or so my vagina has been itching. There's no burning and no other symptoms i can notice except the itching and occasionally it will be a little senstive. Does it sound like i have tonsillitis on my vagina? Is that even possible? Could it maybe be just a mild yeast infection? Please help. thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  No you cannot get tonsillitis of the genitals. But you can acquire many infections during oral sex.  In addition to HIV, gonorrhoea, syphilis, chlamydia can all be picked up during oral sex.  Another very common virus that can be transmitted by oral sex is the herpes virus. There are two types of Herpes simplex virus (HSV). Type 1 affects mainly the lip \u2013 causing \u2018cold sores. Type 2 causes blisters on the genitals.  HSV can cause pharyngitis, an inflammation of the throat with ulcer formation. HSV is known to be highly infectious and virus particles are shed from either genital or oral ulcers. Infection is far more likely when ulcers are present.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Most cases of sore throat are due to viral infection e. g. as part of flu and cold attack. Bacterial infections on the other hand represent a smaller number of cases. Usually there are other associated symptoms and signs that can point to the possible causative agent.   Viral induced sore throat usually subsides in week with rest and plenty fluid intake. Bacterial infections (group A streptococci is the commonest) causing sore throat need to be treated with Antibiotics.   Infectious Mononucleosis is a type of virus EBV induced sore throat that lead to recurrent sore throat with swollen tonsils and Lymph nodes in addition to other specific symptoms and signs. Streptococcal pharyngitis and EBV infection are usually difficult to be differentiated.   In appropriate contraction of the throat or esophageal muscles causes pain that can be severe and sometimes is felt as a lump or tightness in the chest with difficult swallowing.The condition can be a sequence of pharyngitis (viral, bacteria) infection that subsides gradually after recovering from infections. This is usually seen in severe cases of sore throat.  You did not inform us about the kind of investigations that have been done if any, and the treatment you are receiving and whether you are improving or not with this treatment?  I advise you to follow with your Doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

During childhood episode of chickenpox caused by this virus, the virus remain dormant in the body.  Re-activation is seen in some people when their immune system is compromised during stress periods or an impaired immune system in some systemic diseases like DM.   Lesions are in the form of red patches of skin with small vesicles that increases over 3 to 5 days. Blisters then break into all ulcers which get dry with crusts formation.   Lesions typically occur along a single dermatome (the body area supplied by a single spinal nerve) and on one side of the body (unilateral).   The trunk is more frequently affected, like a rectangular belt of rash from the spine along one side of the chest to the breastbone (sternum).  Direct clinical examination is essential.  follow up with your doctor is essential. Keep us updated.  Best regards,\n\n",

When tonsils are swollen and red the condition is named tonsillitis. Inflammation of the tonsils are common as they are the filters for bacteria and virus entering through the aero-digestive tract. Viruses and bacteria can cause tonsillitis with specific clinical symptoms and signs.   Infections are commonly caused by viruses like infectious mononucleosis (the Epstein-Barr virus) and bacteria lik e(Streptococcus group A), in both cases white patches are seen over the swollen tonsils. Diagnosis needs careful examination in addition to certain investigation like Swab and culture and blood tests.   It could be also a lymphoid enlargement in cases of lymphoproliferative disease like lymphoma.  In any case clinical examination is very essential for differential diagnosis.

Will the result be accurate still. How long does it take for the body to buld antibodies for virus which can be detected in blood?   3) should i wait for a week more before going in for testing?  4) If its HSV-1, and if i got it on genitals....how many times it reoccurs on genitals on avarage?

    "content": "hi Sanam,  Your concern for your partner and for yourself is understandable.  Before answering your questions, I d like you to know that the HSV has two main types; 1 and 2. HSV 1 infects the face/chest area and HSV 2 is called genital herpes. Both have different favorite sites. Usually they infect only their favored site. That means it is uncommon for oral type 1 herpes to cause genital herpes. But it is possible, although the infection will be very very mild and tend not to recur.  1. The infective period is when the virus is actively shed from the sore. Unfortunately, like many other diseases, much more virus is shed BEFORE a lesion/sore appears rather than when a sore is present. That means, considering a probablity that your partner might develop a new sore in 5-7 days, there is high chance that he was infective and shedding the virus yesterday! But as already mentioned for the 'favoured' site behaviour of the virus, transmission and then manifestation as a disease is very unlikely.   2. The body starts building antibodies as soon as it comes in contact with an infectious agent. But considering the natural variability of an individual's immune response and add to it the minimum levels necessary for the test to be positive, antibodies may require from 1 week to 3 weeks.  Moreover, the specific method for HSV detection is direct visualization of the virus under a microscope. And that can be only taken from a developed sore scraping. The antibody method is less sensitive.  3.  If you decide to take the antibody test, a 3 week wait is appropriate. If tested negative, you may repeat after another 3 weeks.  4. If it is HSV 1, which is most likely to be, first of all it does not like to infect genitals. If it does, the symptoms are very mild. And usually does not recur. This is unlike if it is transmitted face-to-face by kissing.  Last,  there are support groups for herpes and you may consider your partner to refer to them. Much useful information can be got from there.  References: 1. Internal Medicine by Kumar and Clark 2. Centre for disease control USA.  http://www.cdc.gov/std/Herpes/STDFact-Herpes.htm 3.

    "content": "Hello:  I test negative for the CMV antibody. I may be pregnant at this time.  I recently: 1. found out my partner is CMV positive and 2. played with a toddler of about 1 1/2 years.  My partner's Igm is negative - apparently he does not have a current infection (?)  I did not kiss the baby on the mouth, but did hold him a lot, kiss his cheek and neck and I may have eaten a crust of bread he held in his little palm, which was holding a saliva soaked piece of bread of his own. He may have touched my crust to his mouth, but I am not certain. Also, he sneezed while near me.  He did not appear to be sick.  I am concerned about the possibility of getting CMV through this exposure. I would appreciate guidance on the following questions:  1.  How intimate and close does the contact need to be?   2. Also, if the child does have CMV, would he be shedding the virus a year and a half after birth?   3. Is it possible for me to get CMV from my partner even though his Igm was negative? 4. How long should I wait before I get another blood test to determine if I got CMV at this early stage in pregnancy?   I am very worried because I read that 80-90% of babies born to moms who contract it for the first time during pregnancy have serious birth defects.  I appreciate any response.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Concerned about initial CMV infection at early pregnancy",
    "content": "Cytomegalovirus, or CMV, is found universally throughout all geographic locations and socioeconomic groups, and infects between 50% and 85% of adults in the United States by 40 years of age. CMV is also the virus most frequently transmitted to a developing child before birth. CMV infection is more widespread in developing countries and in areas of lower socioeconomic conditions. For most healthy persons who acquire CMV after birth there are few symptoms and no long-term health consequences. Some persons with symptoms experience a mononucleosis-like syndrome with prolonged fever, and a mild hepatitis. Once a person becomes infected, the virus remains alive, but usually dormant within that person's body for life. Recurrent disease rarely occurs unless the person's immune system is suppressed due to therapeutic drugs or disease. Therefore, for the vast majority of people, CMV infection is not a serious problem.  However, CMV infection is important to certain high-risk groups. Major areas of concern are (1) the risk of infection to the unborn baby during pregnancy, (2) the risk of infection to people who work with children, and (3) the risk of infection to the immunocompromised person, such as organ transplant recipients and persons infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).  CHARACTERISTICS OF THE VIRUS  CMV is a member of the herpesvirus group, which includes herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (which causes chickenpox), and Epstein-Barr virus (which causes infectious mononucleosis). These viruses share a characteristic ability to remain dormant within the body over a long period. Initial CMV infection, which may have few symptoms, is always followed by a prolonged, inapparent infection during which the virus resides in cells without causing detectable damage or clinical illness. Severe impairment of the body's immune system by medication or disease consistently reactivates the virus from the latent or dormant state.  Infectious CMV may be shed in the bodily fluids of any previously infected person, and thus may be found in urine, saliva, blood, tears, semen, and breast milk. The shedding of virus may take place intermittently, without any detectable signs, and without causing symptoms.   TRANSMISSION AND PREVENTION  Transmission of CMV  occurs from person to person. Infection requires close, intimate contact with a person excreting the virus in their saliva, urine, or other bodily fluids. CMV can be sexually transmitted and can also be transmitted via breast milk, transplanted organs, and rarely from blood transfusions.  Although the virus is not highly contagious, it has been shown to spread in households and among young children in day care centers. Transmission of the virus is often preventable because it is most often transmitted through infected bodily fluids that come in contact with hands and then are absorbed through the nose or mouth of a susceptible person. Therefore, care should be taken when handling children and items like diapers. Simple hand washing with soap and water is effective in removing the virus from the hands.  CMV infection without symptoms is common in infants and young children; therefore, it is unjustified and unnecessary to exclude from school or an institution a child known to be infected. Similarly, hospitalized patients do not need separate or elaborate isolation precautions.   Screening children and patients for CMV is of questionable value. The cost and management of such procedures are impractical. Children known to have CMV infection should not be singled out for exclusion, isolation, or special handling. Instead, staff education and effective hygiene practices are advised in caring for all children.  CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH CMV INFECTION COULD BE A PROBLEM  Pregnancy The incidence of primary (or first) CMV infection in pregnant women in the United States varies from 1% to 3%. Healthy pregnant women are not at special risk for disease from CMV infection. When infected with CMV, most women have no symptoms and very few have a disease resembling mononucleosis. It is their developing unborn babies that may be at risk for congenital CMV disease. CMV remains the most important cause of congenital (meaning from birth) viral infection in the United States. For infants who are infected by their mothers before birth, two potential problems exist:  Generalized infection may occur in the infant, and symptoms may range from moderate enlargement of the liver and spleen (with jaundice) to fatal illness. With supportive treatment most infants with CMV disease usually survive. However, from 80% to 90% will have complications within the first few years of life that may include hearing loss, vision impairment, and varying degrees of mental retardation.  Another 5% to 10% of infants who are infected but without symptoms at birth will subsequently have varying degrees of hearing and mental or coordination problems.  However, these risks appear to be almost exclusively associated with women who previously have not been infected with CMV and who are having their first infection with the virus during pregnancy. Even in this case, two-thirds of the infants will not become infected, and only10% to 15% of the remaining third will have symptoms at the time of birth. There appears to be little risk of CMV-related complications for women who have been infected at least 6 months prior to conception. For this group, which makes up 50% to 80% of the women of child-bearing age, the rate of newborn CMV infection is 1%, and these infants appear to have no significant illness or abnormalities.   The virus can also be transmitted to the infant at delivery from contact with genital secretions or later in infancy through breast milk. However, these infections usually result in little or no clinical illness in the infant.   To summarize, during a pregnancy when a woman who has never had CMV infection becomes infected with CMV, there is a potential risk that after birth the infant may have CMV-related complications, the most common of which are associated with hearing loss, visual impairment, or diminished mental and motor capabilities. On the other hand, infants and children who acquire CMV after birth have few, if any, symptoms or complications.   Recommendations for pregnant women with regard to CMV infection:  Throughout the pregnancy, practice good personal hygiene, especially handwashing with soap and water, after contact with diapers or oral secretions (particularly with a child who is in day care).  Women who develop a mononucleosis-like illness during pregnancy should be evaluated for CMV infection and counseled about the possible risks to the unborn child.  Laboratory testing for antibody to CMV can be performed to determine if a women has already had CMV infection.  Recovery of CMV from the cervix or urine of women at or before the time of delivery does not warrant a cesarean section.  The demonstrated benefits of breast-feeding outweigh the minimal risk of acquiring CMV from the breast-breeding mother.  There is no need to either screen for CMV or exclude CMV-excreting children from schools or institutions because the virus is frequently found in many healthy children and adults.  People Who Work with Infants and Children Most healthy people working with infants and children face no special risk from CMV infection. However, for women of child-bearing age who previously have not been infected with CMV, there is a potential risk to the developing unborn child (the risk is described above in the Pregnancy section). Contact with children who are in day care, where CMV infection is commonly transmitted among young children (particularly toddlers), may be a source of exposure to CMV. Since CMV is transmitted through contact with infected body fluids, including urine and saliva, child care providers (meaning day care workers, special education teachers, therapists, as well as mothers) should be educated about the risks of CMV infection and the precautions they can take. Day care workers appear to be at a greater risk than hospital and other health care providers, and this may be due in part to the increased emphasis on personal hygiene in the health care setting.  Recommendations for individuals providing care for infants and children:   Female employees should be educated concerning CMV, its transmission, and hygienic practices, such as handwashing, which minimize the risk of infection.  Susceptible nonpregnant women working with infants and children should not routinely be transferred to other work situations.  Pregnant women working with infants and children should be informed of the risk of acquiring CMV infection and the possible effects on the unborn child.  Routine laboratory testing for CMV antibody in female workers is not recommended, but can be performed to determine their immune status.  Immunocompromised Patients Primary (or the initial) CMV infection in the immunocompromised patient can cause serious disease. However, the more common problem is the reactivation of the dormant virus. Infection with CMV is a major cause of disease and death in immunocompromised patients, including organ transplant recipients, patients undergoing hemodialysis, patients with cancer, patients receiving immunosuppressive drugs, and HIV-infected patients. Pneumonia, retinitis (an infection of the eyes), and gastrointestinal disease are the common manifestations of disease. Because of this risk, exposing immunosuppressed patients to outside sources of CMV should be minimized. Whenever possible, patients without CMV infection should be given organs and/or blood products that are free of the virus.  DIAGNOSIS OF CMV INFECTION  Most infections with CMV are not diagnosed because the virus usually produces few, if any, symptoms and tends to reactivate intermittently without symptoms. However, persons who have been infected with CMV develop antibodies to the virus, and these antibodies persist in the body for the lifetime of that individual. A number of laboratory tests that detect these antibodies to CMV have been developed to determine if infection has occurred and are widely available from commercial laboratories. In addition, the virus can be cultured from specimens obtained from urine, throat swabs, and tissue samples to detect active infection.  CMV should be suspected if a patient:   has symptoms of infectious mononucleosis but has negative test results for mononucleosis and Epstein Barr virus, or,  shows signs of hepatitis, but has negative test results for hepatitis A, B, and C.  For best diagnostic results, laboratory tests for CMV antibody should be performed by using paired serum samples. One blood sample should be taken upon suspicion of CMV, and another one taken within 2 weeks. A virus culture can be performed at any time the patient is symptomatic.  Laboratory testing for antibody to CMV can be performed to determine if a woman has already had CMV infection. However, routine laboratory testing of all pregnant women is costly and the need for testing should therefore be evaluated on a case-by-case basis.   Serologic Testing The enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (or ELISA) is the most commonly available serologic test for measuring antibody to CMV. The result can be used to determine if acute infection, prior infection, or passively acquired maternal antibody in an infant is present. Other tests include various fluorescence assays, indirect hemagglutination, and latex agglutination.  An ELISA technique for CMV-specific IgM is available, but may give false-positive results unless steps are taken to remove rheumatoid factor or most of the IgG antibody before the serum sample is tested. Because CMV-specific IgM may be produced in low levels in reactivated CMV infection, its presence is not always indicative of primary infection. Only virus recovered from a target organ, such as the lung, provides unequivocal evidence that the current illness is caused by acquired CMV infection. If serologic tests detect a positive or high titer of IgG, this result should not automatically be interpreted to mean that active CMV infection is present. However, if antibody tests of paired serum samples show a fourfold rise in IgG antibody and a significant level of IgM antibody, meaning equal to at least 30% of the IgG value, or virus is cultured from a urine or throat specimen, the findings indicate that an active CMV infection is present.   TREATMENT  Currently, no treatment exists for CMV infection in the healthy individual. Antiviral drug therapy is now being evaluated in infants. Ganciclovir treatment is used for patients with depressed immunity who have either sight-related or life-threatening illnesses. Vaccines are still in the research and development stage.

Meningitis has multiple causes including drugs, parasites and fungi but the most common cause is bacterial or viral. When an infection enters the bloodstream and can pass into the central nervous system, the meninges can become infected and swell. Bacterial meningitis is less common than viral meningitis but a person with a compromised immune system can be at risk for either one.   There isn\u2019t a vaccine against Meningitis but there are childhood inoculations and vaccines that are given to Healthcare Providers and testing is done on a regular basis to make sure they have good immunities to certain diseases that they may become exposed to in their line of work. Some things cause meningitis that we have no control over, a person must keep themselves healthy and always use universal protections, this is the only way to help prevent illnesses that we come in contact with.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. My doctor diagnosed me w/ depression/anxiety and prescribed zoloft for me because I had been getting [what I called \"the rundowns\"..for lack of a better name] these episodes of of exhaustion would happen every few months off and on for years. The exhaustion would last anywhere from 3-7+ days , but would never be relieved from sleep or even extra hours of sleep. I woudl have to play 'suck-up' to my body and give it days, and days of rest. when these \"Rundowns\" occurr, I am always frustrated because in my head I wanna do the things I need or would like to do, whether its going to work or playing etc.. Its like my mind is saying 'go, go', but my body is saying 'no', no! Its soooo frustrating!! Its been going on for over a decade. When these rundowns hit, all i can do is lie down and stare at the t.v or out the window. It feels like someone removed the 'battery' from me . I am a very animated person, and with these rundowns, I have flat affect and can't physically get charged up. NOw i am a hyper person, who unless i'm sick does not lie down espec. in the afternoon! I do notice I get these 'rundowns' after either a physically stressfull &/or emotionally stressfull week.   Anyhow, I guess i've known i had a bit of depression my whole life, but when my doctor confirmed to me [after several lab tests] that it's not CFS, that i should try the zoloft. Well the zoloft, much to my surprise has helped me w/ the anxiety and ocd and i noticed I didn't get the rundowns for the first 6 months! And when they did start to creep back, they were functionable, that is I could force myself to work and perform, albeit not w/ the same as my usual energy.   o.k, so today I have got the rundowns again, and i wanted sooo bad to go out and do things this past weekend, but fear if I do I'll 'pay for it' if i don't listen to my body and stay home. AAhh its depressing, my brains says \"go\" and my body says \"no\"!   Can anyone relate to this? and if so, could the doctor still be right and I get these run-downs from the depression and not CFS?!!!!!   My intuition is telling me i do have depression/anxiety, but that i do have cfs too. This isn't normal to be 'run down' so frequently!  Thanks for your time!!\n\n",

The pain is not terrible like the doctor told me to expect. Because the spots just showed up yesterday, might I expect the pain to increase? Last night I did have some trouble sleeping, but it was because the rash was somewhat sore. I am returning to the doctor tomorrow so he can keep track of the rash. Now of course I am worried I have something else, since at 43 I am already diagnosed with shingles, but I did have a gastric bypass in 1987 and have a mal absorption problem.\n\n",

MOST of the marks went away in a reasonable amount of time, but the pain is still there and it is debilitating at times. from what i have been told, although the marks will go away, the pain COULD last forever... i don't mean to be a downer..that is just what i was told...  for me, the pain has not gone away and is worse at times. i hope for you that you get better and experience less pain..and if you get any medical suggestions to make it bettr, do share!!  jesse\n\n",

Typically speaking the general time frame is 24 hrs to 7 days. (Improvements should be apparent after the 5th day)  If he is continuing to have a fever along with the other symptoms I would strongly advise you to contact his physician for a re-evaluation along with other diagnostic studies. In my opinion, I would not relate his current symptoms to defective water lines unless of course raw sewage was present. Does he have any bites, for example, from a tick, or any rashes present? Again I would advise notifying his physician if symptoms persist. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

At first it was about twice a year and always in the same spot.  For a few years it coincided with finals or other stressful situations.  Now it seems to occur in conjunction with my menstrual period as well as stressful situations.  The neuralgia is not consistent, sometimes I hardly know I have a breakout.  Sometimes I feel the pain all the way down the back of my leg for a week or so after the lesions heal.  Recently, some outbreaks are moving closer and closer to my spine.    I've been tested for HIV, cancer and a variety of other things which have thankfully come up negative.  However, I am experiencing hypertension, sleep apnea, depression and a few other annoying issues.  So, should I be concerned that my shingles are breaking out so near my spine and do you have any suggestions about why this is happening?  Thank you for any help you can provide.\n\n",

Usually there aren't and dangersous effect from this, and it crops up along a dermatome, or nerve.  Maybe ask your physicial  for a prescription to treat this and see if he will let you take it prophylactically for a few months, even up to a year to see if this will help abade the outbreaks. If this occurs more that once a year, I would think he would be ok with that.  Other medications are available for the neuropathy(nerve pain) that can also accompany this disease. You could even see if your physician would be willing to give you medication to treat your anxiety to help alleviate the stress that causes this! Hope this helps and good luck!\n\n",

I don't want to overmedicate, each med seems to have a side affect for which there is another med.  After a while it's hard to know what's happening in my own body anymore.  My blood pressure is extremely high lately, as well.  I was really most concerned that shingles along the spinal cord could lead to other complications.   I think the real solution is a new job.   ; )  Thanks again for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Bird flu is an infection caused by avian (bird) influenza viruses. These flu viruses occur naturally among birds. Wild birds worldwide carry the viruses in their intestines, but usually do not get sick from them. However, bird flu is very contagious among birds &  can make some domesticated birds, including chickens, ducks, & turkeys, very sick & kill them.  Symptoms of bird flu in humans have ranged from typical flu-like symptoms (fever, cough, sore throat & muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, severe respiratory diseases & other severe & life-threatening complications. The symptoms of bird flu may depend on which virus caused the infection.  Infected birds shed flu virus in their saliva, nasal secretions, & feces. Susceptible birds become infected when they have contact w/contaminated excretions or surfaces that are contaminated w/excretions. It is believed that most cases of bird flu infection in humans have resulted from contact w/infected poultry or contaminated surfaces.  The risk from bird flu is generally low to most people because the viruses occur mainly among birds & do not usually infect humans. However, during an outbreak of bird flu among poultry (domesticated chicken, ducks, turkeys), there is a possible risk to people who have contact w/infected birds or surfaces that have been contaminated w/ excretions from infected birds. People should avoid contact w/infected birds or contaminated surfaces, & should be careful when handling & cooking poultry.   Hope this helps. Good luck\n\n",

I went through a MRI, spinal tap, multiple blood tests to find out it was mono for the second time, epstein bar and something else attached to it.

    "content": "It probably is a virus or a severe allergy flare-up.  Infection would be in question if you are coughing up green phlegm throughout the day, not just in the morning.  During pregnancy, the gag reflex is more sensitive.  I had allergies at the beginning of one of my pregnancies and assumed that the reason that I was throwing up was because I was coughing so much, which was one reason - the other being I was 10 weeks pregnant.  Post-nasal drip could be causing the diarrhea, along with your system spending its energy on your baby rather than your intestines.  Sore throat could be caused by post-nasal drip.  Viral - no or only low-grade fever.  Phlegm may be green/yellow in the mornings, but clears up during the day.  Nasal discharge green/yellow in the morning, but clears during the day.    Infection - Fever, and phlegm would be green/yellow throughout the day with a very bad odor.    Pregnancy drains us of so much energy as it is that an illness (whether it be allergy, virus or infection) really takes it out of us.  If you have any of the infection symptoms that I describe above, be sure that he understands that you have these.  Otherwise rest, get plenty of fluids, and ask about a safe decongestant or nasal spray to help stop the nasal problems before the gunk settles in your chest, as this could create a perfect habitat for infection leading to bronchitis or pneumonia.  Congratulations on your pregnancy and I hope you start feeling better soon!\n\n",

Is there a reason why my body does not keep the antibodies and is there something I should do?\n\n",

    "content": "I think I may have found the answer to my question and I wanted to share it in case anyone else was interested in it or may have had a similar occurance.  I plan to talk to my doctor about the possibility of my finding.  On the following web site it says: \" Abnormal results  If the patient has little or no immunity to rubella, her HI antibody titer will be 1:8 or less. Women without immunity should receive immunization against rubella provided that they avoid pregnancy for a period of three months following immunization. Women with disease of the immune system or who are taking corticosteroid medications should receive immune serum globulin rather than rubella vaccine to prevent infection.\"  http://www.chclibrary.org/micromed/00064140.html  Anyhow, this is interesting to me, because I use a topical corticostroid ointment for my eczema and I wonder if this is what is causing my Rubella vaccinations ineffective.  Topical corticosteroid pointments, such as the one I use, are said to abosrb through the skin and into the blood stream in small amounts.  The particular one that I use is even warned against use while pregnant, because of the effects it can have on the developing fetus.  (I didn't know this either, but I read it on a web site while doing my research-- and it is a good thing I came across it being that I am pregnant.)  So, now I plan to bring this up to my doctor and see what she thinks about it.\n\n",

    "title": "Parvo B19 in adults...",
    "content": "Please help!  I am a 38 yr old woman diagnosed with parvo b19.  I've had it for nearly 6 weeks now.  Most likely I caught it because it was going around the elementary schools in the area including my daughter's.  Plus I have thalassemia and apparently that makes me more susceptible to this particular virus.  My dad and one of my sisters, who also have thalassemia, got sick with parvo b19 as well.  Their symptoms disappeared in less than four weeks and their lab test results were lower than mine.  My symptoms include tingling throughout my body, arthritis, pain throughout my head, neck and shoulders and swollen lymph nodes in my head.  I had blood tests done at week four.  The result for the IgG was 4.6, and for the IgM was 7.0.  I have not been tested again since that time.  While the arthritis seems to be abating, the tingling and pain are not.  I have been advised to stay away from pregnant women (most especially another one of my sisters who is high risk).  My internist, my daughter's pediatrician, and my uncle (who happens to be a viral research scientist) have all told me that it is not worth the risk to be around my sister or any pregnant women until my symptoms are gone, and then possibly for some time after that!!   But no one seems to be able to tell me when I will be \"safe\".  My sister is very likely to deliver early and her physicians expect her son will be in the NICU.    How do I know how long I must stay away from my sister and her son?  When will I be well enough to see them?  Is there a test that can verify when the active virus has decreased enough in my body to make me \"safe\" again?  Since my symptoms are very slowly decreasing, is it worth it to see an Infectious Disease specialist?  (I have the advantage of being near Duke and UNC-Chapel Hill)  Please help!  Thanks, Susan\n\n",

I was misdiagnosed in the first two weeks, so it has taken longer to get to the bottom of this. I was referred to an Infectious Disease Specialist after prior tests for everything else came up negative. For me, it was worth the visits to see the Specialist, as I was being treated for what was thought to be Lyme Disease in the beginning, but he was able to rule that out, which is a good thing. I feel for you and what you are experiencing. The pain in my joints is decreasing but it is a slow process.  My dr never mentioned being contagious or unsafe, but I would suggest pushing for an answer as to when your disease would be considered a safe stage. Take care. I know this probably is not much help to you, but I hope it gives you some amount of hope. I have one more drs appt, to see a Rhuematologist, then hopefully, my collection of appts will be over for awhile. Go for answers and push till you get them.\n\n",

    "content": "about 5 weeks ago, i woke up one morning with 5 little tiny punctures on my stomach. i assusmed that i'd been bitten by a spider or something while i slept. i really didn't pay attention to the bites but within 24-36 hours i have 2 red lumps on my stomach, both were sore, hot to the touch, and were hard, like there was a \"core\" inside, i also had a low grade fever  99.4. my primary dr. started me on an antibiotic for cellulitis, but after 24 hours the pain, reddness and size of the wounds increased (one was the size of an almond, the other almost the size of an oreo cookie! i went to the ER (since it was saturday) and the dr. on duty tried to drain the 2 \"cysts\" --she had no luck with the large one and she did get lots of pus out of the small one. she took a culture of the pus. she also changed my antibiotics to dyoxy-something. i returned for a dressing change the next day and she said the culture came back as \"staph\". on monday i was in much pain from the larger \"cyst\" and once seeing the infected area my primary doctor sent me to a surgeon....within hours i was in his office. he took one look at the big, oreo shapped \"cyst\" and said i had a spider bite. he would cut it out becuase there was a lot of necrotic fatty cells. he took a huge chunk from my belly...i had a hole of a 50 cent piece...gapping and nasty looking. he cauterized it with a silver nitrate stick and sent me home to continue the dyoxy antibiotics and comeback in a month. i called him everyday with telephone updates (i was scared to death with this huge gapping hole on my belly!) and he finally saw me 4 days later and said it was healing, it was OK and he re-cauterized the wound. after that i saw my primary dr. because the 7 days supply of dyoxy-antibiotics was finished....and the wound was a still red, nasty looking. she gave me a 10 day supply of the dyoxy-antibiotic....last week the wound really started to heal up rapidly!! the huge gapping hole filled itself and now i have a small brown scab. amazing! but....on saturday night, nearly 5 weeks later, i got another spot on my stomach...no tiny puncture marks, just looked like the red cysts i'd had before, with a small pimple like head. i ran to the dr. office....but also at the same time, i felt is was getting a pimple inside my nose....it started small then it became HUGE and even my face/nose swelled and the pressure from the pimple gave me a terrific head ache. ALSO i was scared because i have been having chest tightness, like someone was pressing on my front and back...and low back pain...my primary immediately sent me to the ER again...although she thought my chest pain was acid reflux and maybe panic related, they ran an EKG--which turned out OK.  they took 8 vials of blood from me and said the result were all negative...white/red cells ok, no diabetes, no heart attack...my blood work said i was ok....they lanced my pimple and applied bacitracin or bactran and sent me to see the surgeon again to cut out the \"cyst\"...they also gave me 2 different antibiotics (one turned my urine bright orange) by the time i got tothe surgeon's office 2 days later...the cyst looked like it was shrinking a bit. he said it didn't have anything to drain....at suggested i see an infectious disease dr....and said maybe the first cyst he cut out wasn't a spider bite!!!  now i am scared....could i have MRSA???(oh, yes, i had athrascopic knee surgery for torn cartiledge in nov. 2004) my appointment is in 2 weeks with an ID doctor...and i have a 2 month old grandchild and my daughter and i have decided i shouldn't see him until we find out what's the matter (by the way, the baby had conjuncatvitis when he was 2 weeks old) . my questions are....can i give the baby a staph infection?? can i give an infection to my friends or pass it along unknowlingly to others i meet in church or the  store? is my husband in danger? am i in danger? are the stomach cysts and the nose pimple coincidences like the ER said, or are they related? could the chest pressure i am feeling be a lung or other type of infection? they gave me an acid -reflux cocktail in the ER and it did nothing to relieve the tightness. i am 56, a non-smoker, and overweigh and i am scared to death...i feel like a leper...i don't want to contaminate my friends, i am afraid to go to my health club pool and gym (could i have picked something up there?).....i wash my hands CONSTANTLY and wash my towels immediately after use...BUT i sneeze, use tissues to wipe my nose, i touch my nose--sometimes without thinking about it...can i be giving every body this infection?.....please SOMEBODY help me . i'll go crazy waiting for my infectious diseaase dr. appt.....the spider lady\n\n",

    "content": "Hi spider lady, There are two types of Methicillin Resistant Staphylococcus Aureus (MRSA) hospital aquired and community aquired. MRSA is resistant to certain antibiotics and can't be effectively treated with penicillin, methicillin,nafcillin, or cephalosporins. Diagnosis is identified through a culture of the site of infection. Careful handwashing is the most effective way to prevent spread. MRSA in skin infections may look like a pimple or boil and have pus or drainage. Keep in mind that staph bacteria is present on healthy people skin and unless the culture results specifically stated (MRSA) I would consider that it was staph and not resistent to certain antibiotics. If the cuture specifically stated MRSA the best preventative measure are careful handwashing, avoid sharing personal items, razors, towels etc., keep open areas covered with a bandage until healed. Don't feel like a \"leper\" doing the previously mentioned precautions prevent spread. Good luck with the Infectious Disease consult and I hope you will consider when your time, permits posting an update  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "dear Rntdj,  thak you for taking the time to answer my questions....let me see if i understand this whole MRSA thing...there is staph and there is ALSO MRSA (a resistant staph). a skin infection of MRSA can look like a simple boil or pimple or \"cyst\". a culture of the drainage must be taken to determine if it is just plain old staph or the MRSA variety. if it is just the plain old garden variety staph....that can be treated with an antibiotic like keflex...BUT if it is culture and comes back as MRSA , then the big guns types of antibiotics must be used? right? also if it IS MRSA, there are 2 kinds of MRSA...the hospital acquired and community acquired--what does this mean, how can you tell them apart? why and how does this matter? also after taking 2 treatments of antibiotics, shouldn't the staph infection be eliminated?? the recent cyst on my stomach and the pimple in my nose are another indication of infection again....no one cultured either of them, but they did prescribe new and even more powerful antibiotics....will this get rid of the staph infections for good??? i am anxious to talk to the I. D. dr. and will report what he says at a latter date... thanks again. spider lady\n\n",

    "content": "Hi spider lady, You are correct in your understanding. The basic difference in hospital and community aquired MRSA is the hospital aquired is contracted by direct contact from other patients, certain equipment and staff due to improper handwashing, etc. This type is generally located, for example, surgical wounds, catheter sites, dialysis shunts or equipment, etc. Community aquired type is seen in people who have not been hospitalized in the past year and have contracted this infection out in the community and usually presents with skin infections. If your syptoms do not improve after this cycle of antibiotics then these areas should be cultured as well. You should also be able to get a copy of your previous culture reports  to take to the Infectious Disease appointment. Again, on these reports it will specifically state MRSA. I hope you find this information somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "dear Rntdj, thank you for answering more of my questions! i guess, because i haven't been hospitalized, i must have picked this staph infection up within the community...and possibly as a result of the spider bite weakening my immune system or providing a source to enter my body??? i am very certain that my original problem was a bite from either a spider or something else...and that the 2 \"cysts\" appeared. one large and unable to be drained and a smaller one, that was able to be drained and cultured. i guess i am trying to play doctor- detective, but it seems  to me that the large one might have been the result of the spider venom( since the surgeon excised necrosed fatty tissue) and the smaller was the result of staph infection(because pus came out of it when drained)...and the most recent skin infections (the cyst on my stomach and the nasty pimple in my nose)  was a re-occurance of of unresolved or reocccuring staph....hmmmm? i'd either better get to medical school or see and I.D. physician!  thanks again and i will get as many reports as i can to hlep the I.D. dr. diagnose my problem. i'll be in touch. spider lady\n\n",

    "content": "Infection with WNV can be asymptomtic (no symptoms), or can lead to West Nile fever or severe West Nile disease.        The symptoms of severe disease (also called neuroinvasive disease, such as West Nile encephalitis or meningitis or West Nile poliomyelitis) include headache, high fever, neck stiffness, stupor, disorientation, coma, tremors, convulsions, muscle weakness, and paralysis. It is estimated that approximately 1 in 150 persons infected with the West Nile virus will develop a more severe form of disease. Serious illness can occur in people of any age, however people over age 50 and some immunocompromised persons (for example, transplant patients) are at the highest risk for getting severely ill when infected with WNV.       Most people (about 4 out of 5) who are infected with West Nile virus will not develop any type of illness (an asymptomatic infection), however you cannot know ahead of time if you'll get sick or not when infected.       The symptoms lasts for about a few days to a few weeks. Neurological effects may be permanent.\n\n",

My head felt like it was going to explode. Aside from the slight fever and chills there were no other symptoms (my ds did vomit, but I think that's because his headache got so bad) It's 3:00 am, and I still have a slight headache (up cause the cats were fighting outside)...now just waiting for the 3 daughter's to get it! Anyone else getting this weird virus, or unexplained severe headache? Had it not been so short lived and lasted less than 24 hours I would definately be worried about meningitis, but I think we are out of the woods as far as that goes.  Does this sound like a virus or something else?\n\n",

After that, I guess I had a complete breakdown of my system and the herpes zoster broke out at my right side skull/head.  The eruptions today are gone however the area where the herpes was feels still a bit numb. Before I got ill, I guess I overworked, slept too less and played too much sport (squash). I only engaged a natural doctor and use urinal therapy and eat only fruits, vegetable and the juice out of them. My problem today is: evening time I still have fever 38-38.2 degree Celsius, measured under my tongue. Temperature measured under my armpit is always almost one degree less. My blood reassure is around 110/68 but my pulse always high at 95-101, and then I have a serious headache and feel my pulse in my head. These conditions I have now since about one month. Please, do you have any explanation and advice? Thanks so much rene\n\n",

However, if I would have contracted this dangerous strain then my condition would have become very serious within a couple of days.

    "content": "Fever and any other associated symptoms in a malaria-endemic zone must always be investigated to exclude malaria first. Where this is negative, other causes must be sought by a clinical examination and appropriate laboratory tests, such as CBC, Biochemistry, Serology, Stool and Urine tests. You may have been cured of your malaria attack four months ago and may have acquired a new infection from a recent  mosquito bite. You are quite right that if you had falciparum malaria,  you would have deteriorated by now, but remember that you can have the non-falciparum strain which is not life-threatening and having lived in Ghana for 11 years, you may  have acquired partial immunity.   Serial tests for malaria and/or the other recommended tests are now mandatory since your fever and headache are one month old. You did not respond to my question about the presence of any risk factors for immunodeficiency diseases.  False positives and false negatives with the microscopy malaria tests do occur in the third world due to fungal artifacts that stain microscope lenses. Added to this is the expertise of laboratory personnel in interpreting malaria films. For this reason, there is now a new generation of diagnostic tools for malaria, which detects, with 99% accuracy, the presence of malaria parasites and the strain involved  within 10-20 minutes. This method does not involve the use of a microscope and is called the HRP II test for malaria. Ask to be examined by this method.

Concerning any risk factors for immunodeficiency diseases. Well, 7 years ago I was tested HIV positive here in Ghana. However, on my next visit to Switzerland, I was thoroughly tested and the HIV+ status was not confirmed, rather malaria parasites were found which, I was told, the reason for my increased CD4 cells was. And I fell never sick, at least for the past 7 to 8 years, only the yearly one or two malaria attacks which I usually have very well (?) under control since I know the starting symptoms of my body well and immediately take the anti-malaria course. So normally it ends there and no fever starts. I will keep you posted as soon I have done my lab test. Thank you!\n\n",

Within two days I had developed facial edema on the same side and ulceration just in front of my tonsil on the same side.

By the fourth day I had developed swollen lymph nodes in my neck, jaw and back of my head. On the fifth day I developed nausea and anorexia. Later that day my BP was 142/100, where it remained for the next two days. It is now back to normal (120/80), however, the other symptoms remain. I feel very fatigued as well. I do not have a sore throat. The facial edema is non-pitting. I do not have any dental pain. I am hesitant to go to my Dr if this is likely to be something viral in nature as I do not have medical insurance. I have been treating the oral ulceration with peroxide rinses and warm salt water rinses. Thank you for any input.\n\n",

Have family members and caregivers wash their hands with warm water and soap before touching the baby.  Limit the baby's exposure to people with cold symptoms or fevers.  Keep the baby away from crowded places  Do not smoke around the baby  Talk to your child's pediatrician about other preventive measures and medication  If Hannah should develop any symptoms then you should contact your pediatrician immediately.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a few general medical questions:   1) I seemed to have grown some sort of alergy to alchol. Is this possible?  I only social drink, for instance a few days ago we went out and I had a total of four Smirnoff Ice's in four hours and I woke up about 5 am sick and couldn't get out of bed until 12:00 that day. A few days later something similar happen I had about three drinks then stopped (fearing puking again) and about 2 hours later we were still out and I started getting puky, weak, and harsh stomach pains.  The next morning I woke up okay feeling and had a bacon sandwhich, then I started feeling a little queezy again, but felt fine the rest of the day until the next morning I became upset to my stomach after using the restroom. Also my stoll had been very soft and a reddish colr for a few days. Some people are putting fear that I couldbe pregnant, but I am on birth control religiously.  It seems as though as far as I can rmember I have always had somewhat of an issue with nausia, for instance a lot of times breakfast food make me queezy sometimes and so does greasy food.   2) What are classic signs of diabetes?  I always crave sweets, I'm tired a lot ( i only get about 6 hours a leep a night), all I drink is water, but what are other signs?  3) Over time I have also seemed to have developed general alergies.  I wake up every morning of my life with flem and gook stuck in my throat, my eyes seem to force themselves closed in the mornings with the sun, etc. I've never propertly been checked for algeries. Is this possible?  Thanks\n\n",

Nausea and lack of desire to eat (anorexia) can also be psychological. If in doubt do get a pregnancy test done.  As for symptoms of diabetes these include increased drinking, increased urination among other symptoms. Please look at our diabetes page for more info.  Regards,\n\n",

It could actually be a large list of things: including liver disease, kidney disease. If you feel that you are getting better then try to eat lightly (meaning small potions). Stop drinking for the time being in order to give yourself a chance to improve. If it continues for a few more days then you should get a physical assessment.

There was 2 injuries, one on the front of the tibia, and the other was on the side of the calf around the gastrocnemius and soleus muscle. The bite on the calf is what is bothering me. It is an inch long and was about 2 to 3 inches deep. The er doctor put 4 lose stiches in to close. My question is will it ever stop hurting. It is still bruised and tender. When I swim or run, I cant walk the next day it hurts so bad. I was wondering if there could be in vascular problems. Thanks for your time. Heather\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Delta, You need to have your wound checked out and if it isn't inflammed or re-infected then I would suggest referral to a surgeon. You seem to be experiencing a wound contracture. Your surgeon will be able to determine if your scar problem can be corrected by physiotherapy or if it should require a surgical procedure such as Z-plasty.  Z-plasty is a surgical method for treating scarring which restricts normal movement of joints, or causes deformity. This type of scarring, known as contracture, is caused by shrinkage of tissues in the skin, muscles and tendons and may occur after extensive burns or other injury. Z plasty changes the direction of the scar in order to relieve skin tension caused by the tissues shrinking. Three incisions are made in a Z shape, with the central incision running along the scar. Two V shaped skin flaps are then formed by cutting skin away from underlying tissue. The flaps are then transposed. This has the effect of redistributing tension at right angles to the original defect. The flaps are then stitched in place.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for taking the time to answer my post in advance.  I have two issues going on...  1.  I have found a small pea sized soft lump next to my testicle.  It is not on the testicle but rather closer to where the crease bewtween the leg and groin area.  About a week ago this spot had a infected hair, which I popped when the head surfaced, but now a small knot has formed under the skin that burns sometimes, but is not visbale from the surface and is not changing in size or location. It is generally painless unless I mess with it.  Any ideas or thoughts.  I have no history of testicular cancer or VD's  I have read it could be a infected follicle and other things that frankly scare me.    2.  A few days ago I fell ill having flu like symptoms (chills weakness, cold sweat) it lasted about 24 hours and then I was over it or so I thought, now four days later I am still not 100%, I am still weak and generally fatigued.  I also have had diarrea for the past three days after this illness.  I rarely feel this way.  Any thoughts?  I am trying to be seen by a physician but am looking for whether I should seek attention sooner than my appointment in a weeks time.  Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello redfence800, The small pea sized lump you are describing is probably an enlarged inguinal lymph node. This could have resulted from the infected hair. Nothing to worry about, it should resolve by itself before your doctors appointment.  The other problem could have been a simple flu or a gastroenteritis, its hard to tell. Your doctor may request a panel of investigations to make sure your immunity is in good condition. This will depend on the results of your examination.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I have had several out breaks of shingles over the last 10 years, especially when I get very stressed.      Recently, my father died, my job is ending, I started night classes and doing job searches, so I'm very stressed.  Shingles eruptions used to come out across my mid-back in a line to the right side of the spine. Now they are popping out in a line to the left of my spine. I absent-mindedly scratched them; the itch is severe. Yesterday I discovered itchy eruptions around the left side of my gential area. Could I have scratched the shingle eruptions and passed the virus to mucous membranes on another part of my body?     I am going to see a doctor tomorrow and get tested in case I have contracted an STD, but I am curious to find out if it is possible to transmit the zoster to another place on my body. If I do have an STD, my boyfriend's life will change dramatically because I have not been intimate with anyone else in the 5 years we've been together. Thanks!\n\n",

    "title": "Rabies",
    "content": "Rabies is an acute encephalitis (infection of the brain) caused by a virus believed to be infectious for most mammals. Transmission of the virus is usually through a bite. Transmission also can occur by exposure of a scratch, abrasion, open wound or mucous membrane to saliva or brain material of a rabid animal. The virus has an affinity for the central nervous system tissue and travels along the peripheral nerves to the brain. Once the virus is established in the brain the disease is seldom reversible and usually fatal. The average incubation period varies from 20-90 days after exposure and depends on the following circumstances: a) severity of bite or laceration, b) location of bite (incubation periods may be shorter after bites on head, neck, and fingertips, than bites on the trunk or lower extremities due to extensive nerve endings in the former areas), c) age of the victim (children have faster onset). Two clinical patterns may be manifest and are referred to as \"dumb\" or paralytic rabies and furious rabies (prone to bite).  If someone is bitten by a cat, dog or any animal:  Wash the wound immediately with soap and running water for at least five minutes See a physician immediately, even for minor wounds  If your pet bites someone or has been bitten, immediately confine the pet and contact the local animal control officer or public health agency and check with your veterinarian for treatment and rabies vaccination history.  If the bite is from a wild or stray animal, DO NOT try to capture the animal unless you are sure you can do so without incurring injury.  Do not destroy the animal which has bitten a human or other animal. Contact the local animal control officer or public health agency.   Now back to your question. It would be hard to believe that a pet shop is selling a rabid animal but it depends really on the location of this pet shop and many other conditions that i could not possibly assess from the internet. So from a medico-legal point of view I would have to ask you to seek medical advice to rule out the possibility altogether.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Need info re: treatment for dog bite.  I was bitten by a dog three days ago.  Three deep puncture wounds (felt like his teeth hit my bone) and three surface marks.  Am not at home - traveling.  The area bled well.  I cleaned it off and applied some bacitracin ointment.  Is there anything else I should do?  The area now is a bit red around the three deep sites, only a bit swollen, the deep soreness seems a little better.  Is there anything else I should be doing?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Guest,  Thank you very much for using our website.  When a dog bites you and you did not catch it or was a stray dog then the best way of action is to take the rabies vaccine.   The symptoms that you should look out for as regards to rabies are fever, headache, malaise in the early stages and then fear of water, seizures and irritability in one form of the disease while the other form is manifested by paralysis, confusion and coma.  Wounds are not a problem unless they become infected. As regards to whether you should receive antibiotics as prophylaxis to prevent infection of the wound, most authorities recommend it if the patient has diabetes or if the wound looks suspicious for infection like it is red, feels warm or tender.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
