    "content": "I am a 24 year old female and I have been taking Yasmin contraceptive pill for the past 12 months. At the end of May ( a few days after my period ended) I had food poisoning and was given an antibiotic containing ciprofloxacin. On 2 July (4 days after my period ended) I had a bladder infection and was given an antibiotic containing norfloxacin. 1 day before this my husband and I had sex without a condom. It has only been 22 days, but I have been having some symptoms that are normally associated with pregnancy (nausea, swollen and tender breasts, fatigue, thick vaginal discharge, frequent urination). I am not sure what the affects of these antibiotics on Yasmin are, or if these symptoms could be unrelated. Could I be pregnant and when should I take a pregnancy test?\n\n",

    "content": "As you know, antibiotic use can cause oral contraceptives to be ineffective so there is definitely a possibility you would be pregnant.  A test would likely confirm this now.  hCG levels and the rate of hCG production differs among women. However, home pregnancy tests can begin detecting pregnancy at 7-10 days past ovulation  on average (this is typically about 10 to 16 days after FIRST day of last period). If the test is negative this early, repeat the test a week later.   For most accurate results in home pregnancy (urine) tests, follow guidelines below:   - Use your first morning urine if possible or hold your urine for at least 4 hours for concentration purposes.. -Do not drink excessive amounts of fluids before the test, which may increase the volume of urine. This could dilute the hCG level in the urine sample. - Read and follow the directions included in the test thoroughly!  - If there is a problem with the pregnancy, such as an ectopic pregnancy, hCG levels may be low.  A blood test can detect hormone levels about a week earlier than these tests.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Antibiotics have not been shown to be the concern we once worried they might be with the exception of Rifampin - used for TB and rarely for other infections, so don't worry about the antibiotics used for a UTI, but if you worry, add a second barrier method of birth control.  The fact that you have used withdrawal would also reduce your risk of pregnancy though it is not a reliable method by itself.    In most cases taking the pill within hours, or within the same day, will not be a problem.  If you take a progestin-only pill it is more important to try to take it near the same hour of the day than if you have a combination pill (estrogen/progestin).    Keep in mind that there is a small failure rate with contraception so you cannot completely rule out pregnancy but it is only about 1% failure in a year of use.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Could I be Preggy-3months late Neg blood/urine test?",
    "content": "So here is what is going on with me, and please bear with me as it may be a bit long.  My last cycle AF was 2/14/2009. It lasted the usual 6-7 days, heavy with cramping. Around March 13/14 I spotted for three days. I know that this was not AF because after having a regular AF for years since my teen years, and having it always be heavy with no symptoms other than cramps, I pretty much know my cycle at this point. I never spot, to me, there is no such thing as spotting, lol. My AF is heavy to moderate from beginning to end.  My husband and I have unprotected sex, basically everyday, if not once then twice a day, and he always ejaculates inside. So the risk for pregnancy is there! lol.  Now from February till now, we are 75 days since my last AF. The symptoms I have been having are food cravings, food aversions, mood swings, increase in hormones, increase in sex drive, increase in body temperature, morning sickness, breast sensitivity and enlargement, bloating, gas,fatigue,increase in the ability to smell things, and headaches.  I've taken a multitude of hpt and they all said negative. And from previous blood work done in February I do not have any issues with thyroids, cysts, etc or anything that can cause a missed cycle.  When I went to the clinic Tuesday, they gave me another urine test and came out negative. After I told the doctor there of all my symptoms and the absence of AF for 74 days, she says that it is \"normal\". I may not be a doctor, but I find nothing about missing AF for almost three months plus my symptoms above normal. I was under the impression that I would be having my annual exam at the same time, but they said no. So for now I am done with the clinic.  She sent me out to get bloodwork, among other tests.  I was told that the blood test was negative.  When I asked her for an explanation explaining why my cycle has not been here for 75 days and to explain my symptoms, she said once again that it is normal.  I'm sorry, but I do not find none of this normal.  Especially being that my cycle has been normal since my teen years.    Now here is where everything gets all wonky. My sister/mother/cousins have all been pregnant for weeks (we are talking about 8-12 weeks) before confirming pregnancy with a blood test/ultrasound. All of their hpt with urine came back negative. I have had friends who have told me of the same thing happening to them and their friends. I've been scouring the internet for similar stories, and it appears that there are other women who have been pregnant, but hpt were negative as well as blood test  I even spoke to a ob/gyn and she told me that it is possible for women to be pregnant, but not have it show up on a HPT. It appears that although pregnant, some women just don't register hCG on a hpt.  What I want to know is have any of you ladies experienced this? I just want to make sure I am not going crazy. I need support, my husband and I will be extremely happy if I am pregnant, and even though we were not ttc I will still be heartbroken.  It feels like I am pregnant, I was in denial at first, but I believe it now, thanks to the morning talks with the cold porcelain of my toilet comforting me because of my morning sickness, and the increase in sex drive, and the fact that my husband and many other men I know saying that they can \"smell\" my pregnancy.  I was told that some women want to be pregnant so bad that they trick themselves into pregnancy.  But I only accepted the fact that I could be pregnant about a week ago, and I have been having these symptoms way before that but was in denial.  Have any of you experienced something similar?  Did a sonogram show a baby?  Did any of you have negative pregnancy test/blood test but you were still pregnant.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would schedule an appointment with a gynecologist who has the capability of doing an early ultrasound exam.  There are other subtle signs evident with an internal vaginal exam.  If you see a doctor, you should be able to confirm or rule out pregnancy at that time.  Meanwhile, if you are having unprotected sex you should definitely be taking a multivitamin as this is most beneficial in reducing birth defects when taken in the earliest days of pregnancy.

    "content": "Hi, Pregnancy is always a possibility, but the consistent negative testing makes it seem very unlikely.  There are some women who do not produce enough hcg early on to show up in tests.  If you continue to miss periods you should see your healthcare provider to determine if you are pregnant (by blood test) or if something else is going on to cause your missed periods.  But, be assured that missed periods are almost never serious aside from pregnancy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Pregnancy tests used at the doctor's office are the same as the ones you buy in the supermarket; and if you were 1-3 months pregnant there is absolutely no way it would turn up negative, I assure you.  If it were an ectopic pregnancy, sometimes very rarely a test will show negative, but not at this late juncture, and you would be having severe lower left or right sided pain long before that.  It's good that you are going to get checked; it may be nothing, as the pill is kind of known for causing irregular/missing periods in some individuals.  How long have you been taking it?\n\n",

It's very safe and you only think about it after your period when you feel for the string to make sure it's in place.  No hormones, you don't feel it and it's 99.0% effective, just like the pill.  Here is a link so you can consider if it may be an option for you.  http://www.pamf.org/teen/sex/birthcontrol/iud.html  The serious side effects listed I have not seen but in very rare cases.  There may be cramping for a few days afterward while it gets settled, usually not.  It is  effective the day you have it inserted.  I do NOT recommend the Mirena - it has the same hormone (progesterone) as in the pill and will give you side effects very similar to what you are describing.  It has a higher percentage of pregnancy and has to be replaced every year as opposed to every 10 years.\n\n",

Even if the body rejects it, the chances are practically nil.  It is possible, though, there are no guarantees in medicine.   They do NOT harm the uterus in any way used properly.  You can check the positioning every day if you like simply by feeling if the string is there.  If you can feel it, it's in place.

    "content": "This used to be the belief; however, most of the bad publicity was because of the residual fear of the Dalkon Shield, which was discontinued in the 70's.   There is a very slight risk of Pelvic Inflammatory Disease which can happen (rarely) shortly after insertion, but if the antibiotics are taken as directed for a short course after insertion, there really isn't a problem.  There are other causes of PID, like chlamydia for example, not just IUDs.   If left untreated, scarring can occur in the fallopian tubes, which could interfere with conception, but it is a very painful condition, and the sufferer will seek treatment long before that happens in most cases.  These days, most  GYNs realize the risks are minute, and the benefits great, so the only requirement now is that the woman be in a monogamous relationship.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I will try to answer these several questions.  For Mightymel - missed periods are not uncommon while on the pill but they aren't perfect so when it doubt it's best to take a pregnancy test.  For Becca0428 - pill-free days when taken as prescribed are still protected.  However, the pill is not 100% effective so pregnancy is a possibility.  So are missed periods since these are hormones we are manipulating with oral contraceptives.  If in question, take a test.  These are inexpensive and reliable.  For Ehoes77 - again, a missed period is quite normal and nothing to worry about when you are not sexually active.  Try to relax.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have been taking it for 4 days now and today is the last dose. Nothing has changed.

    "content": "Hello, I will try to answer these several questions at once.  For kds -  it never hurts to take a pregnancy test when you suspect you might be.  Antibiotics for UTI won't hurt if you are pregnant and many women get these so it is possible you had an infection.  It is also possible you have other issues going on as well.  In some cases the antibiotics need to be repeated or changed based on the outcome of the treatment and culture/sensitivity if that test was done.  At any rate, if symptoms continue you should contact your doctor.  These are not typical symptoms of pregnancy however.   For Julie - irregular periods such as you describe are perfectly normal.  Since you had your regular period after you had sex, you would not be pregnant.  PCOS can also cause irregular periods but your symptoms do not suggest pregnancy.  For Nunee - there are many reasons your period could be missed or irregular but it's always a good idea to have a pregnancy test when you are in doubt.  Also, if you are not pregnant and sexually active you must find a reliable method of birth control you and your boyfriend are comfortable with.  Stress about pregnancy is not something you need.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Subsequent studies have failed to confirm this.   A University of Toronto study in 1995 concluded that there was no association between exposure to oral contraceptives in the first three months of pregnancy, and external genital malformations. The study also suggests  that women exposed to sex hormones after conception may be assured there is no increased risk of fetal sexual malformation any more than the background rate of birth defects that normally occurs.   It is advisable to discuss this matter with your obstetrician, just in case he or she is aware of a more recent study which differs.

I went to the clinic and they took a blood test and the HCG was 2835.  They arranged a scan for Monday (yesterday).  When I went for the scan, nothing could be seen apart from the sac - there was no fetus inside.  They did another blood test and that came back as 4476.  Bear in mind this was more than 48 hours after the original blood test.  The doc said the rise was reasonable but not as high as they'd have wanted and to treat it as a potential pregnancy.  I had another appointment today with my GP who said it is possible that it is a blighted ovum.  I am absolutely worried sick and have to wait 10 days before I have another scan.  It feels like torture.  Do you think it sounds like the odds are against me and I am heading for a miscarriage?  Any advice will be greatly received.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to have a period after you become pregnant.  Most women who do report that it is not quite like a normal period - perhaps lighter or shorter.  This is usually due to implantation bleeding as the placenta attaches.  You can repeat the pregnancy test to be sure but positive usually means just that unless there is a miscarriage.  This is also a possibility if the period was heavy.  It is believed that a number of miscarriages occur before the women even realizes she is pregnant.  Again, repeating the test would be the best thing to do.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would say no because you had a regular period.  Even though you ovulated, you do not necessarily become pregnant when you ovulate because the sperm must make its way to the right place, fertilize the egg, and then the egg must implant into the uterine lining.  The fact you took plan B would further guarantee your safety in this.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  The last time my boyfriend and I had sex was late November of 2009. He pulled out just before ejaculating but thought the condom may have broken and was not completely sure if he pulled out in time before ejaculating.Two to three days after this I took plan B. A few days before my expected I began feeling a little nauseous and some other symptoms that are common for both PMS and pregnancy and  I became really paranoid thinking there was a possiblity I could be pregnant and took a clearblue pregnancy test the day before my period came and it came out negative. My period came at the expected time that month and for the month of January, but I have heard of women still getting their periods and were pregnant and this really freaked me out. Could there be a possibilty of pregancy? I've become very paranoid lately thinking that the pregnancy test I took was defective or it was too early, I took the plan B too late, and all sorts things! Basically I'm asking is it possible to have normal periods yet still be pregnant?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are reports of women having periods while pregnant but in most cases any bleeding noted after conception is lighter than a normal period for the woman and usually is only a one-time event.  Again, I must stress that there are women who say they did have periods but this would be very rare.  Pregnancy tests would still detect it if you were pregnant.    As for the faint lines on the HPT - I'm not certain why you got this reading but if you got your period you can be pretty sure you are not pregnant, despite what the test said.  These tests rely on hcg levels and sometimes there is variation with this.  A faint line test result should be followed by another, maybe a week later if the period hasn't started yet.  For Miss Real Talk, heavy periods happen sometimes, as do backaches and these symptoms do not necessarily mean there is anything wrong with you.  Most likely things will return to normal next month.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey I am 18 and my boyfriend's 19. We have had unprotected sex several times but he's never cum inside me. The only time he did was the last day of my period. We consulted a doctor and he said since it was still my last day so the chances of pregnancy are next to nil. However, my usual period date is 13th. It was been constant for several months now but for the past 2 times I've got my period on the 8th. This could be because I started rigorous aerobics 2 months back to lose some weight.  I am getting an absolutely normal period. The main cause of my worry is the fact that I get tired alot and have a constant headache and burping. Which happen to be signs of pregnancy. I sleep almost 8-9 hours a day as opposed to my 5-6 hr sleep and still feel tired.  We love each other but we're not ready for marriage and kids as we're still in college and financially independent.  I would really appreciate it if you could tell me what to do next at the earliest. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree that the chances of pregnancy are not very high.  Some irregularity of period, especially within days is perfectly normal.  Vigorous aerobics can affect your period as well and it's nothing to worry about.    There are many possible causes for fatigue and GI symptoms.  If this continues you should see your health care provider to see if you are anemic or have anything else going on.  Meanwhile, find a reliable method of birth control you and your boyfriend are comfortable with.  This will ease your mind and stress can also affect your period.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your symptoms sure are taking on a familiar sound, there may be a congratulations in the future for you and your husband.   You may be able to get a result from a home pregnancy test now. Your doctor can do a blood test that will pick up your pregnancy much sooner than a urine test. If you would like to test at home, try to find a HOME PREGNANCY TEST that will pick up hCG ( human chorionic gonadotropin) levels around 15-20 mIU/ml.   HCG is measured in milli-international units per millimeter (mIU/ml).  HCG is first detectable in the blood as early as seven or eight days after the fertilization of the egg has taken place.   The average hCG level at 14 days past ovulation is 48 mIU/ml, 16 days past ovulation is 95 mIU/ml, 18 days past ovulation is 292 mIU/ml, 20 days past ovulation is 522 mIU/ml, etc. In general, the HCG levels will double every two to three days in early pregnancy so it should show up on a pregnancy test by the time you are due for your next period.\n\n",

I did not just feel one movement at a time, I felt several in a row. My doctor put me on the generic form of Inderal (30mg/day) when I was 16 weeks, due to fainting,dizziness, difficult breathing, etc.  I barely feel the baby now.  Maybe once a day, if that.  Could the medication be effecting the baby?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, There is no evidence suggesting that this drug would be associated with decreased fetal activity but there is no way to be absolutely sure as it has not been extensively studied in pregnancy.  The activity level of your baby at this time can be somewhat sporadic.  We usually recommend that you do fetal kick counts beginning about week 28 when activity is more consistent.  At that time we would expect the baby to move 10 times in a two hour period.  But, prior to that time, it is much harder to monitor movement.  Mention this to your doctor but likely it is just normal fluctuation.  Do be sure you don't become dehydrated - something that can cause your baby distress.  Good luck. Debbie\n\n",

Me and my husband were trying for a baby and we had regular sex. I took pregnancy test on june -13-2010 and it came positive as my pregnancy symptoms started that day.   I had doctors appointment on june -25-2010 and doctor did vaginal scan and  he said I am only 7 week pregnant. and  he  estimated my due date will be feb- 10- 2011.   On JUly- 12-2010 , again I had vaginal ultrasound(May be I was 9 week 4 days) and due date went to  feb-14- 2011.    Doctor   said my conception date  is  around May-20-2010.  based on CRL length.

    "content": "Hello, Pregnancy is always a possibility when you are sexually active and fertile.  The emergency contraception is usually quite reliable so chances are not very good you would have become pregnant from the first encounter you mentioned.  However, withdrawal is not an effective birth control method and you should use something else preventively.  If you were to become pregnant and were unsure of the date, the doctor would order a dating ultrasound - done after a few weeks - to help estimate the due date.  A few days variation in period is considered normal so unless you are late by several days it could just be the normal variation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The odds are that you would not be pregnant based on the combination of timing during a more \"safe\" time of your cycle, and the fact that he did not ejaculate inside.  While there is always an exception, the odds are not great.  If you are very worried in such situations, you could take plan B but don't be surprised if this upsets your cycle.  Some people worry that the change in cycle resulting from the extra hormones in plan B mean they are pregnant.  Since you wrote the question a week ago, it would be too late for that to be effective now (ideally within 3-5 days after having unprotected sex) and perhaps you already have your answer through your period.  I apologize for the delay.  I hope you got the help you needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to say with this information.  You said you had sex about a month ago but you did not indicate when your last period was.    All of your symptoms can be related to hormonal changes but not necessarily pregnancy caused.  Other changes occur in women with their cycles and with irregular periods it can be hard to know the reason.  If you have had a period since you had sex, then no, you are most likely NOT pregnant.  If your period was a week or more before you had sex, there is always that possibility and if your period does not start you could repeat the test after about a week.  If it is still negative you are probably not pregnant, though some women have low hcg levels and are not detected for a while.  This is unusual, however.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In some rare cases a woman has a \"period\" even though she is pregnant but in most cases this is not a normal period for her.  It may be quite scant bleeding at about the time the period would be expected and is most likely implantation bleeding.  A regular period usually does not occur in pregnancy.  If in doubt, take a pregnancy test for reassurance.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pregnancy could happen since some \"pre-cum\" may contain sperm.  It is not as likely to happen and it would also depend on when your ovulation occurred in the cycle.  If this happened near your sexual encounter your risk would be greater.  The average ovulation day is somewhere around the 14th day of the cycle if you begin counting on the first day of your last period and you have a regular cycle of around 28-32 days.  Again, this is variable so we usually consider a dangerous block of days rather than one single day.  You could use plan B but it would likely alter your menstrual cycle as well so don't be alarmed if you have some bleeding irregularity following use.  If you don't start your period when you expect it, within a few days you could take a pregnancy test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My girlfriend and i have bees sexually active now for a few months. I use a condom every time we decide to have sex. However, recently, on the 6th. My girlfriend was curious to see how my penis would feel with out using protection.   We had sex once, using protection and afterwords she performed oral and i cleaned up a bit. however, later that same day we decided to see what it felt like unprotected. I did not ejaculate at all during this time or even come close because it was very brief. Just enough to feel.  I was wondering what the odds might be that she is pregnant due to any residual sperm that may have still been on my penis? She shows some symptoms of pregnancy such as; Nausea, constipation, headaches, tender breasts, and her delayed period. (Her period is normally on the 21st so it is five days late now and this event occurred on 6th) However, she has been very stressed lately and many of her symptoms, according to the research i have done, can be caused by stress.   Please post back when possible. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can i be pregnant if...",
    "content": "Hello, There is a very good method that can be used by women with regular periods that cycle between 26 and 32 days.  This method uses an inexpensive tool to help you track the safe days.  It makes the whole tracking visual and simple for both you and your husband to know right away the best days to have or avoid sex depending on whether you are trying to wait for pregnancy or trying to conceive.  The system is called CycleBeads.  You can read about it and order at cyclebeads.com.  I must stress that it is for women with fairly regular cycles but if you have periods in less than 26 day intervals it will not work.  If it is right for you, you could expect a 95% success rate.    The beads are the tool that allows you to track which day of your cycle you are on and the colors indicate \"safe\" or \"unsafe\" days.  You keep it by your bedside and slip the ring over a bead each day, moving the ring around the circle.  When your period starts you begin again with the ring in the start position.  There are other natural family planning methods but this is the one I have found to be the most \"user-friendly.\"  The set is not expensive and makes for very economical family planning.  It also helps you to visually understand your body's menstrual cycle.  Other methods like the \"two-day method\" are very good but require you to really focus in on your body's natural secretions.  You can become accustomed to what the fertile days secretion is like and how it differs from the other days.  You must be comfortable with touching yourself to become expert at the subtle changes but many women do become very good over time.  You can also use the two day along with cycle beads to more accurately predict the two days you are most likely fertile, whereas the beads alone use the larger window of likelihood for ovulation (approximately 12 day per month).  During that window, if you are trying to avoid pregnancy you would avoid having intercourse completely.  (Other non-penitrating methods of sexual expression would be fine).  If you are tracking with the two day method and identifying the secretion changes (they take on the characteristic of raw egg whites and usually greater quantity than other days) this can narrow the unsafe days down considerably.  If abstaining for 12 days per month is too difficult, the \"two-day\" may be right for you either alone or with the cycle beads.      Sometimes the Catholic church offers classes to teach couples how to practice natural birth control so you could also check with your husband's parish.  I hope this is helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Im new to this and not sure if this is the right place to post a question but il give it a shot.  Basically i am worrying myself sick over the possibility of an unplanned(unwanted) pregnancy. Here are the details.  During the month of May i missed many pills but tried to catch up and finished them all anyway. June 5th i had unprotected sex and he did not ejaculate in me.  june 6th(day after) i had my period which started at a very unusual time. 5 days later i had a pregnancy test done(urine) at the doctors and it came back negative.  I started taking my pills regularly again (and properly) on june 7th(the day after i started my period because i usually start them on a monday). Then, june 25th and 26th i had unprotected sex (twice). i had been taking my pill steady for about a week and a half at this point and the next days after sex i took Plan B because i was paranoid. (so i took plan b twice-saturday, and then on sunday because i had had sex friday and saturday night). Im not going to lie i was not sober during sex either one of these times and cant fully remember if he ejaculated in me but am pretty sure he didnt. and if he did it was only one of the nights. I took a home pregnancy test two days ago and it was negative and the doctor did a dipstick test and it was also negative (but im thinking maybe it would be too soon to really tell).  My period was a bit messed up for a while due to missing so many pills and i started early last month .i have been taking my pills regularly and properly and am almost finished a whole pack -i am on the third day of sugar pills). This month i am 3 days late for my period so far (according to my last period which happened on June 6th) and so im wondering if there is a chance i could be pregnant (if likely) or if its because of taking plan b twice and having messed up my pills the month before that my period may be delayed. thanks soo much i know that would be very confusing .\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand you are very anxious to conceive but the most important thing right now is patience.  It is considered normal for it to take up to a year of trying to conceive before it actually happens.  Everything must be in alignment and much of it is a mystery as we do not usually know the actual day you ovulate, especially with irregular periods.  This does not mean you won't get pregnant by natural means and efforts, having intercourse regularly - some say every other day during times you may be fertile (again hard to predict).  So, frequency will of course improve your chances.  Your work schedule should not be a problem at all.  The PCOS can make it more difficult to become pregnant.  I'm glad you are being treated for that.  If you do not become pregnant within the year, you may consider discussing an ovulation stimulation medication such as Clomid but that does carry some risks, such as increased chance of twins.  While twins are fun, they also tend to often come prematurely and this can be serious.  So, if you can conceive naturally that would be ideal.    The irregular periods may mean you do not ovulate every month and there are ovulation predictor kits that can help you determine ovulation.  Sometimes it takes longer than a year but we usually don't encourage intervention in someone your age until you have tried naturally for one year.  Babies tend to come when they're ready more often than when we decide it's time.  We can have some influence through planning an birth control, but some luck is involved too.  Try not to worry too much about this because stress hormones can also alter your cycles.  Good luck with your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I wonder if you can help me because i am going out of my mind. Me and my partner are 21. I came off the Dianette pill in August 2009.  Me and my partner have been trying to conceive from the day i stopped taking my pill. We have been having sex at least once a day EVERY day trying to conceive. We have tried to track when i am  fertile and ovulating  and we have sex twice a day on these days. Howeever my periods are irregular. I understand that when you come off the pill it takes a while for your periods to become regular.   At first i was having a period every 2 weeks (August-January). I have started tracking my periods since may. I came on my period May 3rd- and came off my period on the 8th. I then got my next period on the 8th of June and did not come off untill the 13th June. It is now the 15th of July and no period. I did a pregnancy test 2 days ago that came out negative. I have bought a fertility monitor to help me track when i am fertile as it is hard to calculate with my irregular periods but unfortunatly i am waiting to start my period to use the monitor (as i am 2 days late than last month). My doctor said my periods would get back to 'normal' about 3 months after stopping my pill but it has nearly been a year. I am convincing myself that i am infertile. After all how can 2 young healthy people not conceive if they have sex every day?  I would like to know why i have irregular periods soemtimes short or really long. Do you think there may be a problem with my fetility or his?  I hope you can rest my mind.  Thanks for your help!  Cassie\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Can i be pregnant if...",
    "content": "Hi, I will try to answer these several questions.  For amrichu - it depends on the pill you take.  If it is a progestin only pill, sometimes called \"mini-pill\" the time of day is more critical than if you have a combination estrogen and progestin pill.  But, any birth control method has a small rate of failure even when taken perfectly so when a period is missed, it's a good idea to get a pregnancy test.  Of course if it is positive you stop taking the pill but don't worry that you were on it when you became pregnant.  These are hormones not unlike those that occur naturally in a woman's body.  For Skyriver - whenever you are sexually active and fertile there is a chance of pregnancy and only a test can verify it.  There are many reasons discharge varies so that is not a good indicator - blood or not.  It is also possible to have missed and irregular period without anything being wrong.  Most women vary with this at times for various reasons including emotional and worry over the possibility of pregnancy.  For Baby2010 - the fact that you had urinated earlier would not affect a pregnancy test, but if it was too soon to determine pregnancy it could be a false negative and should be repeated a week later if you haven't had a period by then.  Bumps around the nipples are quite normal and not significant as a problem.  There are also many reasons a woman might be bloated and constipated - even tired.  Pregnancy is just one of the many possible causes.  Hormones vary and there are many types of these in the body.  I would watch and wait to see how it goes.    For jan081995 - because of your irregular periods it is very hard to guess about pregnancy and only a test can determine it.  As I said above, emotional worries can upset your hormones and cause missed periods.  Usually symptoms of pregnancy don't occur immediately following intercourse and conception.  If symptoms continue, repeat the test and/or see your health care provider.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are several factors which can influence your chances of pregnancy.  If you have pretty normal periods, and it sounds like you do, you would be in a mostly \"safe\" time of your cycle when it is not likely you were ovulating.  Every woman is different but in general with cycles of 26-32 days between, fertility occurs sometime between days 8 and 19 (start counting with the first day of your last period).  Day 20 and beyond are usually unlikely days for pregnancy to occur, even with full ejaculation.  However, we do not recommend this method as being reliable since failure rate is higher than other methods of birth control.  But, it does suggest low odds for pregnancy occurring from that one encounter, especially when it comes to pre-ejaculate only.  You should be pretty safe with the spermicide and condom use previously.  There are always exceptions, but the combination is quite reliable as a rule.    If your period does not start as expected, take a home pregnancy test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had my daughter in September 2008, at my 6 week check up in Nov. 2008 I had a paragard IUD inserted. I have been able to feel the string every time I have checked. I had a check up n pap smear done in April 2010 my doctor said he could feel the string and everything was okay. Me n my fiance have not been very sexually active in the last year or so because of our schedules. The first day of my last menstrual cycle was July 26th, my periods are pretty regular around 28 days. This month (August) me and my fiance have had sex around 6-7 times already (We have had a lot of time together). On August 11th I did a random check for my string and I cannot find it (I have had my IUD for almost 2 years never had this problem). i checked a few times that day, and then I checked again the 12th, and again today in the shower, its still not there. I did an ovulation calculator to find out when my fertile days would have been and it was Aug 6th- Aug 11th, which we have had sex 4 out of 6 of those days. I do not actually know when my string first disappeared, I just know on the August 11th it wasnt there. My breasts are sore but nothing else other then that. What are the chances that after 2 years my IUD fell out or moved? And what are the chances that I could be pregnant? I still have 2 weeks or so until my period but I knew really early with my first pregnancy (at about 3 weeks) I feel like Im getting myself worked up and it can't even be possible.\n\n",

    "title": "Can I be pregnant with a Paraguard IUD",
    "content": "Hello, There are cases where women get pregnant with an IUD in place but this is not common - only about one in 100 users in a year's time.  The IUD can also move but it is also possible the strings have just moved up so try not to worry.  By the time your period is due, if you don't get it, take a pregnancy test.  Chances are you are not pregnant but if you are you will need to see your doctor soon to evaluate the placement of the IUD.  If it has been lost of course your risk of pregnancy would be higher. If it is still there and you are pregnant, removal may be needed.    Sometimes a doctor can locate the strings and bring them back down into position.  At any rate, you will want to have this checked even if you are not pregnant so you can be sure it is where it should be.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I don't have a private doctor which I can just call. I go to one of those Osceola Clinics. I try calling to change my appointment which is for the 21 of this month because I was tested positive for chlamydia. They gave me the medicine and said they will test me at 36 weeks to see if i still have it. When I try to explain to the appoinment lady she didn't want to change my appointment because is nothing to worry about. Im a first time mom and ofcourse Im goint to worry. I don't know when is my due date and If I break water and still have chlamydia I don't want my baby to get infected so I just perfer a C-section. Im register at Winnie Palmer Hospital in Florida. What are my chances of having a C-section and the babt not getting infected?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, C-section is a very serious surgery and should only be undertaken when there is definite risk to the mother or baby in a normal vaginal delivery.  The treatment you were given should have taken care of the chlamydia and that is why they have told you not to worry, I'm sure.  It is important to take the antibiotics as prescribed and completely.  If so you will be safe.  If by chance you had the infection going into labor you could be tested and a decision about delivery could be made at that time.  Just going into labor would not put your baby at risk,  particularly after treatment and you should be able to deliver normally.  The due date determined by the ultrasound exam is usually quite accurate but this depends on when it was done.  A recent sonogram would not be as accurate for dating as an early one.  You should be able to talk to a provider on the phone (someone besides the appointment maker).  Leave a message that you need to talk to the doctor or midwife caring for you so they can call you back and discuss your concerns as well as your changing estimated due date.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, While the drug can pass to the fetus, there is no controlled study information that verifies harm to humans so information is limited.  This medication is sometimes used in pregnancy when it is necessary and other drugs are not available.  Often there is an \"all or nothing\" effect in early pregnancy where the fetus either survives or not, while congenital defects more often occur a little later.  At this point I cannot predict any particular problem and the chances are that there will be none, assuming the pregnancy continue without other insults.  Take good care of yourself.  Remember that even having some risk does not necessarily mean anything adverse will occur.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course it is not safe.  Pregnant women should never use street drugs of any kind and prescribed narcotics in pregnancy (usually not long-term) are for specific reasons and the risk and benefits are weighed in making the decision with the health care provider.  Tobacco is a known problem for everyone and it can reduce the oxygen supply to the baby by constricting the cord vessels, sometimes causing intrauterine growth restriction and babies who are small in size (also a risk factor for other problems after birth).  Aside from this, smoking in the home and/or will subject the child to secondary smoke - a known cause of cancer and asthma.    A pregnant woman who is addicted to a substance is not thinking clearly because the addiction rules her.  She is not putting her baby's health first (or even her own).  This is how powerful such addictions are.    There is little you can do about it if she is unwilling to take responsibility.  She is clearly in denial and I'm sure she is not telling her doctor about her behavior.  I feel sorry for the baby and understand your concern.  How can an addicted woman be a good mother for her baby even after the delivery?  If you see signs of neglect it would be your responsibility to report this to proper authorities for the baby who can't speak for himself.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have never been pregnant and I have a very good track record with taking my pills on time (generally within 30 minutes, if not right on the hour).  I take no other medications, prescription or 'natural.'  Early this year I was distressed by the fact that I'd had no period for 3 months in a row.  I took a pregnancy test two months in a row and both were negative.  I thought maybe I was just too stressed out.  I went to the nurse practitioner on my campus just in case and she assured me I was probably not pregnant--she did not give me a pregnancy test on the grounds that what she had were just as effective as the store-bought tests I had purchased and used.  She told me that b/c I have been on the pill so long I've probably just stopped producing a uterine lining and thus have none to shed when I take the inactive pills.    The next two months in a row, I had very heavy periods--like I had not experienced in 21 or 22.  This past month, I had no period, at all, again.    Can someone please help me understand why my periods have been happening/not like this?  This back and forth I find frustrating, and not knowing why is just added stress.  Should I seek another kind of pregnancy test?  Are there other potential issues I should be aware of?  Thanks for the reassurance/advice.]\n\n",

Unfortunately, early miscarriage is quite common, occurring in at least 20% of all pregnancies.  Your ultrasound does make it appear that you may be experiencing such a loss this time, but they repeat it in case you are actually just not as far along for everything to show up properly.    You should be prepared for the possibility that the baby did not develop and your body deals with this event naturally but sometimes there is a lag period.  If things work out you can be pleasantly surprised.  The good news is that most women who experience miscarriage do go on to experience a healthy pregnancy so try to stay positive regardless of the outcome now.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They can be discontinued if necessary once you discover you are pregnant.  Since it can take several months to a year to get pregnant, it usually does not make sense to suffer during that time if the medications help.  The NSAIDs are not recommended in pregnancy so your doctor would likely have you stop the Meloxicam but having some around the time of conception would not adversely affect your baby.  In some cases it is continued if benefit outweighs potential risk.  Best wishes and good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

Perhaps it was trapped for a time.  I do not think you need an extra visit at this time but try to rest when possible to see if the pain resolves.    It is understandable for you to be worried, but try to reduce your stress as much as possible since the cortisol (stress hormones) could have negative effects in ways we don't fully understand.  We do know that relaxation, meditation and decreased stress helps you to have a healthy pregnancy.  Abruptio is something you can really not control; just one of those accidents that happen.

    "content": "Hello, This would not be a great concern.  The very large fish are the ones most commonly associated with mercury - swordfish, tilefish, shark and king makerel.  Mahi mahi is low on the risk chart and it is recommended that pregnant women eat fish that are low in mercury contamination because of the wonderful health benefits that come with fish.  The recommendation is for 1 part per million (ppm) or less.  Mahi mahi has 0.19 ppm.  Twice weekly fish consumption is a good part of your pregnancy eating plan, but this is a rough guide, allowing for eating some even higher on the list.  Based on that, four times would not be alarming.  There really is no definite number that indicates the threshold where it could be too much.  These are simply guidelines.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I do have an appt to see a doctor, but its not until august 5th because i just moved & im seeing a new doctor. friends keep telling me i probably got pregnant, but wouldnt i have noticed a change of some sort if my IUD moved? and wouldnt i definitely notice if it came out??? i havent had anything like this happen in the 3 years ive had my IUD so i have no idea what to think. i did have a miscarriage 10 years ago & some of this seems similar, but its been so long im just not sure. not sure if its important but the clots are a very deep, dark, red color. any advice or thoughts on anything else i should look into. i hope i posted in the right place & gave enough info...its my first time on here. thanks in advance for any info i can get.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be impossible to say if you had become pregnant and miscarried as many miscarriages occur before women even realize they are pregnant.  However, it is not likely since the IUD is typically a very reliable method of birth control.  It's not perfect, but the failure rate is very low.    Clotting is very normal in the fluid that the body cleans out with your period and just means some blood pooled for a period of time.  Clotting is the normal process for such blood and will appear dark red, brown or black at times.  It is nothing to be alarmed about.    Variations in periods happen to almost all women so I would not worry too much about this unless you have prolonged heavy bleeding - more than one or two cycles of such. This is because you could become anemic if you lose a lot of blood.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: CERCLAGE AT WEEK 29",
    "content": "Hello, Medications for bipolar disorder are some of the most difficult to deal with in pregnancy.  As a general rule, we must weigh risks and benefits.  It depends on how severe your symptoms are when deciding this ratio.  If a woman is well-controlled with Lamictil, it would appear the benefits will outweigh the risks since bipolar can have serious negative consequences on the mother.  It is important that her health be good in pregnancy.  We know it is important to treat depression since this is a known risk factor in pregnancy and the chances are very good that the medication will be fine.  Celexa appears to be safe, but we can't say for absolute certainty since testing is done differently with pregnant women.  Information is gathered and analyzed by teratology risk associations such as otispregnancy.org.   We know that major depression is harmful, however.  There is a higher incidence of babies having a little more trouble transitioning after birth when their mothers took SSRI antidepressants but this appears to be something that disappears completely within the first two weeks of life and typically occurs for the first 3-4 days (if at all). These babies may require a little more special care for tremors, irritability and restlessness.  We're talking about a pretty small risk to the baby (and only a few will even experience this at all). But, we must weigh this against the risks that come with maternal depression - difficulty bonding with the baby, taking care of herself and her family, substance use which sometimes is employed to try and deal with the bad feelings.  If a woman needs an antidepressant, that need outweighs the potential problems to the baby which seem to be temporary and easily treated.  Most of the available information shows that exposure to citalopram (Celexa) during pregnancy does not increase the risk for birth defects over a background risk (all pregnancies have about a 3% birth defect rate).This should be a good choice to control the depressive side of the bipolar, but without a mood stabilizer (Lamictil), the manic side might be a greater problem.  There have been conflicting reports about the safety of Lamictil (lamotrigine) but this is in part due to the relatively small numbers of women who have taken it while pregnant.   Some reports have indicated an increased risk of oral cleft defects in babies born of mothers who took this during their first trimester but in small numbers it is hard to make an association.  Other reports did not show such an increase.  Some of the results were complicated by the fact that the mothers were being treated for seizure disorder rather than for bipolar and complications could be the result of the disease itself (seizure disorder in the mother) rather than the treatment (Lamictil).   It is likely that Lamictil is probably a better choice for a mother-to-be who needs it and who is effectively treated with it prior to pregnancy than some of the others such as Depakote (valproic acid) which has been shown to increase birth defect risks.    These are important issues to discuss with your health care provider.  It is believed that there is a greater problem with psychiatric conditions not being treated in pregnancy rather than over-treatment since the providers often err on the side of caution (don't take anything in pregnancy just in case).  In truth, the risks may be much greater for the mother, the baby and the family relationship when the condition is not treated.  For mothers with mild depression, it may be worth it to try tapering off, but serious disorders really can't be left untreated.    Another common practice is to cut a dose in half, the theory being that the risk will be reduced. In fact this might be rendering the treatment useless, thereby exposing the fetus anyway, without therapeutic gain for the mother.  If it is to be treated, it should be treated properly.    In your case, examining this before pregnancy, you will be able to decide if it's worth it to try going without your medications but if the results of that are usually serious for you, it just may not be worth it.  One option would be to try going off the Lamictil now and possibly through the first trimester without it (with other therapy options in place instead such as seeing a counselor).  If you feel you need to resume after the first trimester, you could perhaps do so upon the advice of your doctor with the starting gradual dosing.  Typically the control is better when you are taking the therapeutic dose as prescribed on a regular basis and you should not go off your meds without consulting with a doctor to determine the best way to do so.  This would probably not be ideal but it is one option you could discuss with your providers (both psych and OB).  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry to say there is not much to be done for your discomfort.  You may get some relief by using ice packs at the area of the pain to numb the area.  In most cases these do not interfere with pregnancy but there could be a higher risk of the baby being in a breech or other position, hemorrhage at the time of delivery and even interference if the fibroid grows over the opening of the uterus.  Sometimes they twist and cause pain.  Perhaps this is what is happening with you.    Surgery is rarely performed during pregnancy (to remove the fibroid) because of the risk of miscarriage in the process.  You might explore some alternative therapies for pain control such as acupuncture and hypnosis.  I'm sorry you are having such a hard time with this and I hope that in time it will not be as bad as it is now.  Have you tried acetaminophen for the pain?  Is it available where you live?  It is considered safe in pregnancy.  Sometimes narcotics are needed in pregnancy and if taken sparingly these will not harm the fetus but of course you do not want to develop a dependence on these drugs.  Good luck with your difficult pregnancy.  I do hope you will find relief soon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most doctors want to see you sometime between week 10 and week 13.  This usually puts you past the highest risk time for miscarriage, which, if it occurred they would not be able to stop anyway.  Knowing you had miscarried before would not usually change the doctor's exam date unless you had miscarried repeatedly and there was serious concern that it might happen again.  Most miscarriages are one-time events and don't indicate future problems.    When dates are unclear based on periods, a viability ultrasound is often performed to determine weeks of gestation and these are usually quite accurate.   Anything sooner is really unnecessary because it makes no difference anyway.  You should eat well, exercise, take a daily multiple vitamin and stop any bad habits such as smoking or alcohol consumption.  I realize it is fun to feel like you know exactly but most women don't know precisely when they ovulated or conceived naturally anyway and the estimated due date is within two weeks time frame because of the variability of a woman's cycle.    In the meantime you might estimate your due date based on the LMP of around June 23 with an EDD of March 30 until shown differently by ultrasound exam.  Either way the chances are the baby will arrive within two weeks either side of this date.  Good luck in your pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with your doctor.  Your chances are just fine for a healthy pregnancy.  There is a miscarriage rate of possibly as high as 25% of pregnancies (many before the woman even knows she is pregnant) so early miscarriage does happen pretty frequently in most women of childbearing years.  It is usually because something is not forming properly in the cell division process or there is a chromosomal problem.  It's nature's way of taking care of things.  Women having a miscarriage close to the time of removal is really no greater than the average population.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   I have been struggling with ADHD, Anxiety and Depression for many years now. I finally found the right mix of medication and have been feeling better than I have felt in years. My husband and I have held off on having children, but would like to start trying. I am currently taking Ritalin, Wellbutrin and Lexapro. I asked my doctor at my last appointment if I should stop, but he just said that if I get pregnant, let him know, and we will figure it out. However, I'm scared to keep taking these things if they will have any affect on my child when I do become pregnant. However, as someone who has struggled with these things for a long time, this medication is making me feel normal for once in my life. So, I'm also worried that if I go off of this medication, I might lose all of the \"normalcy\" that I have gained in the past few years.   I will be following up with my doctor, but I wanted to know if I should stop taking my medication while trying to concieve/in the early stages of pregnancy before I can get in to see my doctor.   Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are probably fine to take the medications while trying to conceive and many people take the antidepressants throughout the pregnancy as well. It's all about risk vs benefits.  You can also check with a teratology service such as otispregnancy.org.   They have fact sheets about common medications.  Wellbutrin is listed by its generic name, bupropion.  Lexapro passes into breast milk in minute amounts and since it is considered safe in breastfeeding there's a good chance it is OK in pregnancy as well but there aren't a lot of studies to verify this.  The services available like otis can be very helpful.  It is known that untreated depression does put the baby at risk so this must be considered. Once you become pregnant you should stop taking the Ritalin, however.   In truth, very few drugs have actually been shown to increase the risk of birth defects in the baby when taken by the pregnant mom.  You should discuss this with your doctor but don't hesitate to call for information as well.  (826) 626-6847 is their number in the U.S.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The progesterone is a naturally occurring hormone, necessary in sustaining pregnancy, it should not cause problems when taken early in the pregnancy.  Of course it is not something one would continue to take once pregnant but this should not be of concern under these conditions.  Of course there is a typical birth defect rate between 3 and 5% under all circumstances so there is no guarantee but it would be unlikely there was a problem relating to her taking this hormone.

It is difficult to say without more information if you might have been ovulating during the time you had sex.  Without other hormonal contraception it is possible and the nuvaring may have been inserted too late for protection.  However, breast changes can occur with hormonal fluctuation, aside from pregnancy.  If in doubt, take a pregnancy test.    As for information about abortion, I would recommend you contact your local Planned Parenthood or other family planning clinic.  Best wishes.\n\n",

So, I have 3 small simple questions, but let me explain why I ask, or just go to them they have bracketed numbers marking them. (0) etc.  Anyway it was very unexpected, we barely had time to get my mother in law a trained former registered nurse and midwife, mother of 2. The pregnancy was at home naturally, by the time the paramedics got up to us on the mount he was out. It hurt so bad but it the most wonderful experience of my life.  So now I am lactating and doing it a little too successfully in my opinion. There is just too much and they are swollen beyond belief and hurt. (1) Is there any home method like ice or warm/hot water-bottle or can I soak them and will that \"decrease\"  a little of the swelling or relieve a little of the soreness? Veins are popping out in them too, they look unattractive, I'm kind of sad.  (2) But also, the marks from the ducts where the milk is coming out, will those hole marks ever go away? Or are they there to stay forever? And finally (3) I have a very long line that runs up the middle of my belly, what is that? Why do I have one, and other women don't? Why only some, why me? thats going to go away too right?   Thank you very much, and bless you. Kelly, Keith and Kyle.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on the birth of your son.    All the symptoms you describe are very normal and most will eventually go away.  Try to be patient.  As for the sore breasts due to engorgement - you can use ice on your breasts following a feeding to help with the inflammation.  It will not decrease your supply but as your baby continues to feed and the swelling goes down you will be more comfortable and will have the right amount of milk for your baby.  It is truly amazing.  You can also use chilled cabbage leaves (yes, right from the head of cabbage in your refrigerator).  Just tuck these inside your bra and it helps relieve engorgement.  You can also get some relief in a warm shower or by soaking the breasts in warm water (lean over a table with a basin of water).  Don't worry about the marks, veins and holes - these will most likely disappear in time.  You are doing a wonderful thing by breastfeeding your baby and giving him the best nature can offer (and better than anything science can devise).  Even if you had permanent marks, they would be for a wonderful purpose.  Sometimes you get a few stretch marks but they fade in time as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

We don't know how much or which babies will be affected by nicotine and often it can affect the baby's growth.  This is not always the case.  I'm glad to know you have quit now and the chances are good there will be no problems.  Try not to worry about it since there is nothing to be done now.  Just take your vitamins, eat right and do what you can to be safe from here on out.

That said, it is possible your symptoms could be from the change in prescriptions.  Ovulation is rarely actually noticed physically so it would be unusual for that to be the cause.  It is possible of course.    If in doubt, take a pregnancy test if you miss your next period since it would be accurate even when you are on the pill.      Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The agencies that monitor pregnancy exposure risks have assured me that topical treatments for skin are almost always safe in pregnancy.  The possible exception would be something containing vitamin A such as retin A, but even then it would require very heavy application for a period of time to absorb enough to be a concern.  I can't answer for these particular products but the general rule is that these do not cause any increase in risk for birth defects.  Keep in mind that about 3-5% of pregnancies do have birth defects from unknown causes.  Sometimes things just don't work out right no matter what you do, but these topical treatments should not increase your risk beyond the \"normal\".  None of these products appear to be of any concern.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Sometimes women are anxious to get it over with so they can get on with their next attempt to become pregnant or to just have closure to what is likely to be a poor outcome anyway. But, you are under no obligation to have this procedure and you can wait it out if you wish.  Unless you had complications, severe bleeding, infection or something else that would make it important to have intervention, you are fine to let nature take its course.  Best wishes\n\n",

My husband and I had sex on 5/23 (had a positive OPK test that weekend as well) so I figure conception was right around that time.  According to my u/s conception was on 5/30.  The only other activity that occurred between that time was some manual stimulation of me by my partner, no ejaculation, and highly unlikely that there was even any fluid on his fingers at the time he touched me.  Is it more likely that my conception date is miscalculated by the u/s (done at 9 weeks) or that pregnancy occurred from the manual stimulation time?\n\n",

As for the procedures, I doubt there is a problem with the laser hair removal but I would avoid any unnecessary procedures in pregnancy, including the mesotherapy because we don't know a lot about the newer treatments.  We do know there is about a 5% chance of birth defects and most of these we do not know the cause of so it's always a good idea to be safe and consider the risks and benefits.  Pregnancy is a temporary condition and many things can wait until later.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It can take a while for your body to adjust after stopping birth control pills so try to relax while attempting pregnancy. Having regular sexual intercourse is the best way.  Let nature take if from there and don't worry at this point too much about which days you are fertile.  Once your period begins to take on some regularity it will be easier to guess and if your cycle is between 26 and 32 days.  Then you would be considered PROBABLY fertile between days 8 and 19.  This is an average - you could vary beyond that - thus, the reason for regular sex.     It is considered normal for it to take up to a year to achieve pregnancy so try to be patient.  Worry adds stress and the stress hormones aren't so good for you.    Symptoms can be caused by the abrupt change in hormones in your body after coming off the pill. They can also be caused by other reasons, even stress.   While you are trying to conceive, be sure you are taking a multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid or folate, eat a balanced diet, avoid bad habits and lose any excess weight.  These are all contributors to a healthy pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a deviation which occurs in the cell division process.  Sometimes women have two of other organs such as uterus as well.  You did not mention if you have other duplication such as a septate uterus.    This should not interfere with sexual activity as the cervix is at the top of the vagina.  Whether or not it affects your delivery will have to be determined by your doctor.  Most likely one opening is connected to the uterus and I would not expect a problem with the other but your doctor would have to determine this, possibly at the time of delivery.  Since this is an older post, perhaps you will be able to update us.  The fact that you reached this stage in your gestation suggests a good outcome.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, there are PMS symptoms that sometimes result in such symptoms.  Ectopic pregnancy is usually quite painful and would likely result in a positive test.  If your test is negative, chances are this is the case.  Periods are often altered when taking birth control pills so it is not unusual for you to miss them while taking the pill.

    "title": "cerazette no period have a bloated stomach",
    "content": "Hi,  I have been trying to conceive since January...almost one year. I have had abnormal periods for the past few months if you want to call them periods. I saw my OB on Nov. 20th and she ordered a HSG to make sure my tubes were not blocked and also started me on Provera Dec. 1st. The HSG showed no blockages if there were any they were so tiny that the dye probably removed them. However it did show that my uterus was slightly tilted. I started the Provera on Dec. 1st and I take my last pill on Dec. 10th and I am suppose to start a normal period 3-7 days after stopping the Provera. I was wondering can you get pregnant while taking Provera? Should you ovulate normally after stopping Provera and getting a normal period? And is it possible to get pregnant soon after you stop Provera? Also could the tilted uterus be a potential problem in conceiving?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to get pregnant while on Provera but it is unlikely.  If you do, you should discontinue the medication.  It is not likely to cause a problem if you stop using it due to pregnancy.  The tilted uterus would not interfere with conception.  Good luck with this attempt to have a child.\n\n",

    "title": "Can you get pregnant after taking Provera?",
    "content": "Hi,  I am 25 and have been married since last 4 years. Since, we were planning to have kids after a couple of years of our marraige and I always had irregular periods, I was prescribed Yasmin (birth control pill) for contraception and to regulate my periods. We have been trying to get pregnant for almost 8 months now with no results. Since last 8 months I have been off of Yasmin, so that I can get pregnant, but I was surprise, that I got my periods for continues 3 cycle (with 30 days each) without YASMIN naturally.   But after that 3rd last cycle, again my periods became irregular. So, then I started taking yasmin for a month, got my period at the end of the same month and would try to get pregnant and wait for another 1 month so that I can take the pregnancy test to check whether I was pregnant. If not, then I would repeat the same PROCESS overall again. But no results with that attempt too.  My GYN has now prescribed me Provera 10mg (5 day pill). My question over here is that, could I get pregnant by repeating the same last PROCESS, that I tried by using Yasmin ? I mean when i don't get my period, I take provera 10mg (5 days pill) and then once I get my period can we try to conceive and get any positive results on that ?   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A fertile woman having regular sexual intercourse without using contraception will likely conceive within one year of trying.  Anything short of that is not considered infertility; just normal odds.  Everything must fall into place for pregnancy to occur.  The egg only lives a short time and sperm must be present when this happens.  It is only a day or two each month and this can vary.  Even when you time intercourse to coincide with ovulation it still requires a certain amount of luck for fertilization, implantation and normal development to occur.  Continuing to take birth control pills does not assure you will conceive.  Just because you have a period doesn't mean you will definitely conceive.  In fact, taking the pill will stop ovulation and in some women that continues for a while beyond the end of the pill-taking term.  It does sometimes regulate your periods but as you have noticed it does not necessarily continue to be regular.  However, regular periods are not necessary for conception to occur.  You can monitor your basal body temperature by taking it every morning before you get out of bed and before any real movement.  A slight increase (0.5 to 1.0 degree F) in your temperature is usually noticed when you ovulate.  It is recommended you chart this information so you can see the pattern.  Also make note of other changes such as cramping, spotting, bleeding, and mucus changes.  When you ovulate you may notice an increase in mucus and that it is thinner.  That would be the most important time to have sex, when trying to conceive.  Within the year 85% of women will achieve pregnancy.    Provera only helps get your period started; it does not affect ovulation.  For some women it seems to get things going, but not because it causes you to ovulate.  Many women ovulate irregularly and have irregular periods, yet still become pregnant with patience and continued efforts.  Try not to worry too much about this.     Good luck in your attempts to conceive.\n\n",

    "content": "First of all thank you very much for your quick response :)))  As you said, that I should try to monitor basal body temperature, to make note of other changes such as cramping, spotting, bleeding, and mucus changes. I already tried that at the very start of my attempts for trying to conceive. I mean when my basal body temp is high, mucus is not thinner. when mucus is thinner basal body temp is not high. I mean its not occuring in coordination to each other, making it much more confusing & hard for me to take appropriate steps when it is actually needed. I even tried using ovulation kit, monitoring basal body temp & changes such as cramping, spotting, bleeding, and mucus change all together. But, as I said before it is not working in coordination to each other. Instead its getting very complicated to link it all togther.   Also, again after a month, this month I got my periods naturally on my own (30 day cycle). I was just thinking that intially I had to depend on YASMIN to get my periods. But now, that I am trying to get pregnant, I am getting periods naturally without any medication. I really don't have any idea what is happening in my body:)))   I think because my periods are irregular its very complicated to judge, that when do I ovulate. I really don't know what to do. Should I try it for few more months & then approach a specilaist or..............?   Thanks for the support.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is generally recommended that you have intercourse at least every other day while attempting conception.  This takes the guesswork out of it and no matter when you ovulate you are likely to have sperm present at the right time.  If I were you I would try this for a few more months before paying for a specialist.  Of course then it is helpful to be certain you do not have an issue with sperm so your husband would be tested first, most likely.  Once you have those results you can be advised as to the next step. Meanwhile, just have sex regularly, stop any bad habits such as smoking, drinking and drugs, eat a balanced diet so you will be in optimal health, take a multivitamin and exercise daily.  All these things have been shown to improve pregnancy outcome once you do conceive.  Try not to make this too scientific or \"by the book.\"  Often we lose the element of spontaneity when conception is desired and  that takes a lot of the fun out of it.  Some women get pregnant shortly after they stop \"trying\".  Best wishes.\n\n",

Some doctors prescribe other medications for the PCOS along with Clomid, but for fertility concerns with PCOS, Clomid is the most reliable and commonly used ovulation stimulator.  Patience will be the most important thing now, since there are no guarantees it will happen right away.  In the meantime, take good care of your health, eat right, take a multivitamin, exercise and lose any excess weight. These all improve your pregnancy chances.     Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Has your husband considered using Viagra, Cialis or Levitra to counteract the effects of the antidepressants?  Sometimes even a different antidepressant can make a difference or even the addition of Wellbutrin so this is something he could discuss with his doctor since you are trying to conceive.    Additionally, if you are age 35 or younger, we consider it not to be infertility until you have tried for over a year.    Generally it is recommended that you have intercourse beginning a couple of days prior to the ovulation day and a couple of days after to try to get everything to align for conception.  This is because sperm can live inside for a while and it is difficult to pinpoint the exact ovulation time.  This is why I suggest your husband also address his issues.    Day 14 is just an average and for you to predict your ovulation day would require consideration of your cycle - how many days between periods, when you notice mucosal changes (discharge).  As your cycle progresses, your cervical mucus increases in volume and changes texture. The changes reflect your body's rising levels of estrogen and you are most fertile when the mucus becomes clear, slippery, and stretchy - a little like raw egg whites. Basal body temperature readings can also predict ovulation since this can increase by 0.4 to 1.0 degree - detectable only by thermometer readings.  The temperature spike indicates you have released an egg.  If you notice this, the egg only lives about 24 hours so you should have intercourse soon.  You can get an ovulation predictor kit which will help you with this.    Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have a Provera question and this seemed like the best place to ask it.  I had my second baby December 14, 2009 and want to get the Mirena for birth control.  My ob/gyn will not put in the Mirena until I am at least 8 wks post partum and on my period.  So at almost 10 weeks post partum I still had not started a period.  We have been using a back-up method of birth control and I took a pregnancy test which came out negative so he gave me a 10 day prescription for Provera to start my period.  I took the last pill yesterday, but what concerns me is that a couple of days ago we had a condom break.  Thankfully we noticed it after a minute or so and replaced it.  But now I am concerned I am going to get pregnant.  Can you get pregnant while on Provera?  How likely is it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you are breastfeeding I would not expect you to have a period and the only reason I see for this need in order to get the Mirena would be to verify you were not already pregnant, something that could be determined by other means (blood pregnancy test).  I know many doctors who place the IUD at around 8 weeks regardless of the status of the period so I can't say why your doctor felt the need to stimulate a period before giving you the Mirena.   Your doctor would need to explain this to you.    You could become pregnant while on Provera but this is unusual.  Your doctor would need to advise you if this happened since it should not be taken in pregnancy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Ive been pregnant 3 time, 2 ending in misscarriage and the third baby being still born at 28 weeks on december 25th 2008. May 9th 2009 I had my period and we started to try to have another baby, but I didnt have a period for almost a year. So in April of this year I went to the Dr. and he put me on Provera in 10 days cycles. Ive been having my cycle like I should, 2 days after getting off provera, normal flow and length(about 5 days). Well in June, I ended my cycle of provera and didnt start bleed till 5 days after being off the pill, then the bleeding stopped after a day. That was 13 days ago. Now Im feeling nauseated and my nipples are sensitive and sore and Ive been sick with a head cold, which is exactly as I did when I was pregnant the last time. I took a test a week ago and it came out negative, but that was before my nipples started getting sensitive and the nausea set in. Im too scared to take another test, I just don't want to go through all this again, too painful emotionally. What do you think I should do, could I be pregnant????\n\n",

A false negative usually shows up positive the following week, assuming you aren't doing it too soon.  With irregular periods it can be difficult to predict ovulation and so it is a wait and see situation.  The symptoms you describe could be related to pregnancy but could also signify some hormonal fluctuation relating to your medication use.  I'm very sorry about your losses.

I hope you were able to see a perinatologist (specialist for high risk pregnancies).  This doctor should be able to tell you what the possibilities are.    I am a little confused because the fetus does not get air into its lungs until after birth.  I don't know what is meant by the lung not being able to grow.  It could be that something has been found to be in the way of the lung's development.  Some birth defects do cause underdevelopment.  I think you just need to spend more time with the doctor and let him/her know that you do not understand the diagnosis and that you need further explanation.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: lungs of the fetus does not develop and fluid.",
    "content": "Hi,  As you have not mentioned certain important details such as the reason why you are on thyroxin (? thyroidectomy, ? thyroiditis etc), i will provide you with some general information pertaining to your query.  - TRH (thyrotropin releasing hormone) does crosss the placenta. - Maternal TSH does not cross the placenta. - Similarly, thyroglobulin does not cross due to its large molecular size. - as far as T4 is concerned, It appears that when fetal thyroid function is normal, the net flux of maternal T4 to the fetus is very limited. However,in hypothyroid fetuses, placental transfer has been seen to occur + uptake of thyroid hormone from the amniotic fluid through the immature fetal epidermis. - thyroid antibodies, which are found in autoimmune thyroiditis, can cross the placenta.  - Drugs such as thioamides used in the treatment of maternal hyperthyroidism can cross the placenta and affect the synthesis of fetal thyroid hormones.  Of potentially more concern to the fetus is the mother with prior treatment for Graves\u2019 disease(for example radioactive iodine or surgery) who no longer requires antithyroid drugs.In this situation chances of harm to the fetus via placental transfer of thyroid stimulating antibodies may be overlooked.  Overall, the most common cause of hypothyroidism is Hashimoto\u2019s thyroiditis (a form of autoimmune thyroiditis). Approximately, 2.5% of women will have a slightly elevated TSH of >6 and 0.4% will have a TSH >10 during pregnancy.They usually have raised titres of thyroid antibodies which as discussed earlier, can cross the placenta.  Whatever the cause, overt maternal hypothyroidism is not a significant cause of fetal disease because it usually is associated with infertility. If pregnancy does occur, there is a high risk of intrauterine fetal death and gestational hypertension. Most women with milder degrees of hypothyroidism may have no symptoms.  The effects of maternal hypothyroidism on the  fetal and post natal brain development is not very clear and are controversial. Untreated severe hypothyroidism in the mother can lead to impaired brain development in the fetus. However, recent studies have suggested that subtle brain abnormalities may be present in children born to women who exhibited mild untreated hypothyroidism during pregnancy. Several investigators have found effects such as slightly lower performance on IQ tests and difficulties with schoolwork in such children. The most common cause of subclinical hypothyroidism is autoimmune disease (such as Hashimoto's).  Hypothyroid women should have their levothyroxine dose optimized prior to becoming pregnant and should have their thyroid function assessed as soon as pregnancy is detected. Levothyroxine requirements frequently rise during pregnancy, by appproximately 25 to 50%, so the dosage should be tailored to maintain a TSH within the normal range.   Prenatal vitamins containg iron can impair the absorption of levothyroxine.So, ideally, levothyroxine and prenatal vitamins should not be taken at the same time and administrtion should be separated by at least an interval of 2-3 hours.  In case you have an uderlying autoimmune thyroiditis (hashimoto's) causing hypothyroidism and are being treated for the same, then an increasing TSH (after an initial period of stable levels) would indicate that the thyroiditis is continuing to destroy more and more of the thyroid follicles and therefore the TSH is being secreted in increasing amounts to maintain a euthyroid state.  I hope this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

There has been no apparent increase in birth defects among babies whose mothers have used these treatments.  However, if you have high blood pressure you should only take antihistamines/decongestants under your doctor's advice since some can cause an increase in blood pressure.  The concern is with the mother's health.    I cannot say whether or not herbal supplements are safe as these are not monitored in the same way as other medications.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The apgar scores you report here are excellent for successful resuscitation.  The biggest risk for a newborn without spontaneous breathing at delivery is shown by the 5 minute apgar score.  If it were still low, the prognosis is not as good, but a rapid recovery such as this has a very good outcome expectation.  In absence of other complicating factors, I would anticipate a normal newborn.  Of course it always makes sense to watch the baby closely for any recurrent breathing difficulties, grunting, etc. in case there was some lung immaturity.  But, I would expect no serious concerns based on this information alone.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Abdominal pain can occur without any serious problem in pregnancy but, especially if it is accompanied by other symptoms such as bleeding, high blood pressure, swelling, severe headache, visual disturbances (such as blurred vision or seeing spots), or nausea and vomiting.  These can be signs of pre-eclampsia or other problems.  You have not mentioned other symptoms so I assume this is not the case.    If it continues you should talk to your doctor about it.  It could be a sign of early labor. Also there are other disorders, unrelated to pregnancy, such as stomach virus, food poisoning, appendicitis, kidney stones, hepatitis, gallbladder disease, pancreatitis, and bowel obstruction.  The abdomen holds many organs so it can be hard to guess, but we should not assign everything to pregnancy which is the tendency.   Other disorders can be missed.  You would need to be examined to determine the cause of the pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

You may also have a local hotline for questions about exposures in pregnancy or breastfeeding.  The package inserts will always advise against using in pregnancy because medications are not tested in the usual ways to meet the guidelines for indicating safety on packaging.  This does not mean it is unsafe in pregnancy; just that you need to check other sources to be sure.  Your OB should be consulted about what you use when pregnant.

I've been on the pill for over 3 years (started using it to regulate my period) and have never experienced any sort of spotting in between periods. I'm very careful about taking my pill at the same time every day and am almost never off by more than twenty minutes or so; the longest I have been off by recently is less than one hour. My boyfriend and I also use a condom every time we have sex and can't recall one ever breaking. Earlier this week I started experiencing pretty severe diarrhea, which lasted three or four days. The last time I had sex was two days before the diarrhea began. Yesterday I noticed a very small amount of blood from my vagina, which worried me because as I said I've never had this problem in between periods on the pill and I'm not due to get my period for another week. Is it possible that the diarrhea caused a pill or two to pass through without being absorbed, causing the spotting? (Some food passed through undigested, so I don't think this is out of the question.) Or should I be worried that this was implantation bleeding (or something similar) and that I could be pregnant?  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I do not think you are pregnant. Condoms alone are excellent birth control when used every time and taking the pill besides is double protection.  It would be almost a miracle for you to conceive considering these two methods of contraception.  Spotting however is normal, even if you have never had it before.  Almost all women have it from time to time.  Diarrhea is of course unrelated and should not cause you to worry about this.  Hopefully it will pass on its own but if not you should find out the cause but pregnancy is probably not a factor here.  Also, being off by an hour or two on the pill certainly is not cause for concern.  You are doing a great job of practicing safer sex.  Congratulations.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should get your PCOS treated if you are not already. There are medications to help.  Also, if you are overweight you will improve your chances of pregnancy by losing some.  This will also help insure a healthy pregnancy when it does happen so use the time you are waiting to good advantage by getting your body ready for pregnancy.  Eat right, take a good multi-vitamin, exercise and treat the underlying problem.  I would recommend a preconception health visit with an OB/GYN to see what areas of your health can be improved.  Then, if you get the go-ahead, you might benefit from an ovulation stimulating medication such as Clomid.  Women with PCOS often benefit from this along with their Metformin (or other drugs).    Good luck with your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know it is very frustrating and uncomfortable but it is considered normal for you to pass your estimated due date by as long as two weeks.  If the baby can arrive naturally and you can be patient for it, your risk will be decreased and your baby will have a good chance at being born healthy.  Take it one day at a time, monitor your baby's activity and try to get the rest you need so you will be prepared for the work of labor.  Some things just should not be rushed.  Your doctor may request that you get a non-stress test if you don't go into labor soon.  But if the baby looks healthy, leaving him/her there until ready is the best thing for you both.  In most cases by 42 weeks, the doctor will induce labor.  I suspect you will go into labor spontaneously before then.    It may seem like a very long time right now, but actually another week is a very short time to have to wait.  Try to focus on something besides the baby and labor.  Do some reading you would enjoy, watch some movies, take daily walks.    Good luck with the labor and delivery once it starts in earnest.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You could be having some early labor and the baby may be settling lower into the pelvis, resulting in that heaviness you feel.  It is nice when your body can do some of the work while you are still able to go about your normal activities.  There are some women who do not really feel contractions but this is definitely the rare exception.  For most women you will get stronger and stronger contractions that are significant and you won't miss it.  As the contractions get closer and more intense with a pretty good regularity you will be in active labor.  Then your cervix will dilate even if you don't notice a loss of the mucus plug.    In some cases your water could break first.  In most cases labor begins soon thereafter but some women need a little help getting things going so if you should experience this spontaneous rupture of membranes you should go to the hospital or at least call your doctor to get further instructions.    Good luck with your delivery.  I do hope you plan to breastfeed your baby as much as possible.  Get help from nurses, lactation specialists or family volunteers if necessary.  It is worth it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You are safe to begin some exercises and arms would not be a problem to work on.  Usually the doctor wants to check you at six weeks to be sure your uterus has returned to its prepregnancy size and that you are in good health before giving you the go-ahead. This is just because your doctor wants to see how you are doing first. If you had a normal, vaginal delivery, light exercise such as walking, modified sit-ups, and stretching are excellent and you can do this very safely if you feel up to it.  You need to listen to your body here and if you experience heavier bleeding you are probably doing too much.    If you had a C-section, you should wait until you get the go-ahead, except for walking.    Abdominal exercises should only be done once the gap that sometimes is present from the muscle stretching of the abdomen has closed - usually between four and six weeks postpartum.  This is one of the things your doctor can check and will likely be mostly closed by six weeks.  A small gap won't interfere with exercise but a larger gap may.    Start gradually and work up to it, keeping in mind your ligaments are still loose and your risk of falls is increased because of this. Low impact exercises are preferable and some yoga or gym classes have special sessions for new moms.    Do keep in mind that breastfeeding contributes to you getting back into shape faster.  Good luck and congratulations on the birth of your baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The first month I was on 50mg on days 3-7, but during the time they told me to try...I used an ovulation predictor kit and it never said I was ovulating and consequently I did not have a period so had to take Provera again for this month...They raised the dosage of the Clomid to 100mg and I again took it on days 3-7, but the ovulation predictor kit said again that I was never ovulating. My husband and I do not have sex very often because he is on anti-depressants and has no sex drive. I have been trying to pinpoint the ovulation to maximize the times that we are having sex. My gynecologist is the one that has prescribed the medication, but he never seems concerned that things are not happening as they should and I am worried. Is it time to go see a fertility doctor? He said monitoring my basal body temp would drive me crazy and advised against it. I don't know any other way to pinpoint ovulation or any way to know if I am actually ovulating. Any suggestions and/or advice is appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I don't know how your doctor can predict your response to basal body temperature monitoring.  Considering your low sexual activity rate, it seems like it might not be a problem for you as it might for other women. You can also monitor your cervical mucosa to help determine ovulation times.     Also, has your husband discussed the side effects with his prescribing doctor.  Sometimes a change in medication can make a difference.  Not all antidepressants have such an effect on sex drive.   If you follow up with the clomid cycles as prescribed, I have known of women who became pregnant two or three months after stopping the clomid. It was as though it got things going and eventually they did ovulate and conceive AFTER stopping the clomid.  Just one thought.  There are assisted reproductive technologies that may help but I would probably give it a few months to see if something works for you.  I know it is heart-wrenching to try for a long time but I have known of many success stories in those who keep at it.  Sometimes it's just not on the timetable they had hoped for.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, By my calculations, from this information, I would estimate that you conceived right around August 17, but since that was the day you started your period it seems unlikely.  So, one of the ultrasounds could be off a couple weeks, though early ones are usually quite accurate.    As for your baby's growth, I imagine your doctor will continue to monitor this since there are various reasons a baby might have some growth restriction.  Usually they want to see a pattern.  If the baby resumes growth, it is probably not worrisome but if the baby continues to show increasing delays in growth, it might indicate a problem with the placenta, cord or something else - sometimes referred to as \"small for gestational age\" or \"intrauterine growth retardation\".  In some cases the baby is delivered early if it seems there is compromise in nourishment from the mother.  In most cases the baby is best inside for the full term, but sometimes the chances of survival are improved after early delivery if there is a constriction of some kind.  Regular monitoring at this point is the most important thing you can do.  If by chance you are a smoker, this could cause such a problem as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Last week my wife tested positive when she took a pregnancy test. We had not planned to have a baby now and were taking a birth control pill called 'Yasmin'.  She started to take Yasmin after her last period finished on the 30th Jan (period started 27th). She has also been diagnosed with a Kidney stone, and on the 29th we went to the hospital for a check-up. The doctor prescribed Amitriptyline 25mg to be taken once at night before bed. On the 3rd of Feb she started to have blood come again for 3 days. During this period she took both medications.  I do not know whether taking the medications together affected the Yasmin birth control, or whether the second period which came affected the effective duration of the medicine between cycles.  Anyway, as a result my wife is pregnant, but I am extremely worried about what affect the Amitriptyline 25mg which she has taken throughout these early stages of pregnancy could have on the developing baby. I have read various articles on the internet which say that this medication should not be taken during the first 6-8 weeks due to:  \"Possible facial, head, limb and central nervous system defects; possible neonatal withdrawal symptoms.\"  If there was even the slightest possibility that the above could occur we would have to question whether we would want to keep the baby or not.  I would really appreciate your professional opinion on this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a bit unclear as to when your wife conceived during the course of this treatment and when she took the medication and stopped it.  With many meds in early pregnancy there is a period of all or nothing. During the first three weeks of pregnancy toxic influences will cause either the death of the embryo or no malformations at all.  (Dr. Bonny of the Doctor's Lounge helped me with this information).  If there is a problem, often miscarriage occurs but if not, things can progress fine, especially if it is discontinued once pregnancy is confirmed.  Remember also that when a woman is five weeks pregnant, that is dated from the last menstrual period; not date of ovulation, so in fact the fetus is about three weeks' gestation.  So you see timing makes a difference.  There would be greater odds of risk if the medication is continued; less if it is stopped.  Animal studies showed birth defects but rarely are animal studies good predictors of human responses.  There have been humans born to mothers on this drug with birth defects but I don't know if these were among women who continued use vs those who stopped it in the early weeks.  It is also difficult to determine if the cause of the defects was the medication since most defects are of unknown cause and actual studies are not done on pregnant women where other variables are restricted and results are more clear.  I hope this makes sense and will help.  Category C is the designation used because of the animal studies; but some women do take this medication if the need is greater than the potential risk and of course many have given birth to normal, healthy babies.    If your wife would like to talk to a counselor skilled in teratogenic information, she could call Otis Pregnancy Organization at (866) 626-6847.  They would have more specific information on this medication.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason they tell you that tubal ligation for female sterilization should be considered permanent and the decision not made lightly is because it is a complicated and expensive procedure without perfect success.    Cost will vary with the provider but typical in the U.S. is $10,000 to 15,000, though I have heard of some where the cost is closer to $6,000 so you have to shop around.  Because it is much more difficult and takes longer to undo the procedure than it is to do it in the first place, anesthesia costs must be considered and a one or two day stay in the hospital with activity restriction for a few weeks afterward.    How successful it is depends on several factors, including how the original sterilization was performed.    If at least 4 centimeters of healthy tube is present pregnancy rates of 60 - 85% are not uncommon following the reversal procedure.  This can be determined by the doctor reading the operative report from the time of the tubal ligation surgery.  If your procedure involved burning to close the tubes, success may be decreased.  Another factor to consider is the surgeon performing the procedure.  It is done with microsurgery so someone skilled and experienced in this technique will have a better response than a less experienced surgeon.     If you only desire one more pregnancy, in vitro fertilization might be a better option for you and cost will still be high, but it may actually be less if you consider lost wages due to recovery time following reversal surgery.  Again, there is no guarantee of pregnancy but results are quite good now and your chances might be better, depending on the other factors involved.    You would need to see a reproductive fertility specialist for an accurate idea of your situation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You can't really be comfortable with a negative test done this soon.  Most consider 2 weeks to be the time you might expect an accurate result so you were a little early.  But, plan B can have a serious effect on your cycle and so periods can be messed up for a little while.  As you said there are other stressors which can also play a role.  Because plan B is quite effective, it is unlikely you are pregnant from this encounter, but take another test now to be sure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I are attempting to become pregnant starting this month.  He is in the military and if there is any chance of us being able have our first child while he is in training status we would like to so he would be guaranteed to be there during the delivery.   Our problem is that I am due to have oral surgery close to the time I will be ovulating and am worried about any potential harm it could cause.  The oral surgeon said that the anesthesia used (Fentanyl+Propofol+Versed+something else I think) could cause major birth defects and he offered to do a pregnancy test before the surgery that day... BUT I would not be technically pregnant yet if I were to conceive.    My surgery is scheduled for Nov. 24th My estimated ovulation date is Nov. 26th If I were to become pregnant, the soonest day of implantation would be Dec. 2nd  I guess my question would be, if I were to ovulate early and the anesthesia come in contact with the sperm/egg/zygote, is there any chance of harm or defects?  Or does that risk begin after implantation of the fertilized egg when I am actually considered \"pregnant\"?    I feel like there may not be a risk because the doctor said he could do a pregnancy test before the surgery and if it was negative then it would be ok to continue.  But there is the chance of me ovulating during that time and even fertilization of the egg to occur, and I would like to be sure there is no chance of me causing harm.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is always a risk of birth defects in any pregnancy - around 3-5% of all, most of unknown causes.  We cannot be 100% sure there will be no damage if you conceive around the time of the surgery but many women have had healthy pregnancies who were exposed to anesthesia without being aware of pregnancy or who just needed it in spite of pregnancy.  If you conceive just after the exposure I think your risk would be very low, but I can't say for certain if you were to conceive prior to the anesthesia.  The reason they do the pregnancy test first is to try and prevent exposure just in case since we don't do testing of such products on pregnant women.  Therefore, much is unknown.  Discuss your concerns with your anesthesiologist but most drugs used these days appear to be safe and many surgeries are performed on pregnant women without any clear increased risk.    Of course there is no guarantee you will become pregnant with that particular ovulatory cycle anyway - there is a certain element of luck involved here.  Good luck with your plans.\n\n",

    "title": "Anesthesia During Ovulation/Fertilization",
    "content": "Hi!  Obviously the woman that asked this question in the first place already had her surgery and hopefully had a successful pregnancy. But I am providing this information for the many others that are in a similar situation and ask for advice.  Before any kind of surgery we perform pregnancy tests on all women within their fertile years to avoid complications with an existing pregnancy.  During the first three weeks of pregnancy the embryo is relative insensitive against toxi influences. During this time toxic influences will cause either the death of the embryo or no malformations at all. We call this the \u201call or nothing rule\u201d.  Looking at it from a different angle: Many million women each year receive general anesthesia for the implantation of in vitro fertilized eggs and many of them carry out healthy pregancies and have beautiful babies.  Studies of outcomes in large numbers of women who underwent surgery during pregnancy suggest no increase in congenital abnormalities but a greater risk of abortion, growth restriction and low birth weight. These studies concluded that problems resulted from primary disease of the mother or the surgical procedure itself rather than exposure to anaesthesia (Mazze RI and Kallen B. Reproductive outcome after anaesthesia and operation during pregnancy: a registry study of 5405 cases. Am J Obstet Gynecol 1989).  My advice: If you are pregnant - avoid all kinds of planned surgery and have them no earlier than 6-8 weeks after birth of the baby. If you have to have emergency surgery during pregnancy chances are very high that nothing will go wrong with the foetus.  I hope this helps.

Is it possible that i may have miscarried very early in the ?pregnancy? i am very confused and don't feel comfortable mentioning it to anyone. I was quite scared at the time.

    "content": "Hello, Menstrual fluid consists of discarded tissue in addition to blood so it is possible it was just a normal period.  Without missing pills, they are very effective, though not perfect.  It is estimated that perhaps as many as 5% of pregnancies end in miscarriage before the woman even realizes she is pregnant so it is possible and would be impossible at this point to say for sure.  As for your next \"period\" which is actually a \"withdrawal bleed\" when you stop taking the active hormones - I would expect it to be on schedule.  At any rate, unless you should experience excessive bleeding it is not likely anything to be worried about now.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, By 'white spots', you are presumably referring to 'hyper-echoic' spots seen during ultrasonographic imaging.  The abdomen is a common site for congenital anomalies in the fetal. Fetal abdominal echogenic lesions are fairly common, and a majority of them carry minimal or no additional risk to the fetus.    Some of the important ones are...  - extralobar pulmonary sequestration (Intra-Abdominal Pulmonary Sequestration),  - abdominal calcifications,  - noncalcified liver lesions,    - echogenic bowel (Echogenic  bowel in the third trimester is relatively common with an uncertain clinical significance. Some considere it a normal variant in second-trimester fetuses. Others have described it as a prenatal marker for cystic fibrosis, chromosomal aneuploidy etc),  - gastric pseudomass (are echogenic masses within the fetal gastric lumen- cause unclear ? debris,? intra-amniotic bleeding.generally appear in the second trimester & disappear on follow-up),   - duplication cysts of the gut,  - Fetus-in-fetu (FIF) (a rare congenital disorder in which a vertebrate fetus is found incorporated within its twin),   - calcified meconium and   - lesions of the adrenals.  Detection of such lesions generally leads to a detailed search for additional findings and a review of the maternal history.Fetal karyotyping may be indicated in some cases.   Hope this info may be of use to you. Good luck!\n\n",

I live in a third world country and I was worried about the safety of doing a D&C and thought this was safer and better. What are my options now that it has not worked? Should I wait for the sac to come out & for how long? I am really worried.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In most cases the body will naturally deal with this through reabsoption.  Watchful waiting is an approach to a medical problem in which time is allowed to pass before medical intervention or therapy is used. Most of these cases (65\u201380%) will pass naturally within two to six weeks.  Medical management usually consists of using misoprostol so perhaps a repeat of Cytotec could be used but you should discuss this option with your health care provider.  This is used in cases of spontaneous \"missed abortion\" to complete the process and In those cases most will complete within a few days.  A D&C is commonly performed to reduce risk of bleeding and infection if some tissue remains inside, but if your health care is not good there, perhaps the procedure would carry more risk and watchful waiting may be your best plan.  If you have heavy bleeding, fever, chills or other signs of infection, see your doctor right away.     Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, With the negative tests it seems unlikely you are pregnant and there are other reasons women miss periods - basic hormonal changes usually.  Often women find they are pregnant after receiving anesthesia, usually in emergencies and in most cases everything is fine.  Since you had the urine test with the surgery I think it is quite unlikely you were pregnant because accuracy at that point is quite good.    I would not worry too much about the lack of period but if it does turn out you are pregnant you would want to be sure to discuss it with your doctor to determine dating by ultrasound and possibly observation for any potential problems.    Meanwhile, be sure to take a good multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid (folate) daily.  Best wishes on your efforts to conceive.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I want to start trying for a baby in about 6 months. I want to be sure I prepare my body properly for this endeavor. I'm currently overweight, at 270 lbs (5'5\") and have maintained this weight for over 10 years. I eat healthy and do not over eat. I do not have diabetes and all my blood work comes back fine. I'm 28, have never been pregnant and do not smoke/drink/do drugs.   For overall health, heart health, and a healthy pregnancy, is it better to maintain my weight and continue eating healthy or diet and try to lose some weight before I conceive?  I've read some studies that suggest that weight loss and weight gain are not as healthy as maintaining weight because they both put strain on the heart. Plus people who have a genetic disposition to being overweight (as I do) tend to gain more weight when they diet (Yo-Yo). I don't want to gain an exorbitant amount of weight during pregnancy, so I don't want to cause a Yo-Yo effect by dieting before I get pregnant.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think you are wise to plan ahead.  I would also recommend a preconception visit with your doctor to evaluate all aspects of your health.    I would recommend weight loss, but not in a dramatic (yo-yo) way.  No starvation or grapefruit diets which usually result in regaining of the lost weight.  This would include some popular diets like hcg with extremely low calories.  However, a program like Weight Watchers would be excellent for you.  It's a lifestyle change you can live with rather than an extreme diet.  You can even eat this way while pregnant though they won't let you continue to come to their weigh-ins and meetings once you are.    Eating healthy is important but a reduction in calories will not interfere with this.  You may even want to see a dietician for a consultation and calculated food intake program.  It has been shown that even a moderate weight loss of 10% results in huge health benefits and this would definitely apply to your pregnancy.    Even though you don't have diabetes or high blood pressure now, pregnancy stress can bring these on and you are at risk for gestational diabetes.    One of the best things you could do would be to begin a good exercise program - walking, biking, swimming, treadmill, etc.  If you could exercise 4 times a week, this will help jump start a healthy weight loss and not hurt in any way since you are healthy.  But, it is always good to consult with the doctor in that preconception visit about these things first to be sure and do not start with a marathon - ease in gradually.  Start with maybe 10 minutes and work up from there.    Also, if you aren't already doing so, take a good multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid (folate) daily.  This does the most good when taken preconceptionally and at the time of conception.  Also, start reading about breastfeeding.  It has tremendous long-term benefits and has even been associated with a lower incidence of future obesity in the baby.  Good luck in your plans.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Things could go either way.  Bleeding is often a sign of miscarriage but rarely can happen even in a viable pregnancy.  You would need to see your doctor to know for sure by ultrasound or repeat the pregnancy test, though hormone levels could be dropping without it being apparent right away.  Because miscarriage in the first 10-12 weeks of pregnancy is very common, we know this is a very real possibility.  Meanwhile, take it easy and let the doctor know what is happening so if you are miscarrying they can be sure you don't hemorrhage.  Most of the time the woman's body takes care of it but in some cases intervention is needed with either medication or D&C if indeed you are losing the pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is believed that there are many very early miscarriages before a woman even knows she is pregnant, but after the fact it is really not possible to tell if that is what happened or not.  If you symptoms continue it could be due to the medication side effects since fertility drugs do have unpleasant side effects.  If they stop in spite of your meds, it could be that it was an early miscarriage and is no longer a problem.  Or, it could be just some serious hormonal fluctuation causing your symptoms in absence of pregnancy.  I'm sorry I can't be more helpful but you'll probably just have to wait this one out.  If you continue to \"feel\" pregnant, take a test at about the time you would be expecting your period or when you are a few days late.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Diabetes is a serious disease with consequences so you cannot ignore this.  I would return to the free clinic at least, or try to come up with money to see a doctor.  Keep in mind that if you had regular insurance you would be needing to pay a monthly premium.  The visit with the doctor would probably not cost more than a few months' premiums at most.  But, there might also be public options, clinics which offer low-fee or sliding fee arrangements, etc.  If there is a diabetes treatment center in your area this might be a place to begin for finding someone who could treat you.

    "content": "Hello, Since you had your ligation several years ago, it is most likely successful.  Most failures occur fairly soon after the procedure.  I suspect you are just having normal hormonal fluctuation resulting in irregular and missed periods.    An ectopic pregnancy is associated with pain and bleeding.  In these cases you may have falling levels of Hcg hormones, but the pregnancy test would likely have been positive anyway.  With negative testing, sterilization and no other pregnancy symptoms, I suspect this is not an ectopic pregnancy.  If you experience sharp pain, especially on one side and/or bleeding, see your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Hormones are given at exactly planned times and everything is prepared to give the embryos every possibility for success.

So, to go to the trouble and expense only to implant one embryo is risky and of course heartbreaking if it doesn't take.  I hope this answers your question.    Best wishes.\n\n",

It goes straight to your bloodstream when you put it under your tongue.  Can I take this much while pregnant? I asked my OB/Gyn( who looked very young by the way; like he was right out of med school.) I showed him the product label and he said it was okay to take it and that if I get too much I will just pee it out. But 3000mcg of B-12 sounds high compared to 8 mcg that is in the prenatal vitamin.  My maternal grandmother had pernicious anemia and I've read it can be hereditary.  Trivita sells this B-12 to the public online. So it is not a prescription. I asked my OB doctor if he could test me for B-12 deficiency and he gave me that deer in headlights look like B-12 deficiency doesn't have anything to do with pregnancy. He said that wasn't in their normal routine labwork and he would have to call and ask how to test for it.  Am I wasting my money taking the B-12 supplement if I am not deficient. I am 29 years old and my brother who is 31 recently had symptoms of B-12 deficiency. He had tingling sensations like pins and needle sensations from his head to his torso. Actually he said he had it even while he lived at home(in high school) but never told anyone. He said he has also had hallucinations. I found out my mother and my aunt take B-12 shots.  I was just wondering if 3000 mcg of B-12 is too much during pregnancy. I took one last night around 1am and forgot I took one and took one today around 1pm.  Would greatly appreciate your input.

Sublingual is supposed to be absorbed better than taking oral tablets.  This is why a multivitamin won't supply much of it (going through the stomach).  Even sublingual will result in not all of this being absorbed and this is usually the reason for such large amounts - the hope that enough will get through.  B-12 deficiency is not typically screened, as your doctor said, but levels can be checked.  If you are not deficient you probably don't need to take the supplements.  These are not regulated by the FDA so we really don't know what amount is therapeutic.  If you do not have a deficiency, I would advise against the supplement.  There are also intrinsic factors that can interfere with the absorption of B-12 and iron.  It is recommended you treat these conditions under a doctor's order and after sufficient testing to determine the actual cause of the anemia or B-12 deficiency.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,   I'm 34 weeks pregnant and found out a few weeks ago I have had herpes in the past. My ex called and said him and his girlfriend before me had it as he just found out as he had cancer and I guess the chemo kept it from coming out. Its a small outbreak so the doctors said hes had it for years. We were together for 6 years and the girl before him has it and him and her were together for 7 years.   So I know I've had it for atleast 6-7 years. Him and I have been divorced for 2 years. I'm now 34 weeks pregnant and his outbreaks have consisted of a few small cuts. I have never saw any blisters or outbreaks on me but I do shave the pubic area and sometimes cut myself or have razor burn....so its kinda hard to tell. My OB says I have had an outbreak in the past from the blood test.  She has given me valtrex and told me to start it in the next few days until i deliver....is it safe? She hasnt really gone into detail about anything of the risks or side effects. aslo, is it okay to breastfeed while on valtrex? I've researched a lot, and find mixed feelings on both. I just need a second opinion or thoughts. Please help. I cant take crying anymore. She also want do a c-section unless its absolutely neccessary. They don't do elective ones.   thanks so much!  Sarah\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm glad to hear your doctor is advising this treatment.  It is not only safe but helps ensure the safety of your baby.  I am also glad to hear she does not do elective cesareans.  The risks of c-section are not always explained, leaving people to believe they are completely safe and even superior to the natural method of childbirth.  This is not true.  If you had an outbreak of herpes at the time of delivery, the c-section would be necessary and then the benefits would outweigh the risks but with treatment and in the absence of an active lesion, you are best to give birth vaginally.  You can also take antiviral drugs while breastfeeding if they are needed and prescribed.  Best wishes on your delivery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is standard procedure.  The baby has a slightly increased risk of breathing some of it in at the time of birth and causing some transitory respiratory distress but this would be the case regardless of the method of delivery once the meconium is there.  It happens quite frequently and most babies do fine in spite of it.  Unless the baby showed signs of distress that would necessitate a c-section, there are actually more potential problems and complications with the surgery for you and the baby and you would not be able to avoid the problems of the meconium anyway.  The baby does not breathe until birth so during that initial exposure to air - however the birth occurs, if there is meconium, the baby can breathe it in.  Fortunately the color of the fluid alerts the staff so they can suction the baby as needed immediately to help prevent problems.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This cannot be detected with the routine ultrasound exams, but can be with the color doplar ultrasound.    A velamentous insertion on a placenta higher in the uterus is not a significant consequence most times.  If there is any doubt, the baby is taken prior to term (about 35-36 weeks) via C-section - standard in a vasa previa case where it is low, close to the cervix.    Pregnancies with a velamentous cord insertion should have a transvaginal ultrasound to determine if there is a lack of fetal vessels near the cervix.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm on my second pregnancy. My first one was normal with the exception of hypertension in the third trimester. My due date for this second pregnancy is July 24th. I was just diagnosed with pre-eclampsia, with no history of it in either family. My mother had low amniotic fluid when she was pregnant with me, I was her 4th pregnancy, as she had 3 abortions before deciding that she wanted to be a parent. I've noticed that there is a genetic link between abortions/miscarriages and pre-eclampsia after looking up information on pre-eclampsia.  I have come to the conclusion that anyone who has abortions is at a higher risk for having pre-eclampsia and genetically predisposing of it to their offspring. definition of abortion from dictionary.com a\u22c5bor\u22c5tion /\u0259\u02c8b\u0254r\u0283\u0259n/ Show Spelled Pronunciation [uh-bawr-shuhn]  \u2013noun 1. Also called voluntary abortion. the removal of an embryo or fetus from the uterus in order to end a pregnancy.  2. any of various surgical methods for terminating a pregnancy, esp. during the first six months.  3. Also called spontaneous abortion. miscarriage  4. an immature and nonviable fetus.  5. abortus   6. any malformed or monstrous person, thing, etc.  7. Biology. the arrested development of an embryo or an organ at a more or less early stage.  8. the stopping of an illness, infection, etc., at a very early stage.  9. Informal. a. shambles; mess.  b. anything that fails to develop, progress, or mature, as a design or project.  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Origin:  1540\u201350; < L aborti\u014dn- (s. of aborti\u014d). See abort, -ion  So the above definition includes a reference to a miscarriage. Now if abortion=miscarriage, then the female body also recognizes it as a loss of life, as if by a natural miscarriage. With that said we can factually represent abortion being the same as miscarriage. This is a significant thing, don't get me wrong, this is the basis for what I'm about to explain.  In theory, based on facts, women who have abortions are more likely at risk to have pre-eclampsia and predestined it to their future children in their genetics.  When a fetus is terminated, naturally or by force, the body makes a note of this in the genetic memory. It basically tells the genes that are passed down, that any pregnancy with this genetic makeup is bound to be a failure if brought to term. So fetus's that are perfectly healthy can be determined as detrimental just because of the genetic link to abortion.  Because of this, even if you have not had an abortion or a miscarriage, but any of the females on your maternal side stemming from your mother, grandmother on up have had one, you are genetically destined to be more likely to have a miscarriage.  here is some information from wikipedia which will help you understand more on how it links to pre-eclampsia- Many theories have attempted to explain why preeclampsia arises, and have linked the syndrome to the presence of the following:  endothelial cell injury immune rejection of the placenta compromised placental perfusion altered vascular reactivity imbalance between prostacyclin and thromboxane decreased glomerular filtration rate with retention of salt and water decreased intravascular volume increased central nervous system irritability disseminated intravascular coagulation uterine muscle stretch (ischemia) dietary factors, including vitamin deficiency genetic factors The two things that stick out is immune rejection-which you develope your immune system from genetics, and genetic factors- things like genetic memory. Your immune system determines what your body rejects based on genetic memory. Things like allergies to food and medications can be linked through genetics. Therefore genetic memory comes into play. Genetic memory is what tells you what is good and what is bad, and if you are one of those that carries a gene, from maternal or paternal side, you are more likely to have or develop the same symptoms or problems that effect your parents. There may not be alot of studies done on genetic linking from the paternal side to assume that it is linked through a father or any of his kin, but it has yet to be disproved as well. For arguements sake, would it be wrong to say that abortion leads to pre-eclampsia? If this is not enough then here is another thing to look at also cited from wikipedia.  The pre-eclampsia syndrome is thought in many cases to be caused by a shallowly implanted placenta which becomes hypoxic, leading to an immune reaction characterized by secretion of upregulated inflammatory mediators from the placenta, and acting on the vascular endothelium. The shallow implantation is thought to stem from the maternal immune system's response to the placenta. This theory emphasizes the role of the maternal immune system, and refers to evidence suggesting a lack of established immunological tolerance to paternal antigens from the fetus and its placenta. In some cases of pre-eclampsia it is thought that the mother lacks the receptors for the proteins the placenta is using to downregulate the maternal immune system's response to it. This view is also consistent with evidence showing many miscarriages to be an immunological disorder where the mother's immune system \"unleashes a destructive attack on the tissues of the developing fetus.\"  In many cases of the pre-eclampsia syndrome, however, the maternal response to the placenta appears to have allowed for normal implantation. It is possible that women with higher baseline levels of inflammation stemming from underlying conditions such as chronic hypertension or autoimmune disease may have less tolerance for the inflammatory burden of pregnancy.  So the above said, chronic hypertension is usually preventable, but sometimes with genetics you are more likely to have it, and with pregnancy you are more likely to develope Pregnancy Induced Hypertension. Which is a genetic factor.  Does this makes sense yet? Basically the link between genetic memory and abortions mean that someone who has abortions are more likely to carry the gene for miscarriage, but also pre-eclampsia which can be linked to genetic immunities, which are determined by factors in pregnancy like miscarriage, and the genetic anomolies factoring into why a fetus is unviable, even if perfectly healthy.  My main question is, can this be factual? and if so, why has it not been available to the public as common knowledge?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A general preconception workup would be advisable and your doctor could check for polyps or any infection or underlying problem but other than that, your fertility clinic who does the IVF should be able to advise you on any necessary preparation or treatment for the suspected endometrial problem.    Most miscarriages are due to unknown causes and many are thought to be the result of chromosomal problems with the embryo itself and it's nature's way of taking care of what is not progressing as it should.  In some cases a cause is determined or at least suspected and it sounds like this is the case for you where they felt the process of implantation was arrested due to inadequate uterine lining preparation.  This is a hormonal issue and perhaps they can help you with that next time.  But, the experts in the fertility clinic should be well versed on the options available to you.  Because of the high rate of miscarriage in all pregnancies, nobody can guarantee that you will not be disappointed again this way.  There is a certain amount of luck involved after you do everything possible.  Meanwhile, make sure you are at a healthy weight and eating a nutrient-rich diet supplemented with a good multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid.  If you smoke, quit.  If you drink alcohol, stop.  The same goes for recreational drugs.  Then, try to relax and reduce stress even though you are in a situation likely to create stress.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

It would just be too difficult to travel from outside the body, through the vagina, cervix, etc.  Chances are this is normal irregularity of your cycle.  Try not to stress too much since this can also delay your period and it becomes cyclic worry - stress over no period further delays period, which causes more stress.  I think it would be wise for you to consider what method of birth control might be best for you in case you have another close encounter.

I'm in the process of moving. I've been doing alot of lifting and helping moving, and carrying my daughter (1 yr and 10 mon, 37LBs) and I get dizzy alot and see spots but never quite faint. And have been having sever headaches but they havent said anything about my blood pressure being anything different than its normal. 105/70. I've gained 10 lbs since my last drs visit where i hadnt gained any in all my other visits. I'm just trying to be thurough and state things that may be irrelevant to me but could make sense of my situation for the person answering me.  My questions are. Should I find a new Dr? Should I go to the ER and make sure I and the baby are okay?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is difficult to advise you without knowing all the details about the lab work and physical findings, but microscopic blood in urine is not necessarily related to infection and has not been found to be an indicator of adverse pregnancy outcomes.  If there was infection it should be treated but otherwise you don't need to worry and sometimes the test shows a false positive.  Watching for additional symptoms and follow up testing would be advisable in most cases.  It is possible there was no infection at that point, even though you developed one later.  If you are feeling uneasy about the care you receive you should seek another opinion and you can change doctors at any time (unless you have a health plan that does not allow it without a referral from a primary care physician, for example).  It is important for you to have a trusting relationship with your provider and you should be comfortable asking any questions you have.  I would not recommend the ER for baby's health if you have other alternatives.  Aside from checking for a heart rate, the ER is somewhat limited in their ability to analyze your pregnancy concerns, you will incur needless expense and probably have to wait a while to be seen.  Also by the time you are halfway through your pregnancy, most hospitals and doctors advise you to go to the labor and delivery unit of the hospital directly, rather than going through the ER.  If you do not get satisfaction from your doctor's office, you can go to the unit directly and explain your concern to the nurses there.  Earlier in pregnancy the ER is used in cases such as miscarriage where the baby's survival is not possible outside the womb.  If you wish to change doctors, or even to see a certified nurse midwife, you should make an appointment right away and explain to the staff your stage of pregnancy and desire to find a new provider so you can be seen as soon as possible.  Take a list of your concerns with you so you won't forget anything.     Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I know this is an extremely rare condition but I am worried.  Right now I am 14 weeks 3 days pregnant.  I have a retroverted uterus normally.  Everywhere I've read says it should right itself atleast by 14 weeks.  Two weeks ago I started to have some difficulty urinating at night.  If my bladder gets even somewhat full I cannot urinate without a lot of work, walking around, warm bath that sort of thing gets it going but then only a little bit come out and it can take up to two hours to empty my bladder taking 5-10 minute breaks in between trips to the toilet.  Now it feels as though there is a lot of pressure on my bladder all the time, like I always have to pee and it gets worse at night when I'm trying to sleep.    The other thing that developed 2 weeks ago is a rectocele.  I have never had this problem before.  The bulge definately seemed to get bigger over the two weeks it's been there.  I don't know if this could be related but I know if my uterus is trapped it can cause rectal pressure which I imagine would make an existing rectocele worse.  I did go to my OB yesterday and he diagnosed the rectocele and gave me some things to do to try and alleviate it.  I'm supposed to call monday if I'm still having the bladder problems.  It is not a UTI, they did check my urine at my appt.  I'm trying really hard not to worry but I know that if it is an incarcerated uterus it is important to find it early.  Are there other things that could cause this problem?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Spotting is not a typical symptom of early pregnancy though some women do experience a scant, period-like bleed (pink or brownish usually) with implantation.  Hormonal fluctuation occurring with irregular pill use could result in such bleeding, and even the other symptoms.  The only way to know for sure is to take a pregnancy test.  These are accurate within a few days of when your period should begin.    If you are pregnant, spotting does occur in some women and it's just a matter of watchful waiting to see if a healthy pregnancy will be the result.  If you are not pregnant and wish to avoid pregnancy you need to find a method of birth control you will be able to use as directed so discuss the compliance problem with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It has been shown that quitting tobacco use in pregnancy definitely improves your chances of a completely healthy baby. The more you use in pregnancy, the greater your chances of problems so I would not worry.  While a small percentage of baby's are born with birth defects no matter what you do, use of tobacco in very early pregnancy followed by abstinence will almost completely eliminate any additional risk.  Congratulations on quitting.  Sometimes pregnancy (worrying about the life you carry; not just your own desires) is just the impetus you need to make such a lasting change.  For your baby's long-term health, as well as yours, I hope you will continue to be tobacco-free after the baby's birth.  Besides the direct health benefits you are an important role-model for your child.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I have had an opiate addiction for years and I have been trying to ween myself off but I'm having a hard time.  I've been to a rehab facility which didn't really help, I went through serious withdrawals and even months later could not sleep at all without tylenol pm.  When I was pregnant last year (miscarried) they said that I shouldn't get off them cold turkey or I would probably lose the baby so I should wait until I was in the third trimester.  A friend of mine with opiate addiction took 1 suboxone in pieces over 3 days and didn't have any withdrawals and hasn't taken any opiates since. Will this be safe for me to take with the baby?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is no riskier than the addiction and if it helps you get off the opiates, it is much better than continuing as yo have.  We know that the use of opiates throughout the pregnancy is not good and your only other alternatives are 1) cold-turkey, which does come with risks as you have mentioned and 2) using methadone or suboxone.  So, given the alternatives, this is your best choice.  Talk to your doctor about it.  Good luck with this.  Hopefully the needs of the baby will help you overcome the habit.  Sometimes you need something like this to help you get the perspective you need.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Babymaking is a numbers game so you must be patient.  Even if you do everything according to the fertility advice, you only have about a 25-30% chance of conceiving in any cycle.  It is considered normal for it to take up to a year (sometimes longer) to become pregnant while you are \"trying.\"  Of course in some women it works the first month, but this is not typical.    To improve your chances, have intercourse often during your fertile period (the five days leading up to ovulation). Daily or every other day is good rate and if you continue to lie down for about 5 minutes after having sex, this will help reduce the effects of gravity.  Sperm travel quickly and can live inside a woman for up to 3 days and the woman's fertile cervical mucus present in the few days leading up to ovulation creates the perfect environment.  This gives a small window of opportunity but with millions of sperm present, it can happen at any time during that period so having sex a day or two prior to ovulation is ideal.     Avoid artificial lubricants, vegetable oils, and glycerin, douching and vaginal sprays which could affect the pH of the vagina.  Try to keep sex fun and spontaneous - not a chore.  This helps the emotional climate.  Don't forget to take a daily multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg NOW.  Avoid bad habits such as smoking, alcohol and drugs and eat sensibly to increase your chances of a healthy pregnancy and reduce the risk of birth defects, premature birth and miscarriage.    Good luck.\n\n",

I am approx. 5 weeks late, did 3 home pregnancy test which were all negative (last one approx. 2 weeks ago). I came into see the doctor who did a blood test she said 1st one was inconclusive however the second gave a very weak positive. I had an U/S the following day (yesterday) which did not show anything. I still have not heard from my doctor yet, but am wondering if you think I am a prime suspect for an extopic pregnancy. I have no pain at all. My breasts were extremely tender however are just slightly now. I have no morning sickness. I had a dripping nosebleed the other day which is not normal for me. I'm finding my hair excessively greasy. (I'm not sure if any of this matters) I've had no spotting at all. I'm just wondering if it is possible that I could have missed a period and then got pregnant on the second cycle. Or is this really hopefull thinking. Typically I am regular with my cycles. Should I be feeling discomfort or having spotting by now if this is an ectopic pregnancy. Any information would be greatly appreciated. Oh ya I am 27 years old, trying to conceive my first child and have no history of problems with my tubes however did have an ovarion cyst rupture approx. 10 years ago.\n\n",

    "content": "Did you have an abdominal or endovaginal ultrasound?  If I am understanding the timing correctly, you used the home pregnancy tests about 3 weeks after your last menses.  Then the office test became positive at about 5 weeks after your last period.  If this is correct then here is what is likely going on:  The typical home pregnancy test does not become reliably positive until about 5 weeks after the last period (about a week after a woman would have had her next menses).  Thus, it is likely that even if you were pregnant, at 3 weeks the tests would have been negative.    If the ultrasound was abdominal it is more likely to miss an early pregnancy than a vaginal ultrasound.  Generally by about 7-8 weeks a pregnancy can be seen relatively easily to confirm an intrauterine or ectopic pregnancy.  So, it is still quite possible that you may have a healthy, intrauterine pregnancy.  However, if you develop any abdominal pain or bleeding you should be evaluated immediately to assess for possible ectopic pregnancy.  I think this is less likely than the previously outlined senario; however, ectopic pregnancies can be quite dangerous so it is important to be evaluated if there is any concern.  Best wishes on starting your family.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand your desire for a girl, but the only sure way to guarantee this is with selective in vitro fertilization where the situation is controlled - very expensive high tech stuff!    It is not possible to conceive prior to ovulation.  Perhaps you mean that you should have sex during the five days prior to ovulation.  This would be correct because we can't be 100% sure of the exact day of ovulation, though tests can show pretty well.  Sperm can live for a time in the woman's body so having sex before ovulation can assure a supply of sperm available for the egg once it is released.  It is usually recommended that you have intercourse every other day during the fertile period, if possible.  That will increase your likelihood of pregnancy, not gender specific.  Most experts also recommend you lie in bed for about five minutes after having sex to help gravity - prevent loss of sperm by running to the bathroom before it gets a chance to make the trip to the egg.    Girl babies can tolerate a more acidic environment than boys, typically, so some people advocate eating a more acidic diet when trying to conceive a girl.  This can be complicated, however, as you try to determine pH of foods you eat.  You might check the library for Ashley Spencer's book, How to Choose the Gender of Your Baby  or Dr. Landrum Shettles' How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby.  But, keep in mind, there are no guarantees - just some hints for what might help swing the pendulum your way.    Here are some tips for trying to conceive a girl according to \"experts\" (or old wives?).  Foods to eat include chocolate, other sweets, fresh vegetables, and fish.  For sex, try having it in the afternoon, rather than at night.  Some believe the woman having orgasm first helps and her initiating is believed to also help the cause for a girl.  Legend also has it that even days of the month help.  I don't know about that but if you're doing the \"every other day thing\" why not?  If you want to explore all the possible ideas, have sex during the full moon and use the Chinese Gender Chart to help you decide when to conceive.   Any time you plan for pregnancy, you must be prepared for either gender and if anyone promises you anything else, it is a hoax.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, We do not know all the possible effects of using illegal narcotics.  There is not enough information here to know if there is a link but it could be.  There has been shown to be cases where the placenta detached from the uterus in cocaine users, but it is unknown what degree of exposure results in such damage and it does not occur in every case.  This problem sometimes happens even in healthy mothers without addiction.  Another concern is that drug users are often also smokers - another known risk in pregnancy.  The more exposures to harmful substances, the higher the risk becomes for the baby and mother.  Other potential harm includes birth defects, miscarriage and addicted babies. Certainly using the cocaine was risky in many respects and should be completely avoided in pregnancy.  I doubt anyone will ever be able to determine absolutely if the cocaine was responsible for the problem, but it is certainly possible.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Its true.  Each woman is individual and averages take into consideration those with shorter and those with longer cycles and phases.  Ovulation does typically occur exactly on day 14 - this is just the median based on a \"typical\" cycle.  It is estimated only about 20% of women actually ovulate on that day and the day of ovulation is what is significant in conception attempts.   In most women that will be between day 11 and day 21.  This also explains why an \"estimated due date\" is just that - estimated.  We don't know exactly when conception occurred in most cases.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They link in to national registries for information about effects on the fetus if any are known.  There are local organizations as well.  In Utah there is the Pregnancy Risk Line - a hotline for information.  Perhaps there is a similar program where you live.  You may try your local health department or environmental health program, which may be affiliated with the state health department.  Look under titles such as teratology services or information.  I'm sorry I can't be more helpful but it seems logical that she should limit her exposure as much as possible and consider getting a good respirator mask as well.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Also during the first 2 months before I had done a test I was going out and drinking a lot, smoking and taking large amounts of caffeine (energy drinks, pro plus and coffee) as I was tired from my busy lifestyle and unknowingly my pregnancy.

    "content": "Hello, It is very possible you did have a chemical pregnancy, which is simply an early miscarriage.  In the days before home pregnancy tests, most women were not even aware there had been a pregnancy at all, and the period just came.  We don't know exactly why these occur but assume it is related to either a chromosomal problem with the baby, inadequate hormones to sustain it, or problems with implantation and development.  They are VERY common and it is not likely they will affect your future pregnancies.  The negative behaviors you describe can contribute to pregnancy problems and loss but I could not say there was a direct relationship.  Avoiding such substances is always advised in pregnancy and pregnancy planning, just to be sure.  Best wishes for your future.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you started your birth control pills two weeks prior to this event or at the end of your last menstrual period, you should be safe.  The plan B is intended for after; not preventive but the hormones it contains are the same as those used in birth control pills with altered dosage.   Chances are that you will have protection based on the regular pill but extra protection is recommended at the start of the pill if you start it midcycle.  If you started at the end of a period it should be good from the beginning without backup.     I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Subsequent pregnancies can also result in pregnancy-induced high blood pressure but you are less likely to develop pre-eclampsia.  It can happen and given your history your doctor will probably monitor your blood pressure carefully just to be sure but I would not really worry too much about it.    Your pregnancy loss was likely unrelated and should not deter  you.  Again, it could happen again, but since you carried the next baby to term, there is no reason to think you won't be able to do that again.  Good luck and best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Usually this reading is done in succession to determine if the pregnancy is proceeding as it should.  Numbers double every couple of days and if they stay the same or drop off it could indicate an impending miscarriage.  The number alone does not mean that much, but along with the second blood draw, it can suggest a healthy pregnancy.  Stay tuned and good luck.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am 33 weeks +5 days pregnant and was diagnosed about 35 days ago with gestational diabetes and i was placed on a strict diet and monitored my blood sugar level at least 8 times a day.  My results have been great except in the mornings where recently the blood sugar level has been between 90-95 level.  So my questions is my doctor wants me to take insulin shots every night at 10pm, exactly 4 units of insulin with a .03 ml syringe.  Is this safe for me to take i am very worried that my level is not very high at 90-95 so should i take the insulin?  Suzi\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your doctor is the best person to consult about this but insulin will not hurt your baby and if it is needed, may help your baby by regulating your blood sugar.  However, many women are controlled without taking insulin so if you want a second opinion you could seek that.  Because of the lack of compliance with shots, oral medications which lower blood sugar are often effectively used instead.  If your gestational diabetes can be managed with diet, exercise and oral medication you might be able to avoid the insulin but you need to get this advice from a doctor who knows your particular case and you should not alter the treatment without the advice of a physician.    I hope you are meeting with a diabetic educator as well.  It is very important to maintain a good, stable blood sugar, primarily through food choices.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The reason for the category C designation is because medications are not tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women.  This does not mean they are not safe; just that we do not know by way of the usual testing with double blind studies, etc.  Therefore, the drug manufacturer labels it accordingly.  They can't claim safety without the FDA testing.  There are teratology organizations such as otispregnancy.org that track medications in pregnancy and are able to get a good idea if they are associated with any birth defect increase among babies born to mothers who have needed and taken the medications in pregnancy.  Many antidepressants have been used safely in pregnancy and no significant increase is noted in most of the medications.  Zoloft is frequently prescribed but it is usually recommended that you use what was working before pregnancy, since this is most likely to continue to be effective in pregnancy.  If the Zoloft works for you this is a good option.  There is a slight increase noted in babies transitioning to life outside the womb in about 1% of moms taking SSRI antidepressants (such as these) in the last month of pregnancy.  This is in most cases a transient effect but the baby is monitored closely if it does occur.  Your doctor is aware of your medication in pregnancy and the nursery can be alerted to watch for any subtle signs of transition difficulties.    Because of this and the slight increase some newborn issues, some moms opt to wean off the medication for the last month but depression is a known risk to the baby as well as the mom so it is important to get treatment when it is needed and we must always weight the known risks of depression with the potential slight risks of the medication.  At any rate, I would not expect to see any birth defects as a result of the medication.  Be sure to use other treatments for your anxiety and depression such as exercise (walk daily in the sun), good nutrition (a diet heavy in refined carbs and low in vegetables has been shown to be related to depression), and perhaps see a therapist for ideas to help you deal with the problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I recently went in for a check up with my gyno as I have lost 25 lbs on my own and finally had a period on my own again for the 1st time in about a yr. Another reason I made the appt is because I looked up PCOS on webmd.com to see what I could find out about it. Webmd.com says that untreated PCOS can cause diabetes. My Dr. told me that people who are diabetic are those that get PCOS...which is right? Webmd.com also says that getting it under control with metformin will help you avoid becoming diabetic. My gyno said it will make me pregnant and I should not take it yet if my husband and I don't want kids right away. We do want to wait a few months to a yr before getting pregnant but I also don't want to be diabetic at 21. So will metformin cause me to become pregnant? I know it'll help me lose more weight which will increase my chances but that should take time right? The most information I can get would be VERY MUCH APPRECIATED! Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Metformin is a very effective and safe medication for treating PCOS.  Some women become pregnant after taking it simply because they were unable to conceive due to the PCOS and getting treatment often results in normal follicular development.  However, it cannot make you get pregnant - only sexual intercourse will do that.  But, if you are sexually active and not wanting to conceive yet, you should use some method of birth control while taking the metformin.  Condoms are fine.    Recent studies have indicated that metformin alone is not a good solution for infertility in cases of PCOS, but it is still helpful for the problem and if additional help in conceiving is needed, an ovulation stimulator such as clomid is prescribed.  As I said, some women do conceive after starting the metformin and getting the PCOS under control but it is not believed to be primarily due the the effects of metformin.  Part of it is just luck in any conception (or lack of).  You are wise to be alert to possible risk factors for diabetes and I would recommend making any health changes prior to becoming pregnant in the future, including weight loss if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There are many reasons for a woman to miss a period since hormones are always fluctuating.  Most women miss a few here and there without being pregnant.  Even stress can stop a woman's period, as well as over-exercising and being severely underweight such as with anorexia nervosa.  It is not possible to become pregnant under the circumstances you describe.  Sperm really must be placed inside the vagina - usually deep.  Being a week late on her period she could take a pregnancy test for reassurance but based on what you report, it just would not happen.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok, so a little history first. I had my son at 41 weeks on March 24 2009, and at first breastfed him. He ended up getting thrush from a yeast infection that I got after having him and stopped breastfeeding. He was 2 months old about, probably closer to 3. I just stopped producing milk, I never produced a ton of milk in the first place, he was doing mostly formula after the first 2 weeks of breastfeeding. But it stopped without doing anything. I got checked out by my Dr. at 6 weeks to get my Mirena put in, and he says that it's strange to just stop but checked me to see any lumps. Then had me come back in, I believe it was 4 weeks after placing the Mirena...maybe 2, I don't really remember, and I had him check again and nothing. I still wasn't producing.                 So my son is 7 months old now and the past month or so I've felt like I got kicked in the chest, more in the sternum area not really towards my breasts at all. And 2 days ago my right breast started to ache like I was getting milk in to start producing again. I looked at my nipple (lt) and it started sucreting a clear substance that looked like Collestrum. And now it has been like a couple of drops whenever I look at them. It's not like so much that I have to wear a breast pad basically. Also when going to take a bath or taking off my bra, my nipples seem to be a purplish color before they are touched with anything. I was thinking about calling my doctor but thought that I might try this website first for some advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is most likely just some hormonal disruption but nipple discharge when not lactating can signify a problem with the pituitary gland (usually benign) so it doesn't hurt to check it out with your doctor if it continues.  The fact you have lactated in the past is more reassuring that this could just be some latent lactation occurring now due to the hormonal fluctuation.  I would not be overly alarmed but pain is not normal and often signifies a need for follow-up.  It is possible you still have some milk in there and perhaps a clogged milk duct or infection is causing your pain.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have read a great deal of conflicting information about the vaginal bleeding associated with the implantation of a fertilized egg after conception. A friend of mine is very concerned after five days of bleeding which is more significant than spotting, but not quite as heavy as the peek days of a period, nor is the fluid the same consistency as a period. This bleeding started the day after a sexual encounter and I've read that implantation bleeding begins a few days after conception. She has just recently started taking birth control again after several years off it. She has not yet finished her first month on it in this new cycle of pills, so they would not be effective yet. She is a smoker, which I have read can contribute to similar bleeding while one is taking birth control pills. When she was on birth control in the past, she did not experience breakthrough bleeding and was a smoker at the time as well. She intends to take a pregnancy test, but must wait a while longer for accurate results. I suppose my question is this: how likely is it that implantation bleeding would occur the day after conception, and does this sound like breakthrough bleeding, or pregnancy? Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy.  Of course you will have some additional challenges with this condition but it will not do harm to the baby.   You will probably need some extra care from your health care providers and perhaps physical therapy and pain medication.  The ibuprofen is not likely to cause a problem with the baby.  Even though the pain medication of choice is acetaminophen, it is partly related to the blood thinning qualities of other analgesics and not so much due to damage it may cause the baby.    Anything you take in pregnancy should be monitored closely by your physician but there will be options for you as well as non-pharmaceutical treatments or even alternative therapy such as accupuncture.  Work with your OB to make a plan for handling this complication in pregnancy.  Hopefully you will be able to manage the pain but you may have some ongoing activity restriction to protect your back as the pregnancy progresses.  Your physical therapist may be able to give you exercise suggestions to help strengthen your back as well.  Good luck with this painful condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no way to know if the sperm will be affected.  Of course avoiding drug use is the safest course, there is no definite period of time we can determine to be completely safe.  On the other hand, most of the time the sperm is not affected and normal conception and pregnancy occurs in spite of this.  It's luck of the draw.    It is possible to have trouble conceiving due to the cocaine's effect on sperm motility and fertilization.  It is also possible it could result in miscarriage.  Again, there is no way to predict and I am not aware of any known safe period after use of such narcotics.  Even more concerning for me would be taking on the responsibility of fatherhood while having a substance abuse problem.  The longer-term consequences are more likely to be a problem than the actual conception.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My LMP was Sept 19, 2009. I had a positive pregnancy test on October 23rd & 24th. My periods are very regular. On October 28th I started bleeding heavily and cramping for a good 4 days, with very dark brown blood on the fifth day. I new I was miscarrying. I went in for blood work on that day of the first bleed and my levels were 35 then that friday they were 39. Then I went in this Monday the 2nd and they were 56. On tuesday I finally got to see my Ob/gyn she did a vaginal ultrasound and everything looks ok no bleeding or sac, ovaries looked clear etc. So it seems it was a very early miscarriage. She wants me to continue on Monday with another HCG level blood work taken to make sure it goes down.  My question is~ #1~why did these go up after the bleeding has ended. Is this normal? She was not concerned but said she wants to see the levels go to 0. And #2~ could i have an ectopic preganncy etc even if i feel great? I guess i am worried about this level leading into something serious? Please..What are your thoughts? Thank you.\n\n",

You might try taking it easy for a few days to see if things settle down.  When you do have intercourse, be sure you have plenty of lubrication and don't go too fast with the heavy thrusting.

    "content": "Hello, Are you breastfeeding?  If so, missing periods is very normal.  Pregnancy is possible, though quite unusual, since the blood test is very sensitive.  However, hormones are funny things and each woman is different.  To complicate things further the same hormonal disruption that might be stopping your periods could be responsible for the symptoms - aside from pregnancy concerns.  You should be able to just wait it out a while to see if things are just getting regulated again after giving birth but if the symptoms are bothersome, there are other ways to determine pregnancy such as viability ultrasonography.    Thyroid levels should also be checked if this continues and you are not breastfeeding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, About 50% of the adult population has already had this infection from childhood and are therefore immune to it as adults.  You can have the level checked by your doctor to know for sure.  Also if  you use good handwashing in your home, chances are you will avoid it anyway.  There is no preventive medication for this.  It spreads rapidly in children because they often are not diligent in their hygiene and handwashing at school, etc. and are not yet immune.    You should discuss this concern with your OB at your next checkup.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be impossible to say at this point because all women do not ovulate at the usual time.  There are wide variations and we just take 14 as an average day of the cycle for ovulation.  This is how due dates are calculated and day 14 is determined by her menstrual period.  Was she on her period at the time you had intercourse?    Estimates are somewhat inaccurate and she may get another date based on an ultrasound exam.  These are often more accurate when done fairly early in the pregnancy.  The only sure way to know is with a paternity test after the birth of the baby.    Do you have questions about her fidelity other than this date in question?  Perhaps you just need to talk about it.  Show interest in the pregnancy and share the online sites you were exploring.  Tell her you wondered about the dates and ask what she thinks about it.  I would ask her when the last menstrual period was, which is usually used to calculate due date.  This might help to open the door to conversation.  Trust is an important element in a relationship.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is important for you to know that estimates of baby's weight at this point can be off by two pounds either way.  I have seen women get earlier c-sections due to such estimates only to deliver a 6 lb. late preterm baby.  Since you are having a c-section anyway, as opposed to a VBAC, you should definitely wait.    There is a huge increase in baby's needing to go to the NICU (Newborn ICU) due to early planned c-sections.  I know you are uncomfortable but it is best for the baby to deliver as close to your 40 week gestation as possible and having a baby in NICU is no picnic - to say nothing of the increased cost, difficulty with breastfeeding and disruption to your lives.    New guidelines are recommending NO c-sections or inductions before 39 completed weeks unless the baby or mother's health is in danger.  Some hospitals have adopted this policy and the doctor cannot move the date up.  Your scheduled date is perfect.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course I can't tell you what the doctor was seeing or thinking but as for scar tissue and suturing issues, sometimes they are able to remove some excess scar tissue and suture the healthy muscle together in a cleaner repair.  I don't think it is anything to be alarmed about but don't be afraid to ask the doctor to explain what you saw and heard.  Sometimes medical jargon can really puzzle non-medical people.  Old incisions and adhesions can sometimes be a bit overgrown and during a surgical procedure they are able to correct these things.  If your wife has a follow up appointment, go with her and discuss your questions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Periods in young women are often very erratic but this is considered normal.  You can do a pregnancy test at home a few days after you would expect your period.    In the meantime, you might consider a method of birth control that would be acceptable to you so you don't have to worry so much.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course only your doctor can tell you what she saw that caused concern.  You should  be able to ask for more of an explanation.  It could be there was some indication of a tumor, such as a fibroid that might need to be treated but at least evaluated.  This does not necessarily mean anything bad, like cancer, but getting reassurance about it makes sense.  The scan will give more information and she may be waiting for that to talk about it because she really doesn't know at this point.  Try to be patient while you wait for the scan.  I know that is not easy but worrying will not help either.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She said she could see some calcification appearing on the placenta. She also mention tat it looks like there is less fluid on the inside. When i asked if this would affect the baby she didn't say anything, she just told me to sleep on my left, monitor the fetal movement and come back in 3 weeks. Ive been so worried.

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes this happens and nobody knows why.  Monitoring is the best you can do, just as your doctor said.  I'm sure she will evaluate the fluid and placenta again at that point and determine if it seems to be getting worse, remains the same, or seems better.  Hopefully you will be able to carry your baby to a safe place in pregnancy, but sometimes the risk inside becomes greater than the risk outside the uterus with the help of technology.  Usually this is not as good as mom but sometimes it's better if the baby's nutrient supply is not working right.  Nobody wants a premature baby because of the risks involved but sometimes that is the only alternative.    I know you are worried but try to relax as much as possible so you can reduce your stress hormones.  It sounds like you are in good care so continue as your doctor has asked.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Afternoon,  I have 1 copy of Factor V and 2 copies of MTHFR (A). I haven't had a blood clot my entire life. We have been trying to conceive and I was put on 60mg Lovenox at the start of ovulation and until my next menstrual or continue throughout pregnancy. Well, I ended having two early miscarriages while on the Lovenox. I felt horrible while on Lovenox. My stomach was so full that when I walked my stomach would 'slosh' around and my pants didn't even fit. I cried because it made me feel so horrible. Well, after the second miscarriage we got pregnant again, but I did not do the shots that time because we were to wait a month after the miscarriage. I am still NOT taking Lovenox and I am now just over 11 weeks with no issues, all labs have been \"perfect\" and the heartbeat is in the 160's. I am taking folic acid and baby aspirin every day.   Question: Is it really necessary for me to be on Lovenox when I have never had a blood clot before and everything is fine? I have been told that it's better safe than sorry, and I did that in the beginning and ended with two miscarriages. I have tried to find statistics on Lovenox results while pregnant, miscarriages and healthy pregnancies, but I haven't found anything. I have a really STRONG gut feeling that I do not need to be taking the Lovenox.  Thank you so much for your time!   Sincerely,  mmm07\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In prescribing the Lovenox I'm sure your doctor is trying to be as sure as possible that you won't develop a dangerous clot that could put the baby in danger.  You do get some anti-clotting effect from the baby aspirin and it's possible that is all you need.  There is no way to be sure, even with the Lovenox (as you have learned).  Medications must always be evaluated by weighing risks and benefits.  If your side effects are making it not worth it to take the medication and your gut feeling is that you don't need it, that may be your answer.  Informed consent is the important thing.  You know the risks and benefits and decide what is best.  Nobody can predict one way or another, but many mothers do have successful pregnancies despite such factors, with or without this medication.  You have to do what feels right for you and recognize the risks that are inherent with your condition, then hope for the best.  Good luck.\n\n",

They are not round ligament cramps as I have been having those off and on for the last 2 weeks and know how they feel (like localized menstural cramps).  Every 3-4 days I have an excruciating cramp that runs from hip to hip in a slightly downward arc.  It feels almost like I have been cut open. I find it helpful to breathe heavily through the cramp which has me doubled over and incapable of doing anything else. After 30 seconds to a minute the cramp alleviates completely with no signs of achiness or abnormality.  The first time it happened, I thought for sure I was miscarrying, but I have had no spotting or unusual discharge and my pregnancy symptoms have continued.  Should I be concerned and what exactly is going on??\n\n",

Cramping sensations can originate from any of these.  If it is just occasional and not continuous, I doubt it is serious but early pregnancy pain can be a symptom of ectopic pregnancy so pain should not be ignored.  If it worsens or lasts longer you should see the doctor.  Best wishes for a healthy pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since we do not study medications in large groups of pregnant women for the obvious reasons, we do not have good information about the problems with them.  However, after a large number of women have used the medication because it was needed for her health, they can determine with pretty good accuracy that it appears to be safe, or not.  Starting this late in your pregnancy, this seems like a good course.  We always worry about birth defects since in the general population we get about 3-5% of all babies with some form of significant birth defect and we usually do not know why.  But most defects happen in the early developmental stages of pregnancy.  At this point your babies are \"finishing\" and growing, developing lungs to breathe, fat to maintain body temperature and brain growth.  But organs are complete and so you would not get that type of defect at this stage.  Whenever medication is given to a pregnant patient, the risks and benefits are weighed.  If the risk of not using it is greater than the potential (not proven) risk of taking it, then it is usually prescribed.  I believe your doctors are well-qualified to advise you as to the best course of action and I'm happy to hear you are seeing a hematologist as well as your OB.  Good luck with the upcoming delivery.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I had unprotected sex some months ago, i don't remember exactly when because i have some short term memory loss due to a fall! It was around 6 to 8 months ago though. I am overweight! considered obese by my doctors! I understand that it is possible to be pregnant and not know it! I watch the show \" I didn't know I was Pregnant \" alot, mostly for information!  anyways My periods the last several months have been extremely light to vertually non-existant. my periods usually last 3-4 days and no longer. but lately they have been lasting only 3 days or less and have been extremely light for me! Also my periods have been coming at irregular itervuls. My periods have been very precise since i was 14, i had my first period at 9! i have also had alot of nausea! in the last few months. mostly later in the day, it feels like a brick of nausea in the middle of my stomach and if i lay on my back it only gets so much worse! however if i lay on my right side it goes away completely! i get to the point of not being hungary t all. I have also been having high blood pressure in the last month, it has averaged at 150/112 i take it at home 2 to 3 times a day and it rarely goes below 150/95. it is not in the normal range! i have had no problems with my BP before now! i get very dizzy, and when i stand i either faint or come very close! my breasts are tender and have grown a cup size! my stomach is also tender and i cannot wear anything on it or i get very nauseated. I have also been having heartburn alot, i do have gerd but i am on meds for it and it was well controlled until a few weeks ago, i have not been eating anything to aggrivate it at all! sometimes i get what feels like cold heartburn! like ice coming up instead of fire! I have also been feeling unusual movements in my abdomen, some sharp some dull and some very eratic! my stomach is not abnormally protruding but when i gain weight it is mostly in my abdominal region.I am also on some pretty heavy pain meds formy headaches. and i also take Risperadal formy anxiety/depression, i have for a while now, the dosage is very small .5mg in the morning and half of that at night. if i am pregnant how could this effect my baby? I have looked online and alot of my symptoms indicate preeclampsia! this worries me alot! i took a pregnancy test at my doctors office back when i first thought i was pregnant it was 5 days after intercourse and one i took several days later came up negative. i realise it was probably too soon to test. but i have not seen any reason to test again until now. the tests are still negative!  should i get an ultrasound or a sonogram? is there a way to tell without seeing the doc? could there be something else wrong here?    any answers will be most helpful, Sammy ^_^\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, High blood pressure is a serious condition so you need to see a doctor right away.  When you explain your history, a pregnancy test can be done to be sure.  The blood tests are more sensitive, but the urine tests are quite accurate as well so if you have had consistent negative testing, it is unlikely you are pregnant.  Clearly, if you were pregnant you would be far enough along that you would most likely test positive by now.  You need treatment for your symptoms and so a general exam is warranted.  Please do not delay as high blood pressure can lead to serious problems and even stroke.  You also want to be sure your medication for GERD is working well so you don't do damage to your esophagus.  This is another reason to see your health care provider.  The abdomen holds lots of organs so it can be challenging to find the cause of particular symptoms.  Risperdil is not recommended in pregnancy but I am not aware of any specific related birth defect increase among those who have needed it in pregnancy.  If you are pregnant by chance, discuss this with your provider.  Even in cases where there is increased risk from a drug exposure, it does not occur in all pregnancies.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a good possibility that her symptoms are unrelated to pregnancy, but due to the fall.  She should be checked by a doctor.    Early miscarriages are generally not caused by physical trauma unless it is very serious.  The fetus is well-protected.  However, miscarriage is quite common and usually due to causes you cannot control such as chromosomal abnormality, failure of the baby to develop properly, etc.  It is nature's way of taking care of such things.  Time will tell if she is suffering miscarriage, but she needs to find the source of her pain.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "So I have just found out that my wife is pregnant.    She is about 1 1/2 - 2 months pregnant and it was a surprise to us with her being on the pill.  She has had some back problems and has been on some medication for her back pain (tramadol and flexarol) and I am wondering if her having been on these medications in the first 1 1/2 - 2 months would have any effects.  Any help would be nice.  She has stopped using the medications at the moment and is in lots of back pain obviously.  This sounds like a very painful pregnancy and I am concerned with our baby.  Thanks for any responses.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Generally, early use of these medications is not associated with any increased risk of birth defects.  Of course your wife would be wise to try to find other alternatives to treat her pain such as hypnosis, heat and cold therapy, physical therapy, etc. that would be safer and even improve the benefits of the medication.  Often the obstetrician can help her to eventually wean off the painkillers especially by the time of delivery.    Some women with back problems also have less effectiveness with the epidural anesthesia so learning methods of non-medicated pain relief can help her in case she needs to rely on it.  It is helpful for ALL childbearing women, if only as a supplement to other pain relievers.  We don't test drugs specifically on pregnant women so much of the information we have is anecdotal.  Usually the concern with these drugs is the potential for the baby to have some withdrawal at the time of birth if the mother uses them near that time.  Tramadol has a lower dependency rate than other similar medications.    Animal studies suggest Flexeril is also probably safe for pregnant women.  Both drugs are given a category B rating.  The U.S. Food and Drug Administration uses a pregnancy category system to classify the possible risks to a fetus when a specific medicine is taken during pregnancy. Pregnancy Category B is given to medicines that have not been studied in pregnant humans, but do not appear to cause harm to the fetus in animal studies.  Good luck with the pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A few glasses of wine is pretty minimal and I would not worry about it.  While we don't know exactly how much alcohol a pregnant mom can safely consume, the wise course is to avoid it.  It is suspected that binge drinking, heavy or regular drinking would be most risky.  In addition each woman probably varies in the tolerable amount.  Just try to avoid it for the rest of the pregnancy to avoid risk of cumulative damage due to excessive amounts.    There is no data to support problems from this kind of limited exposure and there have certainly been plenty of pregnancies that resulted from heavy drinking episodes or celebratory, limited alcohol use.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Generally the doctor who performs the vasectomy recommends a follow up visit after a few weeks to be sure no sperm is getting through.  This verifies the success of the procedure.  Assuming he had this check and it was negative for sperm, he will not be able to impregnate you unless a successful reversal was done.  Reattachment could happen but it would be extremely rare for the man to be fertile following this since the tube would likely be smaller than it was previously.  This is considered a permanent means of sterilization and is very reliable.  Early failure (soon after the procedure) is usually due to some sperm still being present from before the vasectomy.  It can take in excess of 16 weeks to be \"all clear.\"    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know you are tired of being pregnant but every day closer to 39-40 weeks is that much better for your baby's health.    The good news is that your body is already doing some of the work since you are dilating.  It's great when you can \"labor\" while living your normal life and half the work may be done before you even have to go to the hospital.  But, it is impossible to say how long it will be before your body goes into active labor.  Some women are dilated a few centimeters for a couple of weeks; others a day or two.    Just be alert to signs of active labor.  If your water should break or leak, if you have regular tightening of the uterus that you can track for a while or if you get a feeling of uneasiness, strong lower back pain or other differences in how you feel.  Since you know you have begun to dilate, I would recommend no delay in going to the hospital once you're pretty sure something is happening.  I must put in a plug for breastfeeding too.  It is absolutely essential for babies to get this wonderful immune-boosting nutrition that is perfect for your baby.  Preferably you will breastfeed for a full year, but at least 6 months exclusively if possible for the best benefit to both you and your baby.  If you haven't considered doing this, keep open-minded about it and give it a 30 day try.  You will probably find it very satisfying, a wonderful bonding time, and inexpensive - besides being the best food for human babies!  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pregnancy is measured in weeks and days beginning with the last menstrual period, approximately two weeks before conception occurs.  This is because conception date actually varies and for convenience for dating a pregnancy, we use the firmer date of period onset rather than the nebulous date of conception.  When the doctor says you are 8 weeks along, that means about 6 weeks since the baby was conceived.  I know it is confusing, but I think this is the discrepancy you are concerned about.  Also, there is always the possibility you ovulated later (or earlier) and that will alter the measurements for dates.  Ultrasound dating is considered the most accurate.  I'm sure as you go along, the baby will grow as it should so try to relax and enjoy your pregnancy, take care of yourself by eating healthy foods, exercising, resting, avoiding bad habits, using your seat belt and drinking water.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The third child is very likely to \"show\" much sooner and you look much larger than with your previous pregnancies, just because the muscles are not as firm.  I assume you have been to your doctor by now and a heart beat has been detected.  Usually the practitioner can detect a second if it is present.  Not always, of course, but you would also be measured and monitored so if things were looking suspicious that way you would probably be scheduled for an earlier ultrasound to verify one baby vs multiples.  That's really the only way to verify for sure.  At the least you should find out at your mid-pregnancy routine ultrasound exam, so try to be patient.  Good luck with the pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, According to the American College of Radiology, \"no single diagnostic x-ray has a radiation dose significant enough to cause adverse affects in a developing embryo or fetus.\" However, as a general rule, CAT scans are only recommended during pregnancy when the benefits of the scan clearly outweigh the potential risk.    If there is a life threatening emergency for which a scan is needed for diagnostic purposes, the benefit would outweigh any potential risk.  If it is a minor concern, it is best to be certain she is not pregnant, just to be on the safe side.  We try to limit exposures as much as possible in pregnancy so if it is not really needed, we avoid it.    Missing five pills does put her at risk for pregnancy but other factors are also involved such as when you had sexual intercourse, when she ovulated and if all conditions were favorable for a developing and implanting embryo.  Pregnancy is a risk with missed pills, but not a sure thing.  In fact, luck of the draw indicates many women \"trying\" to become pregnant and using no birth control method still do not become pregnant sometimes for several months.    It would be wise to wait and see if her period starts, then get the scan.  If it doesn't, she should take a pregnancy test.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy!    There is no reason to avoid intercourse during pregnancy and throughout the full course unless you develop complications such as a full placenta previa (where the placenta covers the cervix and you may experience bleeding) or if your water were to break or other complications that would require pelvic rest.  This would only be if your doctor found a problem and needed to restrict such activity.  In most women, intercourse is enjoyed throughout, right up to the time of labor.  Travel is also fine, even by air, unless you have complications such as threatened preterm labor.  Usually the doctors recommend you avoid travel in the last month, if it is a long flight.  But, in pressurized modern jets, travel by plane is approved.  If you take a long flight it's good to get up and move around at times since you may be more prone to develop blood clots when pregnant and staying in one sitting position can put you at greater risk for blood to pool that way.  Best wishes for a healthy pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been on birth control for 12 years, same brand, period on the same day same time like clockwork each month. I decided almost 2 months ago that I was going to switch to Seasonique bc I don't have an attachment to my period. I was supposed to have started the old pack that Friday, but my Rx was out, so they wouldnt give it to me, and my appt wasnt until monday. So I missed days 1-4 of the pills. Started the Seasonique that monday of my appt. Everything has been great. No spotting, breakthrough, nothing. Like everything was the same. Well 2 weeks into it I started having feelings in my abdomen. They have since become more bothersome than anything, like gas/bloating bubbles traveling in the same spot over and over again. Bowels are fine btw. Its not like the cyst I got 3 years ago, nor like period pains. More just movement. I have had white discharge for  over a month now, its just like my ovulation dicharge, but instead for a couple of days, its been everyday. Annoying! I have begun to have more blurred vision and I pee all the time. OH, crap right? Well, I took a test this morning, which if I count from my last period in July (27th), a week before my Drs Appt, (aug 3rd)  I should be like 8 weeks tomorrow. But the test was negative. Any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, While you could be having some side effects from the pill, it could also be something totally unrelated.  Your abdomen contains many organs which can give you grief, GI upset, etc.  But, I would trust the negative HPT at this point and am very doubtful you are pregnant, if this is your concern.    You could have a urinary tract infection so you should have this checked with your health care provider.  If that is also  negative, you may just need to wait and see if it resolves on its own.  You could try simethicone (Gas-X, Mylanta, Mylicon, etc.) to see if you get relief at all.  It's an easy OTC to try.    I'm not sure what to say about the discharge unless it's just due to the hormonal change of the different birth control.  If so, it will probably settle down too.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Was the girl taking birth control pills and this is when she took the daily pill or are you referring to the plan B pill for emergency contraception?  If so, these are quite effective in preventing pregnancy and you should not worry.    Do you mean you worry about the alcohol?  This would not affect the birth control method if it is used properly without missing pills.  If the condom is the only method of birth control used, there could be concern if you are not referring to contraceptive pills here.  I would need more clarification for this question I think.

    "content": "Hello, I can understand your anxiety because pregnant women always worry about the well-being of their babies, and in about 3-5% of all babies, there are birth defects.  In most cases the cause is genetic and/or unknown.  I have been assured by a teratogenic agency that studies the effects of medications and other exposures on pregnant women to determine if there is increased risk of defects.   Very few medications have been shown to cause damage and I have been assured that topicals (creams and ointments) are the most benign of all.  It would take a lot of the medication slathered all over the body to make a difference. Usually ill effects are dose-dependent, meaning the effects become more concerning after longer term use or high-dose amounts.  This is why if you discontinue use of questionable meds once you know you are pregnant, your odds of damage are really quite low.   Testing of drugs is not done on pregnant or breastfeeding women because we don't take unnecessary risks with babies, but after many women have become pregnant while taking these drugs, we are able to track the results and the combined data helps us to determine safety.  So, while the packaging will always say not to use when pregnant or nursing, this does not mean it is dangerous; just that it is not tested in the usual way and so the manufacturers cannot claim safety.  Of course you don't want to take anything you don't need and it's all about risk/benefit ratio, but don't worry about this short-term use.   Enjoy the rest of your pregnancy and take all normal precautions, including doing kick counting to be sure your baby continues to be active, take your vitamins, eat well, walk daily, use your seatbelt, and attend your prenatal appointments.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is what the manufacturer says,  \"Do not use TAZORAC\u00ae Cream if you are pregnant, plan to become pregnant, or may become pregnant because of the potential harm to an unborn child. Talk with your doctor about effective birth control if you are a woman who is able to become pregnant.\"  Notice the word \"potential\" so you don't assume that every case results in birth defects.   Anything with vitamin A is considered potentially harmful and should be avoided.  This cream is chemically related to vitamin A.  The medications such as Accutane (taken orally) are known to cause harm to the baby.  Since we don't test on pregnant women, we take a cautious approach and discourage use in case enough were absorbed to be a problem.  There is a toll-free teratology organization (OTIS Pregnanty) that studies drugs and their potential impact on pregnancy and lactation.  I would encourage you to call them as they would be the most likely resource for this information and they have people to help you.  (866) 626-6847  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is likely this is breakthrough bleeding which can occur at any time, even if it is not typical for you.  If you missed taking some of your pills, pregnancy would be a possibility but if you have been faithful with them, chances are quite slim.  The medications you are taking (I assume the retin-A is topical) may not be recommended once you know you are pregnant but I would not worry excessively over what you would have taken before knowing of the pregnancy.  In most cases, stopping after pregnancy is confirmed is adequate.  Exceptions would be meds like Accutane (internal medicine for acne).  Implantation bleeding usually occurs 6 to 12 days after ovulation and fertilization.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had my baby girl almost 8 weeks ago. Sadly I had to be restitched and it's been 5 weeks after restitching. Immediately after my restitching I had tightening feelings in my area my entire area was in pain and seriously tightened. These feelings continued for a couple of weeks when ever I get up from my bed. Now I don't have these tightening feelings on constant basis but whenever I contract my pelvic floor or with the movement of pelvic floor during urination. It's like my entire pubic area i.e. labia major and minor tightens for a second. Tightening starts from the vaginal opening and move up towards the top of labia major. I didn't have these feelings after the first episiotomy. I am scared and don't want to go to the doctor and have another surgery. It doesn't always happen, only occasionally. What is this? I just know that I don\u2019t feel normal down there, sometimes these tightening sensations, sometimes needle prick sensations inside my vagina. Is it a failed attempt of repairing vaginal muscles? What should I do? I don\u2019t want another surgery. Will these feelings go away with time? Help please I am very depressed and confused.  sincerely Ritu\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have heard some women complain of pain from an episiotomy lasting as long as a year but this is rare.  Chances are you are just having a prolonged healing period but you should bring it to the attention of your delivery doctor so you can be checked to be sure there is nothing wrong.  Again, this would be rare, but it's best to find out for sure.  I would not automatically assume additional surgery would be necessary.  People do experience pain very differently and the sensations you are experiencing may just be your body's nervous system getting back to normal.  Try not to worry too much about this, use lubricants when you have sex and if you find this painful you might try gentle stretching with olive oil and two fingers inserted inside.

    "title": "Re: Episiotomy complication",
    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy!  The recommendation is that you only take medications that your doctor advises in pregnancy.  There are very few drugs that are known to cause an increase in birth defects and the two you mention are not those.  However, since drugs are not studied in pregnant women like they are in others, we don't actually know for sure.   Therefore, it is usually a matter of weighing the risks and benefits to determine if the need for mom is greater than the potential (though unproven, harm to the baby.  Many drugs are used in pregnancy and appear to be safe but caution is always a good idea and taking only those that are really necessary is the best bet.    Please discuss this with your doctor.  Sometimes short-term use is OK, but long-term use could carry more risk.  If you are able to wean yourself off a bit now, while waiting to see your doctor it would probably be a good idea.  Your doctor may be fine with continued moderate use or may suggest an alternative.  Do be sure to take a daily multiple vitamin, eat healthy food, exercise, get your rest, use your seatbelt and attend your prenatal appointments.  All these have been shown to help you in pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It has been almost three years since I gave birth via C-section to my daughter.  My husband and I have been tryign for the last two years to get pregnant again.  My periods have always been a little irregular, but I've been charting regularly since we started trying to conceive.  My charts show that even though i have a long cycle it appears that I AM ovulating.  My Ob-gyn doesn't trust charts because he thinks that most people can't chart properly.  He finally put me on Clomid a couple month ago.  He told me to start taking Clomid on day 3.  Since my normal cycle is closer to 5 weeks I am wondering if forcing me to be on a four week cycle is good.  Some items to consider.  Before he put me on Clomid (as well as cenestin) my charts were showing that everything was out of wack even though I appeared to be ovulating.  i.e. my cervical fluid never showed up or was never of good quality, my temperature shift didn't match when my cervix was soft, etc.  These things seem to have been fixed by being on Clomid, but I'm still not pregnant.  However, my period seems to be abnormally short since I started taking clomid.  My fear is that by forcing my cycle to a shorter time frame it's not giving my body enough time to built up the wall of the uterus properly.  Am I completely off base here?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I know you worry about this but there is no way to know for sure if there might be any problem with this for the baby but since it is early and you have weaned yourself, the chances are very good that there will not be any ill effects. Cumulative effect of medications is one of the factors that increase risks.  At this point hopefully you will be able to rely on acetaminophen for pain and only cautiously use stronger pain meds under your doctor's orders.  I would not worry but would just do everything you can from this point on to have a healthy pregnancy.  Eat well, take your vitamins, exercise and use your seat belts.  Avoid alcohol and tobacco too.  Chances are very good that your baby is fine from this limited use and it has not been specifically associated with an increase in birth defects.  But, since there is much we don't know the recommendation is to avoid as many drugs as possible in pregnancy.  May your pregnancy go smoothly.  Best wishes.\n\n",

In most cases the flu will run its course without complications and you can get help with symptoms if you use pain/fever reducers (acetaminophen), cough medicines, get plenty of fluids, rest and isolation (as much as possible). If flu is confirmed, there are antiviral medications that can help if you get them soon enough to do some good (within 48 hours of the onset of illness).  Fever along with cold symptoms is an important symptom since other viral upper respiratory infections do not usually come with fever.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Iron occurs naturally in many foods and most prenatal vitamins contain iron as well since anemia is quite common in pregnancy.  This is because you have a much higher  blood volume and the red blood cells are decreased by proportion in the blood.  Supplementing is common in pregnancy and not considered teratogenic.  Most supplements for iron alone come later in pregnancy when the pre-pregnancy stores are becoming depleted, and in preparation for labor and delivery with the potential for blood loss at that time.    Routine iron supplementation is not needed for all pregnant women so usually the doctor relies on blood testing later in pregnancy to decide if it is needed, unless the woman has anemia prior to the pregnancy.  I have seen no evidence of increased birth defects among women who take this supplement at any time in the pregnancy.  Of course overdose is possible so ideally this is done with a doctor's recommendation only.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Your prenatal vitamin will contain some calcium and your body can only absorb so much at one time so if you add another supplement you should take it at a different time of day than you take the prenatal.

    "content": "Hello, Because you are pregnant, you should seek medical attention right away for any bleeding!  Otherwise bleeding after sex on a single occasion may be due to rough sex or dry vaginal wall, resulting in inflammation.  This would not usually be a cause for an emergency room visit unless it is heavy bleeding that does not stop.    There are causes that should be checked out including infection (STD, yeast or bacteria), cervical or vaginal polyps, tumors and endometriosis.  These causes could wait for an appointment but bleeding in pregnancy should be reported to your doctor right away.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry you are still having this problem.  While most miscarriages happen earlier, it is possible to miscarry at any point in the pregnancy if something goes wrong.  Often it is believed to be chromosomal and your body knows things can't progress normally so this is nature's way.   Other times it is a problem with implantation or placental development.  Later losses - second trimester - are sometimes associated with an incompetent cervix.    You definitely should see a doctor about this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 30year old woman in the 22nd week of my 5th pregnancy.  I have a history of preterm labor with my first and third pregnancies.  I have been experiencing projectile vomiting since yesterday, I have been having severe headaches for about 2 weeks now, and I have crippling backpain.  I have also been getting contractions now for about 5 days.  The contractions are not very painful as I am not doubling over in pain with them, but they are uncomfortable, and getting slightly worse.  I am not dehydrated I don't' think as I drink a minimum of at least three quarters of a gallon of water a day.  I contacted my doctor on monday about my headaches only and they told me that I am anemic, and to take and extra iron pill, to increase my water, and to get 2 servings of caffine a day.  I have tried laying on my side for the contractions, going pee frequently, and taking hot baths for my backpain.  My question is, are these things that I should call my doctor for, or should I wait it out until my next OB checkup.  That is on the 10th of Sept.  Thank you so much!!!  Tara\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Vomiting and headache can indicate an infection (viral or bacterial) such as influenza or kidney, etc.  It sounds like your doctor is suggesting the first line of treatment for preterm labor and assuming the vomiting is a transcient infection that will subside on its own.    If hydration is the problem, causing preterm contractions, the measures you are taking should help.  If contractions continue, it would be wise to be seen or at least to call your doctor.  I would request a consultation with the doctor; not his medical assistant only.  It is better to err on the side of safety.  If you do not get help from the doctor, and you continue to have contractions and/or back pain, you should go to the labor and delivery department of your hospital for evaluation of possible preterm labor which may be stopped if it doesn't progress too far.  If no sign of dilation is present you will have peace of mind.  It can be virtually impossible to determine real from false labor contractions without a medical evaluation and exam.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The doctor's were split between Zellweger's Syndrome and \"Idiopathic Congenital Chirrosis\", but there was a high probability that it was Zellweger's. As the only male heir in my family with the chance of passing on children, and I want to be a dad one day and to carry on my family name, what are the chances that children that I may have if I marry and decided to have children will suffer from this same syndrome? Is there any type of preventive care that I can take as a father? Thank you so much for your consideration. -- j.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is such a rare disorder there is not much known about it.  You could seek genetic counseling, often available in connection with University Hospitals and other researchi institutions when you are contemplating parenthood.    There is also an organization that deals with rare and \"orphan\" diseases.  You can read about them here:  http://www.rarediseases.org (look for the index on the left sidebar - alphabetical by disease).  They state that Zellweger spectrum disorders are inherited as autosomal recessive traits.  This means it appears only in those who have received two copies of the gene - one copy from each parent. The gene is on a nonsex chromosome. The parents are carriers who have only one copy of the gene and do not exhibit the trait because the gene is recessive to its normal counterpart gene.  If both parents are carriers, there is a 25% chance of a child inheriting both abnormal genes and, consequently, developing the disease. There is a 50% chance of a child inheriting only one abnormal gene and of being a carrier, like the parents, and there is a 25% chance of the child inheriting both normal genes.   Seeing a genetic specialist is only going to be helpful if you also have the mother-to-be involved since both of you would need to have this gene in order for it to appear in your offspring.  This kind of testing is limited in which genes are screened and may be expensive.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Good afternoon,  I delivered my son via c-section on May 10th.  I was in the hospital for 3 days and just as soon as I get home I notice that my discharge starts to have a very bad odor.  At this time I was still bleeding so I could not tell what color the discharge actually was.  I called my Dr who asked me to make an appointment.  At the appointment she did an exam and took a culture.  She stated it was an infection and prescribed me oral antibiotics.  I took the antibiotics as described and it seemed as though the odor and discharge went away.  A few days later it came back.  The results of the culture came back normal.  This time I could tell the discharge color as I had stopped bleeding.  The color is comparable to pus and the smell was similar to ammonia/bleach/rot.  It is not a heavy discharge, but I do have to wear a pantyliner throughout the day.   I then saw my Dr for my 6 week postpartum appointment on July 24th and she did another exam.  Her diagnosis this time was that my vagina did look like it had some type of irritation.  She then prescribed me some antibiotic ovules.  I proceeded to use the antibiotic ovules as described and was hopeful because the first night I used it the smell and discharge seemed to have stopped.  But low and behold after the 3 nights of use, it came back and is still present!  I am at my wits end and my Dr probably thinks I am delusional.  The smell is so unpleasant I am embarrassed to walk by people in fear that they can sniff me out.   I have never had this problem before. I figured no matter where or what the infection is, two rounds of antibiotics would have fought it off, but apparently not.  Could something have been left inside of me during my c-section that maybe is causing the discharge to continuously flow?  I plan to call the Dr again, but I figured I would get a second opinion before another attempt.  Please any advice will be appreciated.  Thank you for reading this lengthy post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, We certainly cannot rule out the possibility of something inside, though it is not common.  It is possible to have recurrent bacterial infections and to require additional antibiotics.  C-section deliveries are associated with more postpartum infections than are vaginal births.  Continue to communicate with your doctor.  This will not be her first case of a persistent infection with odor, I assure you.  Another culture might reveal yeast rather than bacteria and this would have a different treatment.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is core body temperature that we worry about in pregnancy.  We want it to remain below 100 degrees F.  The air temperature does not usually result in raising your body heat that much (as measured by rectal or ear thermometer).  Sitting in a hot tub can do that, potentially raising it to 102.2 in 10 to 20 minutes time.    It is important to replace fluids lost in sweating  (your body's efforts to reduce your body temperature) so sip constantly as well as drinking to thirst.  Make sure you have plenty of water with you.  Don't exercise in that heat since that would also raise your body temperature.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course you will have a bit of discomfort going to a different climate, but you should be fine, even in pregnancy.  The core body temperature should remain under 100 degrees F most of the time.  This is not the temperature in the air but what your body registers by rectal or ear thermometer - the temperature of your internal organs.  In a hot tub your core temperature could raise to 102.2 in 10-20 minutes so we recommend you avoid these.  However, being in a hot place alone, with air around you, will not do this.    It is important for you to remain well-hydrated.  This is probably the biggest danger.  Your body will cool itself through perspiration and this water must be replaced.  Sip constantly, spritz your face to cool yourself don't exercise in this heat (further raising your temperature).  Best wishes.\n\n",

There is no magic number that is \"OK\" or \"not OK\" in this area.  But, if the baby seems to be deprived of adequate nutrients and oxygen due to cord problems or some other in-utero condition the doctor may determine that the baby will have a better chance at health if he/she is delivered early.  To a point, most babies are better off inside than outside to 30 or 40 weeks, but sometimes that's not the case and the baby must be delivered.   In this case we just give all the care we can and hope for the best.    This must be evaluated on an individual basis.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This alone would not be an indication for a c-section.  Your doctor would need to evaluate the complete and detailed history, ultrasound report and other concerns before assuming a c-section would be necessary.  It is major surgery and should only be used when the baby or mother's health dictates it.    The cause can be due to a chromosomal abnormality, placental insufficiency, cord problem such as might be caused by a clotting disorder, maternal infection, malnutrition or substance use.  It is difficult to say if your baby will have any permanent problem as a result of this measurement but  Some infants who have IUGR develop normally, while others have complications of the nervous system or intellectual problems such as learning disorders. If IUGR is related to a disease or a genetic defect, the future of the infant is related to the severity and the nature of that disorder so it could be serious, minimal, or no problems as the child grows.    Your doctor will probably follow up with another exam before deciding if the baby needs to be delivered early, as is sometimes necessary if the chances are that the baby will do better outside the womb than inside, because of inadequate blood supply.  Good luck and best wishes.  Please let us know how it goes with the delivery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a very reliable method of birth control with pregnancies occurring in less than 1% of users.  Because of this high success rate, you should not worry.  If you did find yourself to be pregnant, it is recommended that you have the implant removed but it is unlikely to contribute to any increase in birth defects since it is hormonal and works much like birth control pills, which have been shown to not cause these problems.  Since all methods of contraception except abstinence does have a degree of failure, it is always a concern for women who are in that small group.  But, after tracking many women in this situation, we are able to feel quite confident about this.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I have been searching high and low online for a straight answer to this question.  If a woman were to take benadryl 50mg daily throughout her entire pregnancy would her child end up with some kind of physical or mental defect?  I need to know because someday I woud like to have a child, and I need to take benadryl.  I take it everynight before bed for allergies, and sleep.  I cant go without it because I cant sleep without it.  I am very sure that someday when I do conceive if I went without benadryl and I didnt sleep for weeks it would be very harmful for me and the baby.  I have found online that Benadryl is a class B which means there have been no human trials done, but I found that a study was done on rats and rabbits, and their offspring turned out ok.  Its a very important question for me.  Also what kind of defects would one expect if benadryl was taken daily while pregnant?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is my understanding that Benadryl has not been associated with any increase in birth defects among mothers who take it in pregnancy.  The reason for the classification is because we NEVER test drugs in the usual way on pregnant women.  We can only evaluate after the fact and there are birth defects registries that track children and explore the prenatal history in an effort to find the cause.  If you become pregnant, you should discuss tihis with your doctor (or do it as part of a preconception visit).   There are other drugs that would probably work as well if the doctor didn't want you to use the Benadryl.    The truth is, very few drugs have actually been shown to cause birth defects.  Even so, caution is the wise course.  Most doctors urge pregnant patients to avoid any unnecessary medications while pregnant, since there is still much we don't know.   Best wishes\n\n",

He also told me about valarian which is a natural sleeping aid derived from a plant.  So, Im thinking I'll try it.  I recently tried melatonine, and it didnt work at all for me.  He said its useless, melatonin is made from ground up pig brain, and it wont work.  He told me also that benadryl will not be harmful to my future child.  He said its a cass B, and there is significant evedence showing it wont cause defects.  He also said class A shouldnt even exist because there is almost nothing in class A.  He said it would be worst if I took no benadryl and got NO sleep.  That would definitely harm the baby. He also told me to take prenatal vitamins before I get pregnant, and during my pregnancy.  Do you agree with his advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I absolutely agree.  Taking prenatal vitamins before pregnancy is one of the best things (and easiest) you can do to reduce your risk of serious birth defects such as spina bifida.  I also agree that the Benadryl is often used in pregnancy as well as other medications to aid sleep.  There is even less known about herbal, \"natural\" products because they are not tested like drugs - it is not required.    The classification of drugs for pregnancy is really not very helpful since testing is not done in the way it is for other medications.  The classification X is something to consider seriously because it is a likely cause of birth defects.  Accutane and thalidomide both fall in this category and should never be taken by a pregnant woman or even a sexually active non-pregnant woman who is not using reliable and consistent contraception.  It is true that you need your rest.  You should also make good food choices to include lots of vegetables and a nutritionally sound diet.  Extra fiber and water is also especially good in pregnancy when constipation is common. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Artisia, some other ways that this can occur is through having a previous miscarriage, etopic pregnancy, elective abortion, chorionic villus sampling, and amniocentesis. Do you think it's possible that you may have experienced a miscarriage before but was not aware of it? Some women can mistakingly confuse an early miscarriage for a heavy period. The initial lab test could've been an error. If not, this means you have become sensitized and your antibodies can cross the placenta and attack your baby's blood. They break down the fetus's red blood cells and produce anemia (the blood has a low number of red blood cells). This condition is called hemolytic disease or hemolytic anemia.  A mother who is Rh sensitized will be checked during her pregnancy to see if the fetus is developing the condition. The baby may be delivered on time, followed by a blood transfusion for the baby that will replace the diseased blood cells with healthy blood. For more severe cases, the baby may be delivered early or given transfusions while in the mother's uterus. I send best wishes of health to you and your baby.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The cervix tends to shift up if you are pregnant.  If the basal temperature remains high for 18 days after ovulation, it can be a possible indication of pregnancy.  In some cases there is another temperature rise in pregnancy around seven to ten days after ovulation but this is not a definitive sign of pregnancy.  It might be considered a screening, where it increases the odds of pregnancy and along with other signs can be helpful.  A home pregnancy test is really the best way to tell if you are pregnant.  These can be done as early as a week after conception and are quite reliable a few days to a week after your missed period.  I hope this answers your questions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The size of your cyst is still quite small and can usually be watched through pregnancy with monthly scans.  In some cases surgery is performed in the second trimester when anesthesia is less likely to affect the baby's development, though miscarriage is always a possible complication.  Doing anything early is really not an option.  Chances are it will be OK, but if it grows to be more than 5 cm there is a greater chance of torsion (twist).  I would recommend limited weight gain and sensible eating in your pregnancy to help reduce your risk.  A daily walk or other exercise such as swimming would also help.  Good luck with your pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 25 years old. I have been married for 2 years, and last month my husband and I became pregnant though we were not purposely trying. I did not realize I was pregnant until after I started having problems.  This is what happened:  On May 7th, I had a protein shake with a raw egg in it. Have never eaten raw eggs before, got the idea from a fitness forum I recently viewed. Later that evening I had some stomach cramping, but no diarrhea or nausea. At this time I had no idea that I was pregnant. The following day the cramping seemed to subside.  On May 9th, I drank another protein shake with raw egg in it. Cramping did not return until May 11th. Still no other symptoms of diarrhea and nausea or headache or fever. I think I was experiencing a little fatigue though.  The cramping got progressively worse until May 15th, when I went to a previously scheduled doctor's appointment. Complained of the cramps. A pregnancy test was done and came back positive.  May 16th-Spotting began. Pain immediately ended. Emergency room. First ultrasound done, and blood preg test. Was told something was not right b/c there was fluid in my abdomen. Doctors thought it was either ruptured ovarian cyst or tubal rupture. Empty sac was seen in uterus. May 17th- Fever, brown spotting. May 18th- First OB/GYN appointment. Was told that my preg hormone was dropping by half instead of doubling, and the pregnancy was failing. May 19th- began heavy (like menstrual) bleeding. Today (20th)- told that I was experiencing a miscarriage after 3-4 week uterine pregnancy.  My question: I did not have any symptoms or problems until after consuming the raw egg shakes. Did this cause the miscarriage?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry for your loss.  Unfortunately miscarriage is very common - some estimates are as high as 35% because many probably occur before the woman even knows she is pregnant.  This makes it hard to determine actual statistics.  In the vast majority of cases we never are able to determine the cause of the miscarriage.  It is believed that in most cases there is a chromosomal abnormality which prevents the proper development and implantation of the embryo.  Nature takes care of this through miscarriage.  In most cases the women go on to achieve healthy pregnancies next time when things work out better for the developing baby.    While it is not recommended that you eat raw, unpasteurized eggs, regardless of pregnancy because of the risk of salmonella infection, in pregnancy it is even more significant because theoretically, it could contribute to the risk.  However, considering the fact there was a sac without a growing embryo makes me think the cause was probably something different that prevented the normal growth, rather than infection causing the loss.

    "content": "My husband and I decided we did want one more child after all and made the decision to have my IUD removed.  This was done on Thursday 5-7-09.  I had the IUD in for just under 3 years. I had NO periods while on the IUD. Since we were wanting to have a child my doctor put me on Birth Control pills to hopefully regulate a period.  She recommended at least 1-2 months before I get pregnant anyways. By the time I got home from the doctors after having the IUD removed I started bleeding. I took my first fill friday morning and have continued every day and on time. I the bleeding is still heavy and I have alot of membrane type stuff coming with it.  During the day the bleeding is just slighly on the heavy side, but at night i put in a super tampon and by 2 am i am covered in blood.  I now wear a pad and use a tampon, and set an alarm for 1 am. Usually, not always, I have not went through everything. Then again by 5 am I am having to do this again.  Then it slows down once I am active and it feels like a normal period. I thought the pill would cause me not to bleed until the last week.  Is this something that I should make an appointment with my doctor or keep waiting it out to see if it stops? BTW today is Thursday 5-21-09.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm not sure why the oral contraceptives following removal of the IUD.  This is not standard procedure and one of the selling points on the IUD as contraception is that it is completely reversible with no delay in fertility and ability to become pregnant.  Periods do not have to be artificially regulated in order for you to conceive.  As you know, contraceptive pills prevent conception and sometimes it can delay fertility for a time.  There may be other factors here of which I am unaware.  But, manipulating hormones does affect periods and bleeding is one of the most common complaints.  You are correct that in most women there is only withdrawal bleeding between pill packs but every woman is different.  This may be a response to the removal of the IUD only and unrelated to the pill.  These changes in a woman's body with hormonal manipulation are difficult to predict.    Excessive bleeding is usually defined as soaking 1 pad or tampon per hour over several  hours.  You probably should call your doctor for suggestions.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If you take the pill religiously, as you said, your chances of pregnancy are extremely slight, even without the back up condom or plan B.  Adding emergency contraception would pretty much eliminate any lingering slight possibility.  However, these are powerful hormones and they notoriously mess up your cycle, so don't be alarmed about no period.  Take a pregnancy test if you want but I am quite confident the changes you have noticed are side effects from the hormones you took.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The conservative treatment, allowing your body to eventually evacuate the products of conception, is usually effective and safe but may take between two and six weeks to be completed.   Obviously, the risks associated with medications or a surgical  procedure with anesthesia are avoided.    Use of medication (misoprostol)usually completes the miscarriage within a few days - again bypassing any surgical risks, though medications often have side effects.    Many women opt for D&C to complete the process  quickly.  After several weeks without delivery there is a risk of infection, bleeding or other complications.  Your doctor should explain all the risks and benefits associated with this procedure so you can make an informed decision that is right for you.  Best wishes.                   =                                                                            ========================================================================lP)[\n\n",

I have been having a lot of pregnancy symptoms; My breast are bigger and leaking, I'm exhausted, I've had morning sickness-like nausea, my stomach is bigger to wear my pants don't fit right. And I'm super emotional, like crying for no reason. I feel just like I did for both of my pregnancies. I took a pregnancy test mid day last week and it was negative. So I took another first thing in the morning 2 days ago and it is still negative. Today before I went pee, I saw a string and my iud was out! I had cramps for 20 minutes but now I'm fine. Could a pregnancy have caused the mirena to come out? Or could it have been inserted wrong and that caused a pregnancy? I am really concerned. I don't have any pain or anything that would make me think it is tubal. But the negative test confuses me.  I don't know how far along I would be and it is a long weekend so my dr is closed. Any comments are appriciated. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Pregnancy would not be the cause of your IUD becoming dislodged but it does sometimes happen spontaneously and in a very small percentage of users, pregnancy does occur while the IUD is in place.    The negative pregnancy tests should reassure that you are probably not pregnant, but you may want to repeat the test in about a week to be sure.    The Mirena does emit hormones so some symptoms  you describe could be caused by the IUD and the changes due to the expulsion.    Of course you are also now vulnerable to pregnancy unless you get the IUD replaced or find an alternative contraception method.  If your symptoms continue you should see a doctor who can evaluate your hormone levels and overall health and consult with you for contraception.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would depend on the timing.  Once an egg is released, there is only a short time for fertilization to occur.  However, sperm can live a few days in a woman so if she had sex a few days before ovulation with one man and again at the time of ovulation with another, two eggs were released and each fertilized with different sperm, there is a possibility of this scenario you fear.    At this point you don't know if she is carrying one or two and if two, whether the babies are fraternal or identical.  You will need to wait for more information so try not to stress too much until you know more.    Obviously if she has identical twins, the embryo divided after fertilization by one sperm.  If the babies are fraternal the only way to definitely know would be through paternity testing after birth.    Good luck on this relationship.  I hope you are able to work things out for the benefit of all concerned.   Best wishes.\n\n",

The fact that you don't feel pregnant now may not be a good sign, but since bleeding and cramping are not happening, it would suggest the opposite.  It would take an ultrasound or an analysis of HCG levels over a few days to determine if you are still pregnant.    If you are not, you will need to monitor the miscarriage in case it is not complete and you need intervention.  So, you probably will need to see a doctor about this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sometimes this is an indication that you have been doing too much, especially strenuous activity.  Try taking it easy to see if things slow down.  There is no actual right amount of bleeding and as long as it is not heavy, I suspect it is hormonal adjustment.  If you still need to see your doctor for a follow up after surgery, talk to him/her about it then.  You are less likely to bleed if you are breastfeeding because it inhibits menses, usually for the duration of exclusive nursing.  I think it will eventually slow down but it's good to be in touch with your doctor about your healing process.  If you noticed a foul odor and/or fever, there could be infection but otherwise I would not worry.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Chromosomal abnormalities come into play and sometimes the embryo does not implant properly.  Chances are you will still be able to conceive and carry a child to term.  Best wishes in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think it is highly unlikely you are pregnant considering the details you have shared.  You are not likely to conceive while on your period, in the first place.  If he withdrew before ejaculation, this would further decrease the odds, though it is possible with pre-ejaculate containing sperm.  But along with the timing and the negative tests, it seems like the symptoms are more likely due to your pills which alter hormones and sometimes take a few months for your body to adjust.  These are relatively common side effects.  Best wishes.\n\n",

My question is does this combination affect the effectiveness of the pill.  My doctor didn't mention anything (not that she was with it anyway as suffering from hayfever) but when I picked up the prescription the chemist took me to one side and said I should be careful while on them and use a barrier method for the week of the antibiotics and for the following week to be safe.    At this point in my life if it happened then it wouldn't be a problem as we were thinking about me coming off pill in next 3-4 months to start trying.  I've alo looked up the online info for cerazette which doesn't mention antibiotics but the info on the antibiotic says it can affect birth control.  If anyone can shed a little more light on this that would be great.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The fear that antibiotics interfere with the effectiveness of oral contraceptives has been mostly sproven to be unfounded except in the case of Rifampin - a drug used to treat TB.  For a time it was believed this might translate to all antibiotics and caution was urged while further studies were conducted.  It seems there are other variables resulting in the pregnancies, such as people not taking their contraceptive pill while ill or just forgetting it.  Of course this makes the woman vulnerable to pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most women experience period irregularities at some point in their lives and it is especially common following a change in oral contraceptives.  You may not be ovulating so the hormones are not triggering a period.  There are other conditions such as thyroid or pituitary disorders that can cause this, as well as just hormonal fluctuation, a high rate of vigorous exercise or being underweight.  If this continues, I would see a doctor for a workup to rule out such problems.  There may be no evident cause still, but it is important to find out in case there is something going on that might be easily corrected, such as with hormone treatment.  Best wishes\n\n",

The strange thing about this is, my cycle days are getting shorter and my \"periods\" are getting lighter, and I've started spotting, and getting brown blood and my cycles don't normally do that. I went to the clinic to test for pregnancy and the nurse did a urine test and it came back Neg, but after I explain my symptoms of whats been going on for the past couple of months, I was told to talk to a OBGYN since she says she wasn't train to do or go beyond urine tests. So I just want to know what's going on. Am I pregnant and the HCG levels werent high enough or showing or am I going through something abnormal???

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like a trip to the gynecologist can't hurt.  You may not be pregnant but a  blood test would definitely pick up the HCG levels if you are.  If not, you can get a routine exam with pap smear and that is a good idea under any circumstances if you are due for one.  The symptoms you describe can fit any number of conditions from gastric system to the psychological - this can be very powerful and once you start considering pregnancy, you begin to notice subtle \"signs\" of pregnancy.  There are cases where women did not know they were pregnant and delivered a baby, but in these cases they were not evaluated by a physician.  I would recommend this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Friday, 5/22/09, I finally received a positive pregnancy test & it was confirmed by a blood test.  There is a serious problem, that scares the bejesus out of me.  In the past 3 months, I've done some very bad things...according to the blood test, I'm about 3 months along.  I'd like to preface this with the fact that I've missed 3 periods, but my cycles are irratic. Also, I've been taking pregnancy test weekly since March (1st missed period). I've been using internet \"special\" tests, which I blame for the misinformation.  In the past 3  months I've done many recreational drugs such as: marijuana (3x wk), I've drank 2x, but I've done cocaine 3x, but even worse I've done opiates. I've done fentanyl & morphine on an almost daily basis for 2 months.  I quit the opiates as soon as I found out.  I'm so afraid that I've already screwed up the only thing I've so desperatley wanted for so long.  I tried to be responsible, by taking the pregnancy tests all this time. I also was a pack a day smoker. I've been tapering it off, since finding out & am down to 4 a day.  What are the odds that my unborn baby will be healthy upon birth?  Also, is there any smoking cessation products that I can take to help with the anxiety that comes along with quitting?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have to wonder about your \"trying\" to conceive while using recreational drugs.  Of course it causes worry and there is really no way to know what risk is there exactly.  Often the risks increase with dosage - frequency and amount used - the more used, the greater your risk.  We don't know how much alcohol can be used without risk of fetal alcohol syndrome.  We don't test drugs on pregnant women so we don't have a lot of scientific, good analysis.   Because of this we recommend no illicit substances used and no smoking to be safe.  Many healthy babies are born to mothers who did use such, but we can't predict your chances in this.    You are wise to get off the tobacco (and any other drugs) now because quitting at any point improves your odds for a healthy pregnancy.  It is well worth the efforts to stop smoking.  See if your locality has a stop smoking program.  Many communities do have this, with special emphasis on pregnancy.  Support can go a long way in helping you quit.  Think of your baby and how much good it will do, especially in the long run if you can stay off the cigarettes, thus providing a safer environment for your baby and a good example.  Zyban is used in pregnancy to help women quit and it has not shown to increase the risk beyond the normal 3-5% that occurs in all births.  Please talk to your doctor about your needs, get help from any pregnancy substance abuse program in your area and try to stay motivated for your family's sake.  It has been shown that quitting smoking even during your pregnancy, as late as the second trimester, results in a low birthweight baby risk no greater than in a non-smoker.    The March of Dimes recommends the following resources to quit smoking:      * American Legacy Foundation     * www.smokefree.gov/     * 1800quitnow.cancer.gov/     * A toll-free quit line (800)-QUITNOW (784-8669) Make a commitment now to do everything you can to be healthy and safe in your pregnancy.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, A painful groin lump is most often associated with an infected follicle, ingrown hair, cyst or even hernia.  It would require a professional looking at it to determine for sure.  Pain can radiate away from the point of origin so you could experience buttock pain for that reason.  Of course there could also be more than one event occurring at once, such as sciatica or other pain resulting from pressure on the spine from the enlarged uterus.    A follicle problem may be relieved with warm, moist packs, such as a very wash cloth, alternated with a second one when it becomes cool.  A hernia results from a weakening in the muscle wall which allows a part of intestine to protrude.   This can be an emergency so if you suspect that, talk to your doctor sooner rather than later.  In any case, be sure to point this out to your OB the next time you have a prenatal exam.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You did not indicate how far overdue your period is but even so it can be very difficult to identify the cause.  Topamax itself is not likely to affect your cycle but everyone at times, experiences missed periods for no apparent reason.  Birth control pills themselves often alter your periods, often making them much lighter and some types result in complete cessation.  If this was the type you were using, you would have been informed of that effect, however.  Tompamax can possibly decrease the effectiveness of the pill as contraception so it's best to use a second method, which you have indicate you have done (condom).  With both contraceptives in place, pregnancy is very unlikely, so I would probably  believe the HPT results.  Chances are your period will arrive late or at least resume next month, but there are some rare cases of pregnancy in spite of even two reliable methods so another test might be in order if you don't start your period next time around the expected time.      I do hope this helps you with your migraines.  Try not to stress too much about this, as stress and worry are also known to delay periods.  Missing them is not harmful to you in any way; just causes you to worry about pregnancy.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Generally, home pregnancy tests are very reliable during the fifth week after the start of your last period.  Many now are pretty good the same week or even a few days before your period is expected.  The box should say when they are most effective.  If you use one before 5 weeks and it is negative but you still think you may be pregnant you should take another test during the 5th week.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello (traceface22), If you had your period in December, the approximate time of ovulation is around two weeks later.  By the time the next monthly cycle is to begin, you may be able to get an accurate home pregnancy test.  It could be early and repeating the test the following week would be a good idea unless the period starts.  This can be highly variable depending on the typical length of your cycles.  A short or light period can be an indication of implantation but not necessarily.  Only the test can answer your question about pregnancy.  Symptoms you describe can be related to other factors such as hormonal fluctuation.  To Joardan, We don't have enough information to answer your question.  By next week you should be able to take a home test and possibly get an answer.  If it is negative but your period does not start, repeat the test the following week since false negatives do occur early on.  A positive test is usually reliable.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is impossible to say because women almost all miss a period now and again without being pregnant.  If you are sexually active without contraception, especially around the time of ovulation (somewhere between day 8 and day 19 - each woman is different), it could be pregnancy.  The blood testing can determine pregnancy a little earlier because it is more sensitive so it's good you are doing that.  Pregnancy symptoms can include breast tenderness, nausea, fatigue, headache and a myriad of other signs but they vary greatly from woman to woman and pregnancy to pregnancy.  But, these symptoms can also occur with PMS, cycle variation in hormones and other reasons.  Good luck with your appointment.  I do hope you take a multivitamin as all reproductive-age women should.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been on and off the nuvaring since July. Its falls out sometimes during intercourse with my bf. and we either don't notice or forget to put it back in. This has happened quite a few times so there has been times when he came inside me w/ no form of birthcontrol. However i have always gotten my period. I had the ring in for Dec and got my period on the 10th i put it back in when it was due but it fell out on the 20th of dec. and i got my period again on the 23rd of December. I have not been on it since and have had many instances where he came inside me. Because that has happened so many times before i never think much of it. because i always end up getting my period and was a little discouraged thinking i could not get pregnant. I have not gotten my period in Jan so it would def be late, but i am not sure if i am suppose to get it this month because i had it twice in Dec. I have had to pee more often, sometimes dizzy and faint feeling, very sore nipples for a week or so but i had that last time right before my period, even tho this time it never came and the sore nipples have gone away now, with no tenderness to the breasts. Also some feelings of sickness throughout the day, headaches and for the first time in my life what feels like heartburn. However there have been times when i thought i had symptoms and could possibly be pregnant and my period came so it could also be in my head. Basically my question is if i am suppose to suspect my period in jan and if so i have missed it and could potentially be pregnant. I have not taken a HPT because everytime in the past it is negative and is discouraging. I also don't want to take it if it is normal that i missed my period in jan and will get it come feb. Thanks any info will help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The symptoms you describe could happen either with pregnancy or premenstrual and there is no way to tell if you are pregnant except to wait it out or take a pregnancy test.  Missed periods happen frequently for no known reason but the fact that you hadtwo in December does not mean anything about January.  But, you would start counting your cycle with the second period (Dec. 23).  If you have a normal cycle and ovulate around two weeks after your period, you should be able to get a reliable response on a pregnancy test now.  But, if negative, you should repeat the test the following week if you do not start your period in the meantime.  If you are not pregnant this time, I would recommend seeing your health care provider or family planning clinic to find a more reliable method of birth control since this is going to continue to cause you stress.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a slight risk of pregnancy because ejaculating outside the vagina does not guarantee no sperm was released - something which can happen prematurely in the \"pre-cum\" fluid.  You should use a more reliable birth control method.  There are many options which can give you more peace of mind.    The fact that the tests have been negative is encouraging as these are usually quite reliable but if you go to a clinic, hospital or doctor's office you could get a blood test which is more sensitive than the urine test.  If it is still negative, you probably are just experiencing irregularity of periods due to hormonal fluctuation - something that happens to many women at times.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 22, married, and have been on birth control for nearly ten years.  I have been on my current pill, Brevicon 1/35 for over a year.  I started my last regular menstrual period on April 4, 2009, one day early as my 21 day active pills end on the Saturday and I started bleeding on the Saturday.  My period was normal. (normal on Brevicon for me, means getting my period somewhere  in the 7 days I'm not taking a hormone pill and bleeding significantly, whether it be for 3 days or the full 7) I started my new pack of pills and I may dropped one down the sink mid-cycle and didn't have a back-up pack to take from so I just left it.  I finished the active hormone pills on May 2, 2009.  On Monday evening, May 4, 2009, I received cramping and bloating like I normally get with my period.  The next day I had some very light brown spotting that wiped away when I used the bathroom. The same brown spotting continued until Thursday afternoon when it stopped.  I never had enough of the brown blood to even make a spot on my sanitary pad.  The entire week I had sore back, sore legs, very fatigued, threw up a few times eating foods I normally eat, waves of dizziness, runny nose with no other cold symptoms, sore/heavy breasts, and really bad headaches.  So, I took a hpt on Saturday May 9, 2009 (not knowing it probably wouldn't register so soon) and it was negative.  I felt a little disappointed, but mostly relieved. (my husband and I definitely want children but it's a little early to have one just yet!) I chose to discontinue caffiene, alchohol, and my birth control pills incase I am pregnant.  I continued to feel 'off' all of the next week, and still do.  I have very low energy, sleeping way more than normal, but sometimes having terrible insomnia when I am very exhausted.  My lower back is sore, breasts are tender, headaches are still rampant.  I feel a weird flutter almost like I'm nervous, but I'm not?    It is now May 16, 2009.  I took a hpt last night, and this morning, both negative.  I'm very confused.  Could I be pregnant and just not registering the hGc hormone on the urine tests?  Should I go to my doctor and have a blood test done?  Or should I simply wait to see if I miss another period?  Thanks for any help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. So, I have irregular periods, that is it occurs ever 2-3 months and very rarely every month. And my menstruation usually lasts for at most 8-14 days, although towards the end, it's much lighter. On the 6th day of my period, my boyfriend and I had sex for the firs time. It was towards the end of my menstruation, and my period was already lighter and lesser. Of course we were thinking that because my period was ending, there is the lesser chance of pregnancy, and we did use a condom. The downside is, the condom broke. So, it was like having no protection at all. But the condom broke towards the end of our intercourse. And he didn't blow inside of me (THANK GOD!) because we decided to use the withdrawal method, too.   He hasn't masturbated the day before we had our intercourse so I was thinking he had been urinating. And the morning before we did it, he had also urinated. So it may be that there would be none or very little sperm contained in his pre-cum, right? We tried to get emergency pill, but there's nothing available. So what we did is we bought contraceptive pills (ALTHEA), and i started to take one pill 2-3 hours later after we did it. Is it alright if i continue to take it?  Also after approximately 27 hours after we did it, i bought Nordette and took 4 pills, and another 4 pills 12 hours later. I read that Nordette could be used for Emergency Contraception. I really need assurance right now. The chances of me being pregnant is low, right? help! please and thank you!  PS: I usually sleep very late (12midnight-2am) and i drank alcohol on the day i took Nordette. So my chances are really low right? since i've been putting my self in stress? :(\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The fact that you were at the end  of your period would definitely be in your favor for not becoming pregnant.  Using the withdrawal method in addition would help as well.  It is not perfect but it is better than nothing which, as you said, is what it would have been with the broken condom.    You definitely sound like you are stressed over the idea of pregnancy but with the additional emergency contraception, you should be able to relax.  Stress can contribute to unusual menstrual cycles.  However, stressing yourself with alcohol would have no benefit in preventing pregnancy.  Plenty of unplanned pregnancies have occurred after binge drinking.  I am unclear what you meant about your boyfriend urinating and not masturbating.  If you mean that it had been washed away, that really would not assure you but the other measures you have taken should be adequate.  Yes, you can continue to take the birth control pill as directed in the package insert.  You are wise to find a reliable method for future use.  I think the chances of pregnancy are extremely slim here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello dymplez,  You did not give a lot of information here.  Am I to understand that you have been told you cannot get pregnant because of the PCOS?  If so, that is incorrect (assuming that's all there is to it).  You can have fertility problems but it is not always the case.  Plenty of women with this disorder become pregnant.    If there is another reason you have been told, that could be another matter entirely.  As for irregular periods - that is very common with PCOS so I would not be alarmed about that alone.  If you suspect you could be pregnant, a home pregnancy test is usually reliable a couple of weeks from the time you had sex with likely ovulation, or around the time of your missed period, assuming you do miss it.  With irregularity, it can be hard to know when that might be.  Let me know if you have other pertinent details.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Msheep, I would probably wait it out either until you miss a period or at least a couple of weeks since the symptoms you describe could be due to many different conditions besides pregnancy and you are already taking measure of care in case you are pregnant.  Often when you fear you may be pregnant, you are acutely aware of all kinds of things going on that seem out of the usual for you but which may just be related to other hormonal fluctuation, viral illness, etc.    If you don't have any urgent need to know for sure, I see no reason to get a blood test for this.  Even if you do have low levels of hcg, you will likely show up positive on the hpt soon if you are pregnant.  Keep in mind that oral contraceptives work by stopping ovulation.  Rarely does one missed pill result in pregnancy while using this form of contraception.  But, there is a failure rate of about 1%.  Add a multivitamin to your \"just in case\" regimen.  Serious birth defects have been shown to be decreased when women take a vitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid before and at the time of conception.  So, all women of childbearing age should be doing this every day.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I would like to ask, is this normal? However, 2 days after, my menstruation completely ceased. So most probably, was it just my menstruation? Or was it completely normal, considering it was my 1st time?\n\n",

The first time sometimes causes bleeding if the hymen were still partially intact or there could be trauma from rough sex/inadequate lubrication.  It is not a sign of conception occurring then.

    "content": "This is going to be long, and filled with TMI. But I just really want to know whats going on so I want to give all the details:  On march 21-April 4 we went on our honeymoon, I tried to keep the timing of when I took my birth control pills consistent, so I started taking them in the morning there (7 hours ahead in France & Italy) which was about the same time I would normally take them at bedtime here at home.  I started the next period 3 days early on Sunday April 5th instead of April 8th and it lasted all the way through until the following Sunday and was very heavy.  In the first two weeks of my active pills I missed 5 pills. Not consecutively, as I would miss a pill and take it along with the next pill the following night, so in 10 days I missed 5 pills but made up for them the next day.   On April 16th I was having intercourse with my husband and when we finished I looked down and we were both COVERED in blood. The bleeding lasted about 3 hours and didn't have any clots but was bright red.  On April 27th-May 1st I had some lower back pain on the right side just above my hip, some egg white-consistency cervical mucus, the muscles behind my breasts (not my actual breasts) became sore and tingly and I had an intermittent runny nose but I was not sick at all.  On May 3rd I had a thick blob of white discharge in my panties when I went to the bathroom, and from the way I had been feeling \"off\" I figured we had ovulated during that breakthrough bleeding and I was pregnant, so I didn't take my last active pill that night.   On May 4th I was all of the sudden REPULSED by food (I was starving but the idea of food made me throw up), I was extremely hot and dizzy (I was in my panties and a tank top sweating and my husband was in sweats and freezing) and every time I would bend over or stand up I would black out. I took an hpt, it was negative. That night I could not sleep despite being exhausted. I had painful, sharp cramps in my lower right side just inside of my hip. Sometimes it felt like it radiated into up to my rib cage.  On May 5th the sharp pain switched to my left side just inside my hip, still no pain in the middle, which is nothing like my regular period cramps so I just figured it was implantation and that I would get a +hpt soon. Then the cramps stopped altogether and I had some brown spotting. I had HORRIBLE gas all day long. I figured the neighbors could probably hear it, not exaggerating. When I brushed my teeth, my gums bled (this is how my mom knew when she was pregnant). I was urinating about every 30 mins or less. That night I still did not sleep. I had pressure in my abdomen (felt like someone was blowing up a balloon in there) along with muscle twitches, but no pain at all. I was still fire hot and it made me get a little panicky and shaky. I kind of felt like my heart was going to beat out of my chest, but when I switched to laying on my left side it stopped. I felt weird laying on my stomach.   My period was due May 6th, and I had bright red bleeding with some *very* small clots. I put on an ultrathin pantyliner, wore the same one all day to monitor the amount, but there were only a few tiny dots. When I was using the restroom, though, I had syrupy red bleeding that would land in the bottom of the bowl and take up the space of the size of a quarter or two. I slept through the night. I still hate food. I still have to pee alot.  On May 7th I still have the syrup consistency red blood when I went to the bathroom, but nothing on my pantyliner for the whole day. Had another - hpt, using both clear blue easy digital and first response early result. I started cramping really bad, thought the bleeding was going to pick up and be my period, but it didn't and turned out to just be diarrhea. The cramps went away as soon as I finished with the one round of diarrhea.   Today (May 8th) I only have a small amount of red blood when I wipe. There is no blood in the toilet when I go to the bathroom, and just one tiny dot on my pantyliner. Normally my periods start with a big gush and continue from Wednesday until I start my pill on Sunday. I feel really dizzy and sick to my stomach today, enough that if I were to go into the bathroom I would get sick but instead I just try to lie down and relax. Had another - hpt when I took the first response early result this morning. I called my doctor and he won't see me until July without a +hpt. Could this be messed up hormones or could I be pregnant? If I still get -hpt until sunday is it safe to take my pills even if I do wind up being pregnant?  I have also been monitoring my temperature since my first round of hot flashes to see if I have a fever. I don't but my normal temp is 96.something, and the day I first started getting hot it was 97, and has steadily increased until  99.1 today. Thank you for your help!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I wanted to update what was going on since I haven't received a reply yet. First, I forgot to say I have been on the same pill for 6 years. Second, I'm married and we've had sex multiple times everyday for the past several months. Today is Sunday May 10th, and I still have not received a +hpt. I bought several new ones today because I was informed by my doctor when I called again that  hpt tests are most accurate 7-9 days AFTER my expected period. The bleeding I was experiencing turned to extremely light brown spotting Saturday May 9th (yesterday), so light that I wouldn't have noticed it if I was not looking for it. The bleeding is completely gone today. It was not a normal period for me at all, and I have had the exact same thing every month since I have been on the pill (6yrs) so I am convinced I am pregnant....but I need to know! What should I do? I am planning on starting my new pack of pills tonight since no one will give me a straight answer as to whether I'm crazy or I'm pregnant and I don't want to mess up my cycle if I'm not pregnant. My doctor said it would be unlikely for my pills to hurt the baby if I turn out to be pregnant. How long should I wait until I take the negative tests as a definitive answer if I do not get a positive test? I have also been having extremely vivid dreams every night (takes me a while to realize it was a dream after I wake up) about a baby girl telling me and my husband that she is here, but I need to wait a week or so to know. It's driving me crazy. I have also started getting migranes, something I have never experienced before, and I'm afraid to take medicine for it until I know whether I'm pregnant because I'm soo afraid I will do damage to the baby. Please help me!!!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm still hoping someone will answer this question...so I'm going to update it because it is getting even more ridiculous.   I went yesterday for a blood test. The doctor asked me if I would rather have quantitative or qualitative. Of course I wanted quantitative, it was well worth the extra 200 bucks to me (qualitative is only $20). So they drew blood, checked my urine and said I had a really bad bladder infection, gave me an rx and I left.  Last night I was digging through my purse to find a pen and I found the fact plus that I had used earlier yesterday (don't know how its in my purse) and its positive. I figured it was an evaporation line so I took another test (a clear blue easy) and it registered a faint positive the second a drop hit it.   This morning I had a positive ept...albeit faint. I peed on 3 more sticks...one fact plus, and 2 epts. 1 positive ept, one positive fact plus, one negative ept. All faint thin lines, but definitely not evaps because the lines showed up immediately. I was dialing my husband to give him the good news when the doctor called to say my QUALITATIVE blood test was negative. Yes, qualitative, when I specifically asked and paid for quantitative. How sensitive are the qualitative tests? What should I trust?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry you have not received answers. Sometimes they get overlooked when you add to your original post because then it shows up to us as one that received a reply, even though that reply was from you.  First off I would say you should get a refund if they did not run the full tests.  But, that said, quantitative is really not necessary in determining a pregnancy. They are used in cases where there are problems such as suspected miscarriage, molar pregnancy or twins, as a way of monitoring the changes in the level over time.  But to determine pregnancy you only need to know that hcg is present.   I would recommend you wait a week and take another home test.  It is possible you were so early in a pregnancy that the hcg did not yet register.  But, when followed exactly as directed, they are very reliable.  Best wishes.\n\n",

About the last 2 weeks I have been getting really bad heartburn (which is to be expected) but I also have this severe metallic taste in my mouth.  I am not on any medications.  I usually take about a teaspoon of baking soda in a full glass of water for the heartburn and it goes away, but the metallic taste will stay until the next day when I wake up it is gone.  This happens about every other day to every 2 days.  Also I have this very strange \"buzzing\" or \"vibrating\" sensation in my lower abdomen about where my pelvic bone starts in the front left area.  It is so strange that I think sometimes that I have my cell phone in my lap, until I realize it's on the table next to me.  Are these things that I should be worried about, or are they normal?  I have 4 other children and have never experienced this before.  Any input would be greatly appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have no idea what is causing the vibration sensation unless you are having some kind of digestive trouble.  In pregnancy many body systems are altered to some degree and it varies with pregnancies.  I wonder if the metallic taste is coming from your prenatal vitamins.  You might try switching to a daily multivitamin (no minerals) for a while to see if the taste goes away after a few days.  Calcium carbonate can cause this.  If you take antacids for heartburn, this is a common side effect.  Other medications are sometimes at fault here as well.  If you have not seen a dentist recently, you might want to see if there is some dental condition that could be causing this.  Metallic taste can have many different possible causes but they are not usually serious.  If it continues, discuss it with your doctor at your prenatal visit.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They did an ultrasound and found a large cyst on my left ovary - they thought it was hemmoragic.  I went back today 5/6/09 and the uterus is still a little large but the lining is looking good.  The cyst is still there and has probably gotten bigger the sonographer was unable to determine where the cyst began and the ovary stopped and they aren't sure now what type of cyst it is.  I was given 3 choices...1. start the pill, 2. take norethindrone for 12 days or 3. surgery.  I was told the norethindrone wont affect fertility which I feel like I am about to ovulate on my right ovary soon.  According to the internet, this will stop ovulation and could harm a baby if I do conceive.  I am 43.10 years old and don't want to waste any time in conceiving as you can imagine....so my question is...will the norethindrone starting on day 12 post d/c harm my chances of conceiving on day 14 or harm a baby if I do conceive taken for 12 days?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Norethridone is used for birth control as well as other purposes so it will suppress ovulation and it is unlikely you would become pregnant on that cycle.  It is actually unknown if it could cause problems in a fetus, should you become pregnant, because testing is not done on pregnant women.  The advice is to avoid medications whenever possible when you are pregnant but women do sometimes get pregnant while taking hormones and most pregnancies work out fine.  Of all births there is around a 3% chance of birth defects even without any known exposures.  If you did become pregnant, the advice would be to stop using the drug, but you would not necessarily have any problems because of it.  Let your doctor know your desire to conceive, considering the \"biological clock,\" and ask for a full explanation of all treatment options so you can choose what works best for you.        Most medications with a known teratogenic (defect-causing) effect come with strong warnings to use back up protection and to wait a few months after stopping the medication.  Accutane is an example.  This medication does not come with that type of warning.  However, I would probably wait until the next cycle anyway.  Best wishes and good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

My question is this.  Do you think that taking this medication may have caused these results?  The last time I took it was about a week ago once.  Also, are any of these medications harmful to the fetus?  Is it alright to continue taking them?  I no longer have health insurance so I cannot schedule an appt with my physician to ask these questions, or to confirm my pregnancy.  Should I be concerned?  Should I stop taking these medications?  What will happen if I continue taking them?  Are there any safe alternatives to these medications I may be able to buy over the counter??  Thank you for your help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not worry about having taken these medications prior to knowledge of your pregnancy.  Not many drugs actually have been shown to cause harm to the fetus.  However, there is much we don't know so the safe course is to avoid any unnecessary medication use.    I would say it is very unlikely you would have six positive tests that were false positives.  It sounds to me like you are pregnant.    Promethazine is often prescribed for the nausea of early pregnancy so this should not be a problem.  Benadryl has not been shown to cause any increased birth defects either.    Excedrine Migraine is not likely to have been a problem but it is recommended you don't take it if you don't have to because there is caffeine in it and we recommend acetaminophen for pain (as first choice).  These things must be decided by weighing risks and benefits.  Usually it is good to discuss the problem with your healthcare provider who can help you determine this.    Focalin is a CNS stimulant and it would be best to avoid this in the future if you can.  Trazadone is often prescribed to pregnant women so again, no known increase in problems as a result of this.  Keep in mind that \"natural\" or \"herb\" remedies available over the counter are not necessarily safer for use in pregnancy because they are not tested in pregnant women and are not regulated by the FDA so purity and amounts vary and in some cases they are dangerous.  You should discuss any medication use with your doctor or midwife.    Call your local health department to see if they can refer you to a low cost clinic for prenatal care.  It is important that you find someone to monitor your pregnancy.  Many communities have clinics for the uninsured.  If you are low income it is also possible you might qualify for Medicaid so you should check into this.  In the meantime, you should discontinue any medications that are not essential for good functioning until you talk to your provider.  Sometimes it is the amount taken more than the particular drug so stopping now will help assure you don't continue to add to the overall intake.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Often this is performed with a \"belly button\" incision, using laparascopic procedures.  Not knowing the reason for your salpingectomy, I can't say the reason it was done as it was.  I would consult with the surgeon who performed it to learn the reasons. There is not a standard amount of tube to be left and if the procedure was done for sterilization, there are different methods used.  Pregnancy is very unlikely following such method but is possible and if it occurs, there is an increased risk of ectopic.  I'm afraid I can't tell you what the exact rate or risk is.    I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It has generally been accepted that this is not a genetic disease, though some studies have suggested the possibility.  I'm not sure what good genetic testing would do because the condition does not put your fetus in danger, needing some intervention at delivery or other reason to try and discover the cause.  If you prefer not to have the testing, it should be your decision.  I see no compelling reason for expensive testing of limited value.  Perhaps you could ask your doctor what findings might be beneficial.  If you are not satisfied of the need, feel free to refuse.  I hope you are able to enjoy your pregnancy without being overly concerned about the potential for problems.  As you have learned yourself, these things are manageable and hopefully one day there will be a cure.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Hormones of pregnancy can cause hyperthyroid symptoms so this complicates the diagnosis.  Since you are nearing delivery I don't expect any serious problems, though I'm sure the doctor will monitor your baby once it is born for any possible thyroid disturbance, as occasionally occurs with Grave's disease, an autoimmune disorder that causes the thyroid to be out of control.    Your doctor will probably be following up to determine the type of hyperthyroidism you have and treatment is likely to be delayed until delivery and further testing to see if it is caused by pregnancy hormones.  Nursing mothers with hyperthyroid should be able to safely nurse on medications which were once considered to be a problem. Newer studies indicated that it is safe since the concentration of drug that enters the breast milk is quite low.   I would not be alarmed but it's always wise to watch such changes that occur.  Best wishes and good luck with the delivery.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hyperthyroidism diagnosed and I am pregnant",
    "content": "Hello, I can't say what the cause of this distress is and would recommend an exam to determine if there might be an ovarian cyst or other abdominal problem since there are so many organs in the abdomen - bowel, bladder, ovaries, uterus, gall bladder, appendix, etc.  There are many possibilities for cause of pain.    As for the pregnancy attempt there is the age concern.  Fertility is greatly reduced after age 40-45 so your biological clock is ticking.  If you had a tubal reversal (also expensive I'm sure) and then tried for a while, you could find you are having trouble conceiving and each month  you get closer to menopause so you don't really have time on your side.  It can take a while to get pregnant even if you had a completely successful reversal.  Ovaries start to slow down.  For this reason I think your chances for having a natural child would be best with IVF.  It's true there's no guarantee, but that's the case with all your options right now.  If you don't mind trying for pregnancy, while being prepared for the possibility it may never happen on its own, especially considering sperm motility concerns, go for it.  But, it can be hugely disappointing to get your hopes up when perhaps it is not realistic.    Many older women successfully carry babies to term but those you see (superstars, etc.) often have used IVF, usually with donor eggs, in order to achieve this goal.  There is a lot going on backstage that we don't hear about in the media.  Thankfully some things are still private.    Most of the time, several eggs are harvested and conception is attempted.  If you fail in your effort, the second time usually is not as costly due to the fact the eggs are already harvested.  If cost is prohibitive, I understand you can sometimes travel to other countries (even some Soviet countries) and get the procedure which, including travel and lodging, still saves thousands of dollars over U.S. prices.  Just something to consider and investigate on the internet perhaps.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

In general, though, NyQuil should be avoided in pregnancy  As an aid for you, often your obstetrician will have a list of recommended medicines that are safe during pregnancy for you to use.  The recommendations vary slightly from physician to physician so I usually suggest talking with your OB about what he/she feels is appropriate for you to take.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi PJC,  Often, this is not a significant issue.  Your obstetrician will want to follow  your baby closely during the pregnancy to monitor for any issues that may arise and for proper growth.  A single artery is also sometimes associated with renal problems so they will probably take a good look at your baby's kidneys on ultrasound to see if there are any anomalies.  They'll also take a good look at the heart as well.  Don't let this worry you much since most of the time, a single artery results in a perfectly healthy baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Periods have been normal 30-32 cycle since my son.  Where as before needed provera. After 20 yrs of marriage, am divorced and in a new relationship.  I conceived in Aug of 2008.

I just found out last week that I am pregnant again (yay!!)  Was getting worried it would not happen.  LMP was march 24.  I ovulated on April 7.  I had a 29 day cycle with the march period.  On 14 days post ovulation (dpo) I took a HPT and it was positive.  Was not expecting it, though trying.  I took a second with the same first morning urine, positive.  I took a clear blue easy digital with afternoon urine and it said pregnant before the 3 minutes were up!!  My beta hcg levels that same day was 90.  It was 14 dpo, It seems I implanted on 9dpo, so it was about 4 days after that that I tested positive.  48 hours later, my beta was up to 302.  the web site I used for calculations said they are doubling every 21 hours.  Is this all normal or could I possibly have twins???  Very strong on my side ( sister has frat. twns without fertility drugs, so does paternal aunt, and maternal great aunts etc)  fiancee's mom had two sets of them.  Iam just so worried that I'm getting my hopes up and it happen again.  I have heartburn which I never have, I lost 68 lbs before this pg and eat very healthy.  I have nausea and actually vomited yesterday, fatigue, swollen, sore, tingly breasts, a lot of bloating, yellow/white lotion-type vaginal discharge, frequent urination.  Thanks for any help you can give on these levels.  I take another hcg tomorrow and will be 5 weeks on tues, april 28.  I will relax when I see the sonogram with the baby and heartbeat!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible to become pregnant from the  pre-ejaculate since it can contain sperm.  The likelihood is not great, but this is not considered a reliable form of birth control.    At this point, you should take a pregnancy test.  It should be quite reliable now.  It would also be too late for plan B emergency contraception.  It is recommended you use that within the first 72 hours following intercourse.    If you are pregnant now, your only option would be abortion, keeping the baby or carrying and adopting it out.  You would need to see your health care provider if you want information about abortion options.  Try to find a reliable birth control method you and your boyfriend can both be comfortable for the future so you won't have to worry about an unwanted pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would expect the test to be pretty accurate at this point, assuming you knew for sure when you ovulated.  There is a fertile window and unless you are monitoring yourself closely, most people do not know exactly when this occurred.  If you are sure of the ovulation date, your period would be expected about two weeks after this.  Reliability of the home tests are quite good a week after the expected period date and still pretty good when you are just a couple of days late, though a negative test at that time might still be a positive pregnancy.  Repeating it a week later is usually a good idea unless you have your period in the meantime.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course there is a risk of exposure for your friend so if she shows any signs of illness she should stay home from work for seven days or until she is completely well.  If she does get sick it would be good to  have it lab-confirmed so if anyone else catches it from her, they will be able to get prompt treatment.  This may seem like overkill if she has just a run-of-the-mill virus or common cold but it is irresponsible now to do anything else.  This is for anyone; not just you because you are pregnant.  There is no vaccine for you that is effective against Swine flu so the  usual precautions of staying away from sick people, frequent hand washing and eating healthy foods to help your health are the best measures you can take.    The reason flu is dangerous in pregnancy is because some people get very high fevers or develop secondary infections and that is not good for you.  Most Americans are recovering from the flu without problems so hopefully that will be the case for you if you do get it.  There are antiviral drugs to treat this if you do become ill and these are ideally started within two days of becoming ill.  Since drug testing is not done on pregnant women, we can't say for sure this is safe but no reports of problems among pregnant women who have taken it have been reported so it is believed to be OK.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In early pregnancy, growth of the fetus is very consistent, allowing ultrasound dating to confirm or clarify calendar dates which can vary quite a bit.  By measuring certain bony structures such as skull and leg bones.  This measurement is of the head here is not significant.  It could mean your baby has a slightly smaller head than \"average\" but remember that average means there is a range with half larger and half smaller.  This can be perfectly normal, especially in the absence of other concerning findings.  It has not been shown to be a good indicator of chromosomal abnormality.  This might prompt your doctor to repeat an ultrasound in a few weeks to see if there is any grown delay over time.    In days past when we did not do ultrasounds, we would never have known about such a measurement and chances are everything would still be fine.  Ultrasound is a wonderful tool, but not perfect.  Often it just suggests some things to watch for as time goes on.  Good luck with the pregnancy.\n\n",

On October 29th we did artificial insemination, but then I had a period from November 9th-13th, seemed like a normal period, so I assumed the insem didn't take. My husband and I kept trying using ovulation predictors and had sex on November 23rd. I didn't get a positive test until Dec 10th. The Dr's office went by my last missed period and determined I am approximately 22 weeks now. The measurements say I'm only about 20 1/2 weeks. So, all this said, you can see why I am so confused. I am wondering now, could I be any further along? Was it the artificial insem or the real thing? If it were the artificial insem that would make me about 26 weeks. Is it possible for the baby to just be small? Or is it more likely that me and my husband being together that got me pregnant?\n\n",

The earlier you are in the pregnancy, the less likelihood that you would need to have the procedure since your body will probably expel it.  After 10 weeks' gestation there is a greater likelihood that the miscarriage will be incomplete.    The decision should be made with your health care provider and the goal is to avoid infection and/or excessive bleeding which could result from an incomplete miscarriage.  I hope this helps.

    "content": "Hello,  I am 21yrs old and I have been sexually active for a while now. I am trying to start a more reliable method of birth control than Plan B... I am waiting for my period so that I can start the ring, but am getting worried that it may not come, and I have no idea when to expect it (if I don't know when to expect another period, how will I know I missed it and might be pregnant?). The situation has been getting a little out of hand lately and background is fairly long so I will use point form (also, sorry for such a detailed description of my sex life... but that is what makes it so confusing!):  -had a normal/regular period March 13, usual amount of bleeding for 5 days, then 2 days of spotting (this is normal for me) -sex on March 21st, unprotected but he did not ejaculate -March 22, took Plan B because I was worried -very heavy bleeding began on March 27 and lasted 2 days, with spotting for about 4 days after -I wasn't sure if it was actually my period because I had been expecting it to come around the 3rd week of April (and flow was heavier and lasted less time than normal). -unprotected sex again March 27, again he did not ejaculate in me. I was worried and confused and called a pharmacist to ask if I should take Plan B again - she said that because the last period was at such an unexpected time and we are not sure what was going on, I should take it again to be safe so I took plan B again on March 28 -fooled around again on March 29, though he did not ejaculate in me, there is a possibility of pre-ejaculate or ejaculate from other surfaces coming into contact with me. -April 3rd, had sex with condom -April 9, no condom, he did not ejaculate in me but again there is a possibility of pre-ejaculate or ejaculate from other surfaces/contact after ejaculation coming into contact with me -got worried again because of such prolonged exposure to pre-ejaculate/contact after he finished so took Plan B on April 10 -Apr 11, sex with condom, though it was not perfect use of condoms and some exposure may have happened.  So, I understand that this makes me seem VERY irresponsible! I definitely regret a few of the things I have done in the past month and have talked with my boyfriend about abstaining from sex for now until I know what is happening with my body. I understand Plan B can mess with your cycle (especially with repeated use like this) and I don't know when to expect another period. As a student at university, it's also exam time (i.e. a very stressful time of year) and I have missed my period every September (back to school month) since I started my degree, but not usually during finals. On top of my exams, worrying about pregnancy has also been incredibly stressful and could be affecting my period. I figured that taking a pregnancy test would be able to help me figure out if a missing period is due to stress/Plan B vs. pregnancy but I don't know how long to wait to take one or when to expect another period - most pregnancy tests tell you when to take them based on the date of your next expected period and I have no idea when that would be now!  I am so confused... any help/advice would be wonderful. Since the first period listed in March, I have also been tracking any period/PMS related symptoms and my sleep, exercise, diet and stress levels as well as any side effects I believe were due to taking Plan B. I also began to monitor my cervical discharge about a week ago, to see if I could figure out if I was ovulating or not. If you think any of this information would be relevant and helpful to you, I will be glad to provide it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I understand your frustration but it would be impossible to say how the repeated used of plan B may affect your hormone levels.  It is typical for this to mess up your cycles, as you said, so you have to just wait it out at this point, I'm afraid.    The withdrawal method is somewhat effective - better than ejaculating in the vagina - but of course not perfect.  But, with the extra hormones and bleeding I would not immediately think pregnancy here.  Of course you can take tests every week as long as you are concerned.  Taking this approach will definitely delay your ring use if you need to have a regular period in order to get it.    Most women get a positive result at 9 or 10 days past ovulation.  Since you do not know when you ovulated, you could base your test on the dates of sex since you would have ovulated near that time in order to be pregnant.  For instance, having sex on April 11; if conception occurred you should be able to get a positive test by about April 21.  But, my gut feeling would be that it is unlikely since you had just taken plan B the day before and would have had a high level of hormones in your body at that time.  You are correct that you may have stress-induced period delays as well so anything you can do to try and relax would be good.  But I'm afraid you won't be able to rely on a predicted period date because of the plan B use.  Talk to your doctor about your desire to get the Nuvaring and that you are having trouble getting a normal period first.  The usual reason for having the period is to verify you are not pregnant.  If you take a test in 10-14 days after having sex and it is negative, you could be pretty confident you are not pregnant and could use the ring.     You definitely need to use something besides plan B which was never intended to be a regular contraceptive method.  Best wishes.\n\n",

On Apr 15th, I started bleeding but it was fairly light, and a little weird: I needed only a panty liner but when I would sit down to go to the bathroom, it flowed like a real period (it would literally pour out... and was much thinner than usual) I thought this might be the beginning of my period and was hoping it would become heavier but instead it got lighter and ended today (Apr 17).   The Plan B info sheet mentions both spotting between periods or changes in your periods (lighter or heavier and differences in lengths of cycles, etc) as side effects. I wanted to ask you what they mean by \"spotting\" exactly - how much or how little do they mean? Do you think that this may have been a light period or just spotting?  This was 20 days after the start of my last (irregular) period on Mar 27th, and 5 days after my last Plan B dose.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi- I am wondering which way to go with considering a subsequent pregnancy.  I am obese.  I am also age 37.  I am wondering whether it would be a better option to wait another year or two while focusing on weight loss to conceive, or to conceive now while obese and be a year or two younger?  Which would result in the best outcome?  I do have dysmetabolic syndrome, and very mild asthma, however no other serious health issues currently.  I am currently well compensated with regard to both medical conditions.  I have had two successful healthy pregnancies in the past.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Wishing,  As you probably already know obesity can complicate any situation but given your advanced maternal age I would really think it through because as you know you and your baby are at an increased risk for many different things that can happen with one pregnancy that didn't happen with the first. Also it is more difficult to become pregnant when you are obese. You didn't mention if you were obese with the previous pregnancies or if this is something that happened as a result or your pregnancy weight gain. If you decide to try and get pregnant and succeed may I suggest seeing a perinatologist throughout your pregnancy which your OBGYN will most likely suggest you do anyway. The perinatologist can follow you and your baby more closely and I would just feel more comfortable. The answer to the ? as to whether or not you should be younger or thinner is kind of hard to answer but my personal opinion as to whether or not you could and should have another baby safely is that you definitely have a greater chance of having a normal pregnancy seeing how as you don't have any major health problems and if you are indeed going to have another baby I wouldn't wait much longer because lets face it...none of us are getting any younger...haha! I would just suggest that you watch what you eat, exercise regularly and don't gain too much weight. The rest is in God's hands! Best of luck to you and your family and I hope things work out well for you. I hope this helps\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If I were you I would wait a while and work on the weight.  Any reduction improves your odds in pregnancy, even if you don't achieve your final weight loss goal.   At your age, another year or two will not significantly alter your risk but losing some weight can have huge benefits.  But, if you don't actually work on the weight loss, combining obesity and age over 40 would increase your risks.    So if you are serious about a healthy pregnancy with lowered risk, do something NOW to lose weight.  Even lap band surgery can make a huge difference in pregnancy if you can afford it.  Outcome of pregnancies following gastric bypass and lap band surgery has been shown to be better than outcomes in obese pregnant women.  Nutritional status is important so taking good vitamin supplements after such a procedure is imperative.  It is also encouraged that the surgical weight loss patient achieve their goal and level off before becoming pregnant and they are encouraged to wait for a year following the procedure.  Other options can be just as beneficial.  Weight Watchers and other guided weight loss plans along with exercise has been shown to be very good prior to pregnancy.  You may even wish to see a doctor at a preconception visit to discuss options because there are also medically supervised methods for a more rapid, yet safe, weight loss.   Congratulations on  your desire to have a healthy pregnancy.  Good luck with it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I gave birth to my baby on the first day of her 22 week, therefore she did not survive. At my follow up visit my doctor said that most likely it was from an incompetent cervix. If I had visited him four days earlier shouldn't he have seen that my cervix was dilated more than normal? How is an incompetent cervix determined? Also, I had went to the emergency room because I was having pains, contractions, that were about 4 minutes apart. They put a monitor on me for a while. Then sent me home. The nurse told me that it was probably my uterus stretching and told me to take some tylenol. However, I was in labor. I went home and went to the bathroom and almost had my baby in the toilet. I felt her head in the opening of my vagina and sucked her back in. Could the delivery have been postponed if the nurse would have not sent me home the first time. By the way, I never had any blood or spotting until the second time I went to the hospital.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am so sorry for your loss.  This can be devastating.  Having experienced a late term stillbirth myself I understand how desperately you are searching for answers and reassurance this will not happen again, as well as knowing nothing more might have been done to avoid this tragedy.  Unfortunately the most usual way that incompetent is diagnosed is when a situation like yours occurs.  A loss in the second trimester is always suspicious for incompetent cervix and in the first one, it can usually not be averted.  But, even after the fact we don't necessarily mean it was the definite cause.    Since now there is this possibility your doctor will consider you at risk for it in a future pregnancy and will likely do ultrasonic cervical measurements as you go along.  This is not done routinely in pregnancy because incompetent cervix is unusual and risks associated with internal exams would exceed benefits obtained if it was done across the board.  If it appears your cervix is shortening or even just as a general precaution, in a future pregnancy, your doctor may offer a cerclage (sometimes called a \"stitch\" in the cervix) usually done during the second trimester.  There is no guarantee this will prevent a future early delivery but it can help in many cases.  In your situation it is unlikely anything more could have been done to prevent the early delivery, but had they sent you to the labor and delivery area, they would have been able to determine that you were actually in labor, that your cervix was dilating and you could have delivered in a more appropriate setting.  Of course you would still be grieving and frustrated but at least you would have been attended for the birth.    Most obstetric protocols advise the mother to go directly to L&D if they have an emergency, bypassing the ER altogether if they are at least 20 weeks along.    If you need help with dealing with your loss, please seek therapy for this.  It can affect you seriously. Good luck in your future.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm 19 years old and currently sexually active with my boyfriend of 4 years. I have been on Aviane birth control for over a year now, and am currently not using any other method of birth control. Last month I went on vacation to Hawaii from march 8-13. I'm not sure if the 5 hour time difference would have any effect but I missed a pill and took two when i remembered, and also missed a pill another time in the week (not twice in a row), but took two accordingly as well. I had intercourse on the last days of my period (end of the pack) in the beginning of august. I've been experiencing spotting (brownish) for the 7th day now and I'm wondering if I shouldn't exclude pregnancy as a possibility for this. I know spotting can occur while on birth control, but I guess what I'm trying to understand is if this is implantation bleeding or not, since i'm not sure exactly how long it lasts. (The internet has always been a non-reliable source until now)  Thank you so much for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, They have not been able to determine what level of alcohol use in pregnancy might be safe.  Therefore, the recommendation is to avoid it altogether.  But, many babies are born of heavily drinking mothers who do not develop the fetal alcohol syndrome.  There is probably a genetic component which makes some people more susceptible than others.  We just don't know.    As for quitting now, it absolutely will help since many drug exposures are dose-related, meaning the more exposure over time, the greater the risk of damage.  Don't worry too much about what is passed but concentrate on doing everything you can now to have a healthy pregnancy, including taking prenatal vitamins, eating right, exercising and using seatbelts.

    "content": "Hello This will depend on many factors.  If the placenta is covering the cervix, a vaginal delivery will not be possible.  The doctor should be able to tell by ultrasound if this is the case so you will know in advance.  Some doctors are comfortable with external version; others are not.  If your wife has it, she wants to be sure she is with a doctor skilled in this delicate procedure.  Some doctor do not want to attempt version after cesarean so it will depend entirely on the doctor's judgment.  Medicine is part science; part art and intuition with knowledge of the  patient's history and physical condition.    A version is normally done in the hospital with close monitoring in case the baby gets into distress and immediate delivery is required.  If the placenta is merely sitting low at this point, it would not necessarily interfere with the procedure but it would have to be the doctor's judgment on exam at the time of the version.  At this point the baby could also very well turn on its own.    Good luck to your wife on the delivery.\n\n",

I was with my ex late on the night of the 31rst/morning of the 1rst but protection was used.  Prior, I was with my current Fiance without protection.  I found out in Feb that I was pregnant.  My dating scan puts my due date at Oct 18th.  Last week, I asked my doctor for the possible date of conception.  He told me that it is hard to say as I went off the pill in January, about the first of the month.  He estimated that it occurred between the 25th and 31rst of January.  Is it safe to say that more than likely, the incisdent that occured on the 31rst did not result in my pregnancy?  What also concerned me was the fetal heart rate during the dating sonogram which put me at 8 weeks,was 170bpm.  From what I have read, that is way to fast for a baby that was at 6 weeks conception.  I know the only way to tell is a post natal DNA test, but I am wracked with guilt and I guess I am looking for a little piece of mind.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a percentage of failures in these procedures but it does seem very unusual that both of you would have this problem.    Did your boyfriend have the follow up sperm count test to be sure his vasectomy was complete?  He should definitely do so now either way.  I assume you had a positive pregnancy test and are absolutely sure you suffered a miscarriage.  We don't know why sometimes tubes are able to grow back together.  It's kind of ironic when so many women can't become pregnant and others do in spite of such serious measures to prevent it.    You should consult with your doctor at this point.  He may want to do studies to determine what is going on with you and counsel you on your next move from here.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am in my 3rd trimester and for the last week, I have been craving tuna really bad. I went through 2 cans in a 3-4 day period, and told myself I would limit myself to that, but now that it is gone, I am still having the cravings. I have been looking it up online, but seem to get conflicting reports. Every website says something different. I have not had any tuna this pregnancy, up until a week ago. So, my question is, at this point in my pregnancy (just over 27 weeks), what effect would eating tuna have on my baby? Obviously, I don't want to do anything that will harm him, so, if it would have adverse effects on his development, obviously, I would stay away from it. But if it is ok to eat, in limited amounts, as I have seen on some websites, what is that limit? How much is ok?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since we don't actually know how much mercury may be in the tuna but we know there are trace amounts, the FDA has suggested limiting yourself to 12 ounces of light, canned tuna per week.  Albacore is a larger fish that may have more mercury so they recommend not exceeding 6 ounces of that type.   Because of the tremendous food value in fish, we don't advise you to give it up completely, but perhaps limit yourself to three meals per week.  Mercury has a cumulative effect, so not making this the mainstay of your diet is a good, safe way to go.    An even healthier option would be to choose wild salmon (farm-raised varieties can contain high levels of PCBs), shrimp, tilapia, clams, trout, farmed catfish, fish sticks, flounder, and haddock.  At any rate, you should not overdo it.  The safest course would be to limit your intake of all fish because we live in a polluted world.  Once your baby arrives, you would not need to worry as much because this does not appear to be a problem in lactation since levels in the milk are lower than the bloodstream.  Good luck with the delivery of your baby.\n\n",

I suspect your doctor is getting some additional information and she may even refer you to someone else if she is not comfortable with it.  Of course you can always seek a second opinion with someone more experienced with this anyway and in some cases they must be left in but this should be done with study and consultation.  You are at greater risk for ectopic pregnancy and you have not indicated how far along you are so be alert to any signs of pain or bleeding.    Good luck.\n\n",

They said that they would see what the sonogram showed and determine with the specialist the best course of action. I am just so paranoid after looking online and seeing all of the horror stories!! I am estimating that I am about 6-7 weeks based on my last menstrual which was between Feb 13-17. I am having no spotting and occasional cramping here and there but I am unsure if it is cramping or just gas and I am being a worrywort. To be about 6-7 weeks is 10,000 HCG normal is there anyway to know?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doctors, I'm 38 years old mother diagnosed with slightly hypothyroidism since May 2008 (everything normal except the TSH). I started to take 0.025mg of Synthroid. I told my doctor that I wanted to get pregnant pretty soon and she confirmed that the medication at 0.025mg was correct. On February 2nd, 2009 at 7 weeks of pregnancy I went to see my doctor again because I was sensitive to cold and sweating after, extremely tired and minor join pain. She said that I should continue with the Synthroid at 0.025 since the last blood test from October 2008 showed the TSH within the range. I tried to have an appointment ASAP with the obstetrician but it was not possible until week 10 of gestation. My obstetrician did a rush blood test only for the TSH and since week 10.4 my synthroid was increased to 0.50mg because my TSH was at 5.2.  Since then, I definitely feel better and I\u2019m going for another blood test tomorrow at week 14 \u00bd. I \u2018m a bit concerned about the fact that I did not take the right dosage at the beginning of my pregnancy.  I would like to know what are the possible risks of having a baby with cognitive, developmental delays in my case.  Thanks a lot for your answer.  Linne\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not be alarmed.   While it is important to adjust your thyroid in pregnancy and needs are sometimes increased, I would not expect any adverse effects from an earlier low level.  Try to relax and continue to have this monitored periodically throughout for other minor adjustments that may be needed.  It is not such a fine-tuning that day to day variance will be concerning.  Your baby has two sources of thyroid hormone - its own which begins to function between 10 and 12 weeks and what you supply.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is impossible to say when and if you have become pregnant.  The three negative tests certainly imply you are not.  You may just be late with your period or have missed one altogether - a common event.  The only time you can really predict ovulation is when you have very regular periods or have been monitoring your basal body temperature or secretions to determine your ovulation pattern.  Without this information, either man could potentially be the father of a child you conceived since your February period.    I would recommend a blood test if you are truly concerned you might be pregnant but not having it show up on the home pregnancy test.  You can get this done at a doctor's office.  Otherwise, repeat the home test if you continue to lack a period.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My understanding is that this one is not known to be dangerous to the fetus.  The packaging on drugs always warn against taking any medications without your doctor's permission in pregnancy because extensive scientific testing is not done on pregnant women.  This leaves the decisions in the hands of the health care providers to advise based on risks and benefits of drugs in pregnancy.  Very few drugs are actually known to cause harm to the baby so I would not rush to terminate.  Chances are not any greater for you than for any pregnant woman and there is about a 3% risk of birth defects in all pregnancies, without any particular exposures - just the way it works out randomly.    As more and more women have been exposed to particular medications, data is collected and we learn which ones are truly risky.  Your doctor will know what these are because the few that are harmful are well-known.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is no perfect dating when it comes to pregnancy since every woman is different as to date of ovulation, date of conception, etc.  Two weeks variation either way is considered normal.  When you get your mid-pregnancy ultrasound exam, you will probably be given a date at that time which may confirm one of these other dates.  I would not worry too much about this until you see the results of that exam.  Later, if nature takes its course, as opposed to labor induction, your baby will decide when it is due to be born and will most likely come at the appropriate time.  The variations which sometimes occur is why it is best not to rush things.  If we are off a bit on the estimated due date we could put the baby in jeopardy of a premature birth.  Good luck in your pregnancy.\n\n",

Since your levels were low your doctor gave you a little help.  This may or may not have been the cause of your previous miscarriage but it won't hurt to try this, given your history.  I wish it could be the answer for all miscarriages, but in truth, most miscarriages are of causes never to be known.  Hopefully this was the only problem for you and the supplementation will help this time.  Having a low level early on is not important if the baby has continued to grow normally.  In other words, any lack would not cause a problem if you did not miscarry when it was low.  It should have no other negative results.  Good luck with your pregnancy.\n\n",

I have never seen a heartbeat, and this last pregnancy was the first time we saw a yolk sac. I had my first miscarriage with two empty sacs at 11 weeks and had to have an emergency DNC. I had my second miscarriage at 7 weeks, and it was like a heavy period. I am currently waiting to miscarry again. I am 9 weeks, and although they have seen a yolk sac, there is no heatbeat and no fetal pole. My progesterone has never gone above 9.5 and I am feeling very hopeless. What do you do when you can't get your progesterone high enough to support a baby? I am seeing an RE, and he pushes IVF. But I don't understand IVF, and we can't afford it either. Even with IVF, if your body does not produce enough progesterone, won't it result in miscarriage also? At this point I feel like I may never be able to have children. I have metabloic symdrome, I am on metformin, and I feel like a complete failure.\n\n",

Patience can be very hard to sustain under these circumstances and the hearbreak of repeated miscarriage is hard to bear but you could still sustain a pregnancy at some point.  Chromosomal problems are considered a common cause of miscarriage and there is little to be done about that.  You are correct that IVF is expensive and not necessarily the answer anyway.

    "content": "Thank you so much for responding. I saw my RE again, and he said that he doesn't think I am miscarrying JUST because of the low progesterone. I have to wait to miscarry this time, and then go back in a few months to do some more testing. He hasn't done the clotting testing or anything yet, but he said something like 85% of the time, they find nothing wrong. That seems so depressing. I just want them to find something so they can fix it, and I can carry a baby to term. What do you think my chances are of having a normal pregnancy after 3 miscarriages & low progesterone? Thank you so much Dr!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It would be impossible to predict the chances but it does happen.  I know of several women who carried to term after several miscarriages.  In many cases they took low dose aspirin and progestrone supplementation at the beginning just to be safe, even when no clotting problem was actually diagnosed.  Your doctor is correct that most miscarriages do not result in a diagnosis that can lead to active prevention.  In most cases it is out of our control completely but if you do miscarry again I would get the evaluation just to be sure it is not a factor.  Human reproduction is very complicated, even though it seems to happen easily for most couples.  It's something of a miracle that everything comes together as it does and when things go smoothly - a miracle we often take for granted.  Good luck.\n\n",

We have had protected sex only once or twice in our entire relationship. He hasnt had an outbreak in 2yrs till last night which we didnt have sex for about two days now. I am concerned because I am pregnant and have told my OBGYN that he has it but they never initiated any test or anything... I havent had anything strange on me but once a pimple looking thing on my groin but it went away in a couple days and that was weeks ago. What happends when your pregnant and I find out I have the virus? I am scared for my baby. What happends? Also if I do contract it from him, do we still avoid sex when one has an outbreak? I searched for answeres on a million different sites but non can answer these for me...What should I do about being pregnant and him having it, what happends if I do, and sex..how does that work?

    "content": "Hello, It is recommended you avoid sex while he has an outbreak and you can add to your protection in pregnancy by using a condom for sex throughout the pregnancy since the risk of transmission to the baby is greatest if you acquire the virus in pregnancy; less risk for women who acquire it before becoming pregnant since viral shedding is greatest with initial infection.  Your doctor can run a test to see if you have antibodies currently, meaning you have already acquired it but are asymptomatic.  If you have no antibodies, you should avoid sex in the last month of pregnancy, when risk to the baby is greatest.  Sometimes antiviral therapy is recommended if you acquire the virus during this time; some doctors recommend taking it the last month regardless.   If you have an active lesion at the time of delivery you would need to have the baby by c-section.  If not, vaginal delivery is quite safe.  Discuss your concerns with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most likely this was just hormonal fluctuation.  A spontaneous abortion is not likely to occur so soon.  I am assuming you meant the next period was in July - it says June 25 and again June 11.  Or perhaps you meant June 11, then again June 25, but either way, it is unlikely this would be the event.  It would be more typical of a miscarriage (spontaneous abortion) if your period is late, then comes and perhaps is heavier than normal.    I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, After this procedure there is risk of infection so it is advised that you do not have sex for 3 weeks (or put anything into the vagina that could introduce bacteria).  You should check your temperature to see if it is elevated which could be a sign of infection.  The foul odor can also suggest this and antibiotics might be the safest course so you should talk to your doctor if you feel this is happening.  Bleeding for up to 3 weeks following abortion is normal, even though it stopped for a time.  Beyond this, you should have it checked out.  I would give your vagina a rest while monitoring for infection.  You need to take this seriously and heavy bleeding should be reported.  It is possible to get your next period as early as 3 weeks or as long as 10 weeks, depending on your own body's hormones.  Having had protected sex makes another pregnancy unlikely so I don't think you have had a spontaneous abortion now.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Most miscarriages are caused by failure to implant properly, divide and grow right, or the result of chromosomal abnormality.  There is little you can do to cause or prevent a miscarriage, though bad habits can increase your risk.  So, unless you have some other problem, I would not worry about the travel.

    "content": "Hello, This would definitely not be a cause to abort.  Very few medications have been shown to cause an increased risk of birth defects and this is not one of them.  It can be very hard to know what to do when pregnant because we don't know as much about the reactions - this is because we don't do routine testing in pregnant or nursing women.  After thousands of women have taken a particular medication we are able to analyze the results and determine if there is a likely risk.    The opinion about this medication has been varied over time.  Here is the statement from OTIS (experts on this):  \"Recent studies and reviews that examined the cases of thousands of women exposed to this drug in early pregnancy could find no evidence that using metronidazole during pregnancy increases the risk for major malformations or other adverse effects on the fetus. While some sources still state that this drug should not be used during the first trimester or at all in pregnancy, the current data do not support a significant increased risk for birth defects or other adverse effects on the fetus.\"  Of course there is a risk for birth defects in all pregnancies - most of the time it is just a chromosomal abnormality or totally random.  Only rarely are medications associated.  Flagyl is not one of those that have been determined to increase your risk beyond the usual.  So, don't worry and enjoy your pregnancy!  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Pregnant and on Celexa? HELP",
    "content": "Hello, Many pregnant women do take Celexa while pregnant.  It has been not shown to be a cause of any increased risk for birth defects.  Very few medications really do but you should realize that in the normal population there is about a 3% chance of birth defects in ALL babies, regardless of exposures.    All SSRI antidepressants have the potential to be related to some newborn adjustment problems at birth when taken in the last trimester.  You should discuss this with your doctor do decide if weaning off prior to the end of your pregnancy is something you should consider.  Risks to your health must be considered in the equation.  In most of these cases the baby just needs a little extra care with feeding and breathing and they adjust within two weeks without any apparent long-term effects.  Rarely an infant develops persistent pulmonary hypertension and there has been some suggestion of implication by SSRIs, but of course not all babies who are exposed experience this.   Again, these effects appear to be increased when the medication is used at the end of pregnancy, so don't worry about taking it now.  Just talk to your doctor about risks and benefits.  Otis Pregnancy Organization (OTIS) is currently conducting a study looking at women who take antidepressants during pregnancy whether they choose to continue or discontinue their medication. If you are interested in taking part in the study, please call 1-877-875-7333.  Regular medication studies are not conducted on pregnant women but they do gather information after many women have  used a medication and the data is analyzed to determine any adverse effects.  This is why the manufacturers information sheets always warn you against taking medications in pregnancy.  It doesn't mean they are harmful; just that they have not been studied in the usual manner so the decisions should be made in concert with your health care provider.  This study would be to compare those who take the medication vs those who do not, based on their own risk/benefit determination.    Congratulations and enjoy your pregnancy!  Best wishes.\n\n",

As the pregnancy evolves, the doubling time increases. By 6 to 7 weeks gestation beta hCG levels may take as long as 3 1/2 days to double. If  one were to put this information into a small program, I'm quite sure it would yield virtually the same results that laboratory calculator programs now do.   Hope this is an adequate answer. Probably someone out there remembers the actual formula for computing this, but so much is automated now in lab work that it's largely lost to most of us who now rely on computerized models to calculate the results.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Be careful about what you read.  Often data is incomplete, biased or just plain outdated.  OTIS (Organization of Teratology Information Specialists) who are experts when it comes to safety in pregnancy has said this:  \"Use of metronidazole has been controversial over the years. Older studies have suggested an association between metronidazole and an increase in various birth defects. However, these studies had flaws that make it difficult to be sure if those birth defects were caused by metronidazole. In contrast, recent studies and reviews that examined the cases of thousands of women exposed to this drug in early pregnancy could find no evidence that using metronidazole during pregnancy increases the risk for major malformations or other adverse effects on the fetus. While some sources still state that this drug should not be used during the first trimester or at all in pregnancy, the current data do not support a significant increased risk for birth defects or other adverse effects on the fetus... since the drug is considered safe to use orally, both vaginal and topical use should not pose an increased risk to your pregnancy.\"  This is consistent with my information and experience.  In actuality there are very few drugs that have actually been found to cause defects, especially among the legal substances, even in the early days following conception.  The scare comes from the unknown since actual scientific studies are not performed on pregnant women.  However, after many thousands of women have had such exposures, the teratology organizations that study this are able to reassure us that relatively few pose a threat.  Also, animal studies have never been a good indicator of the effects on humans.  Besides, they are exposed to doses much higher than would ever be prescribed to women.    This would not be a reason for terminating a pregnancy.  I hope this helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 23 yr old female, and I have been on birth control for 4 or 5 years now. My last period started on May 19th. I think it was slightly lighter than usual, but not enough to take notice of. On June 5th, I started having stomach problems. Every time I ate something, my stomach would start hurting, and I would feel instantly full/bloated, and I was having gas. I ate little food that week, because everything was upsetting my stomach. After a couple of days, most of it went away, but I still have the bloated/gassy feeling. Last week, around, the 9th, I started spotting. It wasn't enough for a pad, I just noticed it whenever I would wipe after using the bathroom. It was light brown and color, and originally I thought it was left over residue from a BM. Some days I have it, some days I don't, and it ranges in color from faint brown to light pink. It is now the day/day before my period is supposed to arrive, and the spotting is gone. I have also been real tired. Sometimes at work, I can just fall asleep sitting at my desk.  Since I've been taking BC for so long, my period is very regular. I usually would have my period by now (but tomorrow morning at the very latest), and it might be too early to tell, but I was wondering if these sound like preganancy symptoms to you?  I'm just a little worried, because I've never had these symptoms before.  Also to add to my worry, my mother got pregnant with me while she was on birth control and still having her periods, also at the same age as me.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The only way to know for sure if you are pregnant is to take a pregnancy test, but let me explain a few things.  The chance of pregnancy while on the Pill is very very low. Although some women claim to have gotten pregnant while on the pill, there is usually a reason behind it. For example, taking antibiotics or certain drugs while on the pill can make it less effective. Missing a pill or not taking it at the same time every day will lower increase the chance of pregnancy. Being ill and throwing up can also risk pregnancy. If any of these things occur, it is a good idea to use a back up method like condoms.  It is impossible for a women to still have her period if she is pregnant. A period happens because a women has ovulated, and the endometrium lining  has thickened to prepare for implantation of a fertilized egg. When no egg is fertilized, that lining sheds, and that is when you have a period. If a women becomes pregnant, that lining stays in its thickened state, and implantation occurs.  A lot of women experience bleeding during early pregnancy and assume it is a period when it is not.  There is a lot of different reasons that can cause bleeding in early pregnancy that can be confused with a period.   Sometimes, although rarely, a women can experience implantation bleeding. That usually occurs about 2 weeks before your expected period, that is a light spotting.  When was the last time you had sex? If you became pregnant after your last period, it would be to early to be experiencing the pregnancy symptoms you described.  Based of a normal 28 day cycle, you would have ovulated on June 3rd, and you said you started feeling ill on June 5th.   It is very common for women on the pill to experience breakthrough bleeding in the middle of their cycle, which is probably what you were seeing.   However, if you are concerned, espicially if your period is late, you should definatly take a pregnancy test.  Good luck,  Gracie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, We have all heard of someone who reports that they had periods while pregnant and sometimes the memory of them is not exact - may have not actually been as \"typical\" as they believe them to have been.  In actuality what they had was period-like bleeding; not a true period.  One of the most common causes is what we refer to as decidual bleeding. Sometimes your body\u2019s hormones are a little \"off\" and this causes you to lose parts of the lining of your uterus, especially in the early stages of pregnancy, as Gracie described in the implantation stage or before the lining has completely attached to the placenta.  This does often cause stress to the mother since it resembles a miscarriage, but it is generally not thought to be a health threat to you or your baby.  There are other reasons bleeding during pregnancy may occur which are not threatening, but since it can sometimes indicate a complication it is important to be aware of your bleeding and to contact your health care provider, as this member has done. Since your doctor checked the baby and reassured you there was no problem there, he is correct that it is best to not worry about it.  If it continues, I'm sure your doctor would continue to monitor the well-being of the baby and also verify the possibility of a placenta previa or some other condition of concern.    Odd things do happen relating to the constant fluctuation so I won't say there are no cases where a women bleeds monthly throughout the pregnancy but it is extremely rare and probably another type of bleeding; not a true period.  This absence of periods is so typical that it is our primary determination of pregnancy and was long before home pregnancy testing was done.  Thanks for your inquiry.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Im a 31 yr old 36 wk pregnant woman who had been previously diagnosed with panic anxiety disorder. i have not been taking my ssri or benzos since we discovered i was pregnant and although it has taken a lot of behavioral therapy and will power i have managed to avoid the pills the entire pregnancy.  At my regular OBG appt's my blood pressure is always high (one of my triggers are medical appointments) on the first reading done by the machine, but when they give me a few minutes and take a manual reading it has been fine. My last two appointments I had a different nurse who took only one reading (despite being told about the issues) and BP was high enough that they put me on a NST, only to discover the baby was tachycardiac (good variation but originally heart rate of 180 that after an hour on the NST went down to the 140's) my BP also returned to normal within the first of serial readings done every 10 minutes. This has happened at two consecutive OBG appointments now and the doctor has diagnosed me with PIH and is talking about possibly needing to induce at 39 weeks.  I have NO other symptoms of PIH/Pre-E, no headaches, no abnormal swelling, no vision issues, no protein in my urine, my CBC is normal, they even had me do the 24 hour urine test and it came back fine as well.  The baby has gotten 2 additional growth ultrasounds and is measuring just fine. i get weekly amniotic fluid checks and they are right on target as well. My question is this: Couldn't this all be a result of my panic attacks? I have considered taking half of my pre-pregnancy dose of xanax prior to my next appointment to see if it corrects the BP and tachycardia. I know benzos are a class D- I also know the main risk is cleft deformation caused during the first trimester. I am just wondering since class D is trouble for the fetus but allowed when it is causing an issue more serious with the mother if this might be one of those cases. With going into the Doctor and having all of this additional testing done, talk of induction, etc my panic attacks have more than tripled in the last few weeks. I was also concerned that if I do take the xanax and the BP and tachycardia are corrected that I might be \"hiding\" symptoms that are relevant. I don't think xanax is a diuretic and would not lower real hypertension but wanted any advise you may have... Thanks (in case it is relevant I am a military wife and see a different doctor and nurse almost every time so this is like having to explain the entire situation over and over to a new person)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry you are having this trouble.  I understand how difficult communication can be when you change providers regularly.  However, it is important to explain all your symptoms no matter who you are seeing.  You are correct that the benefit to your antianxiety medication very likely would outweigh any potential risk and late in pregnancy I don't think you would do harm anyway.  Drug classification in pregnancy is very inaccurate because it is based on testing and we do not test on pregnant women.  Therefore, safety is the first concern and warnings are included to make sure the patient discusses the medication with the doctor and each case is considered on an individual basis with all the relevant information available.  The manufacturer of the drug cannot claim safety without the routine testing done with other categories of users.    You should always discuss medication with your doctor before taking it and I'm pretty sure it will be fine to do so  unless there are other considerations your doctor is aware of.  I do not think it would mask any serious symptoms.  Having serious anxiety issues when you are about to deliver is not a good idea so treatment is indicated here.  That is my opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course your doctors will be monitoring you for this condition in a future pregnancy just in case but I would not expect the same thing to happen again.  It is probably just due to the way the placenta and cord developed and next time it will likely do well.  The aspirin suggestion is for the possibility that a small blood clot may have been involved in the insufficiency of nutrient transfer to the baby.  I see no problem with going for the low dose aspirin therapy that is often prescribed in such cases as this.  It would not be a full adult dose; just about the equivalent of a \"baby\" aspirin.

    "content": "Dear Debbie Miller  Thank you for the advice.  As we are planning for the second pregnancy after IUGA in the first, we had an appointment with our doctor here. She recommended us some tests prior to trying for pregnancy and at the same time prescribed Aspirin at low doses. We did the same. We are yet to show the results to the doctor, as she is not available for next one week. The Test / Results are as follows...  1. Lupus Anticoagulant - Negative (ratio of LA Screen to LA confirm is 1.02) 2. Anti Cardiolipin Antibody IgG - Negative 3. Anti Cardiolipin Antibody IgM - Moderately Positive (35 MPL) 4. Anti Phospholipids IgM - Negative 5. Anti Phospholipid IgG - Negative 6. Factor XIII - Normal 7. Rubella Antibody IgG - 279 IU/ML.... A result greater than 10 IU/ml is considered positive 8. Protein C Clotting - 95 %  (Reference range = 72 to 160%) 9. Protein S Clotting - Total Protein S - 70% and Free Protein S is 55% 10. Anti-D/S DNA (Immunofluorescence Method) - Negative 11. Anti Nuclear Antibody - Negative  Our doctor also did mention that, in case the results are positive, its better to go for some daily s/c injection of something (i could not make out the name) all through the pregnancy in addition to aspirin..which may be quite expensive.  We would definitely follow the instructions / prescriptions of our doctor. I request you or any other qualified person in this aspect to comment or give your views and advice based on these results.  I look forward to your valued comments.  regards shyla\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The only way to assure no period on your honeymoon is to continue to take the pill throughout that time.  You can do this, missing a period or two by not taking the benign \"sugar\" or reminder pills if your prescription has these.  Just start the active pills immediately after finishing the three weeks of active pills.  You will miss your period for as long as you continue to take these active oral contraceptives.  Once you stop, you will probably have bleeding at that time.    Stopping your pills midway through will be less reliable.  You could have the bleeding but perhaps not.  If your period didn't start, you could still end up with a period on your honeymoon.  So, if it were me with this desire, I would hold off on the discontinuation of the pill.    Good luck on your upcoming marriage.\n\n",

I've been coughing up phlegm, varying in colors from clear, yellow, or green.  When I go to sleep or lay down my cough is much worse.  I don't sleep for more than a couple of hours at a time.  I wake up from coughing and not being able to breath.  For about the first week or so I lost my voice and began coughing.  It just kept getting worse.  I've been taking mucinex, sudafed, robitussin, Tylenol sinus, and benadryl.  Nothing seems to help.  After being sick for about four or five weeks I talked my gyno into giving me a prescription.  I started with tessalon  pearles (forgive my spelling).  It didn't help, so then they gave an antibiotic and tussinex.  During the week I took the last two listed medications, I began to feel much better.  My symptoms started getting better.  The mucus amount began to decrease and started to get clear.  My symptoms never went completely away, but I thought I was getting better.  Since finishing my medicine my symptoms have gotten worse much faster than before.  I called my gyno they don't want to give me any more medicine.  They wanted me to see my family physician.  I called my family doctor they wont even make me an appointment because I'm pregnant.  I'd just like to get another person's advice.  I don't know what to do.  Do you think I should go to the hospital or contact some other doctor?\n\n",

If you are alarmed by package inserts which recommend you not use in pregnancy unless the doctor orders it, that is because we do not test drugs on pregnant women and the manufacturer must post that warning and cannot claim safety.  It does not mean it is dangerous to the baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My period has never been regular. I've had months when I've had two short periods, and other months where I've missed a period entirely. It's been this way since I started having a period. It's normal to me.  In 2000, I found myself in a situation against my will where I became pregnant. I had an abortion. No problems. Now, 9 years later, I'm engaged with a wonderful man, and we're planning on getting married in October.  About two weeks ago, I found out I was pregnant with my fiance. No symptoms, just tender breasts and a random pregnancy test for kicks. A doctor's visit confirmed the pregnancy. And in doing the math, I think I'm almost two months. Not a planned pregnancy, my first decision is to have an abortion, but now I'm sitting here wondering what the risks would be if I decided to continue with the pregnancy? For the past two months, I've been drinking (and holiday drinking no less), smoking a few cigarettes, two instances of marijuana, soda, fast food, etc.? I just haven't been being very healthy lately. Obviously, I've stopped since I found out, but what kind of damage might I be looking at for the potential baby?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The baby has an amazing ability to survive many insults during his/her development.  The nourishment the fetus gets from your blood is not the immediate, direct nourishment you have taken in.  Sometimes the mother suffers because the baby takes the nutrients and she suffers through inadequate calcium or some other nutrient, but this is more likely in the case of severe malnutrition.  Long-term use of drugs, alcohol and smoking is the most dangerous.  We do not know what level is \"safe\" so we advise women to avoid these substances to be certain.  However, 50% of all pregnancies are unplanned and healthy babies are the typical result, regardless of the early use of these substances, assuming they aren't one of the few known teratogens such as thalidamide or even Accutane.  The most important thing to do now is take care of yourself from this point on.  Stopping bad habits now has been shown to make a  positive difference.  To continue to use would increase risks to your baby in ways such as fetal alcohol syndrome.    Take a multivitamin to boost your nutritional status and avoid bad habits.  You should be able to have a healthy pregnancy and you need not fear much more than any expectant mother does.  There is a 3-5% chance of birth defects even among \"perfect\" pregnancies. There's a certain amount of luck involved.  This would certainly in itself not be an indication or induced abortion.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not familiar with this particular drug and suspect it may be a brand only available in some places.  Perhaps someone here can help better if we know the generic name.  But, as for general information, pregnancy drug classifications are very flawed.  We do not do testing on pregnant or lactating women as we do with other adults.  As a result, the drug manufacturers cannot claim safety.  After thousands of women have used a particular drug, for which data is collected by teratology organizations, we are able to feel comfortable about whether or not an increase in birth defects is associated with the drug.  Very few drugs have been identified this way.  Other concerns of course include the possibility that the medication could affect the pregnant mom's blood clotting, putting her at risk for hemorrhage should she miscarry, etc. or some may raise blood pressure, stress the liver or affect the baby in other ways later in the pregnancy.  In this case (very early exposure), chances are good there will be no harmful effects.  Nobody knows exact day of conception so it is possible this occurred even later than she thinks it did.  Another factor is dose specific - the more of a drug one takes in pregnancy, the greater the risk in some cases so stopping the drug is the best course of action and decreases any hypothetical risk  The other important thing to consider is that while we do studies on animals, those studies are with many times greater doses than any human would have for body weight, etc. and they have been shown to NOT be a good indicator of problems in humans at all.  The important thing now is for your sister to take good care of herself through the pregnancy, take a multivitamin and avoid risky behaviors such as smoking (including secondhand), alcohol and recreational drugs among other measures.  I suspect the pregnancy will proceed normally and she will be relieved when she is able to get her mid-pregnancy ultrasound to verify that all organs are formed properly.  Keep in mind that there is a 3-5% rate of birth defects even in \"perfect\" pregnancies with no exposures at all.  It's just the chance we take with pregnancy.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kbqld,  The 4 blood types, A B AB and O, are basically delineated by two antigens or \"markers\" on the red cells.  There are A antigens and B antigens.  Those with blood type O do not have either of these antigens, those with AB have both.  The + or - part of the blood type refers to another antigen referred to as the D antigen.  The Coombs test looks for antibodies that bind to red blood cells.  These antibodies can bind at a number of different sites, not just the D antigen site, so a negative coombs test does not necessarily mean that you are not sensitized to the + factor.  This test would look for antibodies to your red cells but the issue with these sensitizations is that the body forms antibodies to the baby's red cells so the coombs test is not helpful for determining these reactions.  Given that both you and your baby are blood type O, there would not be expected to develop any antibodies against A or B antigens (since your baby's blood does not have these antigens).  This leaves the +/- interaction (along with any possible \"minor\" antigen reactions that are uncommon but can be significant).  The Rhogam injection is an anti-d antigen antibody.  The way it works is that the mother is injected with the anti-D antibody.  Then, if any of baby's blood gets into mother's bloodstream and the baby is D + (has the D antigen on it's blood cells), the D antibody binds to it and \"covers it up\" so that the mother's body never really is able to see it.  This prevents the mother's body from recognizing the D antigen and making antibodies against it on its own.  The Rhogam antibodies then go away after time and the mother no longer has any D antibodies in her blood so the next baby is safe from attack by them.  To determine if you have been sensitized to the D antigen, you need to be tested for anti-D antibodies.  If they are not present, you have not been sensitized to the D antigen.    The extended blood groupings you list are other antigens (some of the \"minor\" antigens).  For this information to be more helpful for you, you would need to know what your children's extended groupings were.  Basically, any time that a mother is negative and a child is positive for an antigen, there is a risk of sensitization.  These antigens are much less common to develop a sensitization to than is the D antigen.  The Kleihauer-betke test (also known as the Kleihauer test) is a test used to look for fetal blood in the mother's blood stream.  Theoretically, if the test were negative, none of the baby's blood entered the mother's bloodstream to start off the sensitization process.  One must be cautious of this, though, since this test is not 100% sensitive.  This issue can be a bit confusing to explain and understand so I hope I have made some sense to you.  To sum up all this, from the information you have given it is not possible to say whether or not you have been sensitized.  Further testing would be needed if you were concerned.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Remember these tests have only been available for a very little while and prior to this, we usually waited much longer to learn of pregnancy.  This is not concerning if you are taking care of yourself, avoiding risky behaviors such as smoking, drugs, and alcohol, and taking a multivitamin in case you do become pregnant.  I assume this is your goal, though you did not indicate your plan.      If you are not pregnant chances are that your periods will resume in a few months.  If not, see your doctor to determine if there is anything that needs attention.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a common abnormality and in most cases the baby is born with no problems - thus, your health care provider's casual response.  Before routine ultrasound scans most people didn't learn of the condition until birth when the nurse counted the vessels and noted whether there were two or three.    There is a slightly higher incidence of other anomalies but the fact that your ultrasound did not reveal any other concerns suggests your case will be one of those that does just fine with only one artery.  It seems the second one is a bonus; kind of like having two kidneys when one will do the job.    The doctor will be watching closely for any unusual findings because of the potential for associated abnormalities.  Sometimes there could be kidney problems so they will watch for fluid problems - either more or less than normal.   Growth is the other concern so this will be monitored as your pregnancy proceeds.  But, as I said, since your ultrasound was normal, chances are great you will not have any problems with your baby.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First let me explain how the classification of drugs works.  In pregnancy, testing is not done on drugs as it is in other cases.  It would not be ethical to test substances on pregnant or lactating women.  However, after thousands of women have been exposed to particular drugs in pregnancy - either due to need (risk vs benefit) or because the woman was unaware of the pregnancy - we are able to get a lot of information.  One thing we have learned is that animal studies have never proven to be reliable for predicting the effect on humans.  They also usually test the animals with huge, unrealistic doses for their size and weight. Kind of makes you wonder why we continue to do this, doesn't it?    Anyway, because standardized, double-blind studies aren't done, the manufacturer of the drug cannot claim safety and so when it is unknown and further testing would need to be done to claim this, the safe course for them is to indicate that the drug should not be taken in pregnancy.  Of course it is best if you take as few as possible to be on the safe side but sometimes the benefits definitely outweigh the potential (theoretical) risks.  Hyperemesis is a dangerous condition for you and you risk serious dehydration so the doctor has to make the call about treating it.  I am not familiar with this particular drug but if it had been shown to be teratogenic (birth defect-causing) your doctor would not have prescribed it and it would be known.    A few medications have been shown to be harmful and any OB would be aware of them.  Accutane and thalidomide are a couple of these.  Some drugs also have been shown to put the mother at risk in one way or another, perhaps by raising blood pressure, but again, I am not aware of such problems with antiemetics (anti-nausea medications).   Whenever you are in doubt, you should discuss this with your doctor.  Let him/her know your worries so you can be properly informed of your treatment options.  Good luck with the pregnancy.\n\n",

My OBGYN says he's never seen this before with no symptoms and he doesn't know what it is but wants be to start on a anti-biotic used to treat mastitis.  It does not itch. I have no fever, no chills.  I am not breast feeding and it does not itch.  It appeared one month ago and has not gone away.  I don't want to take an anti-biotic and subject the baby to it if it won't help.  I scared because my doctor doesn't know what it is, but is not concerned.  Any help would be greatly appreciated! Thank you!\n\n",

There are some rashes that are of unknown causes and you may not find out the reason. Pregnancy can have differing effects on women and many of the quirky symptoms disappear with the delivery of the baby.  This is probably why the doctor is not too worried.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Chances are you are not ovulating every month and you may wish to use an ovulation predictor kit to monitor your basal body temperature which can help you determine your ovulation.  However, if you try for a few months, having regular sexual intercourse and do not become pregnant, you may want to see your doctor for an evaluation of your hormone levels.  You could be a candidate for an ovulation stimulation medication such as Clomid.    It is also ideal if you have a preconception visit with a gynecologist to be sure everything is OK with your health overall.  You could discuss your concerns and the doctor may have suggestions to help you in your efforts.  Good luck.\n\n",

According to my last menstrual cycle, Dec. 19-25, my due date is Sept. 27.  Before I found out that I was pregnant I had gone to visit my ob/gyn for my annual pap smear on Jan. 5.  The tests showed I had bacterial vaginosis, so I was prescribed metronidazole to be taken vaginally once a night for 5 nights.  I can't remember the exact dosage just that it was a whole plunger full.  I took it around Jan. 15-19.  Now that I found out I'm pregnant, I've been really worried about the effects that metronidazole has on fetal development.  I've been researching online but I'm so confused.  Some studies say that there is no significant effects, others say that metronidazole should not be used during the 1st trimester, especially the 1st 3 wks of gestation.  I'm very worried.  I don't want my baby to be born with cancer or deformations.  What's your opinion on this matter?  Do you have any helpful suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This drug has not been associated with an increased risk of birth defects.  However, the safe course and the one most drug manufacturers take is to recommend against taking anything, especially in early pregnancy.    While this has been controversial in the past, currently there is no evidence to suggest harm when taken in pregnancy.  Previous studies have been flawed and it should be noted that regular double-blind drug testing is not done on pregnant and lactating women.  Organizations such as otispregnancy.org track drugs used by pregnant women (after the fact) and they have not seen any major concerns.  This should not pose any additional risk to your baby.  Good luck in your pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is a disorder which may or may not result in problems.  Many women have had normal, healthy pregnancies without even being aware of this malformation of their uterus.  In other cases, miscarriage or infertility issues bring the problem to the forefront and the uterus shape is assumed to be the cause.    There is less room in there so the potential exists for a preterm delivery if there isn't enough room for the baby to grow to term.   Because of this, and given your age, your pregnancy will probably be deemed high risk and you should get early and comprehensive prenatal care with an obstetrician or teen pregnancy clinic which will address your special needs.    Good luck.\n\n",

Knowing your history will help them to be prepared this time for the possible eventuality.  I'm sure they will monitor your clotting factors and observe you closely at delivery and in the postpartum recovery period.  Do not take any aspirin or ibuprofen products to help prevent interference in that way.    The advantages to mother and baby of a normal, vaginal birth far outweight the risks here.  Good luck with the pregnancy.\n\n",

For about the last 5-6 days, I have daily felt achy and almost feverish with not a single other symptom of illness. Unfortunately, I am a resident physician...armed with enough knowledge in this area (I only work above the clavicles) to be dangerous and to make myself worry incessantly. I feel like I've got a bunch of circulating cytokines...just like at the beginning of a cold. So I did a pubmed search on cytokines and early pregnancy, and discovered that this is a big area of research...and that a big inflammatory response against the invading conceptus could be related to early miscarriage. So, my questions are 2: 1) is it common in early pregnancy to feel this way? 2) would a baby aspirin a day help to decrease the inflammatory response without hurting the baby? thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Bljones72,  Welcome to the world of knowing too much.  The symptoms you are feeling may be from a developing cold or may simply be due to the pregnancy itself.  I would recommend, as much as possible for you, not to worry too much about this.  These symptoms certainly do not mean that you are inevitably heading for a miscarriage.  I would not recommend taking a baby aspirin a day.  Aspirin, in general, is contraindicated in pregnancy.  If it needs to be used I would recommend doing so only under the direct supervision of a hematologist or obstetrician knowledgeable about the use of aspirin for anticoagulation in pregnancy.  Best wishes and enjoy your residency.  It's a great time (busy but fun).\n\n",

Be sure to let your obstetrician know that you were taking methotrexate so your doctor can appropriately look for any issues that may have developed.   Before worrying too much about this though, know that the resulting problems are not a 100% guarantee.  There is still a very good chance that everything will be fine.  Your obstetrician can give you more specific information about your case.  And, as I'm sure you know, I would strongly recommend against taking anymore methotrexate during your pregnancy.

    "content": "I started my prenatal care late in my pregnancy due to some insurance issues and was unsure of my last menstrual period or the time that I actually conceived my baby. I visited a hospital E.R near my home for pain that is not my normal hospital or the hospital that I am going to be delivering at before I started seeing my OB and they gave me an ultrasound and told me that I was 27 weeks. I had an ultrasound yesterday at the hospital that I now receive prenatal care for and they confirmed the dates and told me that I was 35 weeks and 1 day and that they agreed with the dates of the original ultrasound. When I went to visit my doctor for my normal checkup today he wanted to do an amnio scentesis to make sure that the ultrasounds were correct and that my baby wasn't going to be premature at the time of my delivery. I have had two previous c-sections and I've seen a specialist who told me that it was impossible to have a normal vaginal delivery, and also had to be induced for both of my deliveries. I wasn't comfortable with having the amnio and denied the treatment. The doctor told me that since I wasn't going to have the amnio at 49 weeks they would not schedule my s-section and I would have to wait until I went into labor, or wait until I was 42 weeks for them to deliver my baby. Will I even go into labor naturally since my body did not go into labor with my other two children? He told me that the risks of going into labor on my own and not having the amnio were bleeding and my uterus possibly rupturing but also told me that it was a low risk of about 1%. No matter how low the risk is it's very scary for me and I'm now really nervous about this whole thing and wondering if I'm making the wrong decision by choosing not to have the amnio to make sure the babies lungs are developed. However I have talked to other doctors who have told me that the amnio was dangerous at this time in my pregnancy, though my doctor denies that.  Do all hospitals not schedule you for a c-section if you deny having the amnio because the baby could possibly be premature and make you wait 42 weeks or is this just something my doctor and the hospital I'm delivering at do? Also will waiting 42 weeks be dangerous for me or my baby because of size or any other complications that could occur? Though they fear my baby could be premature I have been reassured by the ultrasound techs that the baby is indeed 35 weeks. Why isn't this enough for them. I'm so confused...Any advise is appreciated. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most hospitals and obstetricians feel comfortable scheduling a planned repeat c-section at 39 completed weeks.  There are risks of going past your due date so if there is confirmation of dates by ultrasound it is usually very safe to go ahead at 39+ weeks without waiting to 42 weeks.    If you are not comfortable with the care you are receiving you can always change providers, even at a late date in the pregnancy.  It is important for you to have confidence in your doctor.   If he/she does not explain well the reason they believe waiting is needed, this may be reason enough.  Amnio does come with risks so you should not be made to feel guilty about this decision.

Secondly, since you declined the amnio the DR only has a clue as to how far along you are  for liability reasons he IS NOT willing to deliver your baby without KNOWING 100% how far along you are.   The purpose of the amnio was to determine the maturity of your babys lungs. this would assure the dr that your baby was physically ready to be born or if your baby needed more time in utero   I completly understand your drs refusal to deliver because he is looking out for the best interests of your child and for liabilty issues.   No offense but the risks of amnio are not that high at your gestation and they are far less than the complications of delivering a premature infant  I think your dr is 100% correct and you really need to understand the big picture here THE HEALTH OF YOUR CHILD\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This guest is correct that it is important the baby not be delivered prematurely, a possibility when dates are not accurate and ultrasound does have a two week window of error.  This is the reason you should not be induced prior to 39 completed weeks at the earliest unless there are medical risks involved. Usually that assures the baby has completed at least 37 weeks' gestation even at the outside limits of dating error.  Of course there could always be additional factors here that your doctor is aware of and perhaps has not shared with you.  This is why communication between doctor and patient is essential.    To further clarify the indications for repeat c-section vs VBAC (Vaginal birth after Cesarean), this guest is correct that spontaneous vaginal birth is possible and with little risk even after repeat cesareans, especially since you have given birth this way in the past.  However, getting a doctor and hospital to agree to this is another issue sometimes.  While many support a decision to do a trial of labor, often with the requirement that the labor is spontaneous; not induced, a few years ago ACOG (American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology) issued a statement that has resulted in a huge decline in VBAC births and increase in repeat C-sections, bringing the U.S. to an all-time surgical delivery high.    Their guidelines indicated that a repeat c-section after c-section should be the standard unless the facility is equipped with a surgeon immediately available along with anesthesia and facilities should a cesarean be needed.  They further recommended against VBAC following more than one cesarean birth.  The result is that most smaller facilities refused VBACs even among mothers who have previously had a successful VBAC.  They defined \"immediate\" as having a doctor and anesthesiologist on site throughout the woman's labor; not just on call.  Since many smaller facilities with limited numbers of deliveries do not have that luxury, they created policy prohibiting VBACs in their facilities.    This is believed to be primarily due to liability issues.  The risks of surgical delivery are less likely to result in legal recourse than the risks that MIGHT be associated with a VBAC, the primary concern being a very slight increased risk of the serious complication of uterine rupture in the latter - something that even occurs in women who have never had a cesarean.  Surgical complications are less likely to be blamed on the doctor or facility whereas attorneys may claim they might have prevented complications resulting from a VBAC, had the decision been made to do a repeat C-section.  I am not saying this is right; just that this is what motivates in today's U.S. liability-conscious medical world.    Rumor has it that ACOG will likely revise their statement in 2010 in response to the fallout from the previous statement which appears to be an overreaction to potential risks with little regard for benefits of VBAC and risks of repeat cesarean, especially as it relates to future deliveries, should the parents desire a larger family.   In the future we may see another decline in cesarean rates as more women are allowed to delivery naturally.    But, other factors come into play as well when parents want to be in control of when their baby is born to accommodate schedules (theirs, their family's, the doctor's). They are often afraid of labor and delivery and even choose cesarean because they are more comfortable with it because they feel more in control, even though recovery is much more difficult, painful and with potential complications.  People these days are not patient to let nature take its course and there is also an increased risk for babies who truly are post-dates.  Optimal delivery of an infant is 39-40 weeks completed gestation.  When a woman is 38 uncomfortable weeks pregnant and the doctor tells her s/he can deliver next week on Tuesday (for example) if it is by cesarean, or she can wait and see if she goes into labor spontaneously, risking a delivery up to three weeks later by her doctor's associate because her doctor may not be on call or available, the decision tends to go in favor of the repeat.  Ethical issues are at play because it can be in the physician's best interest (and even the facility) from a financial, scheduling/time perspective to do a cesarean.  The amnio is one way for the doctor to feel confident that they are not jumping the gun and if a repeat is the only delivery method available to her (either because of doctor, hospital policy or personal health history, baby position, etc.).  Though very small, there are some risks with the amnio and if this is the only way her doctor will do the earlier cesarean, he is being cautious about potential preterm delivery and her only alternative is to wait it out, get further clarification, or find a doctor she can feel more confident with.  If a baby were to be stillborn or the baby were to aspirate meconium because the delivery was delayed to 42 weeks, this too would be a tragedy.  It's always a judgment call which is difficult since we have no guarantees in this.   It is truly my hope that the revised ACOG guidelines will help this cause but in the meantime we have to work within the limitations we have and not knowing the policies of this woman's delivering facility, I could not advise otherwise.    I hope this clarifies the situation a bit.  Good luck.\n\n",

The only thing that was explained to me was that my placenta was inflamed which means it was infected or had some type of bacteria but they didnt know what. What we think happened was that my water broke, but it leaked little by little without me noticing. It propably leaked for a week or so, without me noticing, since it was coming out in little amounts. And since there was that opening in the sac for a long time, bacteria got inside and into the placenta which infected it. i don't know if this was your case, but i thought it could help you to find another reason of what it could be. Ask your doctor if it could have been this, maybe it was or maybe not!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, HCG levels alone cannot answer your questions.  There are parameters that help diagnose pregnancy vs miscarriage but if there is implantation in the fallopian tube (ectopic) the lab value alone will not diagnose it.  These are just part of the whole picture.  In a pregnancy, the values typically double every couple of days; otherwise it is likely not a viable pregnancy but sometimes only time can tell since some women have lower levels.  The pattern is the most significant part and that is why your doctor is recommending another test.  I'm not understanding  your question about clomid.  Of course you can be pregnant on it since that is the purpose for which it is prescribed.  But, the HCG levels are not looking like you are pregnant now.  I would follow the advice of your physician who has the advantage of your health history and physical exam.  Sometimes ectopic is diagnosed by ultrasound; often pain is what alerts you to seek help.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your doctor should have discussed this with you and made sure you had a plan for contraception.  You definitely can become pregnant soon after giving birth, especially if you are not exclusively breastfeeding your baby, which usually delays the return of ovulation.  I know it may be a shock at first but you will adjust in time and close spacing, while not ideal, can be just fine.  It is estimated that around 50% of all U.S. pregnancies are unplanned.  Yet, most women and infants do fine once they get used to the idea and get the help they need.  Consider a counselor or talk to your doctor or trusted family member, clergy, etc. about your fears.  If you are indeed pregnant (and positive pregnancy tests are usually accurate 4-5 weeks after the last period), be sure to take vitamins every day and get prenatal care by about 12 weeks.   At the next delivery, please breastfeed for the best outcome for both you and your baby and use condoms or other protection when you begin to have sex again.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Between periods I have had some spotting but I have had this since starting the pill. I havent had any other common pregnancy sympotms. Could I be pregnant or is the irregular period due to the pill?

    "content": "Hello, I think you can rest easy that you are not pregnant.  The pill is a very effective method and used properly has only a 1% failure rate.  In addition, the likelihood of fertilization without intercourse is practically nonexistent.  The sperm needs a pretty friendly environment to travel up through the vagina and cervix.  Placement pretty much needs to be in that area for pregnancy to occur.    The combination of no intercourse and the pill makes this practically impossible.  Your period fluctuation is pretty surely caused by the pill and is nothing to worry about.  Things will probably level out a bit over the first few months of pill use and you will find out what is now your \"normal\" cycle soon.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Age of gestation was determined only from vaginal exam and vaginal sonogram because at The time I was having an ongoing menstral (the whole month of December) and normal periods for the 3 months prior.  Though there was a split sack (with an obvious baby in one and some tissue in the other), there was only one heartbeat detected through vaginal sonogram.

    "title": "Vanishing Twin Syndrome + High HCG",
    "content": "Hello, These are good questions.  First let me remind you that lab values are important but only part of the whole health/illness picture.  Each person has their own curve when it comes to HCG levels so while a pattern can help determine a viable pregnancy vs miscarriage, the values, especially in the case of vanishing twin or other complications can vary greatly.  Other lab values vary with the particular lab and their controls so it requires a doctor to explain them, in light of the lab particulars.   The values are really only useful as part of the physical exam and other findings from history, symptoms, etc.  It is misleading to try to interpret these alone and if labs told the whole story, technicians could do most of our health care.  Draw blood, get results and recommend action if needed.    Some experts believe that vanishing twin syndrome may occur in as many as 1/3 of all multiple gestations, often occurring before the woman is aware there were multiple fetuses.  In days past, most women did not receive pregnancy confirmation until they had missed a second period.  By then, this may have already occurred while she was unaware.    If it happens in the first trimester there is rarely any problem with the remaining fetus and the additional, non-viable one is reabsorbed into the placenta.   Later in the pregnancy there is a chance it could cause problems and sometimes the twin is removed surgically, though this is not without risks to the surviving twin.  Without intervention it would be impossible to predict your odds of carrying to term.  Minor bleeding happens in healthy pregnancies as well as impending miscarriage.  Only time will tell and unfortunately, there is little to be done to intervene if loss is inevitable.  Just do what you can to be healthy, eat good foods, take a daily vitamin, get exercise but not too strenuous, avoid bad habits such as smoking, drinking, drugs and use your seatbelt.  These are things you CAN do to make a difference.  Try not to dwell on the things you can't change.  High stress hormones are not so good on you or your pregnancy.  Best wishes\n\n",

However, the result from her blood test is still giving out positif result as follows:  Anti-Toxoplasma IgG = 141 Anti-Toxoplasma IgM = 1.04 (previously it was 1.08) Anti-Toxoplasma IgG Avidity = 0.677 (High Avidity)  I was wondering if it is actually safe for us to start trying to have a baby? What are the chances for it to affect the baby? What is the solution to treat this disease?

    "content": "Hello, Because these antibody tests can be difficult to interpret, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommends that all positive results be confirmed by a laboratory that specializes in diagnosing toxoplasmosis.  I assume this was the case but you also need someone skilled at interpreting these hard to understand results.  Positive testing can merely show there has been infection in the past and immunity is now present; not just that there is current infection with this parasite.  High avidity actually means immunity to the disease so that in itself would not be cause to delay pregnancy.  It is helpful in confirming the diagnosis and to know that treatment was appropriate.  But, as for residual risk for pregnancy, you would need to consult with her infectious disease doctor to examine the lab results.  From what I see, it just states recent infection and I don't know of any particular recommendation for spacing between infection and conception.   I'm sorry I'm not able to fully answer your question but it would be worthwhile to discuss it in detail with her doctor.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am researching info on Topamax. I've been talking with my docs a bit and they are helping me, but I think I am on the edge of giving one of them an ulcer. I've had horribly severe migraine since a jaw injury and for nine years it seemed nothing we did from radiofrequency ablation to even resetting my jaw helped the migraines.   They were able to fix the jaw pain, but not stop the migraine pain which I just woke up with after a dental procedure with sedation. We tried multiple meds over and over (100+) and re-tried Topamax for the third time about six weeks ago. I had no expectations for it, but had been tracking my migraines and talked with the neuro and he thought I was now getting clusters with migraine together. Unbelievably so it is like they have nearly vanished with this round of Topamax. I had a hard bout with side effects and my neuro really worked with the dosage until he could get me to 100mg or as close to it and we are there and I am so well.   I am marrying in a few short months and my fiance and I just assumed we would not have any children because I was constantly so unwell in and out of hospital vomiting and sick to the point they can not even get IVs they go straight for PICCs and this is really just unbelievable for me to have sustained relief. We so badly want to have a family and I gave up grad school to be an NP because of the migraines, missed out on a career, etc and we would love to shoot for a family.   The ob/gyn said I would need to really coordinate with she and the neuro, but didn't seem comfortable stating much beyond that. All that I am reading states it is a class C drug. Didn't go well with animal studies. I have scanned lots of web pages with personal testimonies some good some bad where for one person it went great another it went poorly and am seeing that it seems folic acid is important I am on a prenatal that the ob/gyn put me on because of ortho evra/topomax interaction for added safety with folic, but would like to hear if someone could weigh in on if these studies were looking at what I assume is really high dosage of topamax in animals and with the women recorded in pharmaceutical studies coming out are these much larger doses than what I am on (100mg)? I feel so excited that I am FINALLY well, and so concerned that I may have now created a catch 22 of sorts!? I also understand that benefit sometimes outweighs risks, but I don't want to be selfish and harm a baby because of the Topamax either. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Risk of problems in pregnancy due to Topamax use is theoretical and there are no red flags, according to teratology resources I contacted about it.    You are correct that this is a low dose which would further reduce any possible risk and the benefits to you will surely outweigh, since they are known, while risks from this medication are not apparent.  Studies are not done on pregnant or breastfeeding women but this information about birth defects and pregnancy history is collected after pregnant women have used a medication, either because they needed it or did not know they were pregnant.  So, while these are not studies that would permit the drug manufacturer to state in labeling that it is safe in pregnancy you should be just fine to continue to use it, thereby reducing the risk of your illness which ultimately could be harmful to the baby.  You would also be fine to take the medication while lactating which has huge benefits for both mother and baby.    I agree with the folic acid supplementation.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Ideally you would discuss your concerns with your wife's doctor.  I am not familiar with this term \"seborrheic\" hemorrhage, but I suspect there was indication that there had been a bleed at one point which has healed over and is no longer a concern.  If it were a serious problem, I am sure your doctor would not be this casual about it.  I understand your concerns with the clotting disorder.  Perhaps the hemorrhage resulted because of the blood thinner but women sometimes have a placental tear or hemorrhage with no other risk factors or medication so we can't say for sure.  Tell your wife not to hesitate bringing the questions to her doctor.  That's why she has a doctor to help her through the complications of the natural process of childbirth.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Yes, it is possible to conceive with PCOS - plenty of women do.  But, it can be more difficult, as you have learned.  You should be evaluated by a gynecologist to see if you might benefit from treatment with Glucophage or Metformin because PCOS is partially caused by insulin resistence.  Many doctors also prescribe an ovulation stimulation medication such as Clomid to aid in conception.  These medications must be taken as prescribed by your doctor.  The potential risk is for multiples (and that means a higher risk of miscarriage, preterm delivery and infant mortality).  But, when properly administered and monitored it often results in a successful pregnancy.  Best wishes and good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since we do not do scientific studies of medications on pregnant or lactating women, our information is limited.  It is considered to be one of those areas where risks and benefits must be weighed.  If the mother needs the medication for her health, the benefit may outweigh any potential risk.  These drugs have not been reported as definitely being teratogenic (causing birth defects) but we usually take the cautious approach and suggest only taking meds when truly needed during pregnancy.  Even less information is available about the father's involvement.  Since a blood supply is not connecting between the father and the baby, it is rare for a substance he has used to be a problem with the fetus.  There are drugs that can damage the sperm and/or make the man infertile.  I have seen no literature to this effect with HGH.  If you take this drug and anticipate or are already pregnant, be sure to discuss it with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would not expect any complications from your delivery at this point.  If you are constipated there are measures you can take that should help.  Take a fiber supplement daily (like Metamucil) and improve your diets with the addition of fruits, vegetables, whole grains and more water.  Exercise daily.    If there is vaginal swelling, you will need to have your doctor examine you.  Again, I don't believe this is related to a delivery four months ago.  Perhaps you are having a hypersensitive reaction.  Try to avoid offenders such as perfumed products (including tampons and pads, underwear, toilet tissue), too-tight pants, etc.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm new to this whole new pregnancy thing and I was wondering if I could get some answers. Well, I'm 30 weeks pregnant and just 2 days ago, it was very painful to stand or even walk. I had to walk as slow as possible and this has never happened to me before. The pains occurred mainly on the left side of my body. Also, when sleeping in bed, I found it very uncomfortable to turn without feeling sharp pains on my left side as well. They slowly started disappearing the next day, but still there were little pains. Also, when I yawn or breathe deeply, I find this small pain on the left side of my lower back. I would breathe in and all of a sudden, a burst of pain. And lastly, I find that my baby isn't kicking as much as she did earlier in my pregnancy. I'm just wondering, are these all normal? Should I be worried? Please answer me! Thank you! Also, Merry Christmas everyone! Oh, one more thing, sex will not cause a miscarriage right? My side started hurting during sex with my hubby, is that bad? Or is it telling me I should be in a more comfortable position?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, First of all, sex will not harm the baby unless you are having some complications that have caused your doctor to prescribe pelvic rest.  Sometimes this is needed in cases such as placenta previa or incompetent cervix.  If you had these conditions your doctor would have told you.  Comfort is another matter and you need to experiment with positions.  Many couples find it works better to use a \"rear entry\" or sidelying position.  As for the pain, it is always best to check these things out. Many times pain is just the result of stretching ligaments, position of baby on nerves and spine, etc. but there are times when acute abdominal pain can be serious so you should see your doctor.  You should also be doing kick counts and if it seems your baby's movement has decreased a bit, this is another reason to have it checked out.  Either call your doctor or go straight to the labor and delivery area of your delivery hospital and let the nurses know what your concerns are.  They can evaluate you and determine if your baby is being stressed for some reason.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Can someone tell me if the following situation is possible?  My wife had consistently taken the pill, without a break for over 6 years. Over that time, if she has ever missed a day (which was rare) she would double up on her pill intake. In that time she had never gotten pregnant.   For the last year or two, of those 6 years, she had been prescribed Ortho Tricyclin. Near the end of this period she required antibiotics (a penicillin derivative of some kind) for a lung infection. We had not been having sexual intercourse for about 3 months and she was still taking her pill regularly. However, we did have sex once, in the middle of the time she was on antibiotics. Six to eight week later she was pregnant, swearing that she had not adjusted her use of the pill.  My question is, how plausible is this?  This all happened years ago and I have two beautiful young children now, that I would never be without. However, my wife had used deception a number of times in the past, prior to this, to keep me near her family's town and quash jobs I have been offered that would require me to travel. I found out recently that she had confided in a friend, before we married, that she would do whatever it took to build a life with me.  The lies she has told to get things her way have generated a lot of tension in our relationship and prior to our having any children we were on the verge of divorce. However, she knows that I would never see a child of mine grow up without a father and this all seemed amazingly well timed to coincide with a move I had planned at that time, prior to being told she was pregnant with our first child. I feel I have a right to know if her claims are plausible (In other words, this truly was an amazing series of coincidences) or was this another cooked up scenario, tailor made to leverage my belief in being a good father. This won't effect my commitment to my kids, but I do want to know whom I am dealing with when it comes to my wife's tactics in the long run.  Many thanks, Needs Some Honesty\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The chances of pregnancy while taking the pill are about 1%.  In other words, of 100 women taking the pill as prescribed, one will become pregnant in the year.  So, while it is a reliable method, it is not perfect so pregnancy can and does occur while taking the pill.  Antibiotics have been shown to decrease the effectiveness a bit, but it has also appeared to be mostly with a rarely used antibiotic, Rifampin.  This did lead us to wonder if others might also decrease the contraceptive ability of the pill.  We don't know definitively, partly because some become pregnant anyway - even without antibiotics.  So, it would be difficult to determine without some more extensive study, if it was related to the antibiotic use or just the random 1% pregnancy.  If you have relationship issues and trust is a concern, I would recommend couples thereapy with a certified family counselor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is always possible that a sensitivity can be there, though this would not be a common thing.  If you no longer need the cream and after discontinuing its use he is still having this problem, chances are it is unrelated as an allergic reaction should not persist after the offending agent is removed and should gradually heal.  He could also take Benadryl or another antihistamine to see if that helps speed up the resolution of itching.  Beyond this, consider any other exposure such as soaps or personal hygiene products, laundry detergent, etc. and encourage him to wash after sex to see if that helps.  Best wishes.\n\n",

On November 8th i still did not receive my period and took a home pregnancy test that turned out negative. I started experiencing headaches, lower back ache, and period cramping. My breasts are heavier but not sore or tender and I don't \"feel\" pregnant (I have a 2 year old and have experienced pregnancy before) . On November 12 (now 8 days after period) I took another pregnancy test where the result was negative. I went to the doctor who ordered a blood test and an ultrasound. I am waiting for the blood test results still, but he told me that if it comes back negative I most likely had a miscarriage in which case he would send me for a DNC. I can't even stomach the thought of getting this done. Is it possible to still be pregnant even if the blood test result comes back negative?  also, is a DNC necessary if i did have a miscarriage or can i let things happen naturally?\n\n",

It seems unlikely a D&C would be needed and in most cases of early miscarriage the body takes care of it without intervention.  Only when it is clear there was not complete evacuation of the contents of the uterus or infection or bleeding are concerns is it needed.

It is a common misconception that every woman ovulates at day 14 of her cycle.  There is wide variation here and there is slight variation at the cellular level as well.  In some cases the fertilized ovum does not implant at all and an early miscarriage happens.  It's just normal variation of the miracle of conception, development, and childbearing.

    "content": "Hello,  My last pregnancy (april 2008) ended in a 2nd trimester loss due to uterine incarceration.  I am now pregnant again (almost 10 weeks) and am very worried about recurrence.  My previous obstetrician was not familiar with the condition therefore I did not receive the care needed to keep my baby alive (manually moving the uterus off of the sacrum).  I have now changed to a different provider and had my first appt today and this dr is also not very familiar with this condition.  I was hoping to work out a game plan with him as far as evaluating the pregnancy before incarceration were to occur and a plan of action if it did occur again.    I have spent countless hours researching medical journals and obstetrical text books but I still have a lot of questions and I can't find the answers.  My main question - when should manipulation of the uterus should be done if incarceration is diagnosed?  It is estimated that my last baby died around 14 weeks and 3 days although we did not find out until 18 weeks and 3 days.  I don't even have my next appt until I'm almost 13 weeks.  My last dr wanted to wait until 15 weeks to act on this pregnancy but that would have been too late last time.  Also, is there anything that I can do to prevent this from happening again?  It already feels the same.  I can feel the severe pressure on my bladder and I'm in constant discomfort.  It led to sever urinary retention last time with a complete loss of the ability to urinate.\n\n",

I will just be sitting there working, and my eyes will just kind of go out of focus (fairly regular, mostly throughout the second half of the day, after I have eaten), accompianied by dizzy or lightheaded feeling a lot. My eyes also feel strained a lot throughout the day as well as feeling nausea sometimes. After the baby, my first few menstrual periods were normal, and then my last one, which came at the scheduled time, there was hardly anything there! I checked two different times to make sure I wasen't pregnant. I also seem to be more sensitive to smell as well as noise - the loud noise hurts my ears more. Again, these are more noticeable at work. Any ideas? I am not really in the financial state to have anyone run a lot of tests, since I have such a variety of symtoms. Hopefully you can help!

    "content": "Hello, Have you discussed these things with your coworkers to see if anyone else has experienced similar symptoms?  That would help you determine if it was an environmental issue.  If so, you could ask your local health department to look into environmental concerns there.    The period is probably just normal fluctuation.  Most women report unusual periods at times and this is considered within the normal limits.  It could also vary if you use hormonal contraceptives or the Mirena IUD.  These often result in reduced flow after a period of adjustment.   As you said, vague and varied symptoms can be hard to pin down but a good overall physical exam with a family practice doctor could rule out some of the more typical concerns, anemia, thyroid dysfunction, etc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The GI system (stomach, bowels, intestines) do make movements that truly are similar to feelings of fetal movement.   When you are acutely aware that the possibility of pregnancy exists, you can be especially tuned into such feelings and it is confusing.  If pregnancy tests are negative and you haven't had other symptoms you can probably rest assured it is normal peristaltic movement as food, gas, etc. passes through the system.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Four months after giving birth to my fourth child, I began sweating profusely all over my body.  Palms and feet not really affected.  I can feel the eminating from my scalp as well as my back.  After I sweat (drip sweat), I go through these terrible chills where I even tremble. My hands shake  because I'm freezing.  My fingers get \"ice\" cold as well. I've seen a number of doctors from general practitioner to ob-gyn to endocrinologist to acupuncturist.  All have just pushed me away because they can't really find anything wrong with me... I am so healthy that I've been literally told they can't help me at all.  But something is wrong,  there has to be something causing me to sweat a lot.  I'm on my 9th month now.  I sweat everyday and throughout the day.  I've tried paxil - no help, I've tried chinese herbal teas - no help.  Right now I'm trying sage tea.  I don't mind spending the money to see a doctor, but I need it to be the right doctor that will help me get back to normal..... take these sweats away. P.S.  I've also had an MRI done to my brain - NO abnormalities...everything is perfectly fine. Thanks, lg\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I too am puzzled since you have already seen specialists about this.  The good news is that if there were a serious problem, they likely would have picked up on it so it sounds like something hormonal to me.  Women's hormones can do weird things for sure.  Have you ever tried birth control pills to see if regulating these hormones helps at all?  I assume they have ruled out infections such as TB.    In the meantime I would keep a record of when these events occur and give as much detail as possible regarding your physical environment, food eaten and drunk, use of alcohol or drugs, emotional state, date and time.  This may help ultimately in finding the cause.  I might try an internal medicine doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, At this point the results are not significant but could be a warning of things to come.  I'm sure your doctor will want to continue to monitor you for other symptoms of gestational diabetes as you progress in your pregnancy.  This could be a risk factor for you but it typically shows up in the last trimester.  Your blood pressure will be monitored throughout your care.  It is important to stay well-hydrated as dehydration will also affect your urine testing, suggesting problems that may not be there in actuality.  Urine should be colorless or very pale yellow.  Anything darker indicates inadequate fluid intake.  There is no exact amount of water you should take in but monitoring urine color helps you to regulate it for yourself as an individual.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a mother of two with a Mirena IUC that was inserted in late 2006.  I have never had regular periods, but when I have had them they have normally been heavy and unpleasant, .  However, for the past few months I have had very light periods (if I have had them at all), and my grandmother continued to have periods during her pregnancies (weird but true; everyone's body is different).  I've been having a lot of the other symptoms that I had when I was pregnant before - the exhaustion, the moodiness, the bloating, the hard-to-pin-down feeling of pregnancy, and the migraines (which are the substitute for morning sickness in my family), not to mention increased heartburn (hiatal hernias also run in my family, so heartburn is run-of-the-mill, but not this bad).  I have back problems from a herniated and ruptured L5 disk in my back that was repaired surgically in 2005; however, what is normally a niggling pain has gotten nearly unbearable for abnormal amounts of time (I have occasional episodes, but they have grown more frequent recently).  For the past few weeks I've been feeling movement that has been growing stronger and stronger; and my belly has been growing slightly over the past few weeks (my clothes are starting to get tighter); however, I have taken several pregnancy tests over the past few months that have all come out negative.  It has been a few weeks since I took one.  The thing is that I have no idea how far along I would be, since I've never been regular with my periods.  I also know that Mirena slightly raises the possibility of ectopic pregnancy, which would explain false negatives on tests - however, I haven't experienced any of the other symptoms of ectopic pregnancy (such as pain in the shoulder).  I know it is a very effective method of birth control and that it is highly unlikely that I am pregnant; however, I am going with what I know.  I also have ovarian cysts that are likely a result of the IUC, and I know that a pulsating sensation in the abdomen can be a symptom of those getting out of hand, but I don't know that they would explain the other symptoms.  I have no medical insurance and cannot just go get an ultrasound (I am a working mother of two in the middle of a custody battle for one).  I have been ignoring this for a long time and have not yet mentioned it to my live-in boyfriend because I am worried that I'm just losing my mind and that he'll think that I've gotten paranoid; however, if I am pregnant and I have gotten far enough along to feel movement (I felt it around fifteen weeks with my second child) and to have started to show a little (I'm able to suck it in some, but it's getting hard) then I'm risking both my health (with my various problems) and my child's to sit around and wait.  (Not to mention that I have no idea what the IUC would do to a pregnancy that actually commenced despite its presence.)  I am really stumped, and I'm afraid to bring it up to anyone I know.  Please, someone say something, because I'm terrified.\n\n",

    "title": "Potentially pregnant with IUC",
    "content": "Hello, You are right that this is a very effective method of birth control, but no method is 100% except abstinence so of course there is always the possibility and whenever you have symptoms of pregnancy you should be tested.  A blood test can be more accurate, earlier, than the urine test so if you are doubtful, get that done.  Some clinics or hospitals may even offer free pregnancy testing.  You could inquire with your local health department about such services.  One thing about having borne a child in the past is that it makes you very conscious of subtle abdominal feelings and changes.  Even women who are post-menopausal sometimes feel sensations that feel exactly like the movement of the baby they felt when they were younger and pregnant.  This is also the reason women sometimes question if they are feeling movement early in pregnancy the first time - it isn't an obvious \"kick\" and they have felt such sensations previously.  The bowel and stomach with it's movements and gases that go with the digestive process can very much mimic fetal movement.  If a woman becomes pregnant with the Mirena still intact, it can sometimes be removed.  The process may result in a miscarriage, but if not, there is also the chance it will be delivered with the baby.    The fact that you still have some periods leads me to think probably not pregnancy.  Most women report lighter periods after the first six months or so of the IUD placement.  Again, take the test if in doubt because there is a failure rate of about 1%.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Unfortunately, in the month of conception (October), we ate the swordfish for 4 times (once a week), and my wife has about 6-ounce swordfish each time.    We didn't know that swordfish has a large amount of mercury and should be definitely avoided for pregnancy, according to FDA.  What shall we do then? Is there any testing to check the mercury level in my wife\u2019s body or the baby\u2019s body?  When can we find it out, if the baby has been affected by the mercury and become unhealthy?

    "content": "Hello, I would not be overly concerned about this.  The amount of exposure over time is the more significant factor - as in throughout the pregnancy.  While swordfish is one of the larger fish with more likelihood than some others to contain mercury it is possible your wife did not consume contaminated fish.  What's more, recently it has been discovered that there appears to be a protective factor in the healthy omega 3 fatty acids found in fish that probably discounts the mercury concerns.  At least it appears that the benefits outweigh the risks, based on studies in countries where fish is a mainstay of the diet and women consume large amounts of the potentially contaminated fish.  More is sure to come from these studies in the future so, in the meantime, it is good for pregnant women  to avoid these types of fish and opt for less contaminated types just to be on the safe side.  The main thing here is, avoid the swordfish, tilefish, shark and king mackerel in the future but do take omega 3 rich fish that are lower in mercury contamination because of the health benefits.  Fish oil capsules can also be used.  I know of no test to determine this now but the main concern is cumulative so avoiding additional exposure to mercury is the best course of action now.    Not all possible effects of prenatal mercury exposure is even known.  It is believed that it would require substantially high levels to actually cause deficits in IQ - higher than what most women might consume.  Try to just enjoy the journey and your baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Perhaps your midwife was a direct entry or \"lay\" midwife as opposed to a certified nurse midwife.  The latter is always affiliated with a doctor to deliver when the pregnancy has complications or requires a c-section.  You didn't say why she won't be able to deliver your child.  Have you developed serious complications?  You should be able to get in to see a doctor even at this late date.  You may need to call a few but let them know your prenatal care provider is no longer willing/able to care for you in your pregnancy.    Often women move to a new location prior to delivering their babies and they are able to get in for care even in the last trimester.  Call your local hospital or if you have insurance you could find a provider listing and inquire about someone who would be available for your care.    If after explaining your situation the office refuses to schedule you for an appointment, call your local hospital labor and delivery unit and explain your dilemma to the nurses who can probably refer you to a provider.   If you happen to go into labor without a doctor caring for you, go to the hospital where your insurance covers (if you have insurance) or to any  facility.  They will find a doctor to care for you in the hospital.  It would be much better if you can arrange this in advance but in the worst case scenario of a surprise, early labor, this would be a possibility.  If you have a teaching hospital associated with a university, this can be a good place to start.    Best of luck to you.  Let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Since you have conceived previously there is a good chance you can again though many women do experience infertility.  With this condition your risk of fetal loss is fairly high and your pregnancy would be classified as high risk.  You should see a specialist who would follow you closely and monitor any signs that your baby was in distress.  By knowing what you are dealing with there is a better chance of early detection of concerns.  There is a certain degree of risk involved but if you are wanting to bear a child it may be worth the effort and the potential problems.

I doubt it has anything to do with your pregnancy and following your recent visit with your doctor, it is probably not a urinary tract infection.  It sounds like normal variation to me.

    "content": "Hello, I cannot say why you are having pain but it is unlikely you are pregnant.  Most women who get pregnant following tubal ligation do so within the first year or so of the procedure.  After a time, things have usually healed over to the point that it is not possible.    You should see your doctor if the pain continues as the abdomen contains many organs which can have problems - bowel, urinary, gall bladder, digestive systems just to name a few.  Ongoing pain of this type should be checked out but would be a very unusual early symptom of pregnancy.  Best wishes\n\n",

Sometimes a light colored stool can be associated with gall bladder disease so if it continues, you should have it checked. Only rarely is stool color variations a serious concern in the absence of other symptoms.  Black, tarry stools can mean internal bleeding such ulcers and light stools can be associated with malabsorption.  This is not common and unrelated to the miscarriage.   Best wishes.\n\n",

HOWEVER, the sonographer told me my cervix is very short and could only measure it at 1.6 cm. She told me to make an appt as soon as possible to discuss options with my doctor. (ie cerclage)  I called my dr office today (my husband is in the navy, so we have to deal with a 'pick a number deli style system' and they said to just watch the spotting and keep my 10 week 3 day appointment and they would discuss this with me then.  My questions are- will I be able to make it to 10 weeks? Why was the sonographer so concerned and my doctor not even seemingly cared? Can I expect another miscarriage with this situation so soon on? Will a cerlage be able to be done with only 1.6 cm to start with? I am so so scared and this doctor that has blown me off is making me feel crazy. Reading online I say i have reason for concern.  I have had 2 previous miscarriages at 4.5 and 6.5 weeks and a con biopsy in 2003 which must be how my cervix became so shortened. :(\n\n",

    "title": "Short Cervix, 1.6 cm at 7.5 weeks?",
    "content": "Hello, Cervical incompetency usually does not cause a problem for the pregnancy until the baby is larger - second to third trimester.  At that point the pressure of the baby can cause the cervix to fail.  Miscarriages that occur early as yours have are not usually caused by this problem.  The cerclage is placed somewhere around 12 - 14 weeks so waiting for your appointment is fine.  Even then it is likely too early to place it.  If a miscarriage occurs before then, a cerclage would not have helped anyway.    When the baby and placenta don't develop as they should, miscarriage is inevitable and nothing you can do will change what must happen.  In some cases early loss can be the result of a clotting disorder in the mother and may be helped in a future pregnancy but this is a rare situation.  Some women seem to not have enough progesterone in early pregnancy and doctors sometimes prescribe this.    Discuss all your concerns with your doctor at your visit.  Start writing notes so you won't forget your questions.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sophia Oxycodone Tablets are indicated for the management of moderate to severe pain when a continuous, around-the-clock analgesic is needed for an extended period of time.Animal studies of the drug have shown fetal harm at a dosage much higher(almost 40 to 50 times) taken by you .So in my opinion this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. But there is no need of unnecessary worry till you see your doctor; you can manage your pain with paracetamol 500mg tablet as and when required as this is considered to be the safest take care\n\n",

I also have seen my OB/GYN and he assured me that the small dose I took, for the short amount of time I was on them, should have no adverse effects on my baby. I appreciate your advice.\n\n",

If the amount increases or you start passing clots, bright red blood or start to get menstral like cramps contact your OB/GYN doctor.  She can run a simple blood test to see if your Beta HCG levels are rising or falling.  They will continue to rise if you have a viable pregnancy and they will fall if you are having a miscarriage.  Good luck Silvia my thoughts and prayers will be with you.\n\n",

Sometimes insulin is necessary.  This usually comes on toward the end of the pregnancy.  You should be screened for this around 27 weeks and your doctor can advise you if intervention is needed.  If so, you may be referred to a dietician for help in planning your diet.  If insulin is required, the doctor will prescribe the type and amount.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "My wife has hepatitis C and she is entering the 8th month of pregnancy. By now, her liver did not give her serious problems. We both try to live a healthy life (we are both HCV +), she's a nutritionist by occupation so we take care of what we're eating etc. In the last month or two, her liver seems to be getting worse, she complains on pains from time to time. We are aware that the liver suffers in pregnancy even if You don't have a chronic liver disease. I had problems with liver inflammation which i solved by using LIV52 and some other silymarin based products on a daily base and I'm fine since then. We have been trying to find out is it safe to take silymarin during pregnancy on the Internet, but we've found awkward, different answers. According to some sources, it is safe, according to others - it is not.   Can someone please tell us, is it safe to take silymarin (even in a form of mild, herbal tea made of milk thistle) during pregnancy, and after, during breast feeding (we have read that milk thistle, a plant that silymarin is extracted from was even used in folk medicine to improve milk flow).  If it is not safe to use it, what are the other options (other medications) that can safely be used in her case.  One other thing we would like to know: what is the recommended birth method when the mother is HCV+. We were told that cesarean birth method is safer and that there is a smaller chance of transferring hepatitis C on a child with it. What would be Your recommendation in our case, cesarean or normal, vaginal birth method.  Thank You very much for Your answer, Best regards, Milos and Marina\n\n",

    "title": "Use of Silymarin during pregnancy",
    "content": "Hello, It is very difficult to advise you about herbal supplements  because we just don't know much about them.  They are not regulated or even tested under the same standards as other drugs and even if they were, testing is not done on pregnant women.  Because of this there are very few drugs we can really say are \"safe\" in pregnancy so the best advice is to avoid anything that is not essential for the mother's health (risks/benefits).  The chances of transmission of this infection to the baby is only about 5% and it appears to be somewhat controversial whether C-section would be preferable.  I don't think this will improve the odds and surgery itself carries additional risks so unneeded surgical intervention is not usually advised, (though across the board it is being done too often).   This is a decision that must be made in conjunction with your wife's health care provider who should explain all risks and benefits of each method of delivery so she can make an informed decision.  If he/she cannot give good reason that a cesarean is necessary, I would prefer the vaginal delivery.\n\n",

Now that some of the bleeding has subsided as per last sonogram she said we can have sex but to be careful. However, when we tried it wasn't even remotely enjoyable and slightly painful, so we stopped.  Even before the hemorrhaging was detected we didn't really have sexual intercourse because it didn't feel enjoyable or the same to me.  I know that lots of couples still enjoy being intimate with their partners far into their pregnancy. Why can't we? I feel too ackward to ask my doctor in person.\n\n",

    "title": "Sex is Painful During Pregnancy?",
    "content": "Hello, Each person is individual in their response to sexual encounters, especially during pregnancy. Hormones can cause a decreased desire but there can also be emotional issues at play here.  Some people unconsciously worry that the baby could be harmed.  Especially after you have had a hemorrhage, you may be very sensitive to this possibility.    I would suggest you continue to work on your relationship, being kind and loving to one another in hopes you will recapture some of the passion you had before.  Many couples never experienced the kind of pleasure in sex they would like, and they feel others are having.  The most important thing is to not neglect one another.  After the baby arrives, this will be especially difficult with the demands on your time and the lack of rest you will get.  All the more reason you should take advantage of your time together now but don't focus on the pleasure you are receiving, but rather, on giving a gift of love to your husband with this form of expression.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I get all my health care through the VA unless I am referred out. This includes all gynocological issues as well that are adressed by the MD selected. The issue at had is that after my period when ovulation is about to occur I start to get very itchy and irritated. They have been treating me as though I hav e persistant yeast infection. Although there is not like a cottage chessey dishcarge. There is a white dicharge but I believe that that is the beginning of ovulation. After I have ovulated and about a few days before my next period or when i have my period all symtoms stop. I never had this problem unitl I had my daughter. It is just weird almost like I have a infection in my uterous and when all the hormones kick in and all the normal ovulation fluids occur this happens. I hope I have given enough information. I am not real sure what to say about the whole thing really other than it is annoying like a yeast infection but there is no other signs to lead me to believe it is a yeast infection\n\n",

It is very possible for your hormone balance to have been altered at the time of childbirth and that this fluctuation continues to cause you this trouble.

As for your other symptoms, miscarriage involves cramps and bleeding so if the pregnancy is not going as it should, that will likely occur.  The only way you can be sure is to see your health care provider who can monitor hcg levels and/or do an ultrasound exam.  Good luck\n\n",

She refused to give me a pregnancy test, and I know the home tests are not as good at picking up early detection as theirs.    I diagnosed myself with hypertension after keeping an eye on my blood pressure during each doctor visit, and sure enough when I asked if I had it, she said yes.  So I now take 100mg twice a day of labatalol. Well I'm supposed to take it and I usually don't because I don't trust her.  I have more questions, but I'll leave it at this for now.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm so sorry about your stillborn daughter.  I too experienced a full-term stillbirth and the cause was never determined.  In the majority of cases it is this way.  The medical community is still quite baffled about this particular tragedy in reproduction.  It is very important that you have a good and trusting relationship with your doctor so you should seek a new provider.  High blood pressure is nothing to ignore and if you need treatment it is important that you get this under control before pregnancy if possible.  If you have excess weight to lose, this would also be advised.    The home pregnancy tests are quite reliable by the time you miss a period.  First Response has an excellent reputation for accuracy but others are good as well.  Sometimes the hormone levels are not quite high enough to detect on any test so you should repeat it a week later if you still haven't had a period.  The blood test done in the doctor's office can detect pregnancy a little earlier because it is more sensitive to the hormones.  But, patience is a virtue and in time the pregnancy will be clear.  Good luck to you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, So this is a first cousin.  Some states have laws banning marriage to a first cousin for the reason you have expressed concern about.  You should consult with a geneticist.  There are usually some affiliated with University hospitals.  They will know what to look for but even then there are no guarantees.  We just don't know everything.  However, their advice would be very helpful for you in planning your future.  Keep in mind that marrying your cousin is not nearly the risk that marrying your sibling would be.  The genetic similarities are not that similar typically.  To pass on a genetic defect that would preclude such a marriage, you would both have to have the genetic defect gene so simply reproducing with a cousin does not mean you will have defective children but science and tradition has put social bans on this that make you worry.  So, for your peace of mind, seeing a genetic counselor might be helpful.    Good luck.\n\n",

If there is failure it is typically in the first year or so following the procedure but there are exceptions of course.

    "content": "Hello, After five years it is unlikely you are pregnant after having your tubes tied.  Most often failures become evident in the year or so following the procedure.  Not knowing what technique your doctor used I can't say for sure but in most cases they remove a bit of tube and seal the ends making it highly unlikely the ends can grow back together.    The abdomen contains so many organs that symptoms can sometimes be similar to pregnancy.  The bowel and bladder are two organs that can be suspect for infections.  Of course you still have functioning ovaries which can also have problems and some women develop endometriosis which can cause abdominal pain.  These are just a few possibilities.  I'm glad you are having this checked out with your doctor for your own peace of mind.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jessica76976,  This soon after your last period it would be unusual to see any signs of a miscarriage.  However, you may be experiencing some bleeding that can occur with pregnancy called implantation bleeding.  Typically, ovulation will occur around 14 days after the start of the last period.  Sperm cells can live around a week in the vaginal tract.  Given your exposure time course, you would most likely have been in the fertile time of your cycle.  This is not a 100% guarantee that your symptoms are due to pregnancy.  Many things can affect bleeding, including various stresses.  Many home pregancy tests are accurate a day or two before the expected day of your next period.  They are most accurate in the 5th week after the start of the last period.  If you take one before then that is negative and your period does not start as expected I would suggest that you repeat the pregnancy test a week later.    Regarding the diet pill, it is hard to say for sure but in general I would recommend against taking any more until you know whether or not you are pregnant.  Many drugs can have some effects on the growing baby, especially early on in the pregnancy.  Diet supplements often contain herbal supplements that have not been tested for safety during pregnancy.  Many supplements claim to be 100% safe and without side-effects since they are \"natural\".  Unfortunately, this is far from the truth.  If your symptoms continue and you're concerned I would recommend you see your gynecologist.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Is there any study out there that proves genes have anything to do with gender? It might sound like a silly question, but I am starting to think that genes might play a roll. For example, my mom's side of the family have mostly girls and my father's side of the family have mostly boys. All of my uncles on my dad's side have atleast 4-5 boys and 1 girl. My uncles from my mom's side have 3-4 girls and 0 boys. I was just wondering...Any answers would be appreciated. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course genes are involved in everything about the human body.  In addition there are issues such as body pH which can affect the survival of a specific gender at the time of fertilization and conception.  Girls also tend to be a bit stronger than boys when it comes to survival.  There definitely could be genetic factors at play here but these kinds of tendencies tend to have occasional exceptions so anything is possible.    I hope this helps a little.  Life still holds lots of mysteries.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course there is the chance of pregnancy if you are sexually active, but you could also be in the years of perimenopause when your periods begin to vary in length, spacing, characteristics, etc.  You could be ovulating inconsistently so pregnancy is still a possibility even when periods have slowed and even disappeared for a while.  Not everyone experiencing menopause has unpleasant side effects such as hot flashes so this is not a good indicator.  Even hormone tests are not very reliable here, though they can sometimes give clues that support the onset of menopause.  You should continue to use birth control until you are well into menopause, defined as a full year of absent periods, with or without other symptoms.    The perimenopause period can last for several years.  It's very inconvenient because you never know when you might expect a period so be prepared at all times.  Meanwhile, repeat pregnancy tests weekly until you are quite sure you are not pregnant.  The two conditions can definitely mimic each other.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Yesterday I took a test (after a four days delay of my period) and found out I was (I AM) pregnant.  It was completely unexpected, as the only sexual contact I had was only six days after my last period and....using a condom! -that did NOT break!! (at least not visibly...)   So, to make things clear: my last period came on August 4; I had sex on August 10 (for the first and only time in the last four months, so... that's when it happened, definitely); my menstrual cycle is of 30/31 days; on September 9 I took a pregnancy test (three of them, actually) and discovered I was pregnant.   I'm 35 years old and single. I wasn't planning to have a child. However, since this happened to me, now I'd rather have the baby than.....consider other option. But... only if I knew I'd have a healthy baby!   Now, during the interval of time August 4 - September 9 I've taken the following medicines:  Nolicin (norfloxacinum) - only two tablets, two days after the intercourse (August 12);  Urinex (a drug for urinary infections, made of: anetol 4 mg + fencona 4 mg + pinen 31 mg [alfa 24,8 mg & beta 6,2 mg] + borneol 10 mg + cineol 3 mg + camfen 15 mg) - four tablets a day, between August 12 and 15, then again last week, between September 1 and 4;  Tantum Rosa, solution for vaginal hygiene, on the first five days after the sexual contact (August 10-15);  Xanax (alprazolamum) - 0,25 mg once a week or so (that is, about four tablets overall);  Dormicum (midazolamum) - 7,5 mg - about twice a week;  Metoprolol (metoprololum) - 50 mg twice a week;  Aspenter - 75 mg (Aspirin / Acidum Acetylsalicylicum) - about three times a week;  Tanakan (Ginkgo Biloba 100 mg) - one tablet a day, during the last week (September 3-9);  Betadine solution (Povidon-Iodine) on a scratch, about three times a day, for six or seven days, between August 23-30);  Visine (tetryzolinum solution) - eyedrops - once a day during the last two weeks (approximately August 26 - September 9).  Also, during this month I had a celebration every week (a wedding, two birthdays and a bachelor's party), at which I drank QUITE A LOT ALCOHOL - about 1 liter (kg) of wine /champagne per night... or about 500 ml of Martini... (In short, I sort of got drunk once a week!)  In addition to all this, I've been drinking a strong coffee every day - as I normally do.  And another thing: the conception happened only two days after my third (and last) dose of SILGARD, the vaccine against the Papiloma-virus! That is, I had the inoculation on August 8 and conceived the child on August 10.   None of this would have happened if I knew I was [about to get] pregnant. But, as I said, I didn't have the faintest idea this could happen! Now that I know I'm pregnant, of course I stopped taking any medication and drinking alcohol. But my question is: given all this, isn't it already TOO LATE?? I wouldn't want to give birth to a sick child!!! -to a child that would suffer and be miserable the whole life! This is the only thing I can think about right now!   Of course, I've called my doctor as soon as I found out I was pregnant. But....her secretary told me she was on vacation and she could only see me on September 26! My therapist, on the other hand, is home sick and doesn't return to work until September 20!! In all honesty, with all these questions unanswered I'm afraid I will go nuts until then!!! So I would really, really appreciate your opinion and advice!    Please excuse my eventual misspellings, it's been a long time since I haven't spoken English.  Many, many thanks! Lea\n\n",

    "title": "Unexpected Pregnancy - Problems",
    "content": "Hello, This is an extensive list of exposures during early pregnancy.  In most cases we do not know what causes birth defects and only when we see a higher than usual rate of defects in patients who have been exposed to a particular drug do we know if it will have an effect or not.  Some factors to consider include the amount of exposure.  A one time use, or limited use is less likely to be a problem.    We do not know what effect binge drinking of alcohol will have on a baby.  Recommendation is to avoid it altogether to be on the safe side but at this point it's best just to avoid any future binges since there's nothing you can do to change the past but hope for the best.  Supplements are not tested at all so we know very little about the effects of these; other drugs approved by the FDA are not tested on pregnant women so our only information is anecdotal (gathering data after a number of women have had exposure either because they did not know they were pregnant when taking it or because the benefit outweighed the risks).  Topical medications are rarely a problem and would most likely require massive amounts of exposure to get into the baby's blood stream so they are probably not a concern.   Eye drops are not a problem.    There is no way to guarantee a perfect baby.  The best thing you can do is take care of yourself now and avoid such exposures in the future. Eat a balanced, healthy diet, get regular exercise, avoid secondhand smoke and see your doctor for prenatal care.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Now that i think about it...maybe i only thought that this was still a yeast infection, but it was probably a side effect of the medication....very itchy and irritated vaginal area. Do you think I overdosed this medication (im pregnant)? (the medication was .8% vaginal cream).

Thinking of my old pills i didnt start a new pack until the following sunday (one week later) A few days after starting new pack i got really sore breasts that over 4-5 days cleared up, but ive been having cramping as well, no spotting though. I had sex 4 days prior to when i would ovulate and one day after. I have no idea when to take a pregnancy test because i still have like 3 weeks of pills left. What chance do i have of being pregnant?  Cant stand waiting :) M\n\n",

    "content": "Hello I apologize for not seeing your continued posting  For the sake of other readers, you are correct that continuing to take birth control pills when waiting to find out if you are pregnant has not been associated with any birth defects or other problems in pregnancy, though they should be discontinued once it is confirmed.  You can also have a serum (blood) pregnancy test earlier than the urine test since it is more sensitive.  Generally the first clue about pregnancy occurs with the missed period.    If I understand you correctly, you had a longer period of time between packets of pills.  The delay in starting the new pack should not have been significant in the effectiveness.

    "content": "Hello -  I don't think you need to be actively worried about listeria unless you actually develop symptoms, which probably would have happened by now anyway. The immune system tends to attack the responsible microbe very aggressively as a rule, and you only ingested a tiny amount of potentially contaminated bleu cheese crumbs. While it is definitely wise to avoid the  soft cheeses (as well as hotdogs, undercooked meats, etc.), especially when pregnant, I think it would be an extremely big coincidence if you did contract listeria from this very limited contact with the food in question.  Hope this helps, and I hope you have a safe and uneventful pregnancy. Congratulations!\n\n",

My period has been irregular for last year, however I never had any problems before. I had an Pelvis Ultrasound and the only result was that a I had small syct in my right ovary (less then 1.5) and that  my ovary was very thick ---the analogy my doctor use to explain what was happening, was like pouring water in a cup that is already full...why after 24 years of normal period am experiencing such a thing\n\n",

The last one was 6 months ago and my periods are returning to normal with very few symptoms of the endometreosis returning.  However, about the time my last period was due I had a brown discharge followed by a few days of extremely light bleeding.  My period is now overdue by a couple of weeks, I have been feeling sick and weak and yesterday and today I have had some light bleeding.  I took a few pregnancy tests which were negative (although one did look like it had a very faint line on it).  Have I just tested too early or is it just my periods still getting back to normal?  There is a chance of pregnancy as my husband and I have not used protection recently.  As he has been unfaithful in the past is there also a chance of infection?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The morning after pill or plan B is a powerful hormone and it will disrupt your cycle.  It can take a few months to get back to normal following this treatment so it is difficult to tell what is going on now.  Even the mood swings can be related.  You should do pregnancy tests weekly as long as you are worried about pregnancy or see a doctor for a serum pregnancy test which can detect pregnancy at an earlier stage than the urine tests.  If negative, you may just have to wait a while for your body to adjust.  Meanwhile, I would suggest a different brand of condom or a second method of birth control - perhaps an IUD, the patch or pills.  Best wishes, Debbie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lily girl,  Pregnancy, while not 100% out of the question, is very unlikely.  Oral contraceptives (OCP's) by themselves are in the range of 97-99% effective when taken as directed.  Add to this the effectiveness of condoms and the chances of pregnancy are very, very slim.    Even with OCP's it is possible to get some break through bleeding/spotting (especially in the middle/last part of the cycle).  Stress can very much affect this so it is quite possible that the start up of classes is affecting your cycle.  If, however, your period does not occur as expected when taking the sugar pill week of your OCP's, I would recommend a pregnancy test just to be sure.  (Again, its very unlikely.)  Best wishes and study hard!\n\n",

If the bleeding is heavier and near when the next period is expected, that period may be delayed or skipped.  All of this would still be considered a normal occasional variation of oral contraceptives.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Kze100,  There are a few medicines that can induce menses.  Typically, these are progesterone based.  The normal menstrual cycle involves three phases.  1st, estrogen induces a thickening of the endometrial lining during the first part of the cycle (immediately after the last bleeding stops).  2nd, progesterone induces a maturing of the lining (to be able to support pregnancy).  Then, if a pregnancy has not occurred, the 3rd stage occurs when the progesterone levels fall.  This withdrawal of progesterone induces shedding of the lining of the uterus and, as a result, menstrual bleeding.  There are several reasons for a woman to have a delayed period.  1st, if pregnancy is a possibility this should be evaluated.  It is also very normal for women to occasionally have an irregular period.  This can be contributed to by stress, exercise, or any number of things.  I would recommend waiting a bit longer before considering trying a medication to induce bleeding.  I would recommend you avoid herbal remedies such as Humphries #11.  The reason for this is because there is often not very good information about herbal medications and their effects.  They can have effects that we are not expecting.  In addition, herbal supplements are not regulated like medications are so there is no guarantee that what is supposed to be in the supplement actually is.  There are many reports of harmful substances being found in supposedly safe supplements.  (OK, I'll get off my soap box now.)  If your period does not start soon and you are concerned about it, it is very reasonable to see your gynecologist for an evaluation and possibly a medication to induce menses.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But each time they do occur, whether I am sitting or standing,  I get what I call a \"rush of blood\" from my stomach to my head that feels like I am being hung upside down? Its a very disconcerting feeling and also makes my chest feel tight and I feel faintish and short of breath. My heart feels like it beats oddly, also, when this happens and I feel so pressurized all over. Its very hard to do much when they come on. I asked my OBGYN about this a few times and since my blood pressure is normal, he seems to think that it's due to the blood flow to my uterus during these contractions and that my blood pressure is probably effected during them.  I am just very, very worried that this feeling will be unbearable to me during the real labor and I will not be able to cope or breath? I never had anything like this with my first child.  Have you ever heard of anything like this or do you have any insight on it?? Anything would ease my mind. Thanks a bunch...  Sincerely, SUPER WORRIED\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sweetheart5015,  This is a bit outside my expertise but I wanted to reply to your question.  Your obstetrician's theory is very plausible.  The uterus receives a dramatic percentage of the body's blood flow that can suddenly be diverted to other places when the uterus contracts.  It may help to be sure you are very well hydrated to help minimize effects of blood flow changes.    If these get worse, it may also be reasonable to discuss with your OB about the possibility of a heart rhythm problem although this seems to be pretty unlikely overall.  I wish I could give you more information but I'm not familiar enough with this type of an issue to confidently answer. Follow up with your OB is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In a woman of child-bearing years who is having regular sexual intercourse with a fertile male, it is considered normal for it to take a year to get pregnant.  So, at six months, while you may be anxious, it is not cause for alarm or intervention.    The best thing you can do is make sure you are both eating a healthy diet and taking care of your health in all ways.  Have sex every other day during the two weeks or so during which you are likely to ovulate.  Your partner should avoid tight shorts, hot tubs and anything that might damage his testicles.  The rest is up to the stars being in alignment, the higher power, God, or whatever you believe makes the world go around.  Good luck with this and try to be patient, decrease your stress worrying about it and it will most likely occur when you least expect it.  If not, after a year, you may want to consult with your doctor to see if a cause can be found.  In some cases however, a cause is just never known and it just takes a while.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your answer. I was quite surprised initially to hear that a doctor would recommend a caesarian just because of poor eyesight. I was asking specifically related to me because I have no other problem than a non-disease related myopia and astigmatism.  On the same topic though, I have a further question: What makes a first birth such a high case for a caesarian?  I am planning to have a child within the next 4 years or so and would really like to steer away from non-natural forms of childbirth. As this child would be my first child would this automatically be in higher risk for complications leading to a caesarian section instead of vaginal birth?  In general I feel rather very uninformed despite my efforts to gain knowledge. I wonder many times why there is a tendancy amongst women to have caesarian sections (at least the women in the society I live). I wonder if it is health related, complications with the baby-related or something else.   I would like some light shed on this.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You might enjoy seeing \"The Business of Being Born\" where Ricki Lake documents her second pregnancy which she determined should be more natural.  She opted for a home birth with a nurse midwife.  While I like the safety net of a hospital for delivery, there is a certain amount of risk that goes into this.  Technology sometimes gets out of hand and interferes with a natural process, such as delivering a baby.  A hospital is great when you are sick or in trouble but for normal life events such as giving birth, we sometimes treat normal mothers and babies as though they are ill.  There is a lot of liability-driven medicine being practiced.  There is a reason this is the case.  Many doctors encourage unnecessary cesarean births because they believe they will be better able to control the outcome, though major surgery such as this has many complications.  It is also more convenient - the doctor can schedule it, people love feeling like they are in charge, rather than at the mercy of their baby.  This is not the way to go, however.  It also brings in more money for the doctor and the hospital.  So, there may be a conflict of interest going on.    I would never advise a first time mother to choose a cesarean electively without some pretty compelling medical reason.  In most cases I would not advise a mother who had one c/section before to repeat it unless it was done under just certain circumstances; not just because the first was a cesarean.    The most important reasons to allow birth to be as natural as possible are fewer complications, infections, faster recovery, better success at breastfeeding, and future childbearing plans will not be adversely affected.  The more cesareans you have, the greater the risk so if you want to have several children, please don't choose a c/section for \"convenience.\"  I have seen cases of post surgery infections, blood clots, and wounds dehissance (opening up).  This is not a pretty picture.  The surgical delivery is an important option for a mother who truly needs it, but too often this is not the case so each birth needs to be carefully evaluated individually and I would choose a midwife or doctor who does everything possible to ensure a vaginal delivery whenever it is safe.  You can get information from labor and delivery nurses who work with these doctors and midwives daily to help you find a provider that meets your expectations.  Of course you need to work within the framework of your insurance but you should be able to find a provider that will advocate for non-surgical birth whenever feasable.    There are various methods of prepared, non-medicated childbirth such as Lamaze, Bradley, hypnobirthing, etc. and they all work on the principle that knowledge is power and they teach relaxation, visual imagery and other skills to help.  You are wise to plan ahead.  Best wishes to you.\n\n",

After those two weeks we haven't had sex, she started being worried after her period didn't come so we bought a pregnancy test which came positive.  Due to the resutls she decided to buy another pack of day after pills and took them this morning, she does not wish to be pregnant. My question is, will this second dose of day after pills interrupt the pregnancy? What are the chances of that happening?

The single dose of Plan B should have been sufficient, though not 100% - but given the fact you used it as directed, immediately following unprotected sex, chances are this worked for you.  Periods can be erratic for a while after this, however, and it can take a while to get back to normal.    In answer to your other question, if this did not work then, yes, the abortion or having the baby would be the only two options.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I was 13 weeks pregnant by the Dr.'s calculations, when he sent me for the ultasound to conferm the age the fetus was only 8mm which is approx. 3 & 2/2 weeks. They found just the sac. So, my Dr. sent me for blood work that day then again on Friday, 2 days later, so he can compare my hormone level (HCG)to see if it had increased. I have been \"spotting\" for a few days but I thought it was just from intercourse, it was very light. 2 days later, Sunday teh 9th of March, I went to use the bathroom and I was bleeding very heavily which also had traces of clots very small(little bigger than a pen tip). I went to the ER and indeed I was having a miscarriage, I passed the fetus in the examining room when I had sneezed.. hardest thing I had ever had to experiance!! My hormaone Level never change from Wednesday to Friday. Er said that it should have atleast doubled if not tripled with in the 2 days. It stayed at 1100. :(  Now, here it is about 3 weeks later and I think I may be pregnant (having same sign(s) as first 2 daughters).. My question is if I take a home pregnancy test will it give me the correct results being so soon? Or would I still have some hormones left from the miscarriage, Does anyone know????\n\n",

    "title": "Alternatives to epidural?",
    "content": "Hello, Any drug used in your delivery has the potential for problems to either you or the baby.  The epidural is actually one of the safest forms of anesthesia for childbirth.  If you want to be completely safe from drug complications, consider an unmedicated birth.  Prepared childbirth can be very effective and rewarding but the key is \"prepared.\"  You won't be successful if you just tell yourself you are going to do it.  But, if you take classes in a method such as Lamaze, Bradley or hypnobirthing, and practice faithfully, you can control your pain by understanding the process and working with your body to push the baby out - to allow nature to do its work.  You could benefit from a certified nurse midwife who is proficient in this type of delivery.  Choosing your health care provider is vital here.  A doctor who does not support this will not be a good choice.  It is work with your mind and the mind is capable of much more than we realize.  At least get hold of some books and read up on the subject.  There is also an interesting video called The Business of Being Born, created by Ricki Lake which shows what is possible.  She did a home birth and I am not advocating that - but the points it makes about getting back to the basics of giving birth naturally are quite remarkable.  In a hospital you have safety backups for problems, but most births are uncomplicated and the hospital environment itself can contribute to the problems.  Being educated on this and preparing yourself can allow you to be assertive to get the birth you want.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Of course you are concerned but the ultrasound findings are definitely encouraging so try not to stress over this.  Even drugs which are known to increase the risk of birth defects do not do so in every case - just raises the odds a bit.  Many babies with exposure to known dangerous drugs are born healthy and normal.  Others are born with problems that have had no exposure to anything.  There is no guarantee and absolutely no way to definitely predict before the birth itself if there might be a problem.  When we have children there are a few risks we take and then we do the best with what we are given.  In the early weeks, typically you would see serious damage or even miscarriage as this is in the cell division stage - before the facial features.  So, if your baby had been seriously affected at this stage, most likely you would have lost the baby or it would be a significant problem that would be seen on ultrasound.  Best wishes for a healthy baby.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you were in the middle of a miscarriage.  By now I'm sure you have the outcome and I apologize we were not available to answer in a timely fashion.  We are volunteers here and sometimes it is difficult to get everyone's questions handled.  Other than that, I am not sure what blood test was actually performed so it is hard to explain what might have been happening.  Typically a serum (blood) pregnancy test is more reliable earlier than a urine test is so if that is the test you refer to, most likely it meant early miscarriage had occurred.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry I did not get to your question in a timely manner.  By now you have delivered and I hope you were able to do so vaginally.  Induction is a very popular option these days - it seems rare to actually go into labor spontaneously, even though the odds are better if you do.  There are complications with induction, most commonly that it ends in a Cesarean  delivery or the baby truly was not ready.  Labor also tends to be especially difficult with pitocin assistance.  Ultrasound exams for weight are not that accurate and there is a two pound variable to be considered.    If induction is done for a cause, it is ideal if it does not happen before week 39 and if the cervix is ready.  The fact that your gestational diabetes has been controlled with medication and diet improves your chances of having a baby of normal size.  Also, your body can accommodate varying sizes of babies and there is no magic number that can be determined in advance that would suggest you could not successfully deliver.  Staying with your prescribed glucose management program is your best assurance for a safe and healthy delivery.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry we did not get to your question sooner. I'm sure you now know the outcome and I hope it was positive for you.    Discharge alone is really not a sure indicator of impending miscarriage.  I am confident it had nothing to do with the medications that you were prescribed either.  Most of the time it is a \"wait and see\" type thing.  There is little to be done if a miscarriage is about to occur.    If you did miscarry, you may wish to see a specialist for testing to see if you have a clotting disorder or to determine if you might be a candidate for some special intervention on your next attempt.  There are no guarantees, but repeated losses sometimes suggest a pattern that could benefit this way.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm sorry it took so long to get to your question.  A low-lying placenta may or may not result in a C section.  As your uterus continues to grow it can pull away from the cervix and cause no problem during delivery.  But if not and if you have bleeding, your doctor may recommend a c section.  If this happened to you, it does not necessarily mean you would need a C/S for future pregnancies so you should consider the possibility of a vaginal birth next time in any case.    I'm sure by now you have your result but in case others have similar questions I have answered here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As it turned out, we weren't pregnant (although we've been trying for several months).  This month, we've received 3 positive pregnancy tests + no pregnancy symptoms (nausea, headaches, breast tenderness, swollen abdomen, nothing!) AND what appears to be a steady normal period (not implantation bleeding, which should last only 3 days). This \"period\" is on its fourth day with no cramping.  I've scheduled to see a doctor next Monday.   In your opinion, is it more likely that I am pregnant or not pregnant? (God sure is funny ... sometimes.)\n\n",

But, there is no set number of days for implantation bleeding and some women feel that they have a nearly normal period with implantation so this alone would not make me decide where to put my money if I were betting on this.  By now I'm sure you have a result but barring additional testing and/or ultrasound determination, it would be impossible to say if you are pregnant or not.  Each woman responds to pregnancy differently and each pregnancy can be very different in the same woman.  Best wishes.\n\n",

As it turned out, I experienced something called \"chemical pregnancy.\" I am indeed pregnant, but due to lack of proper implantation of the fetus in the womb, the pregnancy goes away. Apparently, this is a very common phenomenon; most  people, except those who are actively trying to conceive, never notice they are pregnant, as it comes and goes so quickly.  As of now, we're still trying. This time: positive pregnancy test, positive ymptoms, 1 month, no period, no implantation bleeding, just simply ... pregnant.   To those who are trying: negative PT's mean 'no, you're not pregnant,' as much as you would like to think that you are.  Thank you again for your expert replies!\n\n",

It is nothing to be alarmed about however, and you might try to relax and know that it is a good sign that your body will do well in breastfeeding when the time comes with another baby.  Many women leak from their breasts for several months in pregnancy too and it is harmless.  I would not encourage medication to treat this minor problem unless it is related to some other issue such as a pituitary tumor.  If it seems to become worse you may want to ask your doctor to evaluate your endocrine system.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Around the time I ovulated, my husband and I had intercourse.  I started spotting the next day and then it went away until 2 days later.  I called the Dr. and they gave me a blood test to see if I was pregnant due to the ectopic in Jan.  It was negative. I thought maybe the intercourse irritated something.  The spotting lasted up until my period came which was on time  and lasted  5-6 days as normal.  Around day 12 of my next cycle in June,  I spotted was told by my Dr that I most likely ovulated since it was only once.  A 8 or 9 days after ovulation I started spotting again (this month June) but this was  just very light tan but no thickness to it but enough for me to wear a panty liner up until this past Sun June 22 when my period came 1 day early which normally happens and it was a good amount of bleeding.  Yesterday I barely bled and today I barely bled almost like its done already.  I moderately bleed for about 3 days and lightly for the last 2 or 3days.   I'm confused to why this is happening.  I've never had irregular periods and I'm wondering if i'm releasing any eggs since I am trying to conceive or if you have any answers to what's going on.  I did take a pregnancy test today June 24 and it was neg.  Could this be implantation bleeding?  Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It sounds like you are experiencing some hormonal fluctuation.  I would not be too alarmed by this.  With a negative pregnancy test it is unlikely you are experiencing implantation bleeding but you can always repeat the test a week or two later in case the hormone levels are not yet up to the level that would show up on the test.  Some spotting between periods is normal in almost all women and especially following hormonal changes such as you have had.  It is impossible to say if you are ovulating without monitoring your basal temperatures.  However, you may notice secretions that become heavier around the time of ovulation.  This can be a clue.

    "content": "I am a 28 year old woman, married 3 years ago, but having no kid. My husband is 33. Actually when I got married me and my husband decided not to go for the intercourse for about 6 months as I was studying in those days and don\u2019t want to get pregnant. After 2 or 3 months I started to feel some acne problem, which I used to have before marriage also, but this time it was very severe and my whole face was covered with pimples. I consulted a dermatologist and she advised me some ointments. I used that but it doesn\u2019t effect. Then the dermatologist prescribed me an antibiotic... (Not remembering the name) to use it for 5 days. I used and again visited the doctor. This time the doctor asked me to continue the antibiotic medicine for about 1 1/2 months but with a restriction of not getting pregnant, as that could result in abortion. Knowing that, I immediately stopped taking that medicine and refused to go for further treatment of acne.   After that, the acne problem was gradually reduced to normal and after some time, me and my husband started to go for intercourse. After 15 months of our marriage I got pregnant, but it doesn\u2019t last. In the 10 week of pregnancy doctor advised me for the ultrasound and that was not normal, there was no heartbeats. Doctor waited for about 10 more days and checked the ultrasound again but the situation was even worse having no heartbeat and the sac was also reduced. The doctor immediately asked for the abortion. There was no other way. But in the whole period of my pregnancy, I never even had a spot of blood.   After the abortion, the doctor asked me not to go for intercourse for about 3 months as that could again result in miscarriage. Me and my husband abandoned ourselves from intercourse for three months. But after that, when again we started to go for intercourse, it is not resulting to pregnancy. It\u2019s been now more than 20 months of my abortion and I am unable to conceive. I went for the hormones test last year and this year too. All the reports of mine are normal. My husband also had a semen analysis, which was also normal. Said by the doctor.  Now, I am severely tensed, I am desperate to be a mother but luck is not favoring me. I don\u2019t know what the problem is? If both me and my husband are alright, what is the matter which is a hurdle towards my conception? (Please mind that I have never taken any birth control medicine neither used any birth control objects, such as condoms etc and I have a regular 28 days menstruation cycle)\n\n",

    "content": "I can certainly understand your frustration.  It would seem likely that you would have conceived by now but there are many women who do not conceive in spite of the fact they have regular periods, regular sexual intercourse and use no birth control.  Sometimes it just takes a little while for everything to line up.  To improve your chances, I would suggest you have sex from day 8 through day 19 (start counting days on the first day of your period).  Daily is fine or every other day, but not less frequently than that.  You can also use ovulation indicators that use your body temperature as a guide.  Also, if you notice extra secretions, that is also a sign you may be fertile.  The trick is to present frequent opportunities for sperm to meet egg.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi   I m contacting you people after a long time. As u could able to know from my previous posts, that i have been trying for preganancy since a long time. i had a surgery about 3 months ago, as my gynaecologist diagnosed minor tissue in my uterus and needed to remove that thru cervix. after that the doctor advised me to go for insemination as we have been trying for preganancy for more than 2 years and not succeeding. But me and my husband decided to try for a couple of months and if not succeeded then go for insemination process.   Now the problem occurs with me this month, as we have been actively trying to concieve in my ovulation period, but later on 24th day of cycle when we tried ususally, i started to bleed. after 2 - 3 hours, it started to bleed heavily. and then the next day, i had a finger long piece of flesh (dark pink color) coming out of my vagina.  since then, i am confused that did i have an abortion or was that a regular menstrual period? because i never had this type of solid bleeding before.  Waiting for ur response eagerly.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "First please let me apologize for not answering your question before now.    It is possible you had an early miscarriage but it is also possible to have a period that consists of tissue as well as blood.  Once it happens it is nearly impossible to say for sure.  If there was a pregnancy but the baby just didn't develop, your body will take care of the remaining tissue which may have begun to prepare your body for a baby to grow.    You may become pregnant yet as most people who suffer a miscarriage do go on to conceive a baby that is healthy and strong.  But, if it doesn't happen soon and artificial reproductive technology (such as in vitro or artificial insemination) is a possibility for you, it might be time to consult with a fertility specialist about it.  At your age, there is still a good chance you could become pregnant spontaneously, assuming you don't have some underlying problem that is preventing ovulation.  Polycystic ovary syndrome sometimes does this and is often associated with adult acne.    Good luck.\n\n",

What is the probability of a pregnant woman being prescribed extended (more than say, a few weeks or a month) bedrest during her pregnancy?  And is there a maximum amount of time that a woman might be on bed rest (i.e. what is the earliest point in the pregnancy that bedrest might be prescribed)?\n\n",

    "title": "What are the chances of extended bedrest during pregnancy?",
    "content": "Hello, This is an interesting question because it is impossible to know if you could be one of the few women who might require bedrest in pregnancy. Fortunately the vast majority of women are able to work right up until they go into labor at the appropriate time.  You are wise to think about these things.  Some employers offer short-term disability that can help a woman in this situation.  There is also much controversy surrounding the order of bedrest.  In many situations where it has previously been prescribed it has mostly been discredited as something with little or no effect on the outcome of the pregnancy.  There are exceptions.  Times where bedrest is helpful is in the case of a uterine tear or placenta previa with bleeding, when the mother develops serious high blood pressure and sometimes when there is an incompetent cervix.  Other times (threatened miscarriage,  There is no data that bedrest can help in threatened miscarriage, and yet patients are told to go to bed rest with bathroom privileges when they have bleeding and cramping in the first trimester. It likely will not help but if the woman miscarries she feels that she did all she could to prevent it from happening so some providers feel there is psychological benefit.    This should be balanced with the harm that can be done with bedrest.  Women on bedrest face a host of physical problems caused by lack of activity, including muscle atrophy and blood clot risk as well as emotional issues related to boredom and isolation.  Then of course there is the financial disaster it sometimes causes - leading to further stress.  There is even some thought that the stress means increased cortisol levels which may adversely affect the baby or induce preterm labor.  If your job is not physically demanding, you are likely to do just as well going to work, except in those cases listed above.  Nobody can predict if you will develop high blood pressure, placenta previa or premature cervical changes that threaten a too-early birth.  There are risk factors that might mean you are at increased risk, but even then, there is no way to predict such a thing.  Mothers who are obese or who smoke carry a greater risk for hypertenstion.  If you were born prematurely, you have a greater risk of delivering a preterm infant.    In most cases bedrest involves a few weeks at most.  If it is in early pregnancy, you are likely to miscarry or find that everything is fine within a few days so even if you went to bed it would not be for a prolonged time.  If it is for hypertension, this would likely not occur until the last trimester and if it is severe it can be a few weeks.  If it gets dangerously high, the baby is delivered even if it is premature.  Placental bleeding can occur at any time.  If it is early, it will likely heal over and you can go back to normal activities.  If it is late, it could involve a few weeks until delivery.  Most women are probably on bedrest no more than two months.  A mother pregnant with multiples will also be at greater risk for bedrest to avoid preterm labor but many mothers deliver at term, working right up until their 36th or 37th week (or even beyond).  I know of women who had bedrest prescribed who explained their work situation to the doctor who then agreed they were probably at no greater risk by going to work.  There is nothing that can be done to prevent an early, first-trimester miscarriage so the negative effects of being on bedrest would likely outweigh any psychological benefit that may theoretically exist by going to bed.  If you understand that nothing you could have done differently would have changed the outcome, you emotional health should be fine.    Now, I'm not suggesting you throw caution to the wind and ride rollercoasters, go scuba diving or wakeboarding.  There are risky behaviors that can negatively affect your pregnancy.  Remember the vast majority of pregnant women never need to be on bedrest, but I can't quote you the odds.  It's really senseless anyway since if it happens to you it really doesn't matter if you're one in a thousand.  Good luck with your plans.\n\n",

Implantation bleeding typically occurs about the time of your expected period, not before, which is why many women feel they had a period and are not pregnant, when in fact they are.  If your period does not come as expected, take a home test about a week after the expected period date.  Usually these are quite accurate at that point - not 100% but good still.  Best wishes.\n\n",

When you have a \"period\" after becoming pregnant, it is actually implantation bleeding rather than a true period and most people do describe it as not being their normal type of period, as you have.  This, coupled with your symptoms would suggest doing a pregnancy test.  Assuming the second period was not actually a period, the test should be quite reliable now.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I thought the stitches were supposed to dissolve? The incision is the bikini line. horizontal. They stitched the inside and just taped the outside. I'm positive it is a stitch. I pulled and I could feel it pulling out. It feels and looks like floss. It is like a loop protruding from my stomach. Both ends are still inside. Is this something I should be worried about and go to the ER? Please help a.s.a.p  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Most likely your ultrasound will be followed up with another one (or possibly MRI) that might give more information specific to the concerns raised with what was seen on the first report.  Early ultrasounds are helpful for screening but often they alarm people needlessly. Some abnormalities resolve on their own and others respond well to medical treatments after birth, helping the baby to recover and have as normal a life as possible.  Perhaps you will be referred to a neonatologist or pediatric neurologist for an evaluation to see if there are other problems associated and to help you understand what you are up against.  If so, this will likely be done soon since you have considered a termination and there are legal guidelines that create an urgency.   A decision to terminate is certainly a personal one but I would recommend you meet with the specialist first before deciding.    It sounds like the concern is hydrocephalus, possibly with kidney involvement.  If this is the case, sometimes a cesarean section delivery is recommended to reduce trauma at delivery, then a shunt is placed to help the baby to drain the water into the abdomen from the brain.  Surgery is sometimes even performed on the baby prior to birth in some places.  I wish you the best of luck in the coming weeks as you face this situation.  May you be blessed as you progress in this pregnancy and make your decisions.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, This is such a sad situation.  I am so sorry for your loss.  I can relate since I also had a fetal demise at term.  In my case, my doctor gave me the option for induction which I took gratefully!  I have not regretted doing that.  There may be advantages to letting nature take it's course but there are emotional factors that the doctor might overlook.  I don't know enough about your history to guess why your doctor recommends this option.  You may want to ask for more information.   The problem with induction comes if your cervix is not ready.   In a demise you can usually be given something to soften the cervix and prepare you for induction if your doctor is amenable to it.  If you have had a previous C-section, this may make the doctor reluctant to induce.  This must be a decision between you and your doctor, who will hopefully take into consideration all factors including your health and safety as well as your emotional well-being.    Continuing to carry babies who have died in the womb can be very disturbing.  Well-meaning friends and even strangers comment to the pregnant woman in ways that can be very disturbing if the babies will not be born alive.  These are reasons I favor induction if you are able to get this.    I would like to recommend some websites for support in your grief.  http://www.missingangel.org, http://www.stillbirthsupport.org and http://dailystrength.org/c/Stillbirth/support-group.  I would encourage you to take pictures of your babies at delivery - even if they don't look as good as you would hope.  One day little mementos will be all you have to validate your memory and experience.  Many hospitals have volunteers who put together little packets for grieving moms and include a little blanket, hat, etc. you can put on the babies, then keep these as something that contacted the baby.  They can give you footprints to keep.  This can provide something you can see and touch.  The whole experience tends to take on an unreal feel and it is necessary to have something tangible to help you in your grief.  You will always know that these babies were part of you, they lived inside you and the kicking you felt proved their existence.  May you be blessed in your time of sorrow.  Good luck in the coming very challenging weeks.  Take care\n\n",

I have a great tollerance for pain so for me to be in pain is a big deal. Couple nights ago sharp stabbing pain woke me up, screaming, scared the hell out of my boyfriend, pain from what i remember on my right side mostly, the next day had painful stabbing pain on the left side. When the doctor presses on my stomach i get a nauseating pain for about 20 minutes, upto an 8 on a pain scale.  On ultrasound 2 black splotches no one discussed with me that i asked about but said were 'to early to be sure' Radiologist said posible Tubal. Pain is too much, asked to have it terminated but my doctors office won't reffer out for termination.   I mostly want to know whats going on, I've asked everyone in my family that has been pregnant and they all say it's not normal, even my aunt who is a nurse, My doctor still says it is, the only thing that takes away the pain is the half of vicadin i have left over from my mononucleosis I never used. I know it's not good for it but i don't think it's a healthy pregnancy. Does it sound normal to anybody else?  Help!!!\n\n",

    "title": "5 weeks along, severe cramps and sharp pain for 2 weeks+",
    "content": "Hello, Of course you do need to rule out tubal (ectopic) pregnancy and I assume that is what your doctor is doing, knowing that pain can be a symptom.  You did not indicate how far along you are.  Ectopic pregnancies are usually noticed around six or seven weeks.    You also did not indicate how long the pain lasts.  If it is a brief and passing thing, even though it is sharp, it may be round ligament pain.  These ligaments stretch as your uterus grows and often cause sharp, stabbing pain in the lower pelvis, especially when changing positions.    Don't worry about taking the narcotic.  It is safe in pregnancy when taken occasionally for acute pain such as this but you should discuss it with your doctor to get his OK.  Tylenol is always considered safe in pregnancy unless you have liver problems.  Motrin and ibuprofen are the same thing and it is best to avoid these.  They do not cause birth defects but can affect your blood clotting so it is not recommended.    Of course there is also the possibility that you have something else going on that is unrelated to the pregnancy such as appendicitis, bowel or kidney problems.  Since they did labwork and ultrasound, I believe they are monitoring you for anything serious.  If you have some type of infection, this will likely show up.  Hopefully the pain will pass soon on its own even if they never discover the cause.  Keep your doctor posted about any unusual additional symptoms such as bleeding, fever, etc. and whether or not it improves or worsens in the coming days.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "title": "Adderall during pregnancy",
    "content": "Hello, The easy answer is if you don't really need it, don't take it in pregnancy.  That is the safe course for almost all drugs.  But, that said, often medications are needed in pregnancy and many have been found to be safe.  Label warnings are there because drugs are not tested on pregnant or breastfeeding mothers - thus the manufacturer cannot claim safety.    Teratology services have tracked medications for many years in mothers who were on these either not knowing they were pregnant, or because they really were needed and the risk outweighed potential, though unproven, risks.  Adderall is basically an amphetamine, and these have been studied extensively beginning in the 50s and 60s when they were often prescribed for depression.  Babies of mothers who were on the medications were tracked for 30 years and no increased rate of birth defect, learning disability or other problem was noted in the children of these mothers.  What they did observe was some increase in hypertension (high blood pressure) in the moms which can lead to preterm birth and those babies are at risk for serious complications.  So, if you do take the medication, blood pressure should be monitored closely.  If you already have high blood pressure or a history of preterm birth, it would probably be advised to avoid the Adderall.    The other potential problem for the drug is that it suppresses appetite and this can result in inadequate weight gain for the mother, low birth weight for the baby - again putting the baby at risk.  So, the second caution would be (if you choose to continue the drug) to make sure you are eating a healthy diet and gaining the recommended weight for your body type based on body mass index going into the pregnancy.    As with all medications in pregnancy, risk and benefit must be weighed and you should consult with your health care provider who knows your history so you can make a decision that is in your best interest.    Congratulations on your pregnancy and I wish you the best.\n\n",

    "title": "umbilical cord entanglement",
    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to accurately estimate weight in a fetus and they often miss the mark by a bit but this is pretty good for this stage, assuming they are correct.    The baby moves around throughout the pregnancy and often the cord is around various parts of the baby.  Many healthy babies are born with cords around the neck even three times.  It depends on how tightly it is wrapped and whether or not it interferes with the baby's descent into the birth canal.  For this reason the monitoring will focus on any disruption in the baby's heartbeat that might indicate distress and they will be aware that if the baby is not descending, it might be due to the cord.  If that is the case, intervention with a cesarean section might be indicated.  Babies do sometimes have \"cord accidents\" prior to birth or at the time of delivery so it is important to monitor the baby's movements and if a marked decrease is noted, the mother should be seen right away to assess the status of the baby.  I suspect this information is mostly to alert you and the provider in case anything else develops as the mother nears her anticipated delivery date.  This is all that really can be done at this point.  As I said, it is quite common and usually things work out fine.  Be sure to keep all prenatal care appointments at this time and call or see the doctor if you don't feel right about how things are going, baby's movements, etc.  Best wishes to all of you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It looks like you made a mistake in recording your weight here.  Did you mean 70 lbs?  At any rate anorexia can cause ovulation to cease so I would concentrate on your eating disorder.  Getting to a normal, stable weight can only help your chances.  The body knows it cannot support a pregnancy in such a malnourished state so ovulation is suppressed as part of self-preservation.    See a counselor who specializes in eating disorders.  It is important that you be recovered and with a normal BMI.  Recovering is good but not yet safe enough to grow a baby, especially since your changing (and growing) body image is likely to trigger more anorexia if you have been premature in your assessment of your health.  As I'm sure you know, this is not a quick fix problem.  It will take a while to achieve lasting success in overcoming this disease.  Once the weight stabilizes, your doctor can evaluate your hormone function and help with ovulation stimulation hormones in addition to the treatment for PCOS if needed.    Under these conditions, I can see you having a child in the future.  In the meantime, take a daily multiple vitamin if you don't already do so. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Mo Mo37,  The only real concern about the spray tanning is whether the active ingredient can penetrate the skin.  It seems no studies have confirmed that it does, but  if you must use the spray tan, I recommend you wait until your first trimester is over.  Check with your doctor if you are still unsure.  As for the hydration bed, anything that raises the body temperature over 101 degrees F has the potential to cause harm to a developing fetus.  Saunas and hot tubs are not recommended during pregnancy.  I would recommend you avoid the hydration bed during your pregnancy for this reason.  I hope you have a joyful and healthy pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I must first caution you not to assume that because something is \"natural' it is safe.  Many unsafe products are completely natural.  In addition to this caution, supplements are not tested or regulated by the FDA and so we do not have adequate data to declare safety.  In fact no medication is tested on pregnant women - but teratology organizations track women who have taken various drugs so they have anecdotal evidence and can sometimes give you reassurance on other medications.  Supplements remain a mystery and even the purity of the product is sometimes in question.  There has on occasion been found other ingredients contained beyond what is disclosed on the label.  Without greater regulation, this is hard to evaluate.    The best advice is to consult with your doctor.  Often a prescription medication for anxiety will be the safest course in both pregnancy and lactation.  Do not assume that just because the label says not to take in pregnancy or breastfeeding without consulting your doctor because they all say this.  It is because of the limited testing and the individual nature of the patient.  Many medications are very safe in breastfeeding and because of the important benefits to mother and baby it is important not to automatically stop breastfeeding because medication is needed.  Check it out first with an organization like OTIS (otispregnancy.org).  Many communities have access to this type of service locally.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I would definitely suggest that you find a provider in you area and schedule an appointment in the very near future. Generally you should be seen for your first prenatal visit at about 6-8 weeks, and every 4 weeks after that throughout your first trimester.  During your first appointment your provider will determine you due date, obtain a thorough medical and family history, perform a thorough physical and pelvic exam, and obtain blood and urine for a number of laboratory tests.  Some providers also use early ultrasound to confirm a viable, intrauterine pregnancy and to help determine an accurate EDD (due date).  The provider will also make recommendations to help you maintain a healthy lifestyle during pregnancy and answer your questions.  The first trimester is a crucial period for your baby's development, and it is really important to take a prenatal multivitamin with 600-1000mcg of folic acid daily.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would add that many OBs will not see their patients before 10-13 weeks unless they have problems arise before then.  We consider 13 weeks to be the latest recommended onset of prenatal care.  Some will have you come earlier or have a nurse visit to be sure you are on vitamins, sometimes draw blood, etc.  Some will see you earlier and of course this would be great, but as I said, some feel there is so little to be done then it is better to wait until a heart beat can be detected.  This is highly individualized with each provider, but you definitely should be on a vitamin in the meantime.    Good luck.\n\n",

Some patient's need closer follow up because they may have a high risk pregnancy.   I strongly encourage you to seek direct medical attention or to try to get in touch with a qualified health provider who is in a position to make this decision for you.  All the best!\n\n",

    "content": "Since your daughter is Rh-negative, there is no chance you were sensitized during that pregnancy and therefore would not have developed any antibodies.  Sensitization could occur during a miscarriage, ectopic pregnancy, some obstetric procedures (like amniocentesis) and a few other scenarios, so without knowing your history it is not possible to know if there is any possibility that you've ever been sensitized, but if you have had any of the above, you should have received an injection of Rh immune globulin, which will prevent your body from making the antibodies.  A blood test for type and antibodies is routinely done at your first prenatal visit, so your doctor would know if you've been sensitized. You should have another test for type and antibodies and receive an injection of the Rh immune globulin at 28 weeks with this pregnancy, to prevent sensitization, and after your delivery both your blood and your babies' blood will be tested to determine if you need another injection of Rh immune globulin. (If either baby is Rh-positive, you will.) To summarize, if you are not sensitized and thus have no antibodies to Rh-positive blood cells, your babies are not at any risk of harm related to Rh incompatibility. Good luck with your pregnancy!\n\n",

My pregnancy symptoms are: nausea (but no vomiting), bad headaches, backpain, swollen breasts, nosebleeds, insomnia, constipation, tiredness.

These are more sensitive than the urine tests for those whose hormone levels may not yet be evident but who are still pregnant.  Women vary on this so it's possible to have a negative test while still being pregnant.    Be patient and good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have very reliable sources who indicate there is no need to wait as long as you are recovered, have not lost too much blood so as to be anemic and feel up to it emotionally.  The primary reason cited is to have at least one period to help establish the due date of the next baby but with sophisticated ultrasound gestational age dating, this is really irrelevant.  If there were physical reasons such as nutritional deficiency (very underweight, bulimic, etc.) this might be a reason to wait as you build up your body's mass or perhaps stop a bad habit such as smoking.    As for just a general rule, this has been disproven as making a difference to the outcome of the next pregnancy.  If you are healthy you should be fine to try for pregnancy as soon as you feel ready to do so.  Good luck.\n\n",

She has been taking yasmin for about 6-7 months and topamax for about 3 months, and remembers to take her birth control everyday at around the same time. I am not sure as to the dosage of either medication, but I have read that anti-seizure medication such as topamax may reduce the effectiveness of oral contraceptives.  Does anyone know how less effective the Yasmin may be as a result of Topamax?  We do normally use other forms of contraceptives, however there were a few times we did not. :-[\n\n",

    "content": "There is the potential for Topamax to reduce the effectiveness of Yasmin or other hormonal birth control methods.  They are sometimes used together but there is some risk for results not quite up to normal for oral contraceptives without drug interactions.  Potential means it COULD; not that it definitely WILL.  So, you are taking a little bit of a chance when not using backup but probably not a huge risk.  And, the pre-ejactulate is also not a huge risk for pregnancy - only slight.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume you mean she is 34 weeks' pregnant.    Overall weight gain can vary considerably and if the woman is overweight going into the pregnancy it is not necessary for her to gain as much as a lean woman, while still giving birth to a healthy baby.  Your sister's weight at this point doesn't indicate to me if she is of normal weight or not.  It is typical to gain weight during the third trimester as this is when the baby is growing in weight.  The beginning stages are cell division and organ development but at this point, adding fat, muscle, contributing to overall well-being like brain development is important so weight loss should be investigated.  It could also be related to the amount of amniotic fluid.  I would recommend she talk to her doctor about this in case they need to do ultrasounds or non-stress testing to be sure the baby is not compromised.  It is important for her to monitor fetal movement.  She should haver regular movement at this point, feeling about 10 kicks per two hour period.   If it is significantly less than usual or if she notices \"frantic\" movement, these can be warning signs of trouble.  She should also be sure she gets plenty of water to drink.  Dehydration is not good in pregnancy particularly.  Abdominal pain should always be investigated especially if there is blood or high blood pressure as well.  Best wishes and good luck to your sister.\n\n",

    "title": "Decrease in Braxton Hicks, strange pains",
    "content": "Hello, There is some controversy about Braxton-Hicks contractions.  Some say there is no such thing.  Contractions are contractions, but it is important to determine if it might be true preterm labor as opposed to false labor.  Many women chalk the contractions up to Braxton-Hicks when in fact they are having labor, then only get medical attention when it is too late for anything to be done.  The only way to do this is to see if there are any cervical changes taking place along with the contractions.  Throughout pregnancy your body often has contractions, almost as a preparatory exercise but a decrease in these has not been identified with anything alarming.    It is important to monitor fetal movement and a significant decrease in these can be cause for concern - as can a sudden increase in \"frantic\" movement.  You should monitor your baby's movements and at this stage in pregnancy you should feel 10 kicks in a two hour block of time.  Monitor this daily at approximately the same time.  Be sure you are well-hydrated as dehydration is a concern in pregnancy especially.    The other sharp pain you described should be evaluated, especially if you notice any bleeding or have high blood pressure.  This can be a warning sign of problems so your doctor should be informed.  Good luck.\n\n",

Some women do the following month; others may take a few months since hormones can be out of balance.  It is not easier to become pregnant at that time; I would say just average odds.  If you suspect pregnancy, you can take a home test around a week following when you would expect your period and it will likely be accurate.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - 32yo f preg with #2, 32 weeks and having planned c-sec (will be a CAVB - if you can call it that!) My questions -  1 - Staples vs stitches to close a cesarean - seems like there are people on both sides of the fence on this, as far as which heal better/faster. I think at my hosp. staples are the protocol, unless you request otherwise. I didn't really have any issue with them, except I've recently heard from a few people that stitches are much better and leave a nicer scar. Is there any legit. info either way?  2 - One of my friends who had an emergency c-sec said they gave her something called a 'pain ball' which from how she described it, sounded like some slow release delivery mechanism of painkiller that they put inside her before stitching her closed, which helped alleviate the pain over the course of the next few days. Is there really such a thing & if so, is it called a pain ball?  Thanks, E\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Good luck on your c section.  I'm sorry you aren't able to have a VBAC.    Stapes and stitches are usually a doctor's preference and they are equally effective.  In both cases they remove them as soon as possible to reduce scarring.  It is important to remember though that the wound can dehiss (open up) and this is a serious complication so even after the closures are removed you must continue to take it easy and not strain your abdominal muscles.  The pain ball may refer to a dosing mechanism where there is a pump with painkillers for your IV that is controlled by the patient who can order a delivery of medication by pushing a button or squeezing a ball.  This way you get more continuous pain relief and the pump prevents overdosage.  It is a good way to deliver analgesia but it is only for the short term.  Once your IV is removed you will rely on other pain relief measures.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks - to clarify, though, my first delivery was vaginally (hence the 'CAVB' joke), but was so awful that I've elected for a c-section this go round. With staples, do they still use some kind of dissolvable stitches underneath & just use the staples to close the top? or are the staples holding the whole thing together? And the pain ball thing my friend was talking about sounded more like something she went home with, like an implanted capsule of medicine or something - not a pump for an IV. But thanks for the info!\n\n",

If I go to the bathroom...(not pee) I still have a lot of pressure there, it feels like a fist is about to come out. I'm not and haven't been constipated, I don't strain at all. So, I don't see how going would affect that region if I am not even trying. I've also had more braxton hicks lately, very painful ones. I can't walk more than 100 feet without getting them and it's not just one that I get, it feels like they come every 10 minutes. I've tried slowing down while walking and taking breaks but they still come no matter how many steps I take. I also haven't been able to exercise because of the pressure and painful braxton hicks that I get. Can anyone tell me what's going on?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You must consider the possibility of preterm labor so when you have such cramping, you should see your doctor or midwife.  It can be impossible to tell \"Braxton-Hicks\" or false labor from true labor unless you have an examination.  There are also tests that can screen for the likelihood of an imminent delivery so see your provider about this.  Preterm labor can sometimes be stopped if treated early but if you wait and go into labor you could reach the point where it could not be helped and your baby would be at risk for many problems related to prematurity.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Her doctor will advise her I'm sure, but usually it is reommended that the mother not take it the last month.  Since it might take weaning, it would be good to start right away.  Also, there is the risk the baby could come ahead of schedule and would be at risk for breathing problems if she is still taking the narcotics, so sooner would be best if possible.  She may be able to work on relaxation techniques to control the pain - similar to the kinds of methods which are often employed with labor and delivery such as self-hypnosis, visualization, breathing exercises, etc.  Best of luck to you both.

    "content": "Hello, It is possible you are pregnant even with negative tests.  People have varying levels of the hormones in pregnancy and while the tests pick up the majority at a fairly early point, some people show negative for several months even though they are pregnant.  Your doctor can do a blood test which is more sensitive.  Your symptoms certainly suggest pregnancy but other hormonal fluctuation can mimic pregnancy.  Recently stopping the pill is one of those times when your hormones may be a bit erratic.  So, I guess the bottom line is, I can't say which it is but either is possible.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

During my later pregnancy I had severe gestational diabetes (even though I'd lost quite a few pounds) and needed insulin injections (around 60 units per day the last week). The babies were both an average weight and their blood sugar was fine after delivery. I had no other problems like pre-eclampsia or high blood pressure and I'm only a few pounds over weight.  My question for you is: Is it alright for me to try to conceive another baby or can gestational diabetes get dangerously out of control with the next one? I know I'll probably need insulin again but what are the odds of me harming myself or the baby? The doctors didn't mention I shouldn't have more children but the diabetes sort of scares me.

    "content": "Hello, I would not expect any worsening of symptoms in subsequent pregnancies - it does not seem to progress this way.  Gestational diabetes is very common and it's so good that the doctors now screen for it routinely as the greatest concern is with the out-of-control diabetic.  Well-controlled GDM generally results in a healthy mom and baby.    Having had this in pregnancy does predispose you to the possibility of developing type 2 diabetes in the future but it doesn't cause this; just suggests that you might be more prone to it than some other people.  Whatever causes it in pregnancy could also cause it in later life.  You could do some things to help prevent this however.  Regular exercise, a diet low in refined sugars, and maintaining a healthy weight can all help prevent diabetes.    Best wishes and good luck with your plans.\n\n",

I figured I was about 4 - 5 weeks pregnant. I called my OBGYN and wanted to confirm the test.   The blood test was positive and my levels were 244.  I started spotting 5 days later so they had me get my hcg levels done and it was confirmied that I was miscarrying because my levels when down from 244 - 65.   I had all the symptoms of having a miscarriage. I've had contractions/abdominal pain and have been bleeding moderate to heavy.  They had me take another blood test a wk later to make sure the levels were going down to zero.  I got a phone call and the nurse told me that my hcg levels are up to 95 from 65.  Of course there is no doctor in the office until later so they didn't have an answer to why it would be higher.  The nurse actually asked one of the other nurses that work there and they are both baffled to the elevation in the HCG level.  I am confused to why this is going up and could it be that there is still a baby?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi KortCam,  The decision about whether or not to be tested is a decision you'll what to decide for yourself with the advice/input of your husband and doctor.  2 miscarriages can still be an unfortunate coincidence.    If you were to be tested, the main tests that are done are tests to look for hypercoagulable states (conditions that increase the risk of forming blood clots).  With these conditions, small blood clots can form in the vessels that feed the growing baby, compromising its nutrition and ultimately sometimes resulting in a miscarriage.    These conditions include Factor 5 Leiden, Prothrombin 20210 mutation, Antithrombin III, and Lupus anticoagulant (which is actually a procoagulant) among others.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would suspect you are experiencing some bloating, unrelated to the growing uterus if you are sure that you are just five weeks along.  Sometimes your bowels give you trouble when pregnant and perhaps this is the reason.  It would also explain some cramps.  But, cramping in early pregnancy can also be normal.  If there is no blood it is probably nothing to worry about.  If  you were threatening miscarriage, chances are you would begin bleeding as well as cramping.   Give it time to even things out and if you need to take something for your tummy like anti-gas medication, simethicone is safe in pregnancy.    Best wishes for a safe and healthy pregnancy.\n\n",

I had blood levels checked a week later to make sure they were going down and they went from 65 to 97 and was told that all the tissue was probably not all out and most likely would need a D and  C.  I had another blood test on Dec 31st and had a Doctors appt today (Jan 2) my levels quadrupled.  They went from 97 to 549 in 1 week.  I'm very confused.  Is there a baby and if so is it unharmed.  I have to wait 1 more week to see what they levels read again and if they reach the right levels they will give me an ultrasound.   Thank you  Theresa\n\n",

Don't stress too much about the numbers - we can drive ourselves crazy this way.  Much of pregnancy-related life involves patience and waiting.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "ovulation, birth control and periods?",
    "content": "Hello, It is often very normal to have irregular periods.  The majority of women have some fluctuation because hormones are not released at exactly the same rate naturally, the way they are with artificial manipulation from oral contraceptives.  Widespread use of the pill has made us think that a predictable, regular cycle is normal and anything else is problematic.  In an ideal world we might all have regular cycles we can calendar around but in the real world this is not the case.  The irregularity may be somewhat influenced by the pill use but it is just as likely that it is just your individual body's hormone regulation.  Mother Nature tends to surprise us.  It is also nearly impossible to accurately predict your ovulation date or conception time, though you could get it within a few days if you limited sexual activity to one day in particular.  For this reason I wonder why you believe the bleeding was the day after conception.  If it was the day after you had intercourse, it is still possible you ovulated at a different date - earlier or later.  The frequent periods should in no way interfere with your ability to become pregnant.  It just might make it a little harder to predict your approximate time of ovulation.  Most pregnancies occur spontaneously with regular unprotected sexual intercourse in a matter of months without need for diligent calendar watching.  Relaxing can actually assist in the process since you will not be dealing with stress hormones and their possible negative effects.    So, enjoy the experience and let nature take its course.  You are not having any symptoms of concern.  It is possible for an increase in hormonal fluctuation after stopping the birth control pills so irregularity is nothing to be alarmed about.    Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It could be that your hormones were not high enough yet to be detected on the home test.  Maybe a week later you would get a different result.  Going off birth control pills often results in some cycle disruption so you could be experiencing this.  Try to relax because stress can also delay your period.    It is not always possible to say when you will ovulate.  We give a range only of days 8 though 14 (start counting the first day of period).  Most, but not all, women ovulate during that period of time if they have regular cycles of 26 to 32 days.  When people try to conceive, they concentrate efforts on those days and luck comes into play here.  Do not limit yourself to having sex on those days, but you would want to be sure you are doing it about every other day during the potentially fertile period.  It would be considered normal if it takes up to a year to become pregnant.    Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

Usually finding out so early that most wouldn't have known they were pregnant. except for the last time I was told I m/c a week after I found out... my urines kept showing negative so I believe them and in June I found out I was 3 months along but I had drank alcohol and had been on other meds so the baby stopped developing and had no HB and my tummy was getting bigger and I was getting sicker so we had to do a d&c. Now with saying that my question is.. in October I had a normal mense on 10/05 and then on 10/30 I had some maroon/red spotting then nothing after that. I never got my real period that was due 11/02... On 11/29 in the pm I went to the bathroom wiped once and there was red blood and then nothing after that. we bd that night and still no AF. Then on 12/1 had belly cramps and lots of gas and when I went to the bathroom a little brown only when i wiped... that happened only once or twice a day on 12/1, 12/2 and 12/3... Now we are on 12/25 and I still have no AF. I took pregnancy test some were neg and 4 were pos... took more yesterday and they were neg... do you think its possible because the last pregnancy did not show in my urine that I am pregnant again?? I still have very very tender breast but mostly I have belly pains all the time like menstrual cramps for about 5 weeks now. I don't have insurance until the first but I have been drinking and there was some illicit drug use.... prior to my suspicions....and not knowing using the illicit drugs.... so needless to say I should not have been there with my so called friends... please don't judge me because I would have never of drank or knowingly taken anything to harm a baby I was trying so hard for.\n\n",

Meanwhile, avoid the drugs, take your vitamins and take care of yourself with diet and exercise.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a certain amount of luck involved in conceiving a child.  It is a process where hormones, release of egg, intercourse timing all come together and it (sometimes) works.  It does not happen every time you try, even for the most well-planned according to the calendar, and it is considered normal for it to take a year even with regular sexual relations and no birth control.  It is possible you could have some delay in ovulation due to the depo shot but chances are you are ovulating - things just haven't yet worked out that fertilization and implantation has occurred.  I would not be concerned yet about any problem - you probably just need to give it time, have patience and if you want to get married, plan accordingly, allowing pregnancy to happen when it will.  Sometimes we have less to say about this than we would like to think and it just takes persistence, faith and trust that it will happen eventually - when it does, what a happy surprise that can be!    In the past, before birth control pills, most pregnancies occurred this way.   Good luck with your future plans - all of them.\n\n",

    "content": "Hormones vary considerably between women and I can't say how long you might be affected.  Many women do become pregnant right away so clearly it is not a consistent problem; just a possibility and I a only speculating that is COULD be a factor, though I suspect it is just the normal luck of the draw for when conception may actually occur for you.    You have done nothing wrong in the use of the depo and I suspect you will become pregnant if you have regular intercourse without birth control.  You may not know exactly when you ovulate, though many women become very good at recognizing the subtle changes in their vaginal secretions.  This whitish discharge tends to get more plentiful near the time of ovulation.  This is perhaps the easiest way to know on your own.  We predict that most women ovulate somewhere around 14 days after their period begins but again, much variation is the norm.    For most couples, daily or every other day sexual activity will result in pregnancy within a few months.\n\n",

If blood sharing occurred this obviously would not be the case and the baby would always have the same type.  The only time there is some crossover is at delivery when there is a chance the mother could be exposed to the baby's blood and if she is a negative blood type and the baby is positive, it would be necessary for the mother to receive RhoGam to prevent problems with antibodies she might make that could affect her future pregnancies.  This is a condition that is well controlled and the doctor would be aware of any risk that way with the preventive measures taken, assuming she gets good prenatal and delivery care.    Good luck to your daughter and all concerned in this endeavor.\n\n",

    "content": "Hormonal fluctuation can cause occasional bleeding between periods and this can still be within normal limits. Even though you have a history of regular periods, it is entirely normal to sometimes get it at a different time.  Your other symptoms can certainly be due to a number of problems; not just pregnancy.  PMS, bowel problems, etc.  It is unlikely that the unprotected sex with bleeding right after resulted in pregnancy and that would have been very early to experience anything pregnancy-related.  Implantation bleeding that sometimes occurs when you are pregnancy happens at about the time your next period would occur - a couple of weeks after conception.  Repeating the pregnancy test is your best option but your doctor could perform a blood test which would be even more accurate early on.  Try to be patient and things may resolve on their own. Stress can affect your periods too.  I hope this answers your question.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It is unlikely you are pregnant with your faithful use of the pill, but there is always that possibility.  Such common symptoms as you describe are often associated with a variety of conditions so you would need to rule them out one at a time, most likely.    You said your last time to have intercourse was Dec. 9 but I assume there were other times since your last bleed as well.  Based on this information, if pregnancy occurred I would suspect it was just that recently.  If you must know this early, I would recommend a blood pregnancy test for accuracy.  By the first week of the new year you will likely either have another period or, if not, you could take a home pregnancy test.    You should check for urinary infection if you continue to have cramping, pain and urinary frequency as this could be the problem.  Another potential concern might include bowel irritability.  As you suggested, there are also sometimes side effects with the pill that can mimic pregnancy so this is also a possibility.  I'm sorry I can't confirm what is actually happening in your case.  You can wait it out a little while and see if it subsides but if symptoms get worse you should have it checked out.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, You should be aware that the dose of medication may have to be increased during pregnancy in the case of hypothyroidism. Your blood level of TSH will be periodically checked throughout pregnancy to see if any adjustment is needed. Thyroid function tests should continue to be reviewed every 2-3 months throughout the pregnancy. After delivery, the dose should be close to the pre-pregnancy dose and thyroid function tests reviewed two months later.  Controlled thyroid levels will ensure your healthy pregnancy.  Thyroid medication does not hurt the baby but not taking it as needed could.  Do plan to breastfeed your baby for additional health benefits.  The medication will not do any harm at that time either and will help to ensure a good milk supply.  Fetal heart rate is typically between 120 and 160/minute.  It doesn't matter if you are on the low end or the high end, it is still in the normal range.    Best wishes.\n\n",

Since you are just over the 7 weeks and too early for the 9th week.  I would say your baby is fine.  At 7 weeks the prescence of a heartbeat is a sign of a healthy pregnancy.  As far as your thyroid condition it is perfectly safe to take thyroid medication during pregnancy.  This will not affect the thyroid development of the baby.  A TSH level should be monitored frequently during pregnancy to make sure you do not need a medication adjustment.  As for having a normal pregnancy, most babies that develop problems are due to mom not being treated for a thyroid disorder.  Since you are currently being treated for this disorder your chances of having a normal pregnancy is good.I encourage you to talk to your doctor about the continued need for monitoring your TSH, and free T4.    Good luck and congratulations. Sandy RN\n\n",

If it is viral antibiotics will not help (probably the reason the Zpack did not take care of it) but secondary bacterial infections can arise after you have been fighting a virus and your resistance is down.  So, this does not mean you may not need antibiotics yet.    It sounds like you have done much for your condition already and it may just require more time, rest, fluids and patience.  It can take a while for your immune system to fully eliminate the infection, especially during pregnancy.   You might try resting in a recliner instead of a bed for better oxygen exchange and increased comfort.  As long as you are able to get adequate oxygen and your doctor feels your lungs are clear, you may just have to wait it out.    Good luck in your recovery and with the birth of your child.\n\n",

The reason the doctor prescribes the cough medicines is to try and decrease the cough while your body heals itself.  If the cough keeps you awake nights, you may need something stronger, by prescription so when you talk to your doctor make sure you are very clear about your symptoms and if it affectig your sleep or breathing.  Good luck\n\n",

August 29, 2007...I went in for my 2nd ultrasound and there was no heartbeet. The next day [30th] I had a D&C done. I started my period September 30, 2007, exactley a month later, the period was painful, heavy and very uncomfortable. October, my period was regular, I started my period the 24th of November [6 days early] and it was again, heavy and very \"clotty\". It lasted 7 days like usual though. Now, December 9th, I stared my period AGAIN! It is dark, just like on the 26th of November. I feel very weird, and have gotten sick with some thing similar to strep throat twice in the past two months. I have also been having unprotected sex since Mid-October.  Please give me your input?  Thanks ![/b]\n\n",

    "content": "You should be commended for your diligent concern in pregnancy for the safety of your unborn child.  The problem with these things is that they are not regulated by the FDA and we wouldn't test on pregnant women even if they were.  There have been reports lately that we are regularly breathing and consuming millions of toxins and they are only scratching the surface of finding out what possible responses we may be seeing.  We know there are unexplained increases in certain diseases and syndromes which may be related to environmental factors.    Lavendar has been implicated to a degree in affecting boys sexual organs by increasing estrogen.  There are not a lot of studies about this to confirm but if you want to be safe on it, avoid the lavender for baby boys.  How it might affect pregnancy is anyone's guess at this point.  We have lots of toxins in our world and we need to learn more, do more and live differently than we have in the past.  Many people are switching to more organics, fewer additives and chemicals, etc. to be on the safe side.    I have heard some lectures recently that have suggested we stay away from aromatherapy.  The fact that it does help for certain conditions is a clue that it could also have adverse effects.       Along these lines, it is recommended that we all avoid microwaving in plastic.  Bits of plastic get into our food and it's just not good for us. This is a hard habit to break.  There are many more safety concerns about the environment but these are a couple of things that can be done to help.    Best wishes for you and your children.\n\n",

In this day of the pill, women have come to expect very regular menses.  So, you may not be conceiving or some other problem causing the cessation of your periods, but after all the testing that has been done, I don't think it is due to pregnancy.    Are you by chance underweight or a heavy exerciser?  Stress such as this or mental stress can result in missed periods.  Having amenorrhea (absence of periods) is rarely caused by anything serious.    It can take several months following birth control pill use for periods to get back to \"normal.\"  There are other hormonal imbalances that can cause this symptom and this could generate from one of several glands, involving different hormones.  If you go a few months without a period, you should be evaluated as to what might be causing this.  Missing three or more in a row would probably be a good indicator that it is time to have it checked.  Remember, though, this is a symptom; not a disease.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your symptoms do suggest pregnancy and some people do not respond to the tests at first due to variable hCG levels.  If your symptoms continue and you do not get your period you should have a serum (blood) pregnancy test which is more sensitive than urine.    Other hormones can cause symptoms that mimic pregnancy - some people experience these regularly in association with their pregnancy.  Since you are noticing a difference it seems unlikely.  But, if they continue with negative pregnancy tests, you should see a doctor.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Congratulations on your pregnancy.    I would say that at least in one way your chances are now somewhat decreased for miscarriage.  There is a condition called a blighted ovum where the baby never develops.  Your ultrasound has revealed that this type of miscarriage won't happen.  However, there are other things that can go wrong so you can't totally breathe a sigh of relief yet.  It is estimated that up to 30% of all pregnancies result in miscarriage, usually this occurs by the 10th to 12th week so time is on your side if you make it to that point.  These are the miscarriages that are believed to be caused by chromosomal defects or implantation/placenta problems.  Later miscarriages are usually due to different factors.  They still happen, but not nearly as often.  Take good care of yourself, eat healthy food, exercise, take a daily multivitamin, wear your seatbelt, get adequate rest and try not to stress too much.  All these will help you assure a healthy pregnancy.  Beyond that there is little we can do.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am so glad to see you are taking your prenatal vitamins.  I can understand your concern about your medications. Most women with asthma have perfectly normal, healthy babies, but we know that uncontrolled asthma can result in too little oxygen getting to the baby, increasing the risk for low birthweight and other problems. Uncontrolled asthma can also increase your risk for pregnancy complications such as pre-eclampsia and hyperemesis (too much vomiting).    These are much greater threats than the unknown potential risk to the baby by using your medication to remain in control.  We have not seen documented association of increased birth defects in babies whose mothers have used their asthma medications but since we don't do studies on pregnant women we do not have the kind of controlled studies that can show definite safety.  For this reason the manufacturers do not make claims to that effect.  Talk to your doctor about this but the evidence does suggest it is important to be well-ventilated and if that means using your medication, this is the risk/benefit ratio we are looking for.    Your age does not increase your risk greatly.  There is nothing magical that happens to a woman's body at precisely age 35 so don't worry too much.  It is true that having your first baby now slightly increases some risks but most women your age deliver perfectly healthy babies and it is becoming much more common than it was in the past besides.  Taking care of yourself is your best assurance for a healthy pregnancy.  Good luck with the virus and let us know if you have other concerns.    Best wishes.\n\n",

The cause of your gums bleeding should be investigated but it is not related to your periods unless you have some kind of systemic condition that has affected hormones throughout the body.    Stress can result in absence of periods, even if it doesn't seem worse than usual.  Many women have times of period irregularity and it is considered normal.  However, if it goes on for a prolonged period and you aren't on medications that might make cause this, you should have it checked out so I am glad you are going into the clinic on the 11th.

Your doctor could do an ultrasound exam to verify pregnancy.    I'm sorry I can't tell you anything more definitive than this.  Since you are still having symptoms of pregnancy it makes sense to just see how it progresses now.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Not likely.  You probably were not showing adequate levels of immunity so they gave you the vaccine after delivery when they could be certain you were not pregnant.  This is a shot that should not be given during pregnancy.  They test at your prenatal appointment to see if you are immune.  If not, they give the vaccine after you give birth.  Most people develop immunity after the vaccine so I expect the next time you are pregnant and your doctor tests you will show the antibodies and won't need it again.  It is a rare person who would need to repeat it.\n\n",

Yesterday marked two more weeks, she saw one sac, and my beta level was only 450. dr. said even though ultrasound looks ok, this is a very bad sign and the pregnancy is probably not viable...  However, she said that my progesterone levels are very high...?  I will go back for another beta and ultrasound in a few days.   Any feedback would be appreciated.\n\n",

I'm glad to know your progesterone levels are good.  That is encouraging for your general reproductive health for future efforts.  Miscarriage is a very common outcome and few women complete their childbearing years without experiencing at least one.  It is disappointing, frustrating and very depressing for some women so watch for signs that you might need some counseling.  Best of luck Debbie\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, it is possible to get the influenza vaccine without preservatives or with only trace amounts but the supply is limited so you would have to check with the supplier to find out if theirs is that particular type.    The dangers of flu are greater for pregnant women so it is important for you to get the vaccine.  You can read the US Government Center for Disease Control information about influenza vaccine and preservatives here: http://www.cdc.gov/flu/about/qa/thimerosal.htm  Sometimes web addresses change but you can get information about vaccine safety from the CDC through a search if this one does not work for you.  There are many toxins in our environment that are known dangers and much more serious than the preservatives in adult vaccines.  I'm glad to see you are concerned with the health of your baby.  Hopefully we can all do more to clean up the air, water, and soils to make the world safer for the next generations.  Most likely, birth defects are caused by a combination of many different environmental toxins and genetic predisposition.  You are wise to be cautious and people like you who are concerned with safety issues can be active in world health concerns.       Meanwhile, use your seatbelt, don't smoke, drink alcohol, take your vitamins, eat a healthy diet and exercise.  These are the things that will do the most to ensure a healthy baby.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I certainly understand your concern.  The good news is that your doctor is right.  What you describe is perfectly normal in early pregnancy.  There is no way to be sure everything will continue as you hope but what you have seen is not a cause for grave concern either.    In most early miscarriages, there is really not much that can be done to prevent.  Some doctors are prescribing progesterone if they suspect you may not have adequate levels of that hormone but it will only help if that was the cause of your previous miscarriages.  Some women have clotting disorders and a blood thinner is sometimes prescribed but these cases are not the most common; just two of the identified factors involved in miscarriage.  If it was a chromosomal abnormality, as is most often assumed, there is nothing that can be done to prevent it.  I do wish you luck this time around.  Talk to your doctor about your concerns.  Especially since you have had repeated miscarriages, it is worth investigating.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible it could be either a heavy period or an early miscarriage.  If the latter is the case, it is very likely her body will just take care of it anyway.  If she has other symptoms she should definitely see a doctor but if it is just bleeding with clots (normal) and cramping, the chances are she never will know if it was a very early miscarriage.  If she continues for more than a week to have heavy bleeding it would be good to have it checked out.  There would be no point in doing a pregnancy test now because she is either on her period or having a miscarriage and in either case the test would be negative.  If a woman who is sexually active misses a period, a home pregnancy test is usually quite reliable within a week after the missed period date.  Thank you for your concern for your friend.  I do not believe her future reproduction will be affected unless she contracts a sexually transmitted infection such as HIV, syphilis or gonorrhea.    Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

She called and said that my blood work didn't match up going by my last period.Well,  i told the doctor yesterday that it wouldn't. I think i get my cycle and know when i tested positive. She said that i am only 2-3 weeks pregnant, but that can't be right. You are already considered 2 weeks when you actually concieve baby. So do you think she meant i have only been pregnant 2-3 weeks making me 4-5 weeks pg. I figured yesterday that  I was about 4.5 weeks. Anyway, they want me to come in for another blood test tommorrow in the AM. It was kind of hard to understand all that the nurse said because my son was bieng loud.  The reason i haven't seen my OB is that his office likes to know what your primary doc gives you for a due date before you see him.\n\n",

    "title": "How far in pregnancy do you think i am??",
    "content": "It is impossible for me to guess what she meant and the period date is really all we can go by until later when ultrasounds can verify the most likely due date.  Only about 30% of women ovulate during the 5 or 6 days considered most likely.  That means 70% of women ovulate earlier or later so there will be much variability.  A period date just gets us in the ballpark.    Even blood work has limited accuracy here as hCG levels, which double anywhere from 48 to 72 hours (and up to 96 hours later on) are not consistent enough to say for sure when conception occurred.  We give our best guess to get us in the ball park then watch how the baby grows. The routine mid-pregnancy ultrasound is quite accurate at determining gestational age.  Earlier ultrasound exams can also give a pretty good idea but likely within a week or two either way.    This may be helpful: Typical test results for hCG #  3 weeks LMP: 5 - 50 mIU/ml # 4 weeks LMP: 5 - 426 mIU/ml # 5 weeks LMP: 18 - 7,340 mIU/ml  Many OBs don't actually see their patients until around 10-12 weeks' gestation so this is quite typical.   At this point it should not be that significant to know exactly how many weeks along you are.  Take your vitamins, exercise and eat right, avoid unhealthy habits so you can have a healthy pregnancy.  This is where I would put my efforts if I were you.  Good luck and congratulations on your pregnancy!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi - I am a RN - but my specialty is not Ob.  I have a concern.  I had a positive preganacy test - and can only assume that i am truly pregnant -i won't get to the obstetrician until next week.  As best as I can figure, the baby was conceived on Oct 27th.  Was not planned, but I am happy.  The problem is, that before I realized I could be pregnant, I took Restoril to help me sleep (i've been suffering with insomnia for years.)  I took 15 mg caps approximately 3 - no more than 4 times.  I realized that that may have been problematic, so I looked it up today and confirmend my fear - that it is preg cat X - and can cause fetal defects.  So now I am of course worried.  I realize that there is probably not too much I can do about it now - and I haven't taken any since the few days - and of course will not take anymore.  I guess what I am looknig for is what type of defect is associated with this and if the couple of doses of 15 mg Restoril could have caused significant damage.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I can certainly understand your concern.  I would check with a teratology service if you have one in your area.  You can go to this link:  http://www.otispregnancy.org/ for locating local agencies.  These people are the experts at medication interaction in pregnancy or lactation.  They should be able to give you some information more specific to your situation.  They probably can say if it is likely to be a problem with just such limited use and, if so, what might be expected.  Let me know if you can't get information and I will call our local teratology service.    They have some medication fact sheets on their website, but I didn't see one for Restoril.  In general, discontinuing such medications once pregnancy is suspected or confirmed is often enough to reduce risks considerably.  It is often the cumulative effect of exposure that causes problems.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "At this point it could go either way.  There is a high risk of miscarriage in general - possibly as high as 30% of all pregnancies when you consider those who don't even know they are pregnant when they miscarry.  But it is very common to have these symptoms in a normal pregnancy as well.  So, it's just a waiting game at this point.  If it is a miscarriage you will likely continue to have symptoms which will likely be more pronounced.    There is really nothing you can do to intervene.  Early miscarriages are thought to be related to chromosomal abnormalities and things just aren't developing properly.  Nothing you can do will stop this type of miscarriage.  It never hurts to take it easy a bit to give your body every chance in case the pregnancy is to be OK.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Of the proton pump inhibitor class medicines (of which nexium is a part), nexium is probably among the safest.  There are a few others (prevacid and protonix) that are also class B.  Nexium's \"brother\" medicine, omeprazole (brand name prilosec) is rated class C.    The lesser strength antacids, such as famotidine (Pepcid) or ranitidine (zantac) are both class B as well.  You can discuss with your obstetrician whether or not she thinks any of these would be safer but I suspect that the Nexium is just as safe or more safe than some of the other options.  The one antacid that is very safe and can give some extra needed calcium is Tums.  While it is good at controlling heart burn it is no where near as strong as the other medications above.

    "content": "Hello, I can understand that you are anxious to conceive and worried about your circumstances.  PCOS can definitely make it difficult, though many people conceive naturally in spite of this condition.   I would hope you are getting the PCOS in control prior to attempting fertility treatments because you might conceive without the fertility drugs.  Because so many women with PCOS have high insulin levels or their body does not use insulin efficiently, insulin medications such as Metformin can help normalize insulin levels.  This alone has been found helpful in regulating periods and promoting ovulation.  If you are overweight, losing a few pounds can also improve your chances for ovulation.    Your doctor will need to evaluate and determine how to handle your nonstop bleeding.  Clomid is not known to fix that problem.  It is a serious medication and should only be taken under a doctor's care after careful evaluation to determine if you are a candidate for this treatment.  It also greatly increases your odds for multiples which carry many other problems such as preterm birth and lifelong problems that often go along with that.  You should be made well aware of the risks.  Often when people are feeling desperate to conceive, they brush off these risks, then when they conceive multiples they may risk losing the babies or having serious problems they really haven't considered but which may compound their sorrow.    Clomid itself often causes other side effects as well and your doctor should discuss these with you prior to prescribing the medication.  I repeat, DO NOT TAKE THIS MEDICATION ON YOUR OWN, even if you are able to get your hands on it without a prescription.   Good luck in your efforts to have a child.\n\n",

    "content": "I agree that the chances of pregnancy are practically nonexistent based on the information you have shared.  If there was more that you haven't mentioned, I can't be so confident.  Don't worry about brown fluid discharge, etc.  It usually indicates old blood your body is getting rid of.  Menstrual fluid contains more than just blood too, so a little clotting, stringy mucus, tissue, etc. can all be normal.  It looks like you may be at risk for sexual intercourse soon so if you haven't considered birth control it would be wise to do that now to protect your future health, that of your unborn future children, and to ensure you only become a mother when you are ready to do that.  Infections are also rampant right now so it's a good idea to be prepared with a condom just in case.  Plan so you aren't surprised.  It will give you peace of mind so you won't be worried with each encounter.    Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  There are so many different causes for vaginal bleeding.  Annovulatory cycles, cysts, etc.  It could even be ovulatory spotting.  How many days ago were these near-intercourse encounters?  I can help you decide if now would be a good time to take a home pregnancy test simply to ease your mind (since I sincerely, sincerely doubt that pregnancy is anything to worry about.)  A pregnancy test is only useful after a certain amount of time has gone by.  Really, based on the info you relayed, the chances of you being pregnant are practically non-existent.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, the \"risky\" encounters happened a month ago. I was on period at that time, but I read being on period cannot be considered a safe period either. Anyway, I was expecting my period on 14th. I started having a little brownish discharge on 13th & 14th, had regular and quite heavy discharge on 15th, and that's it. On 16th, there was red discharge, but only during defecation, nothing apart from that.   I'm currently freaking out because found a lot of sites on google which related \"one day long period\" to early pregnancy. So I'm scared out of my mind right now!\n\n",

    "content": "I think I can help you feel better.  I'm not sure how much you know about the menstrual cycle.  If you know a lot, then go ahead and don't pay attention to this entire paragraph.  =)  okay.   The first day of bleeding is cycle day 1.  Typically bleeding will last about 5 days.  Ovulation occurs anywhere between cycle day 11 or so up until very late in the cycle-the average day is day 14.  Sperm can live inside the female tract for up to 5 days.  There is typically a 7 day window around ovulation where it is POSSIBLE (but not likely, since it is not likely for sperm to live those 5 days or to conceive after ovulation) to conceive.  The egg will only live about 12-24 hours.  So it's safe to say there are 7 days where you should either avoid intercourse or use birth control.  After ovulation, there is a phase called the Luteal Phase that will last anywhere from 10 to 18 days.  A home pregnancy test will be positive anywhere after around 12 days past ovulation or so.  What I'm trying to say is, if these encounters were a month ago, if you were to take a test now it would be positive if you were pregnant.  The bleeding may be annovulatory bleeding.  A woman does not always ovulate during her cycle.  This causes stress for her because she worries about pregnancy when her period doesn't come \"on time.\"  A period that is \"late\" is really kind of a myth....ovulation days can vary in the same woman from cycle to cycle.  I know that I have had ovulations anywhere from cycle day 12 to cycle day 100+.  Sometimes it just happens.  And when you're under stress, as you are right now, it is even more likely to occur.  \"Breakthrough bleeding\" like you just had is very common during annovulatory cycles.  I'm sure that was long winded.  I'm not a doctor, I've just spent many years in the throws of infertility and I know menstrual cycles very very well.  =)  My advice is to take a pregnancy test.  If these encounters were a month ago, IF you were pregnant it would be positive by now.  No matter what, it will put your mind at ease.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thank you for taking time for giving that explanation. Yes, I did have general idea of menstrual cycle and ovulation, got to know some more details from you. So that was very helpful.   I remembered another event during the same time last month that I thought might be risky. I'd touched his penis, but I didn't touch myself soon after that. I did, but only after half an hour may be, while cleaning up. So I guess if there was anything on my hand, even after so long time, that'd have been washed away with chlorinated water, right?   My boyfriend has also been trying to convince me that nothing can happen, and even I honestly can't understand how what we did could get me pregnant, but the fact that I had just a day long period and now it's fading again and also a little bit of nauseousness (in the morning, after meals) got me worried. There was also a little bit of lightheaded-ness (I think that's what it was - I felt like I would lose balance at random times during the day), which I associated with stress and emotional disturbance (some problems in the family) which left me drowned in tears for a couple of days, the time when I was expecting my period.   I can't explain the nausea though!   May be I will buy a pregnancy test kit, just to make sure. Hopefully nothing is wrong!   Thanks again for all the information! I really appreciate it.   One question I have, we can't possibly ovulate during periods or just before or just after period, can we? There's at least a few days' difference between ovulation and menstruation, right?\n\n",

Please take a pregnancy test and let us know what the outcome is!    Be sure to be more careful in the future.

    "content": "A blood test at your doctor's office will be billed to your insurance and if you're on the parents' insurance, they may very well find out.  And since it is called a \"quantitative HCG\" or \"qualitative HCG\", if your parents know that HCG is the pregnancy hormone, then they would know what it was.  You can always get a test at Planned Parenthood, however I don't know if they do blood tests or not.  But really, the home pregnancy tests that you buy at the store are very sensitive and accurate.  Especially given the fact that your incidents were a month ago and if you conceived then, you would be about 6 weeks along by now.  There are certain brands that are more sensitive than others.  I have certain brands that I like better than others.  This website has a great table showing the sensitivity of home pregnancy tests:  http://www.fertilityplus.org/faq/hpt.html  Tests measuring the lowest mIU are going to be the most sensitive.  I advise you to steer clear of the ones from the Dollar Store though, despite the fact that they are listed on that website.  Those tests are notorious for \"evaporation lines\", or false positives.  When performing a home pregnancy test, be certain to follow the directions and read the test after the time frame and not any later.  Many tests will get an evaporation line after they have sat for an hour or two and make it look positive when it really is not.  Good luck and be sure to update\n\n",

I had my period a couple of days before the due date this month, but that's not new for me. The thing is, since past couple of months, I've been having pinkish-brownish discharge some days prior the beginning of the period, before the actual bleeding starts. I can't even say discharge, because it merely stains the underwear a little, nothing more. Last month, similar thing happened and the actual bleeding happened just one day, which freaked me out and I kept thinking I'm pregnant, although chances seemed virtually nil. This month, I had moderate bleeding for the first day, then a little heavy on second and not much on third. The thing that's worrying me the most is I'm feeling sick a lot since past two months, in the morning when I wake up, or after meals etc. I doubt it could be a pregnancy symptom, but can anyone tell me what else could be causing it? I'm scared to go to my family doc, worried that she might tell me that I'm pregnant or something. I might take another blood test, but I was hoping to get some help here, because this site has been very helpful for me so far.  1) nauseous, especially in the morning and after meals 2) also, stomach seems a little protruding on the left side only, I have no clue why 3) had mild pain/cramps (can't exactly tell) on the left side of the stomach on second day of period; this is not normal for me because I hardly have any stomach pains before or during periods 4) slight dizziness once in a while  What could cause all this? Also, I have a question regarding hcg levels. hcg is produced in pregnant women, then why 0-5 hcg is considered normal in men and non-pregnant women? Do people normally have a 0-5 level of hcg in body without being pregnant? I really appreciate your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Vinod,  There is a very logical explanation for the lab testing.  Hopefully I can explain it clearly.  As you have described, blood types are either Rh postive or Rh negative.  The Rh factor is also known as the D antigen.  The baby will receive one gene from each mom and dad.  If either of those genes is the Rh + gene the baby will be Rh +.  In your families' case, your wife is Rh neg. so she has two copies of the Rh negative gene.  With you being Rh + and having a baby that is Rh neg. you must have one copy of the + gene and one of the neg. gene (causing you to be Rh + but able to pass the Rh neg. gene to your child).  When mom's are Rh negative there is a chance that the baby could be Rh +.  In this case, if some of the baby's blood gets into mom's blood stream she may develop antibodies to the Rh+ blood cells.  These antibodies subsequently can cross the placenta and destroy the baby's blood cells causing severe problems.    To prevent this, Rh negative moms are given an injection of Rhogam.  This is Rh + antibody.  While it may seem counter-intuitive to give the antibody that we are trying to prevent from forming the reason is quite clever.  This way, there is some, but not much, of the antibody floating through mom's body.  If any of the Rh + baby blood cells get into the mom's blood stream the antibody binds them before mom's body is able to react so that mom never forms antibodies to the red cells.  Now, on to the indirect coombs test.  There are two types of coombs test (direct and indirect).  The direct test looks for the antibodies to the Rh + antigen in the baby and the indirect looks for it in the mom.  When your wife was tested she was initially negative indicating that she had not formed antibodies to the Rh + cells.  This indicates that the Rhogam can protect her from forming these antibodies.  She was subsequently appropriately given the Rhogam shot.  After this she was tested again and found to have a positive indirect coombs test.  This subsequent positive test is expected because she was given the Rh+ antibody (in the Rhogam).    I am uncertain why the cesarean section was recommended.  The subsequent + test would not be indicative of the mother developing an Rh antibody.  The titer was low suggestive that the Rh antibody present was from the Rhogam.  Generally, a second test is not done because it will be positive.    Please do not take this to mean that I am second guessing your obstetrician.  If the obstetrician suspected the baby may have been in danger and was developed enough for delivery, the decision was probably made that it was safest to deliver the baby.  I suspect that there was more involved in the decision than just the Rh factor.  I hope this helps some and isn't too confusing.  Please feel free to ask any follow up questions if this doesn't make sense.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It would be recommended that you have genetic counseling because first cousins are more likely to have similar genetic makeup making it more likely to have the same abnormal gene that might not appear in either of you.  This is because there are recessive genes and it sometimes takes the same defective gene from each parent to show up as a defect in the child.  Other than this, I know of no way that you could effect the outcome by any behavior or precautions.  If you are near a university, this might be a place to start looking for a genetic counselor.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It is very unlikely you need to use any fertility aid.  At your age, a normal, sexually active woman will likely achieve pregnancy within the year.  Chances are you are already ovulating so why would you want to take a supplement that is supposed to help you to ovulate?  I would not take anything now except a multivitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate (folic acid).  This has been shown to decrease serious birth defects considerably when it is taken from the very time of conception.    If you want to try particularly when you are fertile and if you have a normal 26 to 32 day cycle, you should have regular sex (like every other day) between days 8 and 19.  Start counting on the first day of your last period.    Meanwhile, relax and let nature take its course.  Eat well, stop any bad health habits like smoking, drinking and drugs.  See a doctor for a preconception visit to see if you have any immunizations due or any underlying health problem that should be addressed.  If you are overweight, the doctor will likely advise you to lose a bit (being overweight alone can decrease fertility and cause complications in pregnancy).  Make sure you and your boyfriend are mentally and emotionally ready to handle the stress of parenthood.  Read some books about parenting or consider taking a class.  You won't have much time for this once your baby is here.  But, it's good to know what to expect in the way of crying, sleeping and eating patters of newborns, how your life will change, etc.  Some people do not have realistic expectations about this and they have trouble with a demanding infant who requires frequent feedings and does not sleep through the night for several months.    Also, study about breastfeeding so you will be prepared to give your baby the best possible nourishment.  It's also very good for you in several ways.  It is natural and normal but still there is a learning curve and you will be most successful if you prepare.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It would be impossible to say because your symptoms can be present in either case.    Try to be patient as it usually takes a few months for conception even when you are trying.  All conditions must be just right and there's a certain amount of luck that is unpredictable.  So, while you were likely having sex during your fertile time, you still may not achieve pregnancy at this time.  Keep in mind also that there is a high rate of miscarriage, often occurring before you even know you are pregnant.  For this reason, getting a very early test can sometimes be painful.  If you actually do miscarry, you might have a harder time than if you didn't know it.    What you can do now is prepare yourself to be in the best possible physical health by taking a multivitamin which contains at least 400 mcg folic acid or folate daily.  You should be eating healthy food, exercising, losing a little weight if you are overweight, and stopping any bad health habits such as smoking, drinking or drugs.  Then try to relax and let things happen naturally.  This is usually how it happens!  Good luck.\n\n",

This september I went to study abroad, and realized that the doctor had stocked me with Yasmin for the rest of my trip..not Yaz like I have always been on.  I had unprotected sex the first week of October, and it is now a few weeks into November.  That very week in October I had switched and started taking Yasmin.  There is a lot of partying, different food choices and traveling while abroad and I know that can take it's effect on ones body.  I am just worried because I have felt bloated, stomach pains, constantly tired, nausea, and lower back pains.    Are yaz and yazmin pretty much made of the same components that I should not worry too much that it happened in the first week? I didnt really understand why the doctor had given me a different type.  Did my body need time to adjust?  I have been worried about this since it happened, so I am of course obsessing over any little weird feeling I have.  Please let me know if I should be worrying!\n\n",

    "content": "I assume you mean you had unprotected sex on the Tuesday and Wednesday following your period which started on Oct. 31- with the patch being applied on Nov. 4? You did not specify which days those were but assuming that it was Nov. 6 & 7 I would say pregnancy is not too likely, but possibly could happen.    The fact that you did have the hormonal patch at that time, along with the fact you most likely would have just been moving into the time when you might be fertile on Nov 7- assuming the hormone does not suppress ovulation this time and that it occurs at the expected time (day 8 through 19 of your cycle).  The 7th would put you into your first of about 12 days where ovulation would be most likely to occur.  This puts you in a pretty safe situation.    The backup recommendation for the first week following the Sunday start is to avoid the very small risk of ovulating early prior to the beginning of the method. If by chance you are breastfeeding, your risk of pregnancy is even lower but I suspect that is not the case.  The only thing you can do now is wait for a pregnancy test to say for sure, assuming your period does not start as expected when you stop the patch for week four.  Meanwhile just continue the patch with weekly changes as prescribed.    Good luck and best wishes as you serve your country.\n\n",

    "content": "This is very confusing to everyone so don't feel badly.  Pregnancy is counted in weeks from the last period; not from the actual conception date.  We don't really know what day you conceived but when the doctor gives you this conception date it is likely based on the assumption you conceived around day 14 of your cycle.  That means when you count weeks (starting at the period onset - the only real date we have) you actually get a \"freebie\" of about two weeks.  In other words you are counted as having completed two weeks before you even conceived.  That's just the way it's done.  Logical perhaps from the need for a beginning date to count from, but confusing as to weeks' gestation.   I hope this makes sense.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 23 yo I just miscarried my third pregnancy at 11 weeks. My doctor insisted that I do a D&C to do testing on the fetus. I asked if there was a risk of infertility afterwards and she said no. After I woke up from my general anesthesia, my boyfriend told me that I lost a lot of blood during the procedure. Noone informed ME of this and when I asked the nurse she simply said it's normal. I just looked up complications after a dilation and curettage and to my suprise there it was that heavy bleeding during the procedure could be a result of a punctured uterus. Is there a way of finding out if this happened? and what are the chances of infertility resulting from a D&C?  I read that if there is scarring or a puncture at point where the fallopian tubes meet the uterus then the egg might not be able to drop and if there is scarring in the uterus the egg might not implant and that there is a possibility of the sperm not being able to travel to the fallopian tubes to fertilize the egg... See now I am VERY WORRIED that by doing the D&C to check my fetus that I may have caused a bigger problem for myself. I am also aware that bleeding can be normal but now I am presented with all of these \"what ifs\" because my boyfriend was the one notified of how my surgery went and unfortunately he does not remember anything that was told to him (just my luck)... thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am sorry for your loss.  Of course you are worried about future pregnancies. You didn't say if your first two were normal deliveries or not.  But either way, it is difficult to suffer through this.    I do think that if there had been a serious complication such as a puncture, your doctor would have informed you.  I also think you would have had more severe symptoms.  The first thing I would do is ask the doctor for a complete explanation of how the procedure went, if there were any complications, how much blood was lost (and if this is within the normal range) and you could even request a copy of the report of the surgery to read yourself.  If there had been a puncture, it would be written along with what was done for it.  I hope this helps you to feel more confident.  For future planning, I would recommend that you continue to take a prenatal or multivitamin to help you prepare for your next pregnancy.  Take care and good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I believe your doctor is just making sure you have sex during your most likely time for fertility.  Any additional days prior to that would be a bonus for you but should not interfere with your efforts at all.  Of course I do not know your situation and cannot know what your doctor means for sure, but this is my speculation.    Good luck in your efforts.  Meanwhile, I have to remind you to take a multivitamin which contains at least 400 mcg folate if you aren't already.  If you do conceive you should have adequate folic acid stores in your body from the very moment of conception and most people's diet alone is not enough to help reduce the risk of some serious birth defects.  Folic acid taken from the outset has been shown to reduce neural tube defects such as spina bifida by 2/3.    Also, keep in mind that with clomid your chances of conceiving multiples are greatly multiplied.  Take this medication cautiously, and with the knowledge that multiples, especially more than two, are high risk for many problems, mostly relating to preterm delivery.\n\n",

I have an uncontrollable cough which I think is down to me having asthma and have been advised not to take the singulair medication.  A month ago, I coughed and heard a snapping sound, and had real diffuculty breathing.  I went to casualty where they gave me tramadol and tylax pain relief after saying they suspected I had fractured ribs.  Since then I have felt lot of pressure on my rib cage, which is worsened due to the amount of coughing I am doing.  Four days ago, I did the same again to my ribs, different ones this time, and have been given the same pain relief.  Will I have to put up with this happening through the rest of my pregnancy or would they consider me giving birth earlier than my EDD.  I feel like I really cannot put up with much more of the pain.  I am having a casearan section a week and 2 days before my due date, due to problems after my last birth.\n\n",

    "content": "It is not a good idea to deliver earlier than a week before your EDD unless there is a good reason, such as the baby would have a better chance outside than inside the womb.  There is always the chance the dates are of a bit and the baby might have breathing difficulties due to prematurity.  We come up with a guesstimate based on typical conception date and measurements but it can still be off by a week or two.  If the doctor did decide there was a good reason to do it earlier, they would likely check for lung development first.  The risks to the baby are so great.  Even though they can save many premature babies, there are often long-term consequences.  The closer your baby is born to term, the better his/her chances for health.  Even though the mother's comfort is important, it is not the highest priority.  I would ask your doctor for a prescription cough suppressant to  help with that part of the problem.  Also, you could inquire about an alternative allergy medication that might be OK in pregnancy.  I know it is hard to do this but it will be good for your baby if you can endure to the end of the pregnancy.  Hopefully you can get some relief to make it easier for the last trimester.  Best wishes.\n\n",

There are even some women who deliver the placenta naturally even after a c-section removal of the baby.

I guess what I was envisioning was more along the lines of remove the baby, cord, placenta & all and then I'd be able to hold her (sort of like if I'd delivered vaginally) while they sewed me up...but I suppose that's not realistic? I had read a bit about the debate re: spontaneous delivery of the placenta vs removal and the effects on bleeding...but like I said, to be honest that's not really my concern...more just wanting to make things as 'natural' as possible given the planned situation (baby is born, mom gets baby on her chest to snuggle/nurse/etc.).\n\n",

    "content": "You should still be able to do this snuggling part.  The placenta in a vaginal birth is delivered and cord cut, sometimes as baby is placed on the chest and sometimes before that.  It is not necessary to delay that in order to get the baby on your chest or even to nurse.  A c section does mean a little more awkwardness due to positioning but the same bonding events should take place.  Let the staff know your desires so they can accommodate as much as is feasible.  I guess what I'm saying is the suturing/closing will take place right away and delaying delivery of the placenta is not going to make a difference there except for the possible five minutes.    In a vaginal birth, you sometimes are getting stitched from the episiotomy or tear while holding your baby.    Good luck with your birth plans.\n\n",

Unfortunately people do fall through cracks sometimes when their case is different from the \"norm.\"  It is good you are persistent in following up for good care.  Yours is not a typical case of ectopic pregnancy.  It is an emergency and usually it is more clear so you get the right treatment early on.    Good luck to you today with your procedure and recovery.  You have traveled a very rocky road when it comes to reproductive health.

    "content": "Hello, I'm sure this is very frustrating and painful for you.  It certainly does not sound good for this pregnancy to be successful.  However, I doubt it is ectopic because something would have happened by now if it was.  These things happen very quickly.    Of course you can seek another opinion and given your pregnancy history you may wish to consult with an OB who specializes in high risk pregnancies/early losses.  There is not a lot that can be done to prevent miscarriage but with your history it might be worth examining the value of what is available now.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Mslayla~  I was thinking about your post today while I was driving and a couple of thoughts occurred to me:  First, do you know what cycle day you ovulated by chance?  Because how many days past ovulation you are could really effect beta #s.  If your beta is 4000+, then you're probably around 20 days past ovulation or so, so about 5 weeks gestation.  Second, any chance there could have been twins?  I was just thinking about how close you were to doubling, even though it was 3 days and not 2 days.  Sometimes if you had the beginning of a twin pregnancy, and then one of the babies dies; your betas can slow down.  So if you had 2 babies there for little while, and say one died in between these two beta draws you had; then your number would not double.  I don't know if that's making any sense.  I read somewhere that a lot more twins are conceived than people think; and one of the babies dies before it is ever discovered.  Most women do not get betas drawn, and do not have ultrasounds before 8 weeks.  (that's mainly reserved for those of us with infertility and recurrent pregnancy loss.)  ..and you're right, after your beta reaches 2000 the pregnancy should be visible by ultrasound.  However, at this point you'd probably only be able to see a fetal pole and yolk sac.  It might be best to wait another week so that you can (hopefully!) see a heartbeat.  That will give you a lot of peace of mind.  I'm not a doctor, I've just spent a very long time dealing with infertility/recurrent pregnancy loss and seeing a Reproductive Endocrinologist.  I learned a lot.  =)   I'd love to help in any other way I can!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi -  I am currently 4 weeks pregnant.  Received a faint pregnancy line 4 days ago and another test 2 days ago was much darker and confirmed pregnancy.     I cannot go to a clinic for abortion because the nearest clinic to provide services is over 5 hours away and I honestly don't have anyone to take me.  I have no family, no friends with cars and I cannot go through with this pregnancy due to very personal circumstances.  I was on the pill but missed two days; hence the pregnancy.     So yesterday I took 600 mcg of Misoprostol (alone; without mifeprex) to induce miscarriage.  The pills were real, not fake.  After 3 hours I took another 600 mcg.  8 hours later I took another 800 mcg of misoprostol.  I had some cramping and a little pink/brown discharge but that is it.  No bright red blood, nothing.     So now I feel horrible because I don't understand why the medication has not worked.  I know this medication will cause birth defects and I cannot go on with this pregnancy.  Please don't tell me to go to a clinic because that is not feasible for me to do in my situation. I have already contacted every doctor in my town and all they do is refer to the clinic that is 5 hours away that I cannot get to.  I would like to know why didn't I bleed with this medication.  I have more misoprostol but only 12 pills left and I cannot waste them again if I will not bleed and miscarry.  Maybe I have used the medication too early?  I took the first 1200 mcg sublingually and the last 800 orally.  I don't know what is going on; I have searched the internet already for answers but haven't found any experiences similar to mine.  I have found many case studies indicating the effectiveness of using misoprostol alone to induce miscarriage.   I have already tried to see a Dr. face to face but no appointments are available until December :(   I need a Dr. that can prescribe mifeprex to me.......Can anyone help? Do you have experience with misoprostol?  Why didn't the medication make me bleed?  I am so confused.............\n\n",

    "content": "It is not really possible to determine the exact date of conception.  The period dates give us a general idea and that is give or take two weeks since each woman ovulates on her own schedule (not necessarily on day 14 for instance).  The ultrasound can give a pretty accurate picture based on measurement if it is done at the optimal time when accuracy is achieved.  Late in pregnancy it is less accurate.  In the first trimester crown-rump measurement can give a good idea of the gestational age of the fetus.    If everyone had regular, 28 day cycles and always ovulated on day 14 and the woman could remember the exact dates, then it would be easier to know the conception date but there are just too many variables in real life.  Also if a woman got pregnant after having just one sexual encounter (the only one that occurred that month) it would also be easier but there would still be a window of a few days when actual conception might have occurred.  Sperm has a period of viability as does the released egg, so it will vary.  I hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I would not worry too much about early menopause.  Yes it is possible but I think it's more likely that you're just having irregular periods.  If you last had unprotected sex on August 5th (that would put you at approximately cycle day 15) and have had negative pregnancy tests, I really doubt you are pregnant.  SInce your periods are so irregular, your symptoms you are having now COULD be ovulation or they could just be the symptoms that occur during an annovulatory cycle (which it sounds like you may be experiencing.)  I have irregular cycles because I have PCOS.  I am not your classic PCOS though, as I do not have weight problems (I am 110 pounds) or the other \"symptoms\" routinely associated with the disorder.  But my lab results and ultrasounds have not lied and I have PCOS.  My point is, there are so many different factors that could be the cause of your irregular cycles.  I would seek the advice of a OBGYN as soon as possible.  In order to rule out early menopause, ask for cycle day 3 labs of FSH and Estradiol.  These will help determine a lot of what is going on.  I doubt you are pregnant.\n\n",

It sounds like an evaluation of your hormones might be in order anyway.  Has your family doctor ever suggested birth control pills as a way to regulate your periods?  If I were you I would schedule a gynecological exam now to check your overall health.  It is possible you could have something else that is causing your distress such as PCOS or thyroid/other endocrine problems.    Also, if you do not already do it, you should be taking a multivitamin during your childbearing years.  This will assure the best outcome if and when you do become pregnant one day.  Meanwhile, consider birth control in some form for future sexual encounters to give you peace of mind.  It's no fun to worry every month about the possibility of an unplanned pregnancy.  Condoms will also help reduce your risk for sexually transmitted infections and these are rampant right now so it doesn't hurt to be safe here.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Momoftwins,  Following a miscarriage it is very common for a woman's cycle to be irregular or change from its previous pattern for a while.  Often it will return to normal but this may take several (meaning >6 in some cases) months.  Regarding your question about ovulation, ovulation is generally thought to occur 14 days before the next period is expected.  With a 28 day cycle this is mid-cycle.  With a 24 day cycle, ovulation would be expected on day 10, slightly earlier than mid-cycle.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I myself have had 4 miscarriages in the midst of 2 years of infertility, and I understand the heartache that comes with such a devastating loss.  Here's the deal:  a pregnancy is not able to be seen until the HCG reaches a certain number.  I cannot recall exactly what that number is, (I think it's over 2000), but it won't be that for about another week.  I can only compare to my IUI baby, and at 18 days past ovulation (so that would be approximately 4 weeks 4 days, somewhere around there), my HCG number was 937.  I had a bleeding episode that day and went to the ER.  They performed an ultrasound and saw...absolutely NOTHING.  There was nothing to be found and the jerk ultrasound tech said to me \"You're not pregnant, lady.\"  Oh yes I was....my HCG did not lie.  (and that baby is now 3 years old.)  With my second and third children, I had ultrasounds around 5.5 weeks where we could see the fetal pole and yolk sac.  Around 6.5 weeks, we saw the heartbeat.  I'm sorry but it's probably just too early to see anything on ultrasound this early.  You need to wait another week or so.  And believe me, I know how hard that is.  Beat of luck!\n\n",

Early pregnancy tests can sometimes give false negative results and a too-early ultrasound is also not necessarily diagnostic.  There is not much you can do except wait it out.  Hopefully you will have a good outcome this time.    When you do see a doctor, I would recommend your regular OB or family practitioner who is best able to follow your pregnancy all the way through.    Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Spotting is very normal at that stage of early pregnancy.  I would not expect any adverse reaction for the babies as a result of your diet pills, including size.    If you were overweight before becoming pregnant, your gaining only a little weight can still be normal.  You are able to function by using stored body fat.  Your baby gets your nutrients from food, then you rely on the stores.  You should be eating healthy foods and the goal is not to lose weight or even stay the same, but you don't necessarily have to gain very much to still have a healthy baby (babies).  You will probably gain more from this point on, as the babies put on weight with all the body organs formed now.  I do hope you plan to breastfeed your babies to give them the best start in life.  There is nothing better.  Good luck.\n\n",

If you need a referral, call a local health department or hospital referral service.  If you have insurance coverage, check with their customer service or member handbook.    Pregnancy can be a time of many changes in your body that are perfectly normal but only your doctor can determine what is going on for you.  Getting early prenatal care has been shown to improve the outcome for pregnancy.  In the meantime, try to get adequate rest, do not become dehydrated (drink lots of water), get moderate exercise with walking, eat healthy foods and avoid junk food, take a multi vitamin every day, and stop any bad health habits such as alcohol, tobacco, and street drugs.

    "content": "Hello,  Wondering if someone could help me decipher some wording on my surgical report from my first cesarean.  (I have had 3 total, and hope for 1 more.)  It says toward the end of the report:  \"The uterus was closed using one layer of #1 chromic suture.  The right half of the incision was a little ragged.  It was imbricated with a second layer of #1 chromic suture.  At this time, there was good hemostasis from this layer.\"  My question is this:  Does it sound to anyone like the doctor only double sutured the right half (that was ragged) or the whole thing?  So is the left half only closed with one layer of sutures but the right half is closed with two?  Or did he do 2 layers on the whole thing?  I'm thinking \\it sounds like he did the whole thing with 2 layers, but I'm unsure as the wording is really not very clear.  This cesarean was an emergency cesarean performed almost 7 years ago in another state.  My OB at the time did not perform this c-section, a doctor whom I had never met did it because it was an emergency and there was no time to call my doctor.  My oldest son almost lost his life, and the c-section saved his life.  This is actually very important to me, to know if it was double sutured or not.  I would love to have another child and have the blessing of my current obstetrician.  I am terrified, however, of a placenta accreta even though I have no history of placental problems.  I have read that having your uterus double sutured after a cesarean lowers the risk of an accreta.  My last 2 cesareans were definitely double sutured, as it is noted in my surgical reports.  Thank you if anyone can help!\n\n",

    "title": "Question about surgical report (c-section)",
    "content": "Hello, I can certainly understand your concern and, while having the double sutures is an extra measure, it certainly is no guarantee for a problem-free next pregnancy anyway.  There are risks involved with future pregnancies following a c section and for this reason I would never recommend doing c sections on demand (i.e. no medical need or indication).  But the vast majority of pregnancies following either a planned or emergency cesarean delivery result in a healthy baby.  You do not need to worry based on the report.  These are usually never even reviewed in subsequent pregnancies.  If it was a big concern, all doctors would require this information to base a decision on.  It is not that relevant.    If you are concerned about placenta accreta, the best thing to do would be to have a high level ultrasound done during your next pregnancy.  Even accreta (very rare) can have a good birth outcome if the doctor knows about it prior to delivery.  This worry should not prevent you from having another child if you desire to do it.  It is even possible you could have a vaginal delivery (VBAC) if things look good at the time of labor.  The risk of rupture is EXTREMELY low.  Thank goodness we have the ability for emergency c sections when they truly are needed, as with your first child.    Trust your OB who has given his/her blessing for your next pregnancy.  You have had a good spacing for healing and there is no reason one would expect any greater complications than anyone has when contemplating pregnancy.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 30 year old female and I am 7 months pregnant with my second child. I have recently been told that I have a urethral diverticulum which has been causing some discomfort (not currently but a few months ago). I have been seeing a urologist for several years for several issues including nocturnal enuresis, overactive bladder, recurrent uti's and so on. I also have a diagnosis of polycystic kidney disease which so far has not been an issue. Since my diagnosis of the urethral diverticulum, I have seen some spotting on the toilet paper only but it only happens occassionally when I cough really hard. I have mentioned this problem not only to my OB, but also to my urologist. My last urine test at the OB office did show some protein and blood in my urine, but they don't seem highly concerned that my baby is affected. They have ordered a 24 hour urine for a creatinine clearance. My urologist has also mentioned that after my baby is born I will have an MRI to get a better look at the diverticulum.  My question is do you think that this problem is being handled properly or should they be more concerned with my baby. I do not have any abdominal discomfort and the baby is still moving around a lot just like she always has.\n\n",

    "content": "My ex-girlfriend just told me that she is pregnant. I stopped by her house, and she has a bunch of used tampon wrappers in her trash can (she is methodical about taking out her trash, so they have to have been used within the past week or so). Also, she has taken her birth control pills up through today (I discovered). She has been on the pill for at least 5 months (she forgot to take it on two occasions during that time period that I know of). In addition, even though she is only a couple weeks late, she claims to be going in for her first ultra sound this week. I asked to go with her to the ultrasound and she said no. She told me it would be too \"weird\". Also, she couldn't tell me a due date yet. A good friend of mine is a nurse, and she tells me that my ex is lying to me. She has a history of mental problems, and is on daily anti-depression meds. With the problems she has (some which are pretty severe), I can't help but be concerned about her having a child right now. Add in the fact that it would be my child as well, and I am very concerned...she has actually deceived me in the past by claiming she was committing suicide (on at least 2 occasions-the second of which I ended up calling 911). With the evidence at hand, her problems, and past history with trying in desperation to keep me in her life, my thought is that she must be deceiving me. I'm interested is some more feedback...is it possible she is not lying??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Not necessarily.  There is no way to know if the progesterone is what made the difference but if your levels were low it was certainly good advice.  Perhaps your doctor will check the levels next time as well;  if normal, you may not need to, but that would be a call your doctor and you will need to make at the time.  There is no guarantee you can avoid a miscarriage, even taking the medication.  Most miscarriages occur for unknown reasons, perhaps because the fetus is not developing properly.  Progesterone cannot prevent such an event from occurring; it can only boost your levels to the normal range to give you the best possible chance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your friend is not likely pregnant.  The day before the period is generally a very safe day (not 100% but close).  Having gotten her period on schedule, she should be able to relax on this one.  Your situation is also unlikely since you have been on birth control (I assume the pill or something similar), assuming you have been taking the pill faithfully.  It is a very reliable method of birth control but nothing except abstinence is actually perfect on that so there always remains some risk.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I have taken you suggestion from a previous post and went to the OB to talk about the fact that I might be preg.   This is the OB I have had since I was preg with my son. Well I told him that I have not had a normal cycle since June 17th and that I was just gonna do a wait and see that was before my breast started getting more tender and what looks like colostrum is starting to leak small amounts. He gave me a breast exam and said he does not feel and lumps like cancer but he wants me to have a mammorgram. He did nothing about checking to see if I am preg. even though I had him to look through my file and see what happened with my son he stated that even though I bleed like I was on my cycle through my other 3 preg. 2 of which resulted in miscarriages he does not think I am preg. so he will not order the blood test nor a ultrasound. He then said call my pcp and have him to sign off on my mammagram I am 26 by the way. He also disregarded the fact that his MA made him aware of the rapid weight gain I went from 160 to 170 in Aug 1 and now not even a full 3 weeks later I am 181.2 I walk 2.5 miles everyday taking my so n to school so why am I gaining?  I called my pcp and told him what was going on and what the OB said he then stated that I would have to be sure that I am not preg before I can have a mammogram done so what he is going to do is order me to have an ultrasound and the mammogram if I find out when I have the ultrasound that I am preg. do not get the mammogram. He also said given my history of 1 preg (which resulted in a mis) on the pill, 1 preg (had natrually) had to have ultrasound to dectect ( I was 16 weeks when we found out) and 1 preg. ( another mis) on Depo which I had to go to the doc and get every 3 mos. and I still had a cycle during the first trimester with all of them he should have automatically given me a ultrasound and I could very well be preg. If I am I would be 14 weeks as of Sep 16th.  My question is what do you think I should do and if I am should I tell my OB, Switch OB's, ask him again for a preg test or ultrasound and see what he says before I tell him or should I sue him and change OB's I am really confuesed?  Thank you\n\n",

It is very important that you trust your doctor and it sounds like you have lost this part of your relationship.  Perhaps this is just not a good match.  I would encourage you to change doctors if  you feel you cannot communicate well with him/her or you question the care you are receiving.  Your PCP can handle this fine without your OB's involvement unless you are pregnant and your PCP doesn't do prenatal care and deliveries.  If you need to be referred to another OB I'm sure your PCP will help you.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "First off, I don't think you did anything to hurt yourself by having sex when you did.    The abdomen has many organs and problems can arise in any of them.  This does not mean cancer.  There are other conditions of the bowel, the pancreas, the liver, the gallbladder, the uterus, appendix, etc. that can act up at times for various reasons.  You need to get this checked out so you can have relief.  You could have something like irritable bowel syndrome causing the pain and gas.  Menstrual irregularities are generally hormonally caused and this may be happening following the birth of your baby when hormones are getting back to normal.  At any rate, seeing your doctor is the best plan and it may take a work up to find the problem, so be patient and make sure you let your doctor know all the symptoms you are having.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "You sound like a very caring and responsible mom who wants to do the best thing for her baby.  That is very commendable.  Of course if you can quit these habits at any time, even this late, it will help your health and improve your baby's chances.  Second hand smoke has also been shown to be very harmful, especially to babies.  These would be good reasons to get help through tobacco control programs such as with your local health department or American Lung Association, etc.  There are good programs to help you stop smoking and to stay smoke free.  You will probably never have more motivation to do it than when you are having a baby.  As for damage already done, it is unknown what level of alcohol use is relatively safe.  Of course ideal is none.  But, there are plenty of examples of perfectly healthy children born after such binging episodes as you describe.  It is believed that quantity does play a role here so continual drinking will definitely increase the odds of harm.  There is also a genetic component and birth defects may result from a combination of genetic makeup or predisposition to certain problems, and exposure to toxins, especially in large amounts.  The best thing you can do now is concentrate on getting you well.  Alcoholism affects children in many ways so join AA and make a commitment for your baby's future.  Stop smoking to be an example to your children as well as to decrease risk.  You can be the link that breaks the chain of family alcohol use.  This will be tremendous for your child.  There is nothing you can do now about the past but there is plenty of reason to expect your baby will be OK - there is a certain amount of luck and/or divine intervention involved.  Some babies have problems even without toxin exposure.  Your baby might have an increased risk but that does NOT mean the baby will definitely have problems.  Congratulations on your desire to be a good mom.  I wish you the best.\n\n",

    "content": "You should be fine to try again right away.  Had you carried the baby to term, you would likely be advised to wait a little bit to give your body a chance to recover but miscarriage, which is very common, should not require such a recovery period.  Many women achieve pregnancy right after miscarriage and of course this does help east the pain of the miscarriage, giving you something to look forward to again.    It will be easier to determine when you would be fertile once your periods begin in earnest, but if you just proceed with your normal sexual activity (Every other day would be good) the chances are you will become pregnant again.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible you can ovulate before you have your next period so pregnancy could be possible.  If you want to avoid it you should use contraception from the outset.  The abnormal shape of your uterus can contribute to pregnancy problems but I would not expect it in connection with early miscarriage loss.  More likely to be a problem later and there is an increased risk for a breech baby, necessitating a c section delivery.  I'm sure your doctor will discuss any complications he or she may foresee.    Repeated pregnancy loss is certainly heartbreaking and I can understand you being a bit gun-shy at this point.  And, in the majority of cases, the cause of the miscarriage is unknown.  Good luck in your efforts.\n\n",

Once your cycle returns it would be easier to predict ovulation and if you become pregnant it is easier to get an estimated due date.  But, ultrasound can also be relied on for this information.

    "content": "That could very likely have been your first period following the miscarriage.  Trying again should be fine whenever you are ready as long as you are in good overall health.  If you are already anemic, it would be wise to wait and get your iron levels up but early miscarriage does not usually take much of a toll on your body (more on your emotions).    If you had carried the baby nearly to term, the advice would be to wait a little while but they have not seen an increase of problems with closely spaced pregnancies in this situation (miscarriage) so we have no reason to suggest waiting as long as you are emotionally ready.  To be sure your body is in good condition, continue to exercise, take a multi-vitamin containing at least 400 mcg folic acid (or folate), eat a healthy diet and avoid any bad habits like smoking, drinking, and drugs.  Your fertile period is likely to begin next week, assuming ovulation has resumed and this was indeed a period you had on August 2-4.  But, don't be discouraged if it takes a few months to get pregnant.  Sometimes it occurs effortlessly, but often it happens on a schedule outside your control so patience is in order.\n\n",

    "content": "The test is measuring hormone levels which can stay in range for a few days.  Having intercourse on those days will increase your chances of pregnancy.  The predictor is most effective when you use afternoon urine (not first morning) and you should try to check about the same time each day that you monitor.  You can also monitor your vaginal secretions.  Women naturally have an increase around the time of ovulation.  If you noticed secretions yesterday or today (on any given day, monitor both two days), there is a high likelihood of ovulation.    Some pink discharge after sex is nothing to be concerned about.

My fiance and I have been trying to conceive the last 5 months and I have been feeling really tired lately, so I decided to take the hpt.  It came back positive but that same day I started having light blood just when I wipe, nothing on my underwear.  I didn't think anything of it because each time it got lighter and the next day there was nothing.  My problem is last night I was having lower back pain and today I have heavy bleading, more than a usual menstrual cycle.  Could I be miscarrying this early or did the home pregnancy test give me a false positive because it would have been too early to detect?  I do have a history of miscarraiges.  I have had 4 within the last 4 years, but I do have 2 beautiful children.   I did call the advise nurse when I got the positive test and she said it could be too early to tell, it was 10 days before a missed period and most hpt's can detect only 5 days before a missed period.  Please if anyone could give me some advice I would appreciate it.  Thanks.\n\n",

Since then, I have been getting more symptoms.  - Nausea - Light headed - Headaches ranges from very mild to severe - Racing heart which causes pin hole black dots and pressure in my chest and head - Racing heart and symptoms also with braxton hicks contractions - Blurred vision - Lower back pain - Abdominal pain from navel to pubic bone and straight across (usually with lower back pain) - Right shoulder and neck pain  I know most are signs of preeclampsia, however my blood pressure is still in normal range and I did have a 2+ on my last urine sample, though I had had a sweet coffee before going in.  Is it possible that this could still be preeclampsia without the protein in my urine and without high blood pressure?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "The hallmark sign of preeclampsia is high blood pressure so I can confidently answer no here.    You should discuss these symptoms with your doctor but it does not look like preeclampsia at all.    I believe you are referencing sugar in the urine, which could be an early warning sign of other problems such as gestational diabetes.  Your doctor will probably order a glucose test in a few weeks to screen for that.  You are probably confusing this with protein in the urine, which can be related to preeclampsia (along with high blood pressure) but would not be related to what you ate.  Good luck with your pregnancy.  If you are concerned about symptoms and cannot reach your doctor, go to your hospital's labor and delivery unit to be checked.\n\n",

Barley even noticable. then this month my period was a day late which scared me bc it's never late.  My period this month started out really light the first 2 days then it got a little heavier for 1-2 days then really light again. I normally bleed very heavily and have really bad cramps bc I have endometriosis. I don't really have any symptoms of pregancy. My boobs feel a little fuller and firmer but not sore. And I have some underarm pain. I don't know what to think. This has never happend before. When I've been pregnant my periods just stopped and I can't think of what could be wrong so any opinions and advice would be great! Thanx so much guys!!\n\n",

Monday night my fiance and I had intercourse and we didn't use a condom. Well I went to use the restroom and noticed I was bleeding a little. Needless to say it was my period. My periods are usually quite heavy and last for several days (7-9). This time, it is not that heavy and I can wear a single pad for more than 4 hrs without changing it. (Odd for me since I usually change it within an hr or 2 during the first 4 days.)  So...my question is. Can I get pregnant during that time frame?  Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Because we do not know exactly when a woman will ovulate, there is literally no \"100% safe\" days when you definitely would not get pregnant.   But, with that disclaimer, if your period occurred right at the time you had intercourse (it sounds like within hours) it is very unlikely you would be pregnant from that encounter.  If I understand the time frame correctly, it would be too soon for the bleeding to be due to implantation, unless you had actually become pregnant a few weeks prior to this \"period\" and it actually is implantation bleeding.  If that is the case, a home pregnancy test would be able to determine.   Use first morning urine and follow directions as to when it should be \"read.\"\n\n",

This is about the same time volleyball camp started. she has gotten dizzy twice in the last week.  She isn't constipated or anything like that.

These do not have to be connected with a period so it doesn't matter what birth control she uses.

Probably a good move is to have the abdominal pain checked out, assuming something besides pregnancy is going on, but do the test anyway.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Well at the end of July I did not get my next injection and had unprotected sex on more than one occasion around that time. Well my period is late now going on the third week which never happens. I took HPT's about 7 or 8. And five of them came out with something maybe its a evaporation line but there was something very faint but there. I even had my sister do one because I know shes not pregnant so that way i could compare the tests and hers was completely negative and had nothing that could possibily be a positive. My 5 tests had something faint but there. I had a blood test done 11 days after missing my period and it was negative. I don't know what kind of blood test was done they just said it was negative. Well yet another week has passed and no period. Im confused on what is going on. I only had one depo and had periods the whole time so why did all of a sudden when i never got my last shot would my period not be here. I am now 43 days since my last period and im always 28 days and i mean ALWAYS i could count the days on the calendar and know when to expect my period. Is it the depo or could i be pregnant.\n\n",

    "content": "Im 19 years old, female, ive been diagnosed as bipolar and with anxiety disorder.. the only surgeries ive had have been to remove my tonsils. My mother has MS and my father has heart disease. My current medications are Celexa and Lithium. My question is if it sounds to you that i could be pregnant. I have been having unprotected sex with my boyfriend of 4 years and at the moment i am out of the country, and going crazy because my period came over a week early.. expcept it is nothing like my period usually is. Typically my period is very very heavy with severe cramps that immobilize me for about 4 days. My last period was on July 24th and on Aug 16 i started spotting lightly and it eventually became about a medium flow with one clot. The blood started out pink, then became bright red, and faded to brown. This bleeding lasted about 3 days occasionally stopping and starting up again. My bleeding came about a week before i was expecting my period, and now i am one day past my expecting date. Im wondering if this was implantation bleeding or just an early period? Ive been very very tired lately, make that absolutely exhausted, no matter how much i sleep i feel like i need more. Ive been getting headaches at nighttime and some nausea towards the middle of the day for about two days now. My nose has been very sensitive to scents, enough for me to need to leave the grocery store and not able to open the fridge. I have very light cramping in my abdomen that has continued after my bleeding stopped. Ive also been somewhat weepy lately, my moods just off the wall, but that is hard for me to tell if its anything different simply because of my psychological condition. I feel like i may be psyching myself out and obsessing about this, simply because im not really able to get a blood test at this time. i did buy a hpt and took it on the day i was expecting my period but i didnt look at it until 15 minutes after i took it and it showed negative, however i did hear that the results can fade over time? but im not sure if thats enough time for it to fade, or if its just simply too early for the results to show. Could you please help me or at least tell me what you think about my situation? thankyou so much\n\n",

    "content": "You should take another pregnancy test.  The urine tests when used according to directions, using first morning urine and reading immediately are quite reliable within about a week after the expected period start date.  You should not need to do a blood test to get an accurate result, though they are more sensitive than the urine tests.    Yes, your other conditions can contribute to some of your emotionally labile moods, but since pregnancy is a possibility I would recommend finding out about that first.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok...  My mother is going to be forty years old.  All the tests she took prior to the fertility treatments pointed to her being perfectly healthy.  My question is this.  Ok, so my mom went through fertility treatments to get pregnant, and about two weeks after they did the embryo transfer they tested her and she was in fact pregnant, with an hcg level of 16. Three days later (day 17), it had only risen to 24, so they were worried it might end up being a miscarriage. Then, two days later (day 19), it rose to 59. Two days after that, 21 days after the embryo transfer, it rose to 176. Then, three days later (day 24), it was 756. Because it was rising so quickly, they actually thought that my mom might have twins, that one attatched later than the other or something to that extent. However, my mom had been experiencing light bleeding and so they decided to have her come in again, two days later (day 26), and the level had dropped to 550 something. Two days later, the level was 394.  (day 28)  This was friday.  It is now twenty minutes from monday, and my mom has not been taking progesterone shots because they told her to stop.  Did they do the right thing?  Do you think my mom may have had twins, and if so, don't you find it strange that she would have miscarried both at almost the same time?  Is it possible for the mother to miscarry one twin but to sucessfully deliver the second, and most importantly of all, what should be happening with the hcg level if that happens.  I know this is probably too late already but I just wanted to understand...thanks in advance...\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your concern about your mother's pregnancy.  You have good questions.  I would, however, caution you to be careful in trying to interpret the numbers.  The \"normal\" levels are always a range and they vary hugely between women.  Rapidly rising hormones can result from multiples or even from a molar pregnancy, that would never have resulted in a fetus anyway.  Yes, it is possible to miscarry one twin, but deliver the other successfully.  It is also more common to miscarry twins than singletons (higher risk).  Your mother is currently in the \"wait and see\" period since anything could happen, yet there is little you can do to intercede.  As for the progesterone shots, it is difficult to say what \"should\" be done from here.  Her doctor obviously knows her situation best and wants a good outcome so I think she can follow the doctor's instructions with confidence.  Use of progesterone in the early weeks to prevent miscarriage is still under some investigation and it has been suggested that it may not actually help the outcome anyway.  There is a question about whether the decreased progesterone levels is the body's natural response to an inevitable pregnancy loss rather than low levels being the cause of the miscarriage.  If your mom is still pregnant with one fetus, the hormone levels will continue to rise, but not as fast as with twins.  At around 12 weeks the maturing placenta takes over the role of producing the hormones to support pregnancy.  I hope this helps.  We wish your family the best possible outcome.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  Thanks for the quick response.  You cleared up quite a few things.  Abot the progesterone shots, however.  The reason my mother was taking them was because her normal levels were low (from the very start, although the shots were able to bring them up to a normal level), but the doctor attributed this to the fact that this was not a \"natural\" pregnancy, considering that fifteen eggs were taken out of my mother's body, fertilized, and the best ones (2) chosen to be implanted a few days later.  The reason why i was somewhat concerned was that the doctor said that the progesterone shots were needed to continue the pregnancy and prevent my mother from having her period, and he reccomended they be stopped because he believed that because the level dropped on two consecutive visits, my mother had miscarried whatever was there (whether it was one or two).  I am no professional but it seemed a bit soon to me, especially because, at least from what my mother understood, without the progesterone shots, the pregnancy cannot continue to take place, so if there was a second healthy fetus in there, it could not continue to develop.  Thankyou again for your time.\n\n",

I see.  The problem is that my mom was only about 3 weeks pregnant...  Would that have been enough time for the placenta to have developed fully?  On another note, my mother went in today to do some tests...(a week after they stopped giving her progesterone shots and decided that she had miscarried.)  And her level is 236.  The doctors were very surprised...  Obviously, the level has not increased...nevertheless, we are somewhat concerned as her doctors believed that a week would have been sufficient time for her HCG level to return to normal...  Do you know what might be going on?  Thanks in advance, and for all the help you've already given.\n\n",

My husband and I can financially support a child. But what's stopping us is the fear of first having a \"bad/uncontrollable...\" child, and second, of not being 24/7 emotionally/mentally available.Well.  First of all, there are no guarantees in children.  There are kids from upper class, well to do, very well educated, etc etc families who fall into the wrong crowds, and end up screwing up their lives, and there are kids who do just the opposite.  No matter how much you put it off, that simple fact will never change.  The only thing you can do, is do your best.  Treat your child like you would want to be treated in their place, try to anticipate possible issues/problems by putting yourself in his/her place, etc.  The end result may not be perfect, but as human beings, nothing we do is.  All we can do is try our best, cross our fingers, and hope.  Also, keep in mind that although in the end, a lot comes down to the child, the way you raise him/her does make a huge impact on his/her behavior, personality, etc.  Many psychologists agree that behaviors and personality quirks are learned from people with whom children interact with.  So if your child is doing something wrong, keep in mind that sometimes it may require you to look at yourself and ask whether or not you are setting the best possible example.  And this is coming from an only child who spent a decent amount of time alone...  Your kid/s will not expect you to be there for them 24/7.  In fact, they probably won't want you there for them 24/7, especially when they get older.  However, what is important is that you are always within reach, and that you are around when they need you.  Working is something that we all have to do, and juggling family, work, and friends can be difficult at times...but we really don't have any other alternatives, do we?  So my question is: Do most people have kids after having clearly thought it thru, or do they just \"do it\"? Because I'm affraid I'll never be ready to conceive.. From what I understand, it is a combination.  Some people, generally those who like to have everything \"under their control\" hesitate to bring children into their lives because they represent a possibly unpredictable factor in their set-in-stone lives.  The only thing I can say is that if you want to have kids, then you shouldn't delay.  My parents wanted a second child, but by the time they got around to trying, my mother was 40, my father 50, and they had to resort to in vitro fertilization.  And after two attempts, and thousands of dollars spent, it looks like my mother miscarried (on the second attempt.  The first one did not even implant.)  My point being, don't wait around forever.  Before you know it, it might be too late.  Obviously, make sure you are reading for a child...  Meaning that you need to be able to afford not just food, but clothes and diapers and perhaps some kind of nanny to help you out.  And you will want to be living in a location suitable for kids as well...  But once you have that done, all you can really do is close your eyes and take the plunge.  Hope I helped..\n\n",

    "content": "I do not know of any way to determine if you are actually physically capable of having a child unless you were to do fertility testing and I would not invest that kind of money, time and stress if I hadn't yet actively tried naturally (i.e. using no birth control and having regular intercourse).  Sometimes we over-analyze things and my experience is that we never can accurately predict how we will handle something before we actually are there.  We often surprise ourselves and see we have strengths we never would have thought we had when faced with challenges.  If you think you would like to be parents, trust your instinct and your ability to adapt to the necessary changes and personality interactions that will take place.  Parenthood can be difficult, but amazingly rewarding.  There are aspects of it that nobody could have ever told you about (both positive and negative I'm sure).  But I personally would not have missed it for the world.  Good luck.\n\n",

Also, there is greater risk with prolonged and frequent exposures as opposed to one-time events such as surgery.

    "content": "Surgical intervention can help to raise the uterus up in the pelvis (suspension) to help you to have a healthy baby.  This procedure might be sacrospinous uterosacral ligament fixation.  A pessary is also often employed in an effort to hold things in their proper place.   Sometimes the doctor can even do physical maneuvers to move it up a bit.  Once the uterus grows large enough that it can no longer protrude (18 to 20 weeks), it is likely that it will stay in place.    There is some increased risk of preterm birth and/or bladder problems because the organs have shifted out of their usual position, so a pregnancy would be considered high risk and you should have a competent obstetrician caring for you.  There may even be activity restriction - perhaps bedrest- to help assure a good outcome.    Being in the hands of a good doctor will be your best chance for success here.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

It is not necessary to have monthly periods and some oral contraceptives are designed for you to only have four periods a year.  I suspect your period will begin shortly.  If not, a pregnancy test would be indicated and should be accurate at least by a week after your period should have started.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am seriously concerned over just how much risk I incurred while having unprotected sex recently and would greatly appreciate some insight on this matter. I have been on the pill for a month (but it is not my first time, I was on the pill until january 2007) and stopped taking it on the 28th day as per directions. My period came within 3 days, as expected.   The problem is, I did not take the pill the next Saturday as I had to but rather 3 days late. I took three pills instead of one on the fourth day and have continued taking the pill consistently for a week now.  I engaged in unprotected sex multiple times from Saturday onwards with my partner (as well as from Tuesday to the aforementioned Saturday), with him withdrawing before ejaculation, however.  Just how at risk am I? If I don't start ovulating until two weeks after my period ends, does that mean that the risk is not greatly significant? Having been on the pill for a month now, does that not make getting pregnant more difficult?  I am aware this is a long question but I am desperate for advice. Thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "If I am understanding the time frame here it sounds like you were having sex during the time of the month you would be least likely to be fertile.  The average ovulation day would be day 14 when counting from the first day of the period but women vary considerably so we usually consider fertile days to be 8 through 19.  Unprotected sexual intercourse during those days would be the most risky for pregnancy.  It sounds like you were within this safer time frame and by using \"withdrawal\" you do improve your odds.  While this is not a reliable method of birth control by itself, in conjunction with the pill and \"safe\" days, I would not be very worried if it were me.    I'm sure you will feel more comfortable when you get your next period and there are always exceptions, but if I make a guess I would say I do not expect pregnancy from this.\n\n",

It stops and starts again. For the past 4 days I noticed that my breast were not sore and swollen anymore. I haven't had any cramps or pains, just light bleeding. My HSG level was checked the day after the bleeding began, 6 days ago, and it was 1168 which the doctor said was normal. It had increased since it was checked previously. I saw the doctor again a couple days after the test and he said that checking my levels again would not tell them much and to wait until  my first ultrasound , which would be 6 1/2 weeks of pregnancy, unless my symptoms worsened. I am wondering if the bleeding along with my breast not being sore anymore could be a sign of miscarriage and should I do something before this appt. in 4 days or just wait since I don't have any pain or cramps?   Thank you\n\n",

Your risk for other complications are a bit higher, but these things do sometimes heal over and you can go on to have a healthy pregnancy.    Of course you are worried.  Unfortunately it's one of those things where you have to just wait and see what happens since you can't do anything about it.  Just take it easy with light activity, avoiding strenuous, physical lifting, etc.  This is just to prevent aggravating the situation.    But if you have strong cramping and/or heavy bleeding  call your doctor.\n\n",

    "content": "It is not unusual to have spotting and/or cramping in early pregnancy.  At this point it could go either way.  Many women have implantation bleeding and then go on to have a healthy pregnancy.  But, you are in the high risk time frame for miscarriage as well. It is believed that as many as 25% of pregnancies end in miscarriages - some before the woman even knows she is pregnant.  Unfortunately there is not much you can do to prevent miscarriage from happening.  Most likely it is a defect or placenta problem that doesn't allow the baby to develop normally so mother nature takes care of things, heartbreaking though that is for many women.  So, it's a \"wait and see\" kind of thing.  It doesn't hurt to take it easy and not do anything to aggravate the situation, but don't stress too much.  Good chance things will be fine.

    "content": "As you know, pregnancy is certainly likely, given the symptoms you describe and many women experience some light bleeding (periods) even when pregnant.  You have not indicated if pregnancy is a welcome condition or not.  If you are sexually active and not desiring pregnancy, I hope you will discuss contraceptive options with your health care provider.  Also, if you do not use birth control, knowing you could be pregnant at any time, it would be especially important for you to maintain good health and nutrition, including taking a multi-vitamin containing folic acid (400 mcg).  Since pregnancy could occur without your knowledge, being in good health will help ensure a healthy baby.  It would also be wise to avoid any unhealthy habits such as smoking and alcohol.  Since you have a history of low hCG levels in pregnancy, you should see your doctor to determine pregnancy.  There are other ways to do this through examination and/or ultrasound technology.    As for other causes of your symptoms - mostly they would likely be hormonal in nature, so once again, a doctor's consultation would be recommended.  There is also the possibility these symptoms have other causes but the cluster does suggest something related to the reproductive system.\n\n",

    "content": "I would not worry too much about the medications.  Pregnant women often require even strong pain relievers that are considered safe in pregnancy when they have a condition that indicates their use.    In the ideal world, we would recommend that you take acetaminophen (Tylenol) as the first line in pain relievers but others are considered safe when necessary.  Usually we advise you to stay away from aspirin and ibuprofen because your blood clotting could be affected.    Whenever you take medications in pregnancy it is wise to consult with the doctor or nurse midwife who is caring for you.\n\n",

    "content": "From extoxnet.orst.edu: \"Pressure treated lumber containing arsenic, copper and chromium (CCA) may be used safely in food gardens. The arsenic, copper and chromium do leach into the soil over time, however, and may be transported into food crops grown close to the treated lumber... With time, small amounts of arsenic, chromium, and copper will leach out to the surrounding soil. Soil migration is limited, however, depending on the soil type. Although arsenic, chromium, and copper are commonly found in all soils, the levels surrounding treated wood, up to a distance of approximately 6 inches away, will likely exceed normal background levels of these elements. Therefore, because some garden plants will accumulate these elements, do not plant close to treated wood. Alternatives to CCA treated wood include the heartwood of cedar or redwood.\"  I hope this answers your question.\n\n",

So, I think you can be assured these sensations are related to something else like bowel activity rather than pregnancy.  For peace of mind you can repeat the pregnancy test after a week but you are right, pregnancy is unlikely.  But, since no birth control is foolproof, it is still possible of course.  Perhaps you have an intestinal \"bug\" that will pass on its own but if not, see your doctor.  Good luck\n\n",

Just usual cooling tricks are about all you can do.  Use fans, light, loose clothing - try summery dresses instead of pants.  Take cool baths or showers and when you take walks, don't avoid the sprinklers you pass.  Drink lots of cold water, popsicles, etc.  Try to take advantage of the early morning and later evening hours so you can avoid the heat of the day for activities and errands.  This will change once you deliver.  Hormones and blood supply are the main culprits, along with extra body weight.  Sorry I can't give you a magic solution here.  I wish I could.\n\n",

I had laparscopy surgery to open my tubes in 2002, had one miscarriage in June 2003 and then had another HSG in September of 2003 to find that one tube was completely blocked again and the other tube was partially blocked.  Due to this, my Dr had told me I am at a higher risk for an ectopic pregnancy. My fertility doctor has since changed his field of practice and I have not been to another OB/gyn.  I have called 5 different OB/gyn practices in my area, explained my situation and the earliest they can fit me in is a week from now (and that's just an appt with a nurse).  What should I do?  Should I go to the emergency room at the hospital?  Will they do an ultrasound to verify everything is okay? Am I worrying for nothing?? P.S.  I have been spotting in the last 3 days - very lightly and brown in color.  No cramps and breasts are somewhat tender.  TIA for any advice you can give me.\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your concern.  The good news is that you are not experiencing pain, which is typical of an ectopic pregnancy.    While you are at increased risk, it is still quite rare but these are symptoms you should watch for:   - colicky, crampy pain with tenderness low in the abdomen, typically one side but can radiate. - heavy bleeding - nausea and vomiting - dizziness or weakness - shoulder pain - feeling of rectal pressure.  Keep in mind, every woman does not experience all these symptoms but any of them could be associated.  It is considered an emergency condition so if you feel pain, you should have it evaluated at once.  Ligament stretching pain can also occur normally so it can be hard to distinguish.  When in doubt, check it out!  In the absence of symptoms, you should be fine to wait out the week to see the doctor as scheduled.  Usually by the 8th week of pregnancy the danger has passed.\n\n",

No discharge, no cramps, feeling a little \"out of sorts\" (not sure I would call it dizzy) and breasts are still as sensitive as they've been since I took the pregnancy test on Saturday morning.  If I'm not cramping could I still be having a miscarriage?  I've had a miscarriage before at 5 weeks and I had major cramping within 2 hours of first sign of bleeding.  I know every case is different, just want to know how concerned I should be.  I'll take another pregancy test when I get home from work and see if the results are still positive.

    "content": "I would not worry based on your information.  Many children will look strikingly like only one parent.  It is confusing when you think of dark being dominant but that is not always the case.  The genes come in pairs and each parent sends a dominant and recessive gene for eye color, for example.  If you send a recessive gene for blue eyes and your wife sends a recessive gene for blue eyes, your child can have blue eyes, even if both of you had brown eyes.  This is because of the two genes you received from your parents, brown WAS dominant of the two and so you have brown, but if you did get that recessive blue gene for eye color, when you pass the gene for eye color on to your daughter, you could send EITHER the dominant (brown) OR the recessive (blue).  Then, if you daughter doesn't get a dominant brown from your wife either, she has blue eyes, which came from the two blue (recessive) genes that she got from each parent.     I hope this simplified explanation makes sense.  Genetics is truly a fascinating subject.  A great-grandmother's red hair could also suddenly appear, even though neither parent (or even grandparents) have red hair.  Traveling up the family tree can shed some light on these mysteries.  Enjoy your child!\n\n",

    "content": "My husband and I are about to start trying to conceive our second child.  My 31 month daughter and I are healthy but had complications during her labor/delivery.  After she was delivered I hemorrhaged so much that I had a transfusion, I bled for 12 weeks after that and took iron for months.  At my 6 week check up I had an unltrasound and doctors found something on my uterus.  After ruling out cancer, they believed it to be scar tissue but were not 100% sure.  They said I was fine and should be okay for future pregnancies.  I am just concerned about complications during pregnancy or delivery related to the scar tissue(if that's what it is) or possibly hemorrhaging again.  It was very scary and it was a lot of blood.  Am I at risk now for complications?  Am I at a higher risk to hemorrhage again?  Can the scar tissue open?  I am now 26.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Without knowing the exact cause of your hemorrhage, it is difficult to say if this is something to be expected again.  However, each woman who delivers a child should be viewed as \"at risk\" for this and should be managed carefully in the third stage of labor (placenta delivery).  Be sure the staff at the hospital are aware of your history when you are admitted so they will be extra vigilant about this.    Scarring in the uterus can make a difference in placental attachment, possibly increasing your risk of a low-lying placenta.  But, aside from this I know of no reason why this should be a concern.  Since you didn't have a C/S you should not have to be especially concerned about the scar being a problem.    Good luck in your efforts to conceive.\n\n",

    "content": "I certainly understand your anxiety about miscarriage and your frustration with your atypical pregnancy signs.  Unfortunately there is little that can be done to prevent miscarriage so your purpose in getting this information early is probably mostly for curiosity.   If  you have a regular OB/GYN doctor to see, you could ask for an appointment.  Of course they will ask for your last menstrual period date to determine estimated due date.  Explain your history and anxiety about this so they understand why you need a doctor's evaluation to confirm pregnancy.  You should be able to determine pregnancy by ultrasound quite early but this is no guarantee that there will not be a miscarriage as occurs in approximately 25% of cases, most often by 12 weeks.    In the meantime, make sure you are getting a good mulitvitamin containing at least 400 mcg folate or folic acid, eat a healthy diet, stop any bad habits such as smoking, alcohol or drugs so you will be in your best condition for a healthy baby.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 32 years old and was on depression medication (Effexor) for roughly 10 months. I first tried to quit about 3 months ago but I had severe withdrawal symptoms. About 3 and a half weeks ago, I had unprotected sex with my boyfriend. I calculated that I was probably ovulating at the time, so we went to the pharmacy and got emergency contraception (Plan B). I took the Plan B within 24 hours of the initial unprotected sex and had another unprotected sex with my boyfriend before taking the second pill (stupid I know!). My period is currently about 5 days late. I took a home pregnancy test after the 1st day and it came out negative. The thing is, I AM NEVER LATE, only ever been early a few (rare) times. I am afraid that the anti-depressant may have had some interactions with the Plan B, making it ineffective. I currently have extreme nipple tenderness, nausea (which was there before I had unprotected sex as I was weaning myself off Effexor), lower back pain (this usually occurs shortly before I see my period and it has misled me for days thinking that my period was about to start) and I am very cranky. Also, 5days ago when I was supposed to see my period, I had a very brief, very light brownish discharge. This has happened before in the past as a sign of the onset of my period. This time around though, no period followed. I have never been pregnant before and I never thought it would be this confusing when it does happen! Could I be pregnant?\n\n",

I was expecting my period between the 14th and the 16th and still its a no show. Within the past month we started going \"bareback\" a couple times and then before we actually got \"into it\" he put on a condom. There was once that he didn't use a condom but he pulled out before he came. About a week ago I noticed sensitive nipples but that subsided and I had hiccups for like 2 weeks, they'd last a couple minutes then go away but I'd get them everyday. They've now gone away within the past couple days. I have been having indigestion, burping everything I've eaten even it was 2 hrs ago. This morning I havent eaten anything but I drank coffee and I even burped a little then, it tasted like coffee...kinda gross if you ask me. Last  night I felt a little nauseous, the kind where your saliva glands start watering but you hold back the actual vomiting part. It lasted for about an hr then went away.   I went for my pap test a week and a half ago and of course they did a preg test (that was before I was late for my period) and it was negative. I took one again Saturday (14th I believe) and it said negative too. The only reason I took that one was because my feelings got hurt by a customer at work and I cried...which I never do...I've been called every name in the book working my job and never had a breakdown.   So...with 2 neg tests and all these weird symptoms...could I be pregnant? When would be a good time to test?  Thank you ahead of time...  Beckie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Beckie,  Of course pregnancy is a possibility and everyone's symptoms vary so this could be the course of yours.  You can do a home pregnancy test around one week after you would expect your period to occur.  Be sure to read the instructions and follow them exactly, using first morning urine and reading the results right away, in order to get the most accurate result.    A tampon would not dislodge anything relating to pregnancy, including the mucus plug.  Mucus is normally present and varies in amount from day to day, so it is likely just the normal discharge.  There also tends to be an increase in vaginal discharge near ovulation.   Let us know if you have other questions.\n\n",

Whether or not this is the case here is yet to be seen since it is early.  Basically, it could go either way but if miscarriage is imminent you will likely experience symptoms soon such as cramping and/or bleeding.

    "content": "Hello. I am a 32 year old female and have just had my first icsi treatment with the Antagonist protocol. I have never been been pregnant before due to tubal damage and my periods are normally regular and heavy from day two. On tue 26th June I had egg collection and on thur 28th I had et. I had two implanted, one was a four cell the other a six cell. Ten days after egg collection, on what would have been day 23 of my cycle I started having menstrual cramps. I thought the treatment had obviously not worked. I just thought I had come on early due to all the drugs and stress etc. I have had a light brown discharge for three days now and nothing else. I am still having period pains but on top of this am also more tired than usual and have had a slightly queasy feeling for two days now. I have never had fertility treatment before so cannot tell if this is normal or not. Could it have worked? Are the drugs messing my body around? Why am I bleeding if it has worked? Can somebody please help me before I go mad!! My pregnancy test is on the 10th, which is when I was expecting my period, on day 28.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I have been on NuvaRing for a bit less than a yea with a very regular and very brief period each month. Recently, I have been put on a medication (Topamax 75mg) that is known to decrease the effectiveness of hormonal contraceptives and also to cause changes in menstrual cycles. My period came one week early and lasted exactly one week. I followed the same instructions I always do with my ring, taking it out the same date I normally would and putting in the new one on the same date I would. I had intercourse on day 11 of my cycle (4 days after my period ended, first day I put the ring in). My concern is that I could have possibly ovulated.  Could someone tell me what my chances are of this happening?   Thank You!\n\n",

    "content": "This should be OK for you to resume the supplements as long as you do not take excessive amounts.  It is important for you to be healthy in pregnancy and in preparation for delivery so if the additional magnesium and potassium does stabilize you this way, it would be good to resume.  Generally the recommended daily for Magnesium in pregnancy is 350 to 400 mg. Consider the amount already in your vitamin and that should give you an idea.  The primary side effect of excessive amounts is diarrhea and no effects with the babies have been noted.   Of course studies with high levels of supplements are not available so it's good to stay within the recommended amounts unless your doctor advises otherwise.  As for safety in general, these are naturally occurring substances (as you know, are present in foods as well) so there is not a great concern for using in pregnancy.\n\n",

    "title": "Nuchal fold Thickening",
    "content": "Hi, I would like to explain a little bit about this screening in hopes that it will somewhat answer your question even though I am not able to tell you exactly what it \"should\" be at a given point in time.  Screening tests determine risk but do not actually diagnose a problem.  Because of this, telling you what the measurement should be would only say what measurement would put it into an average or a better than average chance of occurring in this pregnancy.Even if the measurement increases your risk, that still doesn't mean your baby has Down Syndrome.  So, if the typical risk, given your age were one in 250, that still means that in 249 of that total the baby would NOT have it.   The nuchal cord marker might increase the risk, say to one in 125.  Still 124 to one that the baby does not have it.    What I'm saying is the fact that the number may be high for nuchal fold measurement does not indicate that the baby is abnormal - just that the odds are a little greater.  This helps people to decide if they want to pursue additional screening tests (which come with a little more risk) that are more definitive.  In same cases this eases a person's mind and in other cases the abnormal screening just causes unnecessary stress since there are many false positives where the parents worry a lot but then delivery a perfectly healthy baby.    Since I am not expert in neonatology and ultrasound measurement interpretation I cannot give you the figures you are asking for but I hope this somewhat clarifies the screening to help you understand the results you have been given.  The screening is done at the time in the pregnancy when it is most likely to be helpful so a later measurement may not even correlate in the same way.  Again, it is only with more extensive testing CVS or amniocentesis you find actual occurrence - the screening is merely statistical risk assessment.\n\n",

    "content": "thank you Debbie, this was found not at a screening, which should be done between 10-14 weeks, but at a level 2 us. i am 17 weeks.  my NT was 4.2, and all of the literature that I have read states that between 15-20 weeks, anything under a 5mm is acceptable, actually, some of the articles claim it to be under 6mm. My concern is that my Dr told me under 3mm, but again from all of the research I have since done, that would only be if you were doing the NT during the appropriate time, whcih is 10-14 weeks.  We just want to make the correct, informed descion on whether or not to do an amnio or not.  I think that I will have to call my Dr and make sure that they did not just make a mistake by telling me that I had to be under 3mm, just will be  a hard weekend. As I am 37, and had this reading, I think he said that I would be 1 in 100 chance, which I  under stand is still not horrible, but again, really fearful of the amnio, as I do not want to ms, and I really do want to enjoy this pregnancy.  I have one healty 3 year old, but have had 4 early (7-9 week) ms in the past year and a half. thank you regina\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your frustration, Regina,  I guess the big question for me would be why would you get the amnio?  If you would not abort anyway, the slightly increased risk of miscarriage may not be worth it and you could watch for additional soft signs of Down's (or lack) which might satisfy your need for that information well enough.  If you would definitely abort a baby with such a defect, it would probably be worth the risk to get this firm information.     Some people choose to do this so they will be prepared in the event that they have a child with such a handicap and want a firm answer about it in advance.    One reliable source, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Washington University School of Medicine, St. Louis, MO, reports equal to or greater than 6 mm as the optimal threshold for greatest predictability in the 14-18 week timeframe.  (PubMed reported: Am J Obstet Gynecol. 1994 Nov;171(5):1282-6.  I hope this eases your mind somewhat - I think it would for me if I were in your place.  Good luck and please let us know how things go for you. Debbie\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would agree with Debbie that the risk of the amniocentesis may not be worth the benefits.  If there are concerns about heart issues they should be able to see the heart extremely well with a level 3 ultrasound.    If there are concerns, a pediatric cardiologist trained in fetal echocardiography can also evaluate the baby.  I would ask for clarification from your obstetrician about why they would want to do the amniocentesis since I can't think of anything about they heart they would learn from the amnio that they cannot get from an ultrasound.  Also, keep in mind that all our screening tests for Down syndrome before pregnancy are really just that-screening tests.  They are in no way 100% accurate.  If you needed to know if Down syndrome was present for sure an amniocentesis is really the only way.    In fact, most of the time, when a screening test indicates a possible case of Down syndrome the baby is normal.  The tests are made this way so they don't miss cases but at the expense of producing more false positives.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Of concern are:  over due menses coupled with low back pain and general feelings of illness.  I am concerned about the bursts of hot and sick feelings, the tiredness, the stronger body smells.  There are different diseases that can give you all these symptoms. PID is one of them: Pelvic inflammatory disease. Another can be simply a urinary tract infection. And there are others. It would be in your best interest to present to the local urgent care center or emergency room, or local health clinic (in the US) where they can set up payment options or even a sliding scale based on income. The doctor at these facilities can run tests that will determine why you feel so sick, and then give you treatment options.  I think it would be well worth the time and money to find out while it is still early.  Sometimes waiting too long can cause further complications!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Yes, it is very confusing.  The reason you have to find other sources for information about this such as teratology organizations, is because medications are not tested in pregnant or breastfeeding women. Therefore, the manufacturers cannot claim safety so they state \"do not take when pregnant or nursing\" and this covers them.  But, the truth is, many medications are considered safe in pregnancy so you really have to talk with the doctor or someone in hi office and let them know you have the photos.  When it comes to package inserts, this can be very deceiving because even when they are found to be safe in pregnancy, the labeling does not change in the USA.    I would feel confident about Metformun.\n\n",

    "content": "As far as possible, its always better to avoid fetus to drug exposure (even though it has not been proven to be teratogenic) during pregnancy. So if you can switch over to a drug which won't cross placental barrier, it will avoid any untoward effects, if any.  Its a routine practice in most of the countries to swich over to insulin during pregnancy for a simple reason that insulin doesn't cross placental barrier.   I'd like to post a relevant para from a pharmacological book:- In summary, although the use of metformin may be beneficial for decreasing the incidence of fetal and/or newborn morbidity and mortality in developing countries where the proper use of insulin is problematic, insulin is still the treatment of choice for this disease. Moreover, insulin, unlike metformin, does not cross the placenta and, thus, eliminates the additional concern that the drug therapy itself is adversely affecting the fetus. Carefully prescribed insulin therapy will provide better control of the mother's blood glucose, thereby preventing the fetal and neonatal complications that occur with this disease. High maternal glucose levels, as may occur in diabetes mellitus, are closely associated with a number of maternal and fetal adverse effects, including fetal structural anomalies if the hyperglycemia occurs early in gestation. To prevent this toxicity, most experts, including the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend that insulin be used for types I and II diabetes occurring during pregnancy and, if diet therapy alone is not successful, for gestational diabetes  - Drugs in Pregnacy and Lactation, 6th edition: Gerald G Briggs BPharm, Roger K Freeman MD, Sumner J Yaffe MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, You didn't give much information about your present circumstances and this can make a difference in your success for pregnancy.    You mention that you were 25 when you had your tubes tied but your age now is one factor to consider.  Women over 40 should discuss their personal chances with their health care provider before seeking the reversal because other factors will affect fertility besides the tubal.    Another important factor relates to the type of procedure you had.  Women with the best chances had a preocedure which involved removal of a small section of the fallopian tubes or those whose tubal involved clips or rings around the tubes.    The overall success rate varies considerable, from 20 to 70 % of those desiring reversal and pregnancy.     It would probably be good to get a copy of your surgical report to take to the surgeon who would be doing the reversal so they could deternine if yours is one that would be likely to be successful.  Size of the tube also makes a difference and this is why a small missing segment will be easier than one which took a larger segment.    The other option for you would be In Vitro fertilization.  In this procedure your egg is fertilized with your husband's sperm outside the body and then transplanted into the uterus.    Good luck.\n\n",

This puts the \"fertile\" days starting at day 4 if one assumes that sperm can survive for 7 days in the vaginal/uterine tract.  7 days is probably about the longest that sperm would be expected to survive (if that long).  Using this calculation (which is a rough calculation), one would expect your risk of pregnancy to begin increasing around March 28th with the chances being much more around April 1st.

Unfortunately, it may not help much with determining paternity since it is possible for sperm from both men to still be viable and able to fertilize the egg during this time.  It is a little more likely that the contact on the 3rd was the one that caused fertilization compared to 3/29 simply because the sperm cells will be more healthy at that point and more apt to successfully achieve fertilization.  Fertilization typically does not occur on the exact day of ovulation.  Instead it usually occurs a day or several days later as the egg travels down the fallopian tubes.  This extra time makes it less likely that sperm from 3/29 would continue to be viable.  This is in no way a guarantee, though.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I use the calendar to check when I may menstruate and it either happens the exact day or a day after because I can feel my abodmen and I start to have cravings and my temperature increases a bit. I use protection 98% of the times since I decided to have sex. I do agree with you it is more likely that conception would have taken place between Apil 4-6 since I more than likely ovulated between April 3-6. Is it possible for a prospective daddy to get any symptoms like the prospective mother? Perhaps gaining weight, tiredness, vomitting, aches and pains? My ex says he's been feeling really tired and he is so concerned and his feet aches when he stands for too long. The only symptom I've had is tiredness, a little weight and a little uneasy when I go to bed.\n\n",

    "content": "There is such thing as a sympathy or psychosomatic reaction in some fathers but it is not biologically caused so it usually relates to their emotional state relating to the pregnant mother or the anticipation of the expected child.  They seem to be very empathetic to what the mother experiences and seem to mimic the symptoms.  If the father doesn't even know about the pregnancy and is not actively involved in it now, it is unlikely he is having this type of reaction.  Probably stress or picking up some kind of virus, independent of the pregnancy.\n\n",

Can you give me your insight into the possibility of the paternity. My doctor stated that due to my regular 25 day periods, I would have ovulated on the 12th day which is April 4th or between April 5 & 6. So which partner is likely to be the father? The one I had protected intercourse with and the condom ruptured on March 29 or my ex with whom I had unprotected sex with April 1 and April 3 and he ejaculated in me? I am now 10 weeks pregnant.\n\n",

For Jan of a new year it's 1-3 days less than it was the entire yr.  So i think the pattern is 30. I guess I calculated incorrectly. So in that case based on the previous information excluding the possible ovutaion dates wasn't I more likely to haev ovulated between April 5 or 6? Who is more likely to be the father? Also do I stop taking folic acid at any time during my pregnancy, i'm 10 week and 5 days.\n\n",

This would put your expected ovulation day around April 8th or 9th based on the math in my head.  Fertility would be expected to begin around April 2nd or so based on this.

    "content": "It seems, based on your MRI, that you have some mild disk encroachment on the spine and possibly on the nerve leaving the spine.  It's likely that this is contributing to your back pain some.  It doesn't seem severe but probably enough to cause pain.  Pregnancy can worsen back pain because the spine begins carrying more weight from the baby and the weight is shifted forward so the spine is having to compensate more.  I would recommend that you discuss your MRI findings with a neurosurgeon or spine surgeon to see if anything needs to be done.  Often, for back injuries, physical therapy is the most helpful.  Surgery is generally a last resort because the surgeries often have complications and varied success rates.  You may want to ask the surgeon their opinion of pregnancy.  I suspect that while it may cause some increased pain it would not be dangerous.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Some days my pain is not bad but most days just sleeping or sitting the wrong way has been causing a lot of pain around my SI joint that goes into my butt and continues down the back of my leg. I also have a chip off of the actabulum which causes hip and outer leg pain, all associated with my left side.   I have been trying to get proper medical care for over 1 1/2 years through work comp but the doctors seem to have a one track mind. I was in therapy, which was helping because I go out of alignment but that too was stopped by the insurance company and doctor that does not feel I need any medical treatment.   Unfortunately, I have been to 3 surgeons about my pain. The hip surgeon said there is nothing that he is willing to do and does not believe I can still be having hip pain after so long. Also I have seen two back surgeons. The first wanted Epidural Steroid Injections which were no benefit and I asked for a second opinion for the fact he was counting down the days to retirement and if I needed surgery wanted someone who would be in practice longer. The second opinion I got was that there was not much he was willing to do because there was a multi level injuries and my entire left side is affected. He decided there was no way to tell what was directly causing the pain and therefore would not operate on someone who is only 25. He sent me for tests and then when I followed up with him he had no idea he had ever treated me before.\n\n",

    "content": "I understand the hesitancy of the surgeons in not wanting to operate.  Back surgery is notorious for being quite complicated and with significant complications a relatively large portion of the time.  If the surgeon is positive what is causing the problem there is a decent chance the issue could be made worse by doing the surgery.  Back pain can be extremely frustrating because it seems that nothing helps.  My best advice to you is to continue to follow up with the surgeons and at some point things may change to the point that surgery would be beneficial.  Until then, try to keep your back in the best shape possible.  It may help to see a physical therapist to get some specific recommendations about stretches, etc. that may help.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Last Saturday, I had very minor bleeding and I went to the emergency room just to make sure everything was OK. They did a blood test and found that I had a urinary tract infection. For this they gave me an antibiotic. They also gave me a pelvic exam. At this time they said that everything was fine and they were happy that my uterus was still closed. Two days later I miscarried. I'm just wondering whther or not they were supposed to give me the papsmere and could this have caused the miscarriage. Should I go see my OBGYN and can he tell me for sure?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rturner, It is unlikely that the pelvic exam contributed to the miscarriage.  While you express concern about the \"pap smear\", It is not routine for an actual pap smear to be done during a ER visit pelvic exam.  I do not know if in reality, the spotting you experienced that precipitated the ER visit, may have been an early sign of the body's intent to miscarry.  Many times a problem with the developing fetus may signal the body that this is not going to be a viable birth, and the body eliminates it.  I would convey this occurrence to your OB/GYN because this puts you into a category of \"high-risk\" pregnancy, a category that means you need close monitoring the next time you become pregnant.  You were right to have the UTI evaluated by the ER MD.  And based on the little information you have presented, I doubt that you did anything to cause the miscarriage. I wish you well with your next pregnancy.\n\n",

Your doctor often will do a urine test; however, if there is suspicion of pregnancy and the urine tests are negative, a blood test can be done which is much more sensitive.  It may also be that the hormone level in the patch was a little low and your body's hormones took over again.  This may have changed the expected due date for your period.    If your period doesn't start in the next week you should follow up with your doctor.  In the mean time, it is OK to replace the patch as you normally would.  If you are pregnant, the exposure to the estrogen from the patch is not harmful during the short time until pregnancy is diagnosed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

During my pregnancy with her, I had horrible bouts of dizziness, and could barely get out of bed after the 3-month mark.  I had to stop working because I would pass out after standing for about 15 minutes.  The doctor told me my iron levels were slightly low, but nothing to worry about.  At 40 weeks pregnant, I developed preeclampsia.  I was induced on my due date because there was a significant amount of protein in my urine.  There was no prior incidence of blood pressure problems through any of that pregnancy.  At the time of my daughter's birth, my iron levels were dangerously low and the doctors wanted to do a blood transfusion.  I refused, and the levels returned to normal very shortly following.    I am currently 21 weeks pregnant with my second.  I'm having the same repeat dizzy spells.  My iron levels are normal, as well as my blood pressure while I'm at the doctor.  Last time I was at the grocery store (this is where I notice most of these problems since it involves walking), I tested my blood pressure while I felt fine, and it was 150/108.  My blood pressure is ALWAYS around 110/70 when I'm tested at the doctor.  I was shocked at how high it was, and how normal I felt.  Within about 15 minutes, however, I started feeling dizzy, had to sit down.  So I took my blood pressure again immediately, and found that it had dropped a significant amount.  It was 80/50.      I understand that blood pressure can change within just minutes, but it seems like an awfully dramatic change.  And I'm fairly certain now that it's my blood pressure causing this dizziness.  There is a very large family history of blood pressure problems and heart problems.  I have Mitral Valve Prolapse (was diagnosed at 18 years old), but am not on any medications for anything.  Normally, drinking tons and tons of water throughout my grocery store trips helps keep me from passing out.  Sometimes, though, it doesn't work.  How can I get this under control and what are the effects this will have on my 21-week-old fetus?    Any help is greatly appreciated, as this is an ongoing problem and I would like to have more children.  This problem makes it incredibly difficult to be pregnant.  I have no blood pressure problems when I am not pregnant.  But I do have very significant irregular heartbeat, which gets worse when I'm pregnant, probably because of these blood pressure irregularities.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I hope you are in good communication with your obstetrician or family doctor about your bothersome symptoms.  In addition to the classic hypertension (high blood pressure), there is secondary hypertension, where something else in the body is resulting in the high blood pressure (or fluctuating blood pressure).  Since your doctor will only see the results on the days you are in there, let him/her know what is happening, what the home monitoring is showing and you may be recommended to have your pressure measured even several times daily using a home monitor.  The overall pattern is important so your doctor needs to know what is going on.  Some conditions that can affect blood pressure include glandular problems (thyroid, adrenal gland, parathyroid, diabetes, etc.), kidney problems, sleep apnea, obesity, medications (including supplements), and pregnancy induced hypertension.  This is why it is important for you to communicate with your health care provider so if additional testing is necessary it can be arranged.    Additionally, blood pressure fluctuations are usually without symptoms (as you noticed when you discovered the episode of high blood pressure) so it is possible your symptoms are caused by something else entirely which should be checked out.  Gestational diabetes is another common pregnancy complication which can cause some very uncomfortable feelings.  This is generally checked near the beginning of the third trimester because it most often appears in the latter part of pregnancy but it can occur sooner too.    Please let us know what you find out.  This is definitely not a normal pregnancy reaction.  Even if it turns out to not be serious at all, it is important to be sure.\n\n",

The catheter is still inside, there is a strange bump outside and my wbc is high, even though i don't feel it although i am tired all the time. I'm now in my second trimester. Should i wait until after the birth to remove it? Does it pose much of a risk?  I'll most likely have to get another c/s for this baby so i'm thinking that they could give me a spinal this time and remove the catheter right after delivery. that means waiting 4 1/2 months though.   thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "It is a little difficult to say whether the catheter is related to the high WBC count.    In general, if possible surgery should be postponed during surgery.  If the surgery is necessary, the physicians will take special precautions to make it as safe as possible for both mom and baby.  In these situations it comes down to risks vs. benefits.  In some cases it will be necessary to take the risks due to the need for the surgical treatment and in some cases the benefits will not be worth the risks.  I would recommend following up with your obstetrician to try to identify why your WBC count is high.  I think it is unlikely that the catheter is the source of your WBC count but be sure to get your doctor's opinion since I cannot examine you.  Also you should discuss the risks of surgery during pregnancy with your obstetrician.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Well I am apparently quite good at conceiving boys, since I have 3 beautiful sons.  =)  Honestly, I don't think there's much you can do.  Some people believe in the Shettles Method, which is timing intercourse as close to ovulation as possible for a boy and as far away as possible for a girl.  This is from the theory that Y chromosome carrying sperm (boys) swim faster and don't' live as long as the girl sperm.  I have seen far too many Shettles opposites to put any faith in this method.  My sister-in-law, in fact, is due with my new niece in August and they only had intercourse the day before ovulation, which according to Shettles is definite boy territory.  My first son is also a Shettles opposite.  We were not trying to get pregnant at the time but he was conceived with intercourse 4 days prior to ovulation, which would put him in the girl territory according to Shettles.  What really gets me about Shettles is that there are other methods that outright contradict it and they also prove a high success rate.  This leads me to believe that it's a crapshoot.  You do, afterall, have a 50/50 chance of it working since there are only 2 genders.  =)  I have heard of some people douching with an alkaline douche (baking soda) prior to intercourse in hopes to make a more suitable environment for the boy sperm.  You might try doing a web search to find out more information on this.    In the end, I think you're going to get what you get; unless you see a doctor and do a more scientific approach such as Microsort or the Ericsson Albumin method of sperm spinning.\n\n",

Since you describe it as burning I think it is unlikely it is anything serious but if it gets worse, doesn't abate or you have any other symptoms you should call your doctor right away or go to the hospital if not available.  Otherwise, let your doctor know at your next appointment.  You should also be monitoring the baby's movements and if there is any concern go to the hospital.  I would expect about 10 kicks in a two hour time frame.  It's a good idea to do \"kick counts\" and pick a time each day to count these during a two hour period.  If you don't get this much activity, call your doctor.\n\n",

If the pregnancy tests remain negative, pregnancy is less likely but not impossible.  Your obstetrician can perform a blood pregnancy test that is more sensitive as well as an ultrasound to look for any evidence of a growing baby.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "hi, i am a 20 year old female with no serious helth issues. i have had an irregular cycle since i first started my period and it has been very hard for me to know when i am supposed to get my period. the last time i had intercourse was on the 28th of April and before that on the 14th of April. We are pretty careful when it comes to protection but i don't remember if we used protection both times and im not on any type of birth control. I havent had a period in four or five months. recently my breasts have grown slightly and they hurt and i had back cramps for a few days. yesterday i started bleeding. its hard to describe but its very heavy with clumps and i am in excruciating pain. pain killers don't help. im starting to think that i might have been pregnant and that i am misscarrying. is that possible? if so, should i not use tampons and what should i do to confirm? please answer as quickly as possible, im getting very ancy. thank you so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm sorry you are having trouble getting important prenatal care.  Here are a few thoughts.  First of all, the most important shot for you when Rh negative is the one given within 72 hours of you giving birth.  The prenatal shot is kind of an emergency just-in-case backup.  They give it close enough to delivery that it would likely be effective in the case of a premature delivery that may be emergency without medical care or for some other reason you were unable to get the Rhogam after delivery.  So, to ease some of your fears, just make sure you get the Rhogam after delivery if you are a candidate.  If your baby's blood is tested and found to be negative you don't need the shot at all.    Secondly, have you tried contacting your local health department to ask if there are any community clinics you might be able to use, where doctors work on a sliding fee schedule or in other ways help people like you who are uninsured?  I would check in the State or County listings (often in your phone book under government related services) for Health and just start asking questions.  Also, check with your Medicaid office to find out what is holding up your benefits.  Are they waiting for any information you need to provide?  Is there a case worker assigned to your case?  If so, you want to speak to that person or their supervisor.   Some states have additional support services for pregnancy that helps expedite the Medicaid process so your care does not have to be held up waiting for this.  Call your Medicaid office to find out and be sure to tell them you are pregnant.    Good luck and let us know how it works out.\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, I agree, this is probably just a normal timing situation.  Because of the very short life of an egg (and usually only one is released each month) it can take a while for everything to work out just right for pregnancy.  Up to a year is a common time frame for pregnancy to occur.  In actively trying to become pregnant, you should make good use of the time from one week to two and a half weeks after the beginning day of your period.   This would be your most fertile time period.    Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am 27 years old with 3 prior cesarean births.  My first son was born in March 2001 Second son born in August 2004 Third son born in May 2006  My first cesarean was an emergency after 44 hours of labor, my son becoming very distressed.  He was also acencletic, and an attempt to turn his head into the proper position failed.  Baby 7 pounds 15 ounces.  My second cesarean was a repeat, as the hospital does not allow VBAC.  It was uncomplicated.  Baby 9 pounds 3 ounces.  My third was another repeat, and it was uncomplicated.  In fact my OB said it was \"a piece of cake.\"  Baby 8 pounds 1 ounce.  I did have a minor subchorionic hemmorrage during that pregnancy, which resolved itself by 12 weeks gestation.  All 3 boys born healthy  During my third cesarean. I asked him if it looked okay in there for me to have a fourth and he gave me a thumb's up.  It was noted that I had minimal scar tissue given the number of cesareans I have had, my uterus has not thinned and I had no bleeding issues.  My OB has said that he does not foresee me having any complications with a fourth, (but was quick to say that things happen and you never know.)  So now for my question:  I have been given the green light to have a fourth.  My husband and I would like a fourth (AND LAST) child.  This will be the last one.  I understand that maternal and fetal risk goes up with each cesarean, yet I have also been told by a labor and delivery nurse that if you are cut in the same place each time (as I have been..there is only one scar on my uterus), that is a good thing and a 4 cesarean may not be any more risky than a second.  Is any of this true?  How common are issues such as placenta accreta?  What precations can one take to help ensure a safe delivery?  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm sorry there is no test and it seems the jury is still out about whether or not there is increased risk.  While all surgery comes with risk, and any cesarean is riskier than most vaginal delliveries, one study reported in PubMed indicates there is little risk posed with a fourth cesarean delivery as opposed to a second or third and some other sources have also put the risk at a comparable level with the third.  There are a few more complications that accompany multiple c/sections such as placental problems relating to attachment, placenta  previa, etc.  Given your history I would see no reason why you would expect problems but of course nobody can guarantee this in any circumstances.   Good luck with your decision.\n\n",

When I was 18 I was not on anything and when I was 20 I was on Depo.  My question is Why did the doctors not know I was preagnant any of these times?

Please help me understand how they did not know even after I told them I have been through this before?  P.S. I also took home PT and they all said negative they say that until I get 6 months along.\n\n",

Because of this, these women will test negative using urine pregnancy tests for longer than typical.  I do not know why this is the case.

    "content": "I am a 19 year old female. I experienced sex for the first time almost one week ago. I didn't want to have sex, but my boyfriend pushed his penis into me anyway. It was only inside of me for like maybe 3 minutes, and as soon as I felt it, I pushed him off of me. After I pushed him away, he \"finished\" himself with his hand and caught all of the ejaculatory fluid in his hand, and then got rid of it. I fixed my clothes and none of that touched me in any way. Since Sunday night when this happened all I have done is cry and research everything I could think of. I learned about a pre-ejaculatory fluid that seeps out randomly before the actual ejaculation occurs, and that there is a possibility of sperm being present in that fluid if the guy had experienced an ejaculation within the 72 hours prior. I talked to my boyfriend about it, and he said that he had not. I would like to know if there is a possibility that I might be pregnant. I would also like to know all the risks and possibilities and options that I have in either situation. Within this week I have started experiencing the normal sympptoms that I usually have before I start my period: breast tenderness, small cramps, irritability, tiredness, etc. I should be starting my period within the coming week. There was no contraceptive methods used at all (except for the \"pull out\"). I did not consent to this improper misuse of sex. Please help, thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "In general, your risk of pregnancy is low based on a few reasons but not zero.  There is often some sperm in the pre-ejaculatory fluid.  The amount is low so pregnancy from solely this fluid is unlikely but again, possible.  Also, based on your menstrual cycle, if you are less than one week from starting your period it is unlikely that you are currently \"fertile\".  Generally, roughly speaking, the week after the start of your period and the week before are less fertile and the middle two weeks are more fertile.  (Don't base a rhythm method of contraception on these estimates.)  If you do not start your period as expected you should take a pregnancy test.  Also, incidents such as you are describing can be very traumatic to deal with emotionally.  If you find yourself having trouble I strongly recommend you see a counselor or talk to someone you trust about it.  Sometimes just having someone to talk to can make things so much better.

    "content": "Hi, You do not indicate the first day of your last period but based on  your regularity and expected period I would say it was around March 22.  This would meant your most likely conception would have occured sometime around April 5 (though this can vary considerably).  Then, on May 7 the fetus should have been 6 weeks by gestation age (the two weeks prior to conception are actually added because gestation is calculated from the first day of the last period).  April 21 (the day before your period was due) would not be a likely time for pregnancy.  For instance, it would be considered one of the \"safe\" days if you were using a natural method of birth control such as cycle beads.  So, while that is not a completely reliable method, it does work pretty well in predicting fertility times and you should not have been fertile then.  Based on your doctor's impression that the fetus was 3.5 weeks (was this by ultrasound?), that would have meant conception occurred about April 12.    If conception had occured on April 21, the doctor would be seeing a fetus almost 4.5 weeks.  You didn't say exactly how the doctor was determining this developmental age.  If April 21 was the only day you had sex, that would change the picture of course.  I hope this makes sense.  Feel free to write back if you still have questions.\n\n",

I have also been told by my doctor to wait and see.  I just want to know if I am getting a premature menopause (I am only 34 years old this year) or have I developed thyroid?

    "content": "Menopause or thyroid issues could certainly account for your symptoms.  Pregnancy is also a possibility.  An ectopic pregnancy is less likely but some women seem to have lower amounts of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) in the urine.  hCG is the hormone produced by the placenta that is tested for with urine pregnancy tests.  It's pretty rare but some women don't have a postiive urine test for 8-10 weeks.  A serum pregnancy test is much more sensitive.  If there is concern for pregnancy a serum test can be done as well as an ultrasound to look for an intrauterine or extrauterine pregnancy.  Testing the thyroid is quite easy.  A TSH and T4 level can be drawn from the blood to assess this.  Menopause can be tested for by checking FSH and estrogen levels.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Generally by 5 weeks, home pregnancy tests are around 99% accurate.  Several factors can result in a false negative, including very dilute urine, testing too early (i.e. before 4-5 weeks), and incorrectly performing the test.  I would recommend you repeat the pregnancy test now using the first morning void.  If this is negative it is likely to be a true result.  There are several things that can alter a normal period including stress (good stress as well as bad stress) and illnesses.  If your pregnancy test is negative and you do not have your period by 8 weeks I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes and congratulations on your recent marraige.\n\n",

Sperm can remain viable for several days (with reports of up to a week) after deposition in the vaginal tract.

    "content": "Hi, I would continue to have every other day sexual intercourse from about day 8 or 10, through about day 20 (but of course you don't need to stop then - you would just be less likely to be fertile and the idea is not to miss the most fertile time.  Stopping at that point won't do anything to improve your chances so relax and enjoy it).  Not everyone ovulates at the same point in the cycle.  A fertile woman, regularly engaging in sex will likely become pregnant within the year and it would not be considered abnormal for it to take the full year.  You were very lucky the first time - it just doesn't always work according to our calendar and planning.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Since you have regular 30 day cycles, you were probably at the last day of the time before your most fertile period would begin.  The next two weeks beginning on the 24th would be the most likely time for pregnancy. For instance, if you were carefully practicing the rhythm method using cycle beads to monitor the times you would especially want to use a backup method of birth control that time would begin on the 24th.  Used correctly in women with regular cycles, this can be a pretty good method, so based on that, you were still in the \"safe zone\" and pregnancy would not be likely (possible, but not likely).   Does this make sense?  At any rate, the odds are in favor of not pregnant.   Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your fear, but, getting the pregnancy test could actually give you relief.  A regular test would be reliable in the 5th week following the previous period.  The emergency contraception you used is usually quite effective.  Stress (such as worrying about pregnancy) can also cause a delay in the cycle.  So, getting information will probably be best to help you move on with other decisions you need to make.  It also sounds like condoms may not be your best means of protection so you may want to come up with a backup method.  Withdrawal is not an effective birth control technique.  I would encourage you to get some medical advice about a method that you and your girlfriend can both be comfortable with (and consistent in using).    Let us know if you have other questions or you get more information about this that you would like to share.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Since you got a normal period after the sexual encounters, it is unlikely you could be pregnant.  But, it is not because he did not ejaculate.  Sperm can be present with penetration even if he withdraws so unless you use a condom or other form of birth control, there is always this chance.    Would you like information about contraception (birth control)?  There is an element of worry when you are sexually active if you are not yet ready for pregnancy.  You could feel more peaceful if you are are better prepared to avoid pregnancy until you are both ready physically, emotionally, financially, etc.  Let us know if we can help with this and please consider visiting a clinic or doctor to discuss various methods of birth control so you can find something that would be right for you.  It is also a good idea to check your overall health at this time.  You are likely fertile and with sex, this usually results in pregnancy before long unless you plan otherwise.\n\n",

    "content": "No, there is no evidence that taking the pill when pregnant will cause birth defects or other problems for the fetus.  They consist of hormones just as your body makes.  They interfere with ovulation primarily and if you have ovulated in spite of the pills or because of inconsistent use, you do not need to worry about damage.  Once pregnancy is confirmed you will be advised to stop taking them to allow your normal hormones to do their work to sustain the pregnancy but if you are not pregnant, you would want to keep taking them on the recommended schedule anyway.    If you think you may be pregnant, be certain you are taking 400 mcg folic acid (perhaps as part of a multivitamin) because this has been shown to decrease risk of birth defects when taken early in pregnancy.  Women of childbearing age should consistently take a vitamin daily as described because 50% of all pregnancies are unintended.\n\n",

Will this start my new schedule or will it go back to the 16th-18th because that's what I am normal? #3- Is it just coincidence or is there something to the fact that, when I'm close, my periods always seem to start the day after I have sex, usually only if I actually have the big \"O\" though.

Its actually rather common for a woman to miscarry very early on in a pregnancy, and never know she was pregnant. It is also not a coincidance that you start soon after having an orgasm. The contractions caused by an orgasm can cause a period to start. Your periods may be a little abnormal if you have had a miscarriage, but I would count 28 days from the start of this peoriod and assume that is when the next period will come., although it may be a little later or eariler.

The reason it is hard to say is that not everyone ovulates at exactly the 14th day.  If you have regular menstrual cycles between 26 and 32 days, your most likely ovulation date would be April 9 making intercourse on the 8th the most likely conception. Sperm can live in the fallopian tubes up to five days.  But eggs do not last so long (around 12 to 24 hours).  Again, since you don' t know exactly when you ovulated, you can't be sure which it is.  Only paternity testing later could most certainly verify who is the father.  I hope this helps, even if it doesn't give you a definite answer.  Good luck.\n\n",

There is simply not enough data on phenylephrine to really say if it is safe or not, so it has received a pregnancy class C rating.  If possible, this drug should be avoided since we just don't know for sure.  Pseudoephedrine has a bit more data.  It has had some small trials in pregnant women and has been found safe in these studies.  The problem is that the studies were small so a danger may have been missed.  It is rated class C (not enough data) by the US and class B2 by the Australian data system (Probably safe but not certain).  Some obstetricians OK the use of pseudoephedrine and some do not.  It's probably safe but we can't say for sure.  If there is an allergy component, diphenhydramine (commonly called Benadryl) is safe to use in pregnancy (US class B and Australian class A).  As a summary: Class A-safe Class B-probably safe Class C-uncertain Class D-evidence suggests drug is unsafe Class X-definitely not safe  The Australian system tends to have better data than the US system at this point.  Sorry, it's a long answer to a short question.  Here's a summary.  I would recommend avoiding phenylephrine, pseudoephedrine is probably safe but I would recommend waiting until after the first trimester, diphenhydramine is safe.    Saline nasal sprays are always safe and may provide a little help.  Your obstetrician may have a list of safe medicines for you take as well.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The rational behind using oral contraceptives is that the hormone in the pill \"overrides\" the bodies natural hormone levels causing the hormones FSH and LH to be suppressed.  This suppression prevents the surge of LH that is involved in ovulation, thus preventing ovulation.  If one misses taking the birth control pill, the levels of estrogen or progesterone may drop below the threshold for suppression and allow the body to \"take over\" again.  At this point, ovulation may occur and the chance of pregnancy increases.  While the likelihood is less than not using the oral contraceptive at all, the chance of pregnancy does go up.    The general recommendation if you have missed more than one pill is to start a new pack of birth control pills and use an alternative method of contraception for the next month.  If your menses are not on time as expected you should take a pregnancy test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Missing one day is not as likely to result in ovulation but two or more does raise your risk.  If you miss a day, you should take the missed dose along with the regular dose on the day you remember.  If you only miss one, the likelihood of pregnancy is not great so you don't need a backup method of birth control - just take two the next day when you remember.  With two or more missed, you would be wise to use a backup until you start your next package of pills.  I hope this is clear for you.

    "content": "I would recommend a workup with your OB/GYN who can better determine what kinds of fertility challenges you have.  I see no reason why the procedures you have had in the past would affect fertility, but if you have been sexually active for three years, attempting pregnancy, there is cause for concern.  Getting the right diagnosis is essential.    While clomid has helped many women who have trouble with ovulation, it is not without its risks (especially for multiples and their resulting preterm deliveries).  You would only want to take this under a doctor's care and only if this is the actual problem with your fertility as determined by your doctor. Progesterone is an important hormone in pregnancy but it too should be used only with your doctor's knowledge and encouragement.    Good luck in your attempts, but please schedule a visit with your health care provider or fertility clinic.\n\n",

    "content": "Nipple discharge such as you describe is rarely a sign of a  serious problem and often considered a normal part of your breast's function, especially in a woman who has breastfed a baby. If that's the case, the discharge might resolve on its own. Avoid nipple stimulation \u2014 such as by frequently checking for discharge \u2014 because stimulation actually makes the discharge persist.   You may get some relief from your symptoms by applying a warm compress and taking a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medication such as aspirin or ibuprofen.  Breast tenderness can also be an early sign of pregnancy.    Another possible cause of discharge is hormonal (excess prolactin) and can result from birth control pills or other medications, frequent breast self-exam, sexual activity, thyroid or pituitary gland disorder. Some women experience such symptoms during menstruation.  Other causes usually are found in older women such as tumors (typically non-cancerous).    If the problem persists, it's best to check it out with your health care provider to be on the safe side and of course it is always important to have regular physical exams where you should report any unusual symptoms to your doctor.\n\n",

    "title": "Pregnant after Egg Donation Cycle?",
    "content": "'m a 22 year old woman. I just went through an egg donation cycle where the doctors varied my birth control pill cycle and didn't give me much information or assistance.  I suspect I may be pregnant, but don't want to do a home testing kit because I fear the gonal-F I took as part of the cycle may give me a false positive.   Here is what happened.  Approximately the second week of February, I back-to-backed my pill packs (Ortho-tri-cyclen-lo), but still had a period around February 18th. About the first week of March, I returned to the doctors from the egg donation, who told me to stop taking the ortho tri cyclen for five days (it was about the third week of the pack) and then on the 5th day begin taking a different brand of pills (Loestrin-Fe). I did so, and used condoms as a back up birth control method whenever I had sex.  I had another period during the 5 days when I stopped my pills. On March 19th, I begain taking the Lupron for the egg donation cycle. I was to stop my pills on March 24th.    I asked the doctor whether I was protected from pregnancy at this point and he said yes.   On March 21st and 22nd, my husband and I had sex without a condom.   We began using condoms again on the 24th, when I stopped taking my pills. The next time I visited the doctor on April 5th, the doctor found it strange that I did not have a period at all when I stopped the pills on the 24th. He took no action and said nothing further. I began taking the Gonal-F on April 5th.  At this point (and until now) my husband and I abstained. On my last ultrasound on April 17th, the doctor commented that the lining of my uterus was unusually thick. The egg extraction took place on the 19th of April.  I have not experienced a period or any sort of bleeding as of yet.  My questions are the following 1) Is it at all possible that I am pregnant 2) How soon can I take a pregnancy test without getting a false positive from the Gonal-F (my last injection was Tuesday the 17th of April)?   Thank you very much for your assistance,\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, breasts can leak in a non-pregnant woman with stimulation, as with foreplay and this is within the normal range.  It could be due to the normally present duct-blocking keratin being dislodged.  All women (pregnant or not) have fluid in their breasts but usually the ducts are plugged when the woman is not pregnant or breastfeeding.    This can also be a sign of a hormonal imbalance, medication side effects or other abnormal condition so if it continues, she should seek an examination by her health care provider to be sure it is not a problem.  Most likely this is benign.  The greater issue I see here is a matter of trust, which is essential in a good relationship.  Hopefully you can work through this concern, but if not, this may be a red-flag for future relationship challenges.\n\n",

    "content": "It is rare to get chickenpox a second time, but some people who have immune disorders may not develop antibodies to the disease, thus they can contract it again.  Has your wife actually been exposed to a known case of chicken pox?  Until recently, when the vaccine became available, chickenpox was almost always out there in the general population and it was almost impossible to avoid exposure.  The vast majority of adults are already immune.  Vaccination has decreased the incidence and therefore will have a positive effect on pregnancy risk.  Keep in mind that 3 to 5% of babies in the general population are born with congenital defects and your baby's risk with this exposure would be only about 2%.  So try not to stress too much about this.  It doesn't carry the high risk of defects found with prenatal rubella exposure.  The doctor can give your wife ativiral drugs to reduce the severity of the illness, but it sounds like she is not having a bad case anyway.  OTIS (Organization of Teratolgoy Information Services) has a fact sheet about chickenpox at http://www.otispregnancy.org (English, Spanish and French languages).  Good luck and keep us posted on your wife's condition.\n\n",

Went home from DR, took another urine test, EPT brand, and showed pos.  My wife has missed period, tender breasts, and had some spotty bleeding, which appears heavy when she urinates.  Has been bleeding for 7 days now, not much usually.  After the last test on Thursday, took another ept on Sat and was positive.  had ultrasound, reg and vaginal, couldnt see anything.  Should have had period on 23 of March, but didnt have one.  Have taken total of 6 urine pregnancy test, which  have shown positive, including the one at the doctors office which the nurse first thought negative.  Took a new test, a \"pee in cup\" type which showed a faint positive, and may not have done correctly.  Waiting on blood tests.  Wife is diabetic, and we have never had kids.  I am 40 yrs old.  Also, she has pain in lower back, extremely good smell, headache off/on, and occasional cramping.  Hasnt take any bc in years.  What do you think?  Pregnate, misscarrige, eptopic? thank you\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds very consistent with pregnancy.  The urine pregnancy test is quite specific for human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a hormone made by the placenta.  It is possible that the pregnancy is too early along to see the fetus developing yet.  In this situation, your obstetrician will likely want to follow the specific amount of hCG in your wife's blood.  With a normal intrauterine pregnancy, the hCG amount rises very predictably.  If it is not rising as expected (too fast or too slow) this can indicate the presence of other conditions such as ectopic pregnancy or fetal demise.  Of note, it is possible to have elevated hCG levels and not be pregnant.  In particular, there is a type of tumor, known as choriocarcinoma, that secretes hCG.  If pregnancy is ruled out by other means, this should be looked for.   Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for the reply.  What do you think about the bleeding? It has been 8 days since she started bleeding, and is similar to bleeding with a period.  Can she be pregnate and still have a period?  She has had some pain in lower back, her breasts are still tender, and this morning, another ept test was positive.  If there was a miscarrige, how long would the hormone stay in the system and register on a ept?  She has not seen any tissue or anything, just some clumpy blood.  Bleeding a little worse since yesterday.  Any thoughts? We have been married for 17 yrs, and this is the closest we have come to being able to have children.  I know with her age, and the diabetes it will be tough, but we can still hope. again, thankl you!!\n\n",

The fact that it occurs frequently does not help you heal but know that many people carry such burdens and time does ease the intensity of the pain.    Be advised that perinatal depression is also real and occurs both in pregnancy and in the postpartum period.  Hormonal imbalances, along with your possible sense of loss and/or failure in this pregnancy can contribute to this potential problem.  Be alert to signs of this in your wife and seek treatment early if it is needed.    My best wishes\n\n",

I am currently taking Abilify and Prozac for my bi polar disorder. And now i am on YAZ to regulate my periods. This is my first month on yaz. I missed a dose in my second week of taking it. (i started the sunday after my period started.) I took my pill the next night with my other pill. I had sexual interourse, unprotected, and he ejaculated inside me. I also took some of my pills late. I have had extreme cervical discharge and nausea from time to time. I am always sleepy, for the past 2 weeks. When I first started my birth control i had loss of appetite. Now, for the past week, I've been really hungry all the time. I even ate food I do not eat, because I had somewhat of a craving for it. Could I have gotten pregnant? Or could it just all be in my head? Any replies are well appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "There are several possible explanations, including pregnancy.  Oral contraceptive are quite effective but only when taken consistently.  Missing an occasional pill is OK-just take it the next day with that day's pill.  Consistently missing pills makes the contraceptive ineffective and other methods should be used.  You may also be having some side effects from starting the pill.  It will often take 2-3 months for women to become acclamated to the pill.  If there is concern about pregnancy you should take a pregnancy test.  They become accurate during the 5th week after the start of your last period.  Also remember that birth control pills do not protect against STD's.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may be a first-time-mother thing, but I feel like something is wrong and I have no health insurance.  The clinic is not taking me seriously.  Advice welcome.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "To answer this, I need to know what you did after you missed the pills.  I.e. did you take extra pills or restart a new pack, etc?  Generally for 2 missed pills, the recommendation is to take 2 pills on the day you remember, 2 pills the next day, then 1 pill a day until you finish the pack.    If you miss the pills the pills during the 3rd week of the pack after taking the 2 days of 2 pills, take one pill a day until the end of the week if you start your packs on Sunday then start a new pack.  If you don't start on Sunday you can just start a new pack.  In these situations you may not have a period that month.    It is generally recommended that if you miss more than one day in your packet you should use a back up method for the next 1-2 weeks.  If you are concerned about the possibility of pregnancy you should repeat your pregnancy test in the 5th week after your last period or see your doctor for a blood test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 29 and have had three children all by c section.  During the month of February, I had to undergo minor surgery for the removal of my copper IUD.  (No harm was done, strings were not available to remove it in the office.)  Until that point, my husband and I felt that our having three boys, were didn't want more children.  We have changed our minds and also read a book by Landrum B. Shettles titled 'How to Choose the Sex of Your Baby'.  We understand that our outcome may not produce a girl but we would be quite happy with a healthy child regardless of the gender.  So, we have been trying to conceive ever since the IUD was removed.  I have been tracking my CM and feel that I have the information that I need to know when ovulation is/has occurred.  My last period was March 9.  We have followed the guidelines according to the book.  I have noticed that I have had some light cramping.  The cramping has occurred on and off every day following the 22nd of March and cannot recall having these symptoms as PMS this early before my next cycle.  Along with that, I have felt some tingling sensations in my breasts but am not sure if my mind is so focused on becoming pregnant that it has made my judgement a bit hazy about this symptom.  I have let my impatients get the better of me and have taken several HPT's with negative results.  I am due to begin my next period on April 9.  Would I be getting false results as of today by taking an HPT?  If so, what about the early detection tests?  Are they accurate and when would I test for accurate results with those?  Thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Depo-Provera can do just about anything to a woman's normal cycle.  This can range from no bleeding to severe bleeding and just about anything in between.  After about 6 months on the medication about 1/2 of women will no longer have a monthly cycle.  After 12 months almost all women will stop having their monthly cycle.  It will return after stopping the depo-provera.  I suspect that you may be experiencing some symptoms related to your medicine; however, this is a little soon.  If you were ready to start your regular cycle it may be your normal cycle with some medication effect.  The medication does not start preventing pregnancy right away.  I recommend that women use another form of birth control for 1 month after starting the medicine.  So if there is a possibility of becoming pregnant I would recommend you take a home pregnancy test.  The medication will not interfere with the test.    If your symptoms do not improve over the next few days I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old mother of three.  I've recently quit taking my birth control pill.  I am expecting my first regular period since I quit my pill on April 1st.  My husband and I had unprotected sex on the 16th and I am now very concerned I may be pregnant.  I have taken 2 pregnancy tests.  They both came back with a very faint plus sign after about 10 minutes.  My doctor told me to consider this a positive and once I have missed my period I need to call so they can schedule my first appointment.  I am just not completely convinced that I am pregnant and all the wondering is beginning to take it's toll on me.  I am having slight cramps (my periods are usually horrible), tingly breasts, lightheadedness, extreme fatigue, and as of last night I was very nautious.  Is this all in my head?  I \"feel\" like I am pregnant, but the test was negative, then turned positive.  Do I need to worry?  Thanks.  Amy\n\n",

    "content": "Home pregnancy tests are generally most reliable beginning the 5th week after the start of the most recent menses.  Given that you have had 2 tests come back positive (even though it was a late response) I would be suspicious of pregnancy.  Generally, home pregnancy tests can miss pregnancies but when they are positive they are usually accurate.  The late response may indicate that your hormonal levels are still low (as would be expected in that you are about 1-2 weeks earlier than the test would typically pick up).  I would recommend you repeat the test closer to April 1st when your period should be starting or during the 5th week after your last period started.  This will give a much more reliable result.  Alternatively, if your doctor is willing, a blood test can be done that is more sensitive and picks up pregnancies earlier.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "The data is still unclear about lunesta during pregnancy.  It currently is labeled as category C which means that there aren't enough studies to prove it safe or not safe.  There have been some studies done in rats that showed that dosing of 800-1000 X normal levels did not cause increases in birth defects.  There were a few studies showing that lower doses but still well above the recommended dosing did cause some low birth weight rat pups and a slight increase in failure to implant of the embryo.  All these studies were done at very high doses and none showed a definite danger.  One must be careful when interpreting studies in animals for human usage.  The results don't always correlate.    Unfortunately there isn't data to give you a definite answer; however, based on the few studies that have been done I think that it is quite likely no harm has been done.  I would recommend that you discontinue use of the medicine during pregnancy due to the lack of information about it.    In general, it's best to avoid medicine while pregnant but if you do need some there are meds that can be safely taken.  Your obstetrician can give you a list.  Be sure to let your OB know about the lunesta, but I really think everything will turn out fine.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am an 18 year old female and the past 2 weeks after having sex with my boyfriend, I have had a very uncomfortable pressure above my pelvic bone but below where normal cramps are.  I feel like I have to pee when I don't and when I finally do, it burns and is somewhat cloudy.  I rarely ever want to eat which is odd for me and I have a slight fever and continuous headache.  For the past 6 months my period has been either a week early or late, and before that I could time it down to the hour.  The cramps have also been horrible.  Because of this, I scheduled an appointment with my gyno for later this week.  My breasts have been very slightly swollen and tender for the past month.  My period is also a day late.  To settle my mind, I took a pregnancy test and it came back negative.  My stress level has also been the highest ever with money issues this month.  Ovarian and cervical cancer run in my family.  I was just wondering if anyone had any suggestions as to what could be wrong with me, if it could be a urinary tract infection, if my gyno can help me or if it could possibly all just be in my head.  Thank you for your time!\n\n",

    "content": "Your symptoms are very consistent with a urinary tract infection.  Evaluation for this is relatively simple.  Your regular doctor or gynecologist can usually do the first part of the test in the office (a simple urine dip stick) to see if the urine is consistent with an infection.  Then treatment is anywhere from 3 to 7 days depending on the preference of the doctor.    Other possibilities should you find that you do not have a UTI would be STD's, in particular chlamydia and gonorrhea.  Your gynecologist can test for these as well, if needed.    UTI's are quite common in girls, especially those that are sexually active.  You may want to ask your doctor about a medication called phenazopyridine (it's more commonly known by its brand name, pyridium) to take for a day or two.  This will help with the burning with urination until the infection is clearing.  Just note that it will turn your urine and tears orange (something to remember if you wear contacts as it will stain them).  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Let's start with discussing a commonly held assumption about pregnancy (not that you necessarily have this assumption).  Often, women believe that they cannot become pregnant without having a period.  The truth is that this may or may not be true-depending on the cause of the absent menses. Pregnancy generally will result in a cessation of ovulation for a time period after birth but that time period is quite variable.  It is possible to have an egg released and become fertilized on the first occurrence, thus leading to pregnancy without a period.  To more specifically answer your question there are a few possibilities for your symptoms.  One possibility is that you have a urinary tract infection.  Your obstetrician can test for this.    If you are concerned about pregnancy it is probably still a little early to use a home pregnancy test.  Generally these become positive about 5 weeks after the start of your last period or about 3 weeks after ovulation (generally about 2 weeks after the last period).  So, if it has only been 2 weeks and we assume that fertilization occurred you may need another week or so to have the home urine pregnancy tests be more accurate.    Frequent urination can also be a result of your body returning to its prepregnancy state.  During pregnancy, blood volumes as well as many other things increase.  The excess water will be slowly excreted back to the prepregnancy state via urination.  I would suggest you discuss your symptoms with your obstetrician or primary care doctor and have a physical exam if your symptoms persist for more than a day or two.    Regarding the Medrol, the data about use in pregnancy is mixed.  Most studies say it is probably safe.  There are a few studies that show it increases risks of some birth defects.  In general, we recommend that women who are pregnant do not take any medication unless they have to.  If this is not an option, careful decision making with your obstetrician will help avoid any unwanted effects.  So to summarize all this... I recommend you talk with your obstetrician about using the Medrol if you are pregnant.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not an obstetrician, but I'll give my best attempt to answer your question.  The term friable essentially means easily damaged.  If your daughter's umbilical cord broke during delivery the term friable certainly fits.  This is a bit unusual.  Generally, the umbilical cord is quite strong.  Obstetricians often pull gently on the cord to help deliver the placenta.  When a cord breaks, doctors must work quickly to clamp it so that significant blood loss does not occur.  If there were other circumstances that may have caused the cord to break it is less likely to happen again.  With the family history of retained placenta I would be a bit suspicous of some underlying cause.  Unfortunately I do not know what this may be.  I would recommend that you discuss this with your obstetrician.  You can make an appointment just to talk with her about your future risks.  I am unable to make any estimation of future risks for you (sorry).  If your obstetrician is unable to help you she may refer you to a perinatologist that specialized in high risk pregnancies.  Best wishes.  Hope this helps some.\n\n",

    "content": "I.U.D.'s  can increase the risk of retained placenta as you have mentioned.  Also, abnormal uterine shape can increase risk due to less effective contractions aiding in placental separation.  There are a few rare conditions known as placenta acreda, percreda, etc. where the placenta grows into the wall of the uterus making separation without hemorrhage difficult.  The more controllable cause would be overactive manipulation of the cord/placenta by the delivering doctor.  If the cord is pulled on too hard it may break or the placenta may tear.  There are also associated problems with uterine prolapse from pulling too hard on the cord.  These causes are unlikely to recur.  Unfortunately, this is about where my knowledge of this issue ends.  Regarding your doctor, I would discuss the issues with him/her and if your doctor is not comfortable I would try simply requesting an opinion from a high risk obstetrician.  At that point, if your doctor refuses I suggest you continue to talk with him and see if there is a reason for the refusal.  Most doctors are very willing to send a patient to another doctor if it means the patient will get safer, more specialized care.  Sorry I can't be of more help.  Perhaps some of my colleagues may be able to help more.  Best wishes.  Let us know if we can be of any other help to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I'm a 21 year old female who has been seeing the Ob-Gyn since I was 18. I am not sure what \"normal\" vaginal dishcarge is, but I feel that mine is not normal. I have asked my doctor to examine me, and she says I am healthy. The discharge has an unpleasant odor to it and can range from being white/cloudy to even yellowish. It sometimes is  thick and stingy while can also be watery. It is very uncomfortable and makes me self-conscious sometimes. Often times I will just wear a tampon to help soak up the discharge to avoid the smell. Sometimes I can notice it outside my clothes. Should I get another opinion from the obgyn or is this normal? If it is...it stinks! HELP! I am not sexually active.\n\n",

    "content": "The amount of vaginal discharge that is \"normal\" can vary from woman to woman.  Aditionally, cervical/vaginal mucous can change through out the monthly cycle to be more watery vs. thicker.  Typically, however, \"normal\" vaginal discharge is not malodorous.  Excessive discharge that has a bad odor can be a sign of a yeast infection, bacterial vaginosis, or another infection.  These can be tested for by doing a microscopic evaluation of the discharge to look for yeast or excess bacteria.  As you are not sexually active, STD's such as chlamydia and gonorhea are essentially ruled out.  Any sexual contact can put you at risk for acquiring an STD, however; so if you have had any chance of being exposed I would recommend being evaluated for these as well.  I would suggest following up with your gynecologist for reevaluation.  If your doctor is in agreement it may be worthwhile to try an emperic treatment for a yeast infection since they are so common.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A pregnancy test is a test that examine for a hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) that is positive when women are pregnant. The test can be done using blood or urine sample. However, a blood test scan tell if the woman is pregnant or not few days (6-8 days) from ovulation and fertilization. The test can gives a clear answer for pregnancy, as well as an idea about the pregnancy duration in weeks by a quantitative analysis.  Testing for urine on the other hand, is better done one week after a missed period. One negative result (especially soon after a missed period) is not enough to exclude pregnancy and the test should be repeated there after or blood test is done. Some antibiotics and contraceptive pills interfere with the test and should be avoided.  The symptoms you have described although do occur in pregnancy, they are not specific and may occur due to several other causes even in stressed female. In addition too, spotting regularly for two days on monthly basis is less commonly seen in pregnant women, but may be caused by menstrual irregularities caused by the contraception pills.  You may either do a blood test or repeat your urine test as mentioned before.  Hope this information is useful.\n\n",

We haven't officially \"tried\" to conceive yet, but we're just talking..  The thing is I want to have twins,  but I don't even know if it's possible.  Here's a little briefing:  From my mother's side, there's no history of twins (except for her mother's sister's daughter who had twins).. And on my dad's side, there's 2 uncles and 1 aunt (out of 8 uncles and aunts) who have twins. ( One of these uncles with twins is married to my husband's dad's sister)   My husband has 9 other brothers and sisters (woww, i know!), and none of them have twins.  But his mother's mother had quadruplets but they all died at birth.. By the way, my dad's mom and my husband's dad's mom were sisters..  I bet to the reader this all sounds crazy! lol  So i just want to know, what are the odds that we have twins in the event we decide to conceive? And if both my husband and I don't have any fertility problems, can I still take pills to have twins?\n\n",

    "content": "The incidence of twin births has been increasing over the past several years.  In 1987 the incidence was reported at about 9 in 1000 births.  In 2003 the number had increased to about 17 in 1000 births (Australian data).    There are several factors that have probably contributed to this.  In particular, the use of fertility medications.    Really, there isn't much you can do to increase your chances of having twins.  It is possible for you, even if no one in your family has had twins before.  The rate is about 1% of all pregnancies that will result in twins.  So, if you become pregnant there is about a 1 in 100 chance you'll have twins, roughly.    Interestingly, we've also seen that taking folic acid supplementation leads to an increased risk of twins as well.  We now recommend that all women take folic acid if they are trying to conceive and throughout the pregnancy to help decrease the risk of neural tube defects.  Twin incidence also increase with increasing number of pregnancies (I.e. with each subsequent pregnancy the chances go up very slightly).  Best wishes to you and your husband on starting a family if you choose.  One word about the fertility drugs.  While they do increase the chances of multiple gestations (twins or even more), there are some pretty nasty side effects.  While I'm a pediatrician, not an obstetrician, I suspect that it would be difficult to find an OB that would be willing to prescribe them to help with conceiving twins.  They are generally reserved for couples that are having difficulty conceiving.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Most of the teratogenic effect of drugs occur if they are taken during the first trimester. I am sure that your Doctor is aware of the drugs he is prescribing to you while you are in the last trimester, so you do not have to be stressed.  The following information may be helpful to give you an idea about the safety of the drugs you received in this period on your fetus.  According to the FDA: Bactrim is considered as a pregnancy category C which  means it is not known to be of harm on the fetus, but its effect on folic acid  which is important for the fetal development. Thus it should be given according to the physician prescription in conditions which necessitate its use.  Augmentin is considered a drug category B., which means its is not supposed to be harmful to the baby.  Hycodan Tablets is not known whether it can or it can not cause harm to the fetus and is not recommended be many to be used during pregnancy.  Keep in mind that the risk of most of drugs to cause harm to the fetus is mainly during the first trimester.  Follow up with your Doctor is essential. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Colds during pregnancy are not particularly dangerous.  There are a few viruses that can be quite serious in pregnancy, such as the chickenpox and CMV.  Most viruses, however, are really just an ill-timed annoyance.  It's good to let your OB know about any illness that you have during your pregnancy so they are fully aware of any issues that might arise.  Fevers that typically go along with colds (101-102) are safe for your baby.  Some studies have shown an increased risk of birth defects if fevers above 102 are sustained for more than about a day in the first trimester.  Studies have also shown that after about 16 weeks the risk of high fevers goes down.  If you are having high fevers (upper 103's or above) it's probably a good idea to let your OB know just for caution's sake.  Treating a viral cold during pregnancy can be a bit tricky.  Tylenol is safe.  Beyond that, you have to be a bit careful.  Many cold medicines contain 3-4 different medications and not all may be safe during pregnancy.  Remember that any medication that contains a non-steroidal antiinflammatory (such as aspirin or ibuprofen) should not be taken.  A good resource is to talk with your local pharmacist if you are needing an over-the-counter cold medicine.  That way you can verify each medicine individually to make sure it is safe.  Also, if you ask your OB chances are she has a list of medicines she considers safe that you can have.  Above all, the best thing to help you get better is rest.  Drink plenty of fluids-all the old home remedies that make you feel better.  Hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

    "content": "t Hi Debbie,  These contractions start very early in pregnancy, most women do not really notice them until the second half of their pregnancy. These usually mild contractions are thought to play a part in toning the uterine muscles and promoting the flow of blood to the placenta.  Braxton-Hicks contractions can be triggered when you (or your baby) move or when your belly is touched. They may also occur when you are dehydrated. Each Braxton-Hicks contraction may last one to two minutes. During this time, the whole uterus becomes hard. This may feel strange and sometimes uncomfortable.  What distinguishes these contractions from real labor? When you are in labor, contractions last longer, occur more frequently, and become progressively stronger. However, Braxton-Hicks contractions come and go and may go away altogether if you change your activity (for example, rest or take a walk). Drinking a couple glasses of water may also help. If you are having difficulty distinguishing between Braxton-Hicks contractions and those of real labor, it\u2019s important to contact your health   Take Care, and Best of Luck to you  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "content": "First, I'd check with your doctor to confirm that you have Rh E antibody and not Rh D, which is more common and has more treatment options available. Rh E antibody is a special marker that is sometimes found on red blood cells. It's fairly rare, but it's important to know about it because your doctor will want to monitor your unborn baby more closely.   It's difficult to say how you got this antibody, but it's more commonly found in women that have had prior pregnancies and also in women who have received blood transfusions in the past.   The antibody poses no harm to you directly. However, the concern is that this antibody in your bloodstream might attack and destroy the blood of the unborn baby. This process is called hemolytic anemia and can be extremely harmful to the baby.     The baby must be followed closely with specialized tests to watch for signs of hemolytic anemia. Most likely, your doctor will order additional ultrasounds and perhaps amniocentesis to check the amniotic fluid for signs of hemolytic anemia. If the baby begins to show signs of hemolytic anemia, certain treatment options are available. In some cases, the baby may be given a blood transfusion while still in your uterus. In other situations, the baby may be delivered earlier than the original due date so that it can receive necessary medical treatment in the nursery.   The best thing you can do is to educate yourself about this condition, (like you are doing!) and work closely with your doctor to assure that you and your baby receive the best medical care possible.   It is very important to communicate with your Doctor your concerns and have him/her answer your questions before you leave the office. Your Doctor is most qualified in narrowing down what his suspicion is or what type of antibody disorder he thinks it may be.  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

I have not had any signs of pregnancy like I did with my daughter, and yet I am having some signs as if my period was about to start.  Like the slight cramps and tenderness in breast.  I took a pregnancy test and it came back inacurate.  There is history of cysts and hystorectomies in my family.  We have just gone through a time here that was slightly stressful.  Could this cause they symptoms and causes of my period or lack there of?\n\n",

    "content": "When a woman of childbearing age has a delayed or absent period, pregnancy should be the first thought.  Home pregnancy tests are good, but should always be confirmed by a blood test if positive or if negative and suspicion still exists.  In your case, having a tubal ligation makes pregnancy much less likely-but it has happened before.  In the absense of pregnancy, there are several other causes of delayed menses.  It is not uncommon for women to occasionally miss a cycle, then return to normal cycles after this.  Also, stress can delay menses.  This includes \"good\" stress.    Early menopause is also possible.  If you are having other symptoms of menopause you should discuss this with your doctor.  Large amounts of exercise can also delay menses.    Most commonly this is a benign thing.  If your menses don't start in the next few days you may consider having your doctor evaluate you just to make sure that there is nothing more serious.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Absolutely ,Exercise, diet and stress can delay the onset of menstruation or alter cycles once they've been established.  Some women also have very light bleeding, or spotting, during ovulation.  . (Stress or other problems can sometimes cause a cycle to be shorter or longer.) .   Some women feel a period coming days before they get it.  both physically and emotionally. The menstrual cycle has its ups and downs of hormones, and different people react differently to hormonal swings. Just before and during menstruation, levels of the female hormones estrogen and progesterone are low. That's when some women feel bloated, irritable or blue, or \"just crummy.\" Just crummy might mean cramps, sore breasts, backache, headache, nausea, and feeling tired.   An over the counter pregnancy test is not as effective in detecting the pregnancy hormone found in the urine when contraceptive is being used it tends to give a false/positive result. I suggest that if you do not have your period within the next 7 days see your physcian and have a blood test done to rule out pregnancy, if blood test is negative then your body is triing to stabilize your hormones with the given stress.  Good Luck Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "content": "Endometriosis can have a significant impact on the ability to get pregnant.  It can also have an impact on the menstrual cycle if severe enough.    As for being able to get pregnant without a period, it is possible but given your situation less likely.  What would essentially happen is that ovulation would occur and if the egg was not fertilized, a period would ensue.  However, if during the random cycle that did result in ovulation also resulted in fertilization, the embryo may successfully implant and suppress the period that would have occurred.  In someone who has had absent periods for a long time, it is most likely that ovulation is not occurring, making pregnancy not possible.  Simply not having a period for several months does not, however, guarantee that ovulation will not occur with the next cycle so pregnancy cannot necessarily be considered impossible.  I would recommend talking with your OB if you are trying to get pregnant.  There are treatments for endometriosis that can help increase the odds of pregnancy.  Also, you'll want to find out why you are not having regular periods as this may impact your ability to conceive.    Hope this helps.\n\n",

As such, there should anatomically be no way for pregnancy to occur as the sperm cannot reach any eggs that are released.  It should be virtually impossible to become pregnant for you.  That being said, ectopic pregnancy is a serious matter.  So if you are concerned about the possibility of an ectopic pregnancy I recommend urgent evaluation to rule this out.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Progesterone is actually a pro-gestational hormone.  Women who have a history of miscarriages are often prescribed progesterone to take during the first trimester to support the pregnancy.  However, high doses can cause problems.  With one single dose  you are probably going to be fine.  It's a good idea to let your obstetrician know anyway, so she can be watching for any complications.  Also, I'd recommend putting the two pill in different rooms. :)  Hope this helps.\n\n",

Keep in mind that, Breast feeding impairs the return of ovulation and most of women breast feed (no supplementation) might get their period every three weeks, every six months, or without periods for many months.   This is due to the fact that the pituitary gland makes more prolactin, a substance which suppresses ovarian function and causes your breast to enlarge, be tender and sore.  A Pap smear is done during the pre-natal care and showes no risk to the fetus.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. He can advise you to go for hormone analysis and abdominal US if needed.

    "content": "Generally most pregnancy tests are positive at 5 weeks.  This is when most women decide their period is late and do the test.  There are several pregnancy tests now that are able to detect pregnancy earlier, but generally they still won't be definitely accurate until 2-3 days before your period would normally start.  2-3 weeks is probably too early for most tests, so a negative test result should be repeated if there is suspicion of pregnancy.  Ovulation is generally about 14 days from the start of your period.  Fertilization may not occur for another few days.  By about 3 weeks, the new baby is just barely getting a foothold and hasn't really had time to begin making enough HCg to turn a test positive.  Also, the first AM void is more likely to be positive than at other times as the urine is generally more concentrated.  Best wishes for your new family.\n\n",

Few of these organisms normally lives in the vagina and tends to grow out of control once the immune system is down.  During pregnancy and menstruation there is a higher risk for yeast infections.  Some doctors advise women to apply natural yogurt to the vagina daily as it helps in controlling the acidity of the vagina to a level that does not a low Candida growth. Douches are not recommended by many doctors as they can increase your risk of yeast infections and some says never to use them especially during pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Fallopian tubes help eggs to move from the ovary to the uterus each cycle (month). Tubal ligation is a procedure done for women who chose not to become pregnant (permanently). There are different surgical procedures that are used to achieve this purpose like cauterization and tying (clips). Failure rates are reported in some cases and pregnancy could occur  in 1 out of 200 women. Causes of tubal ligation failure may include: incomplete closure of the tubes, slipping out of the tying clips. Reversal procedures of tubal ligation are also available and only specialists can advise which is more convenient if any is possible. However, attention should be paid to exclude ectopic (tubal) pregnancy if pregnancy occurs after a tubal ligation due to an increased risk from the damaged tubes.\n\n",

    "content": "I had an emergency c-section with my first child (6/00).  I had an elective c-section with my second child (7/03).  We are thinking of having a third child and I worry about having too many c-sections.  I do not really want to have a vaginal delivery (I am afraid of uterine rupture  - and the birth itself).  I am wondering if a third c-section is safe (aside from the usual risks).  Would this be a better option over a VBAC since I have already had 2 surgical deliveries?  A vaginal delivery scares me immensly and I think it would impair my labor if I chose a VBAC... but I am not 100% opposed to it.  (This would be our last child).    My first c-section was due to failure to progress (I was induced & went from 1 to 3cm and back down to 1cm after 14 hrs of labor), meconimum aspiration, and irregular heart beat in my son.  I have a fibroid or two around 3cm (thought I would mention it incase it is relevent to your reply).  I also get ovarian cysts monthly (some up to 7cm)... so I may even have trouble conceiving.      I am 35 (36 in Feb).  Past surgeries include appendectomy (1981) and the c/s listed above.  No meds.      Thanks for any insight you can provide!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi spensaid0003, It would be very difficult to actually assign a \"number\" as being safe. This depends on many factors, the woman's health, what type of incision was made in the past, etc. A C-section is of course a major abdominal surgery, which pose a risk of complications in itself. The more often this surgery is performed, the greater the risk of uterine rupture. Your physician who knows your history etc. would be the most reliable person to answer whether your health and your own personal situation would warrant the risk. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Anyway, in my residency (surgery) and med school, there were some women who had previous c-sections and deliverd vaginally with no problems.    I don't understand all of the decision making, obviously rupture of the uterus and health of the baby are prime considerations.  I don't know if there is a number as Teresa said.  If you are reasonably good health, your uterus is healthy (not too much scar tissue), and the nature of the previous incision--vertical/horizontal.  ALl of these factors play a role and this is the turf for a skilled ob/gyn.  I would talk to your doctor, and trust him or her to guide you.  Worrying about it will only cause undue stress and pressure on you.  I wish I could just say a number to make you feel better, but one woman might only be able to have one, and another 5.  Its so complex.  Best wishes to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor,  I am a 30 yr old female with PCOS ,who is 5weeks pregnant. I achieved pregnancy using Clomid on days 5-9, I became pregnant after just one cycle. I am also taking PrimaOne Care prenatals.  On Monday by doctor drew blood to test my hcg and progesterone levles, she later commented that my progesterone was good (did not mention the value) and that my Hcg was 151.5 (I was 4wks 4days pregnant) Then two days later, on Wed. my doctor tested my progestrone and Hcg again. This time my Hcg was 418 and my Progesterone was 35. My doctor commented to me that my progesterone was lower than on Monday (again, I don't know the value, I didnt ask). She wants me to come in next Wed. to test again.  I am concerened that my drop in progesterone signals a potential impending miscarriage. While I know 35 is still well within the normal range, I have read that a drop in any level signifies a bad pregnancy and impending miscarriage.  Do levels generally fluctuate, because my doctor commented that I should not worry and that it might be a \"lab fluctuation\". Can you explain what that might mean? Also is there any chance my levels will go back up on there own or is it more likely to continue falling?  I would like to avoid taking Progesterone supplements because I have read that they have not been proven to succesfully prevent miscarriage and can actually cause birth defects.    Since this is my first pregnancy, I am obviously very upset by this information, any information you can provide me with would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Everything went back to normal and well, about a week and a half before my period was due, I noticed I was leaking both milk AND colostrum. Which, I quit breastfeeding 7 months ago and had dried up. I am now 5 days late for my period. I took a bunch of hpts, 3 showed a line and/or faint lines and the last couple were barely visible.  I'm on effexor,150mg, seroquil 50mg ambien 10mg and zelnorm 6mg.  I have a bunch of symptoms, but I thought that when you're pregnant the lines get darker on the hpt's, not lighter.and if I'm not, how come I'm making milk again. I don;t think it could be my medications as I've been on them for a while and this has never happened and my ob said that nuva shouldnt cause it. I go in tuesday for a blood test. any kinda advice would be wonderful... anything i can do in the meantime... I'm not sure what the heck is going on with my body!!! Help? :) thanks so much!\n\n",

    "content": "I have two children but I had to have a hysterectomy in 2000.  For the past week or so I've had feelings in my lower abdomen that feel exactly like the movements you would feel in the 15th or 16th weeks of pregnancy.  They are sporadic and strong enough that my husband has been able to feel them.  I have gained about 15 pounds in the last 3 months or so.  I feel like I tire easily as well.  I have not been nauseated as I was with my second child, but I was not nauseated at all with my first child.    I feel like I'm crazy for even thinking that I could be pregnant, but other than when I was pregnant for my two children, I've never felt these things before.  I took a home pregnancy test that came back negative.  I've done some research and while pregnancy post-hysterectomy is not unheard of, it is extremely rare.  Since the possibility of being pregnant is highly unlikely, is there any other medical condition that could explain these symptoms?  Should I explore the pregnancy possibility any further by scheduling an appointment with my doctor or does the negative pregnancy test totally rule out that possibility?  I do not think this could be something psychosomatic because my husband and I do not even want more children, so it's not been an unfulfilled dream.  Any advice or education you could provide would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you for providing this service to those of us with questions.\n\n",

Diarrhea may be related to, for example, certain illnesses, diet, etc. In late pregnancy this may occur in the short time frame before delivery. Diarrhea that lasts more than a short time, or accompanied by other symptoms, should be reported to your physician as dehydration may occur. I hope that the rest of your pregnancy and delivery went well. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Flashercar, Get out the Charmin!  Yes in general castor oil in safe to take in  a small dose to induce diarrhea.  It is often \"the midwives recipe\" for labor induction.  BUT and this is one BIG BUT it will probably not work if you have not had any dialation yet and if your cervix is still on the thick side meaning if they told you on your last visit for example that you were say 1cm and 50% effaced for example.  All this product will do is make for a very unpleasent experince. If you do try and do it anyway PLEASE drink alot of water and some juice while the pocess is happening.  You can have several loose stools and you do not want to dehyrate.  You state in your post that you have protien in your urine so in general in your case I would not reccomend doing anything without your OBs permission.  He/she may already may have a plan for you.  I would stay on bedrest on your left side and follow what they have told you to do exactly until your next visit.  I understand your despreate but your baby will be here soon.  GOOD LUCK!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lucky5, OK you ask a tough question becuse it varies so widely for so many women that you probably will find my answer kind of well not much better that any book you may have picked up.  So here it is anywhere from 2 pushes to 4 hrs of pushing.  The variables are if a woman has an epidural and at what point she starts to push, how high the baby is in her birth cananl, how good of a pusher she is, how much urge she has to push, is this her first baby.  Is the baby in a \"OA\" position meaning looking at the floor when the head comes out or \"OP\" postion looking at the sky or often reffered to as \"sunny side up\" this postion takes much longer and a wider pelvis to accomplish a vaginal delivery. The rule of thumb is 2 hrs for first baby and 20min - 1 hr for any baby after that.  Again in the day of epidurals and what I see when I go to work and a Labor RN this is so not the case with something called fully and waiting.  When a mother becomes completely dialated she will wait until the urge to push is very strong which often times is when the babies head is very low in the birth canal so it often will take someone who has had a baby less than 20 min and  a first time mom no more than 2 hrs. As far holding a push for so mamy seconds your labor nurse will insruct you on how to push, but I do not count with my women.  I have them push three times with each contraction holding each push for as long as they can taking a big breath in between each push.  Almost like diving under water and coming up for the next breath of air before diving again.  OH and by the way if your girlfreinds have told you it feels like your having the biggest BM of your life, they are right.  Best of luck!!\n\n",

    "content": "thank you for responding to that question.  My baby had an extremely long shoulder dystocia and I pushed as hard as I could.  I looked over the fetal strip and my pushes were only 10-12 seconds long for each push. His head came out after second push.  After that it was a many many pushes of 10- 12 seconds.  That was even putting everything I had into it.  Are all pushes done in 1 contraction considered separate pushes or do you add together the 3or 4 pushes together and consider it one? He was my 3rd baby.  I go over everything over and over.  How long can a baby handle restricted oxygen flow without neurological damage?  After the head is out is it possible for the fetal monitor to pick up the baby's heart rate or just the mothers since the head is already out?  His heart rate was very high during the time he was stuck so I thought maybe that was my heartrate being picked up from the extreme pushing.   Thank you for taking the time to respond to my post.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lucky5, So sorry for that very very scary ending to your delivery.  It is one of the worst things that happens in obstetrics because there is just no way to predict it at all.  It happens in all size babies and to first time moms or moms giving birth to their fifth baby as in your case with your third. I have a few questions for you, How long was the dystocia? and How much of an effort did it take the team to get your baby to breath after he was born?  What was his apgars?  There is really no way to know how your baby dealt with his hypoxia but newborns are amazing at what they can handle. It is most likely that your baby will be fine. You are right in thinking that it was you heart rate being picked up on the monitor unless there was an internal lead placed on the babies head at some point during the labor.  This is someting you would have known about before hand and not a procedure done after the head was out.  Listen,  after a shoulder dystocia is diagnosed by the labor staff all hell breaks loose.  This is an obstestrical EMERGENCY,  there is no more pushing with contractions it just becomes PUSH!  There is no more monitoring of the heart rate of the baby.  We do not care because if we do not get the baby out in a timely manor we already know the heart rate will not be good so again it is just keep pushing from you and the doctor just keeps trying different manuveurs as  the nurse pulls your legs back to open your pelvis and screams at you to push.  I am sure you remember the air in the room change from calm to high tension and anxiety. Please tell me how your baby is now.  I understand how worried you are about him and will probably be watching for every milestone to be reached as would if he were my own.  I hope my answers give you some relief.  Please remember that most babies get through these events without a scratch.  I will hope the same for your baby.\n\n",

    "content": "The total length of time of the start of pushing was 9 minutes.  OUr baby's head came out after the 2nd push which was quick.  So he was stuck the remainder of the time.   They used 2 manuevers over and over, Mcroberts and suprapubic pressure.  He had very respiratory effort and required mechanical suction then bagged oxygen which he responded to.  His apgar was a 7 and 8.  I do not think that is completely accurate only because he was given a 2 for respiratory even though he needed assistance and did not cry on own. He did not cry at all even after oxygen.  He arm did not move after the delivery.  I am crying as I write this, he cannot speak we use sign language, and wears an AFO on leg to give him support,  he has struggled with breathing, feeding and swallowing since birth.  His arm is weak and is functional by use of different muscle groups.  I spent everyday going through everything that occurred and wish I could go back and insist he had more testing after birth, but I didn't know.\n\n",

    "content": "lucky5, I am so sorry and again there just no way to know what babies will get trough an event like a shoulder dystocia fully intact and what babies will not.  I am so sorry that your son is now suffering from birth injuries as a result.  I hope that you are in contact with other parents who have been through the same ordeal so you can walk through this journey with others that truely understand your pain.  Apgars will often not tell us the long term outcome of an infant but it often can tell us in what amount of distress the baby was prior to being born and how much researve was left.  If sounds like it took very little effort to get your son to breath on his own, babies do not have to cry to meet this criteria they just have to breath.  In this case though the apagars really told you nothing on how well he would do in his future.  Like wise with the baby I have seen with the 4-7-9 apgar at 1-5-10 min of life who is now a thriving little boy.   There is only a few tests at birth they could have done like sleep EEGs and maybe a CAT scan or MRI but they may have told you little more than you know now or maybe nothing more I am not even sure of this.  Often times only time will tell what a childs full potentail will be.  You have to be tough Mom and fight for this child and get him the services he needs and DO NOT let anybody tell you he can't when you know he can.  Remember not to forget yourself you need time of solice and peace.  I hope you see that you made NO mistakes back then and there was NOTHING you could have done to change the outcome of his birth.  Good luck to you and your family.   Tracy\n\n",

The  few other parents are dealing with 1-2 minute dystocia's affecting the arm.  I keep going over  the 9 minutes of fetal strips to see what went wrong.  They said the fetal strips showed no sign of distress when his head was out, but I know that could not have been his heartrate because the straps at that point were up by his feet and I was pushing.  The strips show a heartrate starting at 150 before head came out to 170-180 after head came out staying around that for the entire dystocia.  He was born stunned.  I have no idea what that means. I keep going over that last 9 minutes to see why it took so long.  Asking myself if I could have pushed longer?  Calculating the exact minutes from the time his head came out.  Why he was not under close observation after 8-9 min of restricted oxygen?  Asking why he was stiff and accepting being told that some babies do that.   I should have thought of all of this and been more insistent and not excepting he will be fine.  I was not aggressive enough because I wanted to believe he would be okay.  I am having a difficult time with the whole situation.  I was very strong before seeing what my son goes through everyday.  Do you know where I could find someone that would look those 9 minutes and tell me at what point he was not hanging on?  Do you know of other parents that I could talk to that went through a similiar trauma?  Thank you for taking so much time responding to my situation.  Mary\n\n",

All those feelings of guilt, anger, and sadness that you feel every day will not get better if you focus on your sons delivery.  What you need to do now is push on and fight for his future.  If you google a search for say cerebral palsy support you may be able to find a support group in your area.  They may not be parents specific to kids that suffered from shoulder dystocia but they are parents of kids that are suffering from delays like the ones you describe.  You can learn so much from other parents as well as teaching other parents about what you have gone through and the things you have learned through your journey.  These are the things that will make you stronger.  We do not know why some babies can go through a mild oxygen deprevation say and suffer from delays while others go through other birth events where hypoxia was several minutes long and be just fine.  We wonder this all the time in OB medicine.  This is what makes this job very difficult sometimes and also why c-sections are becoming so common these days.  I do not know if there were mistakes made in your case but I do know that as far as you are concerned there is just nothing and I mean nothing you could have done to change it.

The difficult part of this situation is that we do know that our son is a result of a mismanaged shoulder dystocia and that it should not have happened.  Many other manuevers should have been attempted, but weren't.  I put my faith in the doctors and they failed my child.  But makes it worse is that he did not get the proper care and observation he deserved because of what ocurred.  All of this time I blamed myself for not being  prepared for a shoulder dystocia so that I would have known what could of and should of been done, but the truth is , I never heard of it until it happened to me.  I know now that I could not have done anything more than push with all I had.  I cannot make up for what happened and all the doctors who did not assess him properly once they saw shoulder dystocia on his records, but I will be more aggressive with his therapies and continue to work with as much as I can  so that he can be as functional as possible.  I am thanking you for the reassurance that I myself could not have changed what had happened.  I am now going to focus on fighting for his future with all that I can. The first thing I am going to do is re arrange his therpies so that my children and I can have a few days to have fun and enjoy our time together. I cannot thank you enough for  the support, encouragement and advice you have given me.  Thank you for your help.  Mary\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Mickapoo, Unless there you are expecting anything less than a normal outcome for you and your baby than there should be no need for all of those people to be present at your delivery.  It is your labor and your delivery and you should you speak to your nurse upon your arrival to the hospital if not before.  I would call the nurse manger of the unit and discuss it with her because it may be that the resp. therapist and nursery nurse only come in a case when needed and when needed you of course would want them there.  But in any other case you would want your newborn handed to YOU after YOU have delivered it. I am a labor nurse on a very busy labor unit and we have 2 labor RNs and a MD or CNM attending our deliveries and only invite the special nursery care staff in when needed.  This may be the case at this hospital as well and if not you go ahead and demand that.  What you are asking is not unreasonable AT ALL!! GOOD LUCK!!!  and the best to you and your family.\n\n",

    "content": "Ok so I am 39 weeks pregnant and my family and friends want me to deliver at the hospital closer to us.  I am on medicaid and all doctors near me that accept it were no longer accepting new patients so I ended up having to go to a near by city.  The hospital that my doctor delivers at is 45 minutes away with no traffic and the one in my city is 25 minutes no traffic.  My daughters doctor also uses the hospital closer and I would like both of my children to have the same doctor.  Is it mean to ditch the doctor I have been going to all this time by going to the hospital in my city instead of the one he delivers at?  I mean he has been my doctor for about 5 months now and he still doesn't know me by name without looking at the charts and I don't really mind who delivers me, in fact I have heard more good things about the hospital near my home and their doctors in labor and delivery than about the other. What should I do?  Will my doctor get less from medicaid because he didn't deliver?\n\n",

If you feel comfortable with changing to another physician, then there should not be any reason not to do so, but the decision has to be yours, not someone elses. As for payment, the offices typically bill for weekly/monthly office visits and labor and delivery is usually billed when that service is provided. It would be the same, for example, if you were out of town, and delivered, whomever provided those services would be the one to receive payment. Just make sure that you have an available physician for your obstetric care. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I had normal menstral cycles from July - Oct but since November m cycles have been the normal 27 days apart but are only lasting for no more than 5 days. (Nov x 2 days, Dec x 4 days, Jan x 5 days).  This month my period was 6 days late.  It arrived on 2/17 with very severe cramping and nausea and by the third day had slowed to practically nothing.  Prior to getting my period this month i had a big breakout on my face and neck, i was getting nauseous, i was very moody, and was very bloated.  My cervial mucous, which is supposed to be a good sign when one is ovulating is the same at all points in my cycle.  It is an off whiteish color and is not very thick.  I never see the egg white  looking mucous.  Is that a sign that something is wrong?  Also i had an abortion when i was 21, would that have anything to do with our difficulties.  When i was on the pill my cycles were always normal.  They came every month, on time, and lasted the normal 5 days.  Should i be concerned?  Is there something my doctors should be looking into?\n\n",

I had a perfectly healthy pregnancy and had my baby 4 months ago.  I have never had any symptoms that are related or show any signs of SLE. Overall I am very healthy.  My doctor's face of  concern haunts me when he asked if I wanted any more children.  I guess my question is,  are the odds high that I would not carry a baby full term even having a history of now problems and a perfectly healthy and easy pregnancy.  Or do blood test results hold a bigger weight in reality.  My brother has Lupus if that info helps to answer my question.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Jelvibean, Here is the deal, as with any systemic disease and pregnancy it has a chance of getting worse, getting better or staying the same.  Women with SLE also are at greater risk for pre-term labor and delivery as well as miscarriage.  You will most certianly have to speak to a MD about this but I do not believe the risk are that much higher than the general population unless you test postive for the anticardiolipin antibody and if you do it can be treated with baby asprin and other blood thinning meds. I would say when you are planning to have another baby you should seek out a specialist in SLE and have all of you questions answered.  SInce you have yet to display and of the symptoms of lupus who is to say you even have it. Good Luck!!\n\n",

I have been test for gallbladder problems...negative and my doctor did blood work to make sure it was not HELLP again but only after my husband insisted.  My blood work was negative.  Is it possible that I have HELLP without all of the other symptoms?  My doctor tells me that it is probably just the baby and it is normal, but I do not think it is normal pain at all.  I feel like she has no concern.  If I do have HELLP is their something I could be doing right now to prolong delivery?  Thanks for your help!\n\n",

Ask your doctor about a thing called round ligament pain, its very sore and happens when baby rests on or near a ligament. Had quite a lot of pain myself during last pregnancy and remember that since your last pregnancy you are 8 yrs older, not as young and probably not as fit!!! you'll feel it more.,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Tshoemake, I just wanted to add a few things here.  First off I understand why you are so worried.  HELLP syndrome is a very scary thing and I can see why you would not want to live through that experience again.  I just wanted to interject a idea regarding your pain in your right upper abd. that comes and goes.  You state that your gallbladder tests where neg. but this does not mean that you do not have gall bladder disease.  Often test for those types of thing can show nothing but indead there is something.  What someone like you could do is start to keep a food diary and see if your \"attacks\" are associated with any types of foods that you eat.  Then you can bring this to you doctor and he can help you sort through this.   As far as prolonging a pregnancy with HELLP syndrome.  If you truely had HELLP you would NOT want to prolong the pregnancy.  There are only a few rare instances in which a baby is safer out of the womb at 29 weeks rather than in.  HELLP is life threating to the Mom and the only cure is delivery.  Because of this your baby is at risk as well.  Of course this is very complicated and has varying degrees before it gets to the HELLP part of the disease.  You may have only very mild elevation of a particular lab or blood pressure that if you keep youself qiuet and on bed rest you may buy you self several weeks at home or in the hospital under close observation of your OBs.  Each case varies greatly as with each MD. Hope this helps a bit and I hope you find yourself happy and well.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The causes of absence of menstruation for less than 3 cycles are similar to the causes of amenorrhea (cessation of menses), with the exception of anatomic or chromosomal etiologies. Hypothalamic, pituitary, or ovarian hormonal dysfunction is less severe or of shorter duration than with amenorrhea.[1]   Causes in general include pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy (especially if you have had a tubal ligation), use of hormonal birth control methods (such as birth control pills or hormonal injections or implants), recently stopping birth control pills or breast-feeding.   Other causes such as rapid weight loss, obesity, excessive exercise or participation in endurance sports, menopause, severe stress or lifestyle change, use of certain medications and hormone imbalance.   Other, more serious causes of missed periods include tumors, pituitary disorders, and other glandular problems involving the ovaries, thyroid, or adrenal glands. These problems are rare.  Usually if the period is late and the woman is not pregnant, the cause is hormonal--she is not ovulating regularly for some reason. Weight changes and stress levels can disrupt the menstrual cycle; so can being peri-menopausal, taking some medications, and engaging in heavy exercise.  References: ========== 1. Jonathan S.

    "content": "You cannot have a period and be pregnant. let me explain why.  Typically, a womans cycle is a month long. Around day 14 of her cycle, ovulation occurs. Meaning, she releases an egg for fertilization. This egg lasts only for about 2 days, and sperm can live in the body for about 5 days, so the week before ovulation occurs can be a fertile time. The next 2 weeks of a womans cycle her body is preparing for pregnancy, assuming that the egg was fertilized. The lining of the uterous thickens, preparing itsellf for implantation of the fertilized egg.   If no fertilization occurs, at the end of the cycle, a woman has her period. The bleeding is caused by the shedding of that thickened lining, because it no longer needs to be thick, because there was no egg implantation.   If however, fertilization occurs, and pregnancy happens, the lining of the uterous stays thick, and implantation of the egg occurs. Since the lining did not need to shed, there is no period.  However, sometimes women experience bleeding during  early pregnancy that they mistake for a period. Generally however, if a women is pregnant and does have bleeding, it is much lighter than a normal period, and does not last as long.  If you suspect pregnancy, the first step shoudl be a pregnancy test, and if you get a negative result, followed by a period, it is very safe to assume that pregnancy did not occur, and you are safe. If a pregnancy test is a positive result, and a period still occurs, then you shoudl see a doctor to confirm that you got an accurate test result, and confirm the source of the bleeding.   So the short answer is, no, a woman cannot have a normal period and still be pregnant, but some pregnant women can experience bleeding that is indistinguishable from a period.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 20, I have 2 children, ages 3 and 9 months.  I've hod 2 miscarriages, 13w and 15w.  I've been dignosed with homozygous MTHFR and Anitcardiolipin Antibodies.  I've had 3 D&C's, 2 for my m/c's and 1 after the birth of my daughter for retained placenta and possible placenta increta.  I hemorrhaged at 4wks post-partum, had the D&C and was relatively well.  My periods were lighter, 1-4 days of light bleeding and up to 4 days of spotting.  I recently discovered that I'm pregnant again, as of now I'm 5w1d.  My beta was 868 at 19dpo, had another draw at 21dpo but don't know the results yet.  I'm really worried about an ectopic pregnancy.  Yesterday, 5w, I had some cramping, lasted for 7 1/2 hrs and then had pink spotting 5 hrs after the cramping stopped.  I've been having some pain in my side, by my hip bone and down a bit lower, like right above my pubic bone on the right side, as well, only on 1 side.  It's kind of a burning pain, but not when moving it's mostly just when I'm sitting around.  My doctor isn't really concerned, won't give me an ultrasound til I'm 7w.  I have an appt tomorrow and plan to ask about the cramping and spotting then, but in the meantime I'm looking for answers.  What should I be asking my doctor to do?  Sorry this is so long.  Thanks for any help.  Jennifer\n\n",

    "content": "Does your doctor know about the cramping and the spotting?  As you said just stress on the cramping episode and the spotting. During his assessment he will be able to determine the best course of action. The problem with ultrasounds is at 5 weeks they may or may not detect the gestational sac (the first structure the ultrasound detects).  On the other hand, the usefulness of transvaginal ultrasound (TVUS) evaluation when the hCG is less than 1000 mIU/mL has been debated. One study showed that TVUS can still be useful with an hCG level of less than 1000 mIU/mL. In this study, approximately 13% of the abnormal intrauterine pregnancies and 39% of the ectopic pregnancies were identified by TVUS. US should not be delayed purely on the basis of hCG levels.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jenniferj5, Although,  the gestational sac may or may not be visualized by abdominal ultrasound  during the 4th to 5th week of pregnancy the viability of a fetus when vaginal bleeding is present in early pregnancy is usually determined at 6-7 weeks because a heartbeat can be typically visibly observed. This would be one reason that an ultrasound would be delayed until the seventh week. Keep in mind that brown spotting as compared to outright frank bleeding is actually an encouragement. Best wishes and I hope you will consider an update when your time permits. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "The 1st trimester is filled with many symptoms, but, for some women, bleeding and spotting becomes common.   During the first weeks of conception, the fertilized egg is constantly burrowing into the soft lining of the uterus. Even after the pregnancy is confirmed, this process of implantation continues for several more days, sometimes even a week. As the egg burrows, small blood vessels can burst, causing a small amount of bleeding to occur.   This blood can take days to reach the vaginal opening. Once it does, the blood is usually brown. When women experience bleeding and spotting in the first trimester, brown blood is the most common type that they find. Brown blood can be considered \"old\" blood, that was most likely caused by implantation.  The most frightening type of spotting or bleeding during the first trimester is fresh blood, or bright red especially if accompanied by cramping. While this type of spotting or bleeding can be serious, it is not always confirmation that a miscarriage is occurring.   While bleeding in the 1st trimester can be common, it is important to remember that whatever type of bleeding occurs, a physician should be notified. Most physicians will closely monitor the bleeding, and may recommend bedrest in some cases.\n\n",

Generally speaking, for example, one type of infection, Trichomoniasis, may cause a vaginal discharge that is yellow to green in color, has a frothy appearance, with an unpleasant odor. Most areas have free women care clinics. Below is a link that may provide you with information regarding availability of such healthcare in your area. Under (Opportunities) Click on: find free or low cost health care and enter the information requested. I would strongly suggest an evaluation. I hope this information is somewhat helpful. Click here!

    "title": "Should I change Doctors?",
    "content": "I am 40 years old, 35 weeks pregnant with hypertension and GERD (both diseases diagnosed 3 years earlier). Right now, I take Aldomet, Zantac/Prevacid, Repliva. I had my first baby at 28 weeks due to pre-eclampsia. I originally had a different OB who said I would be on bedrest one month prior to my due date. But I had to change doctors because my insurance changed. The Ob I have now is nice, but I question her judgment. She is too flighty and doesn\u2019t talk to me like an adult. She has not scheduled my c-section, and I\u2019m due March 4th. She keeps saying \u201coh, due dates can be 2 weeks before or after\u201d\u2026Here are examples of why I\u2019m concerned:   1. My feet swell so big by the afternoon, that sometimes I can\u2019t even walk on them. She told me to get maternity support hose. She is just so blas\u00e9 about everything, and not taking it seriously.   2. She told me (well her nurse did) that I had HPV and needed a colposcopy (biopsy of the cervix). She said because I had gotten an abnormal pap smear. I had let her know from the beginning, my pap smears have always come back abnormal since I was 16. (endometriosis) I refused the 1st time. But then I came in for an appt (I was 30 weeks) and they were ready to perform the procedure. And they did. The tests came back normal.   3. For over 3 months, she said \u201cThat the good bacteria in my vagina were not winning the fight with the bad, and it might be yeast\u201d I told her I hadn\u2019t had any itching or burning, but she prescribed Gynecol. Which has a lot of side effects. I took it, no difference.   4. Finally, I look on the internet and suspected maybe I have Bacteria Vaginosis. But on Jan 19, I started having pain in my side, I went to work the next day it got worse, I called her office and she said it could be constipation and prescribed Colace, I took it, but Sat morning the pain radiated thru my back even worse. That night around 12:30 I started having contractions and horrible pain. I went to the ER, suffering from pre-term labor. My BP was 140/98. They called her and she prescribed a shot to stop the labor, and let me go home that morning with just a sleeping pill.   5. I went to her office on that Monday, she said I was fine, that happens sometimes but the (fibronectyin?) test they gave me was negative, so I probably wouldn\u2019t go into labor for the next 2 weeks. I asked her what was the shot I received to stop the labor. She said she didn\u2019t know, and started laughing. I asked her point blank do I have BV, and she said yes, and started with the \u201cgood/bad bacteria\u201d speech. I took Cleocin for the BV, which has left me with extreme burning and itching.   I made an appointment to see her this week; I decided to inform her I want my c-section scheduled for February 23rd, my 38th week, since she can\u2019t seem to make a decision. My sonogram doctor said I should have had my operation scheduled already. Am I over reacting?   My previous c-section was vertical, and because of the high risk with my blood pressure and rupture of the uterus, I cannot have a baby vaginally. I just need some advice on what to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Texas, You have some very real concerns.  It is important to feel comforatable with your doctor as that you should be able to ask him/her whatever you want without fear of not geting them answered.  Trust in your case the most important factor is gone.  I would consider changing doctors.  However, you are so close to delivery, that may be next to impossible.   Is your current doctor in a group practice?  Perhaps one of the other doctors in this practice could take over your care.  If she practices alone, you could make some calls to other doctors that are on your insurance list to see if they would accept you as a new patient despite your close delivery date.   Good luck with your delivery.  Write us and let us know how you and your new baby are doing.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thank you so much for your concern. Well since that posting, I was put in the hospital, I didn't know why until I got there... (PIH), but I was released after 3 days. My doctor has now put me on bed rest and is acting concern about my bp. She says she can't schedule a c-section, but they are monitoring my bp, and want me to go as far with pregnancy as I can. So right now I'm stuck with her. Right now my baby is 6 lbs, my sono said I was 35 weeks; she said I was less than that. I am monitoring my bp at home and will go to the hospital if I see it go up too high, or I have any symptoms, since this is my second go round with this, I do have a little knowledge on what do. I will keep you posted on what is going on with me. Thank you so much, because I really felt like I was alone out there. L\n\n",

    "content": "hey I am not a doctor but I do study around these kind of things, ok, so the first guy you stopped having sex with before he ejaculated and you started your period(indicates you didnt get pregnant) now the second guy, you did not mention if he ejaculated in you, well if he didnt, the chances you can get pregnant is very unlikely, usually in pre-cum it contains No sperm, but he if did go in you, then there is a chance you can be, only if you were ovulating that day(ovulation occurs week or two before your period) and sperm can stay in you close to a week. I had unpretected sex with my husband(without him going in me) and I did not get pregnant, a few months laters, we got really careless and he just went in me all the times we had sex, and about a 5 weeks later, I found out I was pregnant. I hope this helps you some, so yeah if you don't want to get pregnant wear protection or just make him pull out...it worked for me all those times.\n\n",

My last period was in early December. Since Thursday I have been having brown discharge. It was at various times during the day and would stop and Thursday night there was bright red but only a little. There was none on Friday but some on Saturday and Sunday especially after intercourse.   I took an at home pregnancy test on Thursday but since my period is irregular I wouldn't know if it was timely. The result was negative. Today I still have the tinted brown/pink discharge and slight lower back pain. I have been takin OTC cough and cold medications for the past 5 days and have tried to take them minimally. I know that I should go to the doctor but can you please tell me what exams or tests I should ask for first as I do not have health insurance and want to keep the costs to a minimum. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Birth control pills contain female hormones (a progestin or a combination of a progestin and an estrogen). These are very different hormones from the ones measured by a pregnancy test. Pregnancy tests measure the beta-subunit of HCG (beta-HCG).  While it depends upon the sensitivity of the specific test, most home urine pregnancy tests (sensitive to 25 mIU) will turn positive about 13-16 days after conception.   If you were not on oral contraceptives, this would mean about the time of the first missed menses. When you are on oral contraceptives, ovulation could have occurred at more irregular times so that all you can say is if the pregnancy test is negative, you are either not pregnant or are less than about 14 days pregnant from ovulation and in such a case need to repeat it again.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It's unlikely, but possible.   Ovulation (when the egg is released from the ovary) can be difficult to predict because your menstrual cycle doesn't necessarily run like clockwork from month to month. If your cycle is shorter than usual, or if you bleed for extra days, you may ovulate during or shortly after your period. If the release of the egg (which can live for one to three days) coincides with the lingering live sperm (which can live in your body for five to seven days after unprotected sex), you can conceive. The bottom line: If you are not using contraception, it's still risky.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  The post-ovulatory period is known as the post-ovulatory infertile phase and is confirmed by a combination of temperature and mucus signs about three days after ovulation.   This phase lasts until the onset of the next menstrual period. A dense network of filaments forms a thick sticky mucus plug which impedes sperm penetration and sperm are rapidly destroyed by the acidic vaginal secretions.   The post-ovulatory infertile phase is the most effective in avoiding pregnancy. This is because it has a constant length of approximately 14 days as the corpus luteum remains for around fourteen days, then it shrivels and dies; the level of progesterone falls; the temperature drops; and the endometrium disintegrates, so completing the cycle.  In your case it all depends on when your last ovulation took place. If it took place at least 3 days prior to intercourse then you are most probably safe.  The highest possible screening sensitivity for an hCG-based pregnancy test conducted on the first day of a missed period is 90 percent, as 10 percent of women may not have implanted yet.[1] It was estimated that the highest possible screening sensitivity of a home pregnancy test by one week after the first day of the missed period is 97 percent. So now it would be too soon.  Best regards.  References: =========== 1. Allen J. Wilcox; Donna Day Baird; David Dunson; Ruth McChesney; Clarice R. Weinberg.

At the beginning of this month's cycle, I accidently skipped 3 days (as I was out of town)... then my boyfriend and I had unprotected sex about a week or so after missing the pills. The last time we had unprotected sex was on New Years. I didn't worry at all... But I was supposed to start my period Sunday... It is now Tuesday and I have yet to start my period OR see any signs of my period or pregnancy. Any advice? Could I be pregnant?  Thank you.\n\n",

Additional contraception is used for the remainder of the cycle.  Since you didn't use additional protection then there is a possibility that you are pregnant, you are advised to get a pregnancy test now. If it turns out negative take another next week.

I know that blood clots are a risk when taking birth control pills, but I never thought about it until I had knots pop us on my leg.  I have had one about 2 inches from the bottom of my leg (along the front) pop up and it has been there for 3 weeks.  I thought maybe I bumped my leg and didn't realize it, but I am kind of worried.  It is a little red and warm to touch and kind of big.  Tonight I noticed 2 more all about 2 inches apart.  One straight up and the next one diagonally up toward the inside of my lower leg.  Could this be blood clots?  How can I be sure?  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Barnesthefam,  It\u2019s a very bad, life changing thing to get a blood clot in your leg, called a deep vein thrombosis (DVT) but it\u2019s deadly to have an embolus break away and float to your heart or lungs causing a pulmonary embolism (PE). A superficial thrombophlebitis may be what you are feeling, you can feel this type of clot just under the skin, which isn't as bad as a DVT. A deep vein clot can\u2019t be felt or seen but you will know it\u2019s there when you experience leg swelling, warmth & redness, pain that is worse when standing or walking or your leg is cold and blue from complete blood shutdown (depends on the position of the clot). If you think you\u2019re getting clots contact your doctor right away, they are life threatening!!\n\n",

We were intimate 29,30,31,1,2,3 My period would be due on the 10th I was impatient and did a HPT (an EPT, and First Response) Jan 5, and 10. Negative Results I was very dissapointed because I noticed some very very light bleeding and backpain. But then nothing afterwards. Implantation bleeding? YES! 2 days later (14 days past ovulation) I tested positive within 45 seconds. Then to confirm I did one 2 days later. :D   So if you are pregnant you will test positive generally 14-18 days past ovulation.  Good luck to you and remember to be calm and patient.  lemon\n\n",

    "content": "This is our second attempt of conception using the injectibles Follistim and IUI (Insemination) and I thought for sure this time it worked... I've been SO HUNGRY... but then today... day 11 since insemination... three days before I was supposed to test... I got brownish pink then later heavier brownish red discharge... only when I wipe really for the most part... but is it my period coming early (something that has NEVER happened) or is it implantation spotting (didnt' happen in my first two pregnancies though).  Everything I'm experiencing is new to me and its so frustrating... because if this IS MSday 1 then I need to see the DR who is 2hrs away tomorrow morning... if its not, then I don't' need to waste my time and money... for sure!  So... should I wait it out? If I do and I'm wrong and it IS my period, then that means I loose this cycle for \"free\" lol.. and have to wait, then induce a cycle with prometrium and start all over. I just don't know WHAT to do. It doesn't seem to be getting heavier, but my cycles have started this way before. I just don't know. I feel crampy and stuff..not bad... but slightly... it could be either or couldn't it. I have no way of knowing... a HPT wouldn't show up positive yet I don't' think. HELP.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi luvnlife2day, Pregnancy symptoms may vary from one pregnancy to another. Implantation bleeding may occur between 6-12 days after conception and may be the earliest symptom present. It is usually lighter in color than the normal menstruation. Early pregnancy tests may show positive (if there is sufficient amounts of hCG production) even before a missed cycle, however, these are usually done after a few days of the missed cycle. It would be next to impossible for me to state that you are definitely or are definitely not pregnant. You may want to call your physicians office for guidance in how to proceed and of course testing may be suggested prior to you actually going into the office. Good luck to you! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I know there could be a possibility that i could be pregnant, but I took a HPT today and it came back negative. What I would like to know is, was it too early to take the test?, Is it possible that i could be pregnant? I'm not sure what to think, it's sort of stressing me out, because we want to be!!!

    "content": "First, a little backround, not sure if it is relevant or not. A year ago, after missing a period, a visit to the doctor confirmed pregnancy with a urine test. I was having breast discharge then, which was one reason I thought I may be pregnant. A week after that, I began to bleed, and at the ER, they said I was not pregnant, and I was just having my period. Im not sure who was right, because I felt pregnant, and think I had a miscarriage. It took about 2 months, but the discharge stopped, so I contributed it to hormone changes.  Fast foward to this week. I had unprotected sex during a fertile time, using only the withdrawl method for birth control. My period is due tomorrow, and abotu 3 days ago, I began having breast discharge again.   It is cloudy colored, and it is a fair amount, at least several drops at a time. It feels sticky, and has no odor. I know nipple discharge is common, and can be due to a blocked duct, but is it normal to have 2 blocked ducts at the same time? This is comming from both nipples.  Or is it a pregnancy symptom as I thought last time? I suppose I will find out the answer tomorrow if my period comes as it should, so assuming my period does come....what is causing my nipples to have this discharge, and should I be concerned?\n\n",

Its not an instant remedy, sorry, but it should work to ease your cramps and lighten the bleeding.  I had alot of friends that got on the pill just to ease cramps.  It did both for my friend(lighten the bleeding, and ease her cramps). I hope this helps!\n\n",

Running to bathroom, sick on tummy all the time and very sore breast(tender to clothes). This has been going on for about 3 weeks now.  Could this be from coming off the shot or could I really be pregnant?  Home test was taken on the 2 and the 6 but was neg.  Should I test again?? Thanks alot!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Okay, heres the story:  Me and my boyfriend of 2 1/2 years had a fight and broke up around October 25(about the time of my LAST period)...or so i think it was my last period...  I started dating this other guy and we had sex around november 4th... i just found out last week that I AM PREGNANT!    My first reaction was that it had to be the rebound guy's baby because i had my period(or so i think i did) and wasn't with anyone else besides him... But then i started talking to some people and doing some research on the internet and now i'm not so sure if that actually was a period or not that i had october 25... I've started thinking that i may had been already pregnant with my BOYFRIEND's baby and didn't know it... missed the november period and just assumed it had to be the other guy.   My question is this:  When i go to take my first sonogram next week, will the doctor be able to tell me exactly how far along i am so that i can count back and see if i concieved in october with my boyfriend or if in november with the other guy??? I HAVE to know as soon as possible!    I'm hoping and praying that it is my boyfriend's baby because that would make our lives so much better... either way though, i know that i'm going to love this kid.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a mother of two my youngest is 18 months old and she was breastfeed for a year, I was able to wean her and dry completely up within a week, I was producing significantly less milk and that is the reason that I weaned her, I never had any problems with mastisis or anything. I completely dried up.  Last night before I took a shower I observed my breasts in the mirror and they did not look right, The glands in my aerola are more prominant . I tested for milk and I was able to squueze milk out of my left breast only . Have not been able to get any milk prior to last night, It seemed that it was coming from one of my ducts and a Montgomery's gland that was right above it. My husband does not really stimulate my breasts during intercourse and we only have sex once or twice a week  History last menses , October 24th (first day) Sexually active , had sex around the 4th and the 6th several times with husband , No protection  Had lower abdominal pain and backache last week  took pregnancy test this A.M. and was negative ( I think there is a line there but you can barely see it) Been moody and have had lots of stress lately. My daughter was born 6 weeks early and I was producing milk with her from 3 months till she was born and my O.B. said that might have been one of the reasons that she was early. Any help would be greatly appreciated and I will answer any questions that are required, I am no longer covered by insurance and found this Miracle sight, Thanks to all the Doctors and nurses  that give their time and energy to such a great site!\n\n",

    "content": "First of all, take a second pregnancy test.  Release of breast milk can mean that the hormones causing milk production are out of balance. This condition is called galactorrhea. Release of a liquid other than breast milk can be a sign of infection, inflammation, or a tumor in the breast.  The pituitary, thyroid, adrenal, and ovarian glands all release hormones that govern production of breast milk. If the thyroid gland is not producing enough hormone it can lead to untimely release of breast milk. Another explanation is a benign (non-cancerous) growth on the pituitary gland. In these cases, menstruation usually stops as well.  Other causes are stress, sexual stimulation, and drugs, including birth control pills, marijuana, narcotics, anesthetics, reserpine (Diupres, Hydropres, others), methyldopa (Aldomet), antidepressants, and other medications prescribed  for mental and emotional problems  If the next pregnancy test you take is negative, and you still do not have a period, you may want to schedule an appointment with a doctor to find out what is causing this.  http://www.dshs.state.tx.us/famplan/default.shtm This website is for the Family planning of Texas.

    "content": "I tested negative orginally on my pregnancy test I was too early taking it. But after waiting I tested positive  on two seperate home pregnancy tests with faded lines Yesterday (20th)   I posted a comment on the 19th about asking if I could be pregnant. I AM !!!:)  BUT:(( I woke up this morning @ 7am with severe abdominal pain across my abdomen and in my lower back. I went to school and at 10am I went to the bathroom and noticed I was bleeding lightly. I started to panic because I believe according to my cycle I am about 2 weeks pregnant (time after conception)my last Menses was October 25/26th very light. 2 days max.  I immediately went to my girlfriend who was closest to where I was and laid on my back and called an OBGYN.   They told me that there is not a whole lot they can do but take a quantative blood test. which I had today at 2:00pm and so I am waiting lying as still as possible for (24 hours they told me) freaking out crying because I think I have lost this baby!?  I don't know what to do I am going crazy. Could this be an ectopic pregnancy? could I be miscarring or could this be a chemical pregnancy.  I have been bleeding since 10am this morning and now the blood is medium-heavy flowing slowly. And I have the worst cramping ever.  Any guidance or prayers would be much appreciated!\n\n",

    "content": "Antibiotics can cause birth control to be less effective, which is why it is always recommended to use a back up method such as condoms when taking antibiotics. If you were on your period during the time of the unprotected sex, it is unlikely you could become pregnant because that is not a fertile time. If your period is not due until november 22, it is a little early to get a positive pregnancy test.   This does not mean you are not pregnant. All that aside, all women ovulate at different times, and it is possible to have become pregnant, and there is just no way of knowing without a pregnancy test. Wait until at least the first day of your period, and take an Early pregnancy test. If that is negative, and you still do not get a period, wait a few more days, or even a week, and test again.   Since you did not start taking your birth control pills on time, your period may not come when it is expected this month.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "It is much more likely to simply be spotting/irregular period related to the BCP; this is very common with hormonal birth control in the first 3-6 months.  If you haven't missed any pills, it would be very unlikely that you are pregnant.  As far as testing, it will be accurate at the time of the first day of a missed period.  Since you actually tested a few days after your period was expected, there has been enough time for it to be accurate.    The symptoms you are experiencing are very common right before a period in many women and can be more intense when the period is irregular.  Sometimes, some spotting is the only period for that month; usually the next month is normal.    If your symptoms persist and you are worried, call your GYN.\n\n",

    "content": "oh wow..Ok..that was helpful to me too. See, I'm on ortho tri cyclen lo too..and about three months after I started taking them..I started having horrible panic attacks.. I'm still on the pill now.. seven months later...but I'm learning how to make them go away... Since your not even on it anymore..it's mostly just in your head. Next time you get a panic attack, just force yourself to calm down..I mean..Panic attacks are really stupid.. I mean..it's never like your ever in any real danger or anything...You just FEEL like your gonna die.. But your not.. You haven't died yet have you?? If you don't think you can do it on your own..I would go to the doctor and look in to getting a prescription to help you cope... Trust me..They'll go away and you'll start feeling fine..   When I had mine, I thought I had everything under the sun..I had no idea it was a panic attack. At first I thought I was just sick with the flu or something..because I got myself into such a tizzy that I threw up.. Then I felt like..maybe I was diabetic? But oh man..it was so unlikely.. And then ..maybe there was something else wrong? I always felt weak and shakey...maybe I had a problem in my back?? Or maybe I was just dying?? Then I started feeling a tightness in my chest and neck... and decided I should go to the doctor and see if maybe I was having heart problems... I didn't have any. So I went to the chyropracter..and she told me exactly what it was...Panic attacks....That simple :S It's been about three months..but it's getting better every single day.. I might still swich pills..not sure yet... I want to try seasonal...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mlady25, What type of sterilization procedure did you have, for example, tubes tied, ligation (tying and cutting), cauterized etc.? Generally speaking, when ligation and cauterization is performed it is considered permanent. If tied only, there is a chance that they may become untied. Depending on the procedure you had done would determine the the chance that pregnancy is possible. However, keep in mind, if you had a test at the hospital (which I assume was a blood test) and accuracy and detection rates are even higher than the urine tests in determining pregnancy, and a negative home pregnancy as well, in my opinion if you had the ligation and cauterization procedure I would find it unlikely that you are pregnant. However, again if you only had the tying procedure done, there is a small chance. Leakage of fluid from the breasts may also be caused by other things aside from pregnancy including hormone imbalances. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I am scheduled to have arthroscopic knee surgery on 11/7/05. My orthopedic surgeon believes either my meniscus is torn, or there is a loose piece of bone or cartiledge floating around in my knee. I'd like to proceed with the surgery, but not am in so much pain that it could not wait until after I deliver.   What I would like to know is are there any safe methods of anethesia (i.e. would local be ok), and would I be able to take any narcotic pain medicines without harming the embryo?   I have an appt to speak with my obstetrician, but can't see him until after my surgery.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

He/she would most likely want to get clearance from your obstetrician before hand. Generally speaking, unless a surgical procedure is an emergency a physician may want to delay a procedure. Narcotics are not advisable during pregnancy and if the procedure is completed a NSAID (Motrin) would be safer to use. Again make sure that you notify both physicians prior to this procedure.

    "content": "I am 28weeks pregnant and I had my glucose testing yesterday.As the day went on I started having severe itching on the soles of my feet.Then on the palms of my hands too.Then this morning it was all over but still hands and feet were way more severe but NO RASH NO BUMPS NOTHING .My hands and feet are swollen more than normal but not my face.I thought it was related to the glucose test I had. I looked online and found that if you have itching that starts on feet and hands and you have NO rash that it is a chance that I have something called cholestasis. I was unfamiliar with this until reading the info online. When calling to get my glucose test results she revealed I failed and have to have another test with blood drawn every 3 hours.I mentioned the itching but she was not concerned at all.She said there was no way it was from the glucose test but it seems to odd to have started itching like this after the test. Dr. seems unworried too and when I asked for a blood test to check for the cholestasis they just shrugged it all off.  So can the itching be caused by the glucose testing? I had my gallbladder removed years ago so can I still develop cholestasis? I am so worried and am not being taken serious since they say it is so rare. I do not know what to do. Are there any other symptoms besides itching? I do not have jaundice and stools are not pale.But since the itching is the only real sign most often how can I differintiate if it is okay or not since my Dr. is not willing to listen?I need some desperate help!!!! I am already high risk and having problems so I do not need this problem to worry about too.It just came on so suddenly so I am worried. Shannon\n\n",

    "content": "Hi shnncof, Intrahepatic cholestasis occurs inside the liver. A simple lab test to evaluate liver function should assist with identification of this disorder. Often the only apparent symptoms are itching of the hands and feet but when other symptoms arise typically the urine will be a dark color, pale bowel movements, fatigue or exhaustion (which is difficult to distinguish between normal events of pregnancy and this disorder), etc. Keep in mind that this condition is relatively uncommon but I would suggest that you inquire with your physician about having labwork for liver function studies to ensure all is well. Also keep in mind that Gestational Diabetes may also be linked to dry itchy skin and tingling in the hands and feet. I hope this information is somewhat helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I have requested the test to my dr. and he insists on NOT testing me.I was asking my family if anyone had the symptoms or the cholestasis and found out my aunt had it.So now I am even more worried since it is mainly a hereditary thing. The dr. said the tests are not always accurate anyway is he correct? I heard that is the only way to tell and they are very accurate. I am appalled after knowing this IS in my family that he will still not test me.I am to have blood drawn tomorrow 3 times due to failing the firrst glucose test and so it would be no trouble but he still sys NO. I am in tears why? What if this IS  cholestasis?How do I insist on having it done when he is telling me no? I have went in for exhaustion  1 week ago it is so bad I was fainting. My urine has been dark for over 2 weeks now and he said it was just a UTI and I am on antibiotics.I went in also 2 weeks ago for less movement with the baby.I can't get a 10 count kick out of her and he said she was just sleeping but it is so bad I feel her move maybe 3 time a day and I pay very close attention. I am freaking out.I stil am itching all over some what but more on my hands and feet.I have made my feet bleed from scartching so much. I do not know what to do.I am so worried. Shannon\n\n",

If there are only slight elevations and your physician stated that they are nothing to worry about then the abnormalities must have been quite mild. Gallbladder dysfunction frequently presents during pregnancy so this may contribute to the cause. However, if your symptoms worsen then it would be advisable to get a second opinion.

To my knowledge, although it's possible to test for paternity from cord blood, (providing there is consent from both parents) using what she claims, and how she claims she is going to do it...... is quite unlikely. I am not aware of a lab anywhere that would do such a test such as she is claiming. Some people's desire is to make all of those around them miserable because they are themselves miserable. Very sad indeed. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Now this morning (Monday) I wasn't bleeding at all, so I sighed a huge sigh of relief, and went about my day.  Then I made lunch for my husband and one of my children, and after we ate lunch, I used the restroom, and I was bleeding again.  Its not the regular color of blood, its almost like a brown, and at other times its a dark pink. I have absolutely no pain and feel fine.

If you are taking fertility medications with hCG - e.g. Novarel, Profasi, Pregnyl - please consult your doctor regarding appropriate times and circumstances for testing. Other fertility drugs and medications that do not contain hCG will not precipitate false positive results. Similarly, progesterone will not cause a false positive as well.   Be sure to do your testing with the first morning urine as hCG is most concentrated in the urine at that time.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21 years old and I have been with my boyfriend for over four years.  My periods are always quite irregular, despite the fact that I am on the pil (Marvelon) and take it very regularly.  Around Septemeber 1st, I was due to have my period, but I skipped it, because I chose to not take my sugar pills, but instead to continue taking the next batch of pills.  My boyfriend and I had intercourse on August 27th, September 3rd, September 10th and September 18th (but the last time he did not ejaculate).  On September 6th, I started what seemed like a period but it was quite brownish.  It went on for about a week and then it stopped for about 2 days and then started again.  On September 20th, the brownish discharge turned into what seems like a normal period and it is red.  (It's still going on.)  During all of this time, I have been using tampons.  Also, I have been urinating more frequently and I have been a little tired.  But the fatigue could have something to do with just starting my courses at university again.  I know that this seems complicated, but I am very worried that I could be pregnant and I am just wondering if it's possible... Any help would be very much appreciated.  Thank you.\n\n",

I've been a regular 28 days, except the last three cycles I used progesterone supplements, b/c of previous micarriages....so my cycles were a few days longer. I had taken a few of the online early pregnancy strips test and had what I thought were faint positives. Even one this CD27. Do you think I could have just started my period 2 days early (on day 26?) or maybe the progesterone screwed me up? or maybe it's implantation bleeding? It's bleeding...not as heavy as a normal period...no clots (yet anyway). Was just holding out for a last bit of hope. Have been ttc since my miscarriage in January at 11 weeks. Very depressing. My luteal phase my be even more screwed up.\n\n",

    "content": "Well, I can tell you that implantation bleeding usually occurs 5-10 days after fertilization. You window of bleeding *could* be considered as implantation bleeding, or a period, it is so hard to say. It can be a period because you were a couple days near the expected period date. However, you are also still in the 2WW, and it could be the implantation.  Was this bleeding heavy? Do you need a pantyliner, of pad? Or is it \"spotting\"?   The sure way to know is an HPT. If I can make a reccommendation, I would try \"Answer Early\" or \"First Response Early Results\". Both of these tests only need a small amount of the pregnancy hormone Hcg to detect a +. A standard test can take 50-100 mUI of Hcg to register, these take 25mUI. As far as the strip tests from the internet, I personally have encountered a lot women reporting false results with them. I am not saying your strips are bad, but trying a store bought test can provide further interpretation.\n\n",

Hubby got kicked in the cheek and was in awe.  My second child, I didn't feel her until 21 weeks and every time I told my husband to, \"Come here!  She's moving!\", she'd quit as soon as he put his hand on my belly.  It was another 3 weeks before he caught a fleeting kick.  She hasn't stopped picking on him and she's 10 now.  17 weeks is  the earliest in the \"normal\" timing that anyone feels the wee one.  Enjoy the peace and quiet now because it has been my experience that the ones that move the least in the womb make up for it in full force once outside.    Again, if you still have deep concerns, go in for a quick check by your physician.    Best wishes to you all!\n\n",

I underwent one year of fertility treatment due to unexplained infertility and then underwent a diagnostic laparoscopy that revealed bilateral hydrosalpinx, but two months after the surgery I conceived naturally (without any fertility meds).  Now, my OB/GYN has prescribed isoxsuprine and allyloestrenol.  I have searched the net for info on these drugs and was shocked to read that they are no longer in use in the Western world (I live in India).  I sought three opinions here in India and all three physicians said they have been prescribing these drugs for many years and have seen no fetal abnormalities.  I am very confused whether to use these drugs or not.  If anyone could give me advice, I would really appreciate it.\n\n",

    "content": "From MedlinePlus: Pregnancy\u2014Isoxsuprine has not been shown to cause birth defects in humans. However, isoxsuprine given shortly before delivery may cause fast heartbeat and other problems (low blood sugar, bowel problems, low blood pressure) in the newborn.  From my interpretation of literature available to me: Allyloestrenol also has not been shown to cause birth defects in humans.  It is/was used to prevent abortion or premature labor, but proof of efficacy was lacking.    Summary: Vasodilan (isoxsuprine) is still used in the US and Canada.  Allyloestrenol is not used, but only because they have no proof that it actually works.  Neither one has been shown to be harmful during pregnancy.   I hope this information eases your mind a bit.  Speak with your doctor again about your concerns and feel free to even ask him to show you the information he has on the medications to ease your mind.  Congratulations and good luck!\n\n",

I am very worried because my left uterus is very small, and abnormal. I was wondering if anyone could give me advice on how to make the pregnancy last longer, any advice that you have would be appreciated. What questions should i ask my doctor? Should i see a high risk specialist? What should i do? I also have very severe asthma and i am currently taking albuterol, singulair, allegra, zyrtec-d, theophylynne, and ditropan for an over active bladder. I have not had an asthma attack in over a year ( which is the first time in my life that i have not had an attack for this long). I am usually hospitalized about every other month with asthma attacks. I am so worried because I know that woman with uterine didelphys do not have a good outcome with pregnancy. Any help at all would be appreciated!!!!  Hicksuwish@aol.com _________________\n\n",

When someone loses a baby at that stage, it isnt something you yourself can change or you yourself caused, we all have imperfections and sometimes those arent compatible with life and a miscarriage occurs. Try to remember to lower your stress and take folic acid before trying. I would love to be kepy up to date if you have time to update me. Charleen\n\n",

    "content": "I have written a question under the gynocology section, but this OB might be a better place to get answers. Here is a little back ground- I am 21 and have been with my boyfriend for over a year now. I am on ortho tri low and take it consistantly. I have been having pain during intercourse in the right side of my vagina. It almost feels by the right ovary, but I am not sure. This has been going on for about 2 weeks now, and it feels like a sharp shooting pain. I am also having cramps frequently throughout the day. They are almost like PMS cramps, but I am a week and a half away from my period (and this has been going on for 2-2 1/2 wks now). My nipples are very sore and sensitive to the touch. I have also been quite constipated. I know these are all signs of pregnancy, but I took a home preg. test and it came up negative. The Dr. office said they would be calling me back with some answers but I haven't heard from them yet and so it would be great to get some advice while I wait it out...   Does anyone think there is still a possibility that I may be pregnant even thought the test said negative or any other ideas what is going on?!   Any response are greatly appriciated!!!\n\n",

    "content": "My wife had PID about two years ago and we were told this could increase the risk of ectopic pregnancy. My wife and I were trying for our first baby, and we were succesful in our first month of trying this past June. Based on estimates from our doctor, she is 7 weeks pregnant if you go by the first day of her last period, but is technically into the 4th week of pregnany based on approx. fertilization of the egg. The doctor did a urine test and blood test on the 13th of July (about 2 1/2 weeks or 18 days into the pregnancy) and it came back with an HCG level of 219. Our doctor also suggested we go for an ultrasound within the next few weeks.  Two questions...is 219 at 18 days a normal level for HCG and secondly, how early can an ultrasound detect an ectopic or normal pregnancy? My wife hasn't really had any symptoms of an ectopic pregnancy but we want to be cautious and get an answer as soon as possible to see if we are in the clear.  Thanks for any help anyone can offer.\n\n",

Seeing as she is in week 9 and has no sysmptoms of Ectopc pregnancy, plus the apparent good ultrasound, are we more or less in the clear with regards to Ectopic pregnancy?  The only problems she is currently having is constant nausea and extreme lack of sleep (tossing and turning all night). Is that normal or an indication of something else?

As far as your questions.....since you havent heard from the US and also she is nine weeks, thats pretty good indication that it is not ectopic, there is always a possiblity however so any severe pain should take her to the hospital (which it normally would anyways). The nausea and restlessness are part of pregnancy and are unfortunately very normal. There are medications that can be prescribed that are safe (ie diclectin) for the nausea if it is too bothersome. Please keep me posted on the baby ok! Charleen\n\n",

I saw my ob this last Tuesday and he wants to check for uterine polyps, he believe I might them for he said my ultrasound last done the day after on the day of my miscarriage, my uterine lining was very thick..is this a sign of a uterine polyp(s). I have read on them and if so a D&C will be performed but like to avoid that if I can. Do you know of any other less invasive way of getting rid of uterine polyps or are some ok to just leave alone. I have my ultrasound this coming Tuesday. I know I can't assume I have them which I hope I don't. I am spotting now, expecting my period either Tomorrow which is my day 33 which is my normal cycle. I have decided to wait till October to try again to at least give my uterus time to heal. The acupunture is helping termendesly (I know I spelled that wrong) my depression is under control and I feel alive again...I am back to my happy go lucky self...missed the old me. I am doing much better. I got pregnant both times the first time, a fertile mertile..just need a little help keeping that tiny life inside. My partial thrombast and cardiolipin AB IgG were slightly elevated (Is that bad??) and my sugar was at 104. I have lost almost 30 lbs since Januray so I hope that helps. My blood pressure is normal now. I will keep in touch Charlene and let you know what happens. Hope to hear from you soon. Yasmine : )\n\n",

    "content": "I recently gave birth 9 weeks ago by c section.  My lochia lasted much longer than expected, still red at 6 weeks.  It had finally slowed down and turned brown around week 7 and even stopped completely for about a day.  Then, I started bleeding again bright red and have been doing so for the past 1 1/2 weeks, sometime red and sometimes brown.  Is this my period coming back?  Is this normal or something I should be concerned about?  I have had some kind of discharge, either red or brown almost every day for 9 straight weeks.  There has never been an odor or any cramping at any time.  I am also on the third week of my second month of birth control pills.  Please help!\n\n",

Basically, everyone is different, but ....if you are soaking maxi pads (one fully saturated pad per hour) then you need to see a dr. The fact that you are not cramping and have no foul smell is good, it means you are less liely to have infection. Did you have any extra bleeding during your section? Also, you would have been due for a 6 week check up with a Dr, did you have that and what did they say? Again...the amount of bleeding and the other symptoms we talked about are what I would watch. Take Care and congrats on the new baby!! charleen\n\n",

Please, try and find one and go there immediately. They are usually affiliated with religious institutions like churches or hospitals sponsored by those religious institutions.

I'm in serious pain, and I'm having trouble sleeping at night, as well as breathing.  I can't bend over cause it hurts too bad.  Is this a sign of pregnancy?  What should I do?  Right after my period me and my husband have been intimate at least every other night after that.  But since my cramping, its only been about once.

    "title": "Re getting pregnant",
    "content": "Hi there!    The question you have is a valid one. The type in your cycle when you can conceive is dependent on how long you go between periods(ie: is it exactly 28 days or more like 30). The day your period starts...if you count back 14 days that is when u ovulated, not 14 days from the start of your period in all situations. It is definitely possible that you can get pregnant in the time frame you mentioned, but there are numerous factors. If your period was on time, even though you describe it as different, and you have a negative pregnancy test at this date, you may very well not be pregnant. If you are unsure, wait 5 days and repeat your home pregnancy test. If it is still negative I would then trust the result. Charleen\n\n",

Of course use a back up method of birth control if pregnancy is unwanted at this time. Maybe there is another oral contraceptive that would work better. In my practice, I have ran into a few women who get the headaches you described with birth control too. Just check into that with the doc.\n\n",

I know that it usually takes about 3 months for ovulation to regulate, however I have yet to get pregnant. I am concerned that my husbands sperm may not be as \"potent\" as they should be. He smoked marijuana daily while he was in high school/Junior High. He hasnt smoked in about 3 yrs. Could this still be a problem? I also occasionally have hot flashes, which is concerning.

    "content": "The first thing you have to always keep in mind is... keep it off your mind.  Six months is not uncommon at all while trying to conceive, even up to 2 years.  If either of you are stressing yourself out over becoming pregnant, this in itself can inhibit ovulation and/or sperm production.  Yes, past marijuana use could have some impact on sperm production after 3 years, but do not immediately blame that and do not give up.    Hot flashes could still be hormones readjusting to the body being in control of them now or even summer in general.  ON 7/7/7 is a pretty strong regimen, although not the strongest by far.  Contact your physician for possible hormone level tests for you and possible sperm count testing for your husband if you can't stand the suspense.  Most importantly for you, hubby and future bambino is to relax and enjoy the attempts.\n\n",

This has been going on for about the last 8 weeks. It began about 2 weeks before 2 periods ago. She had a painful period, began to feel a little bit better, and then was miserable for a month. Her last period came and it wasn't as painful as the one before. She seemed as if she was feeling better again. And now she feels miserable. She is on the pill(i think yasmin or w/e it is called). We have had sex, but always with a condom. And I'm pretty sure that both periods were normal(they are always very light for her b/c of the pill). She is worried about going to the doctor and finding out bad news. Also, I am pretty sure endometriosis runs in her family. And her breasts have been slightly tender here and there - the main problem is the pain in her lower abdomen/cramp area. Any ideas on what could be wrong with her?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi mopsy, The pain in your bum and loose or more frequent bowel movements may be associated with nearing the end of term of your pregnancy. Hemorrhoids, also a common occurrence in some women during pregancy also causes discomfort. Your midwife should evaluate to see if hemorrhoids are present and if not the I would relate the pressure/discomfort/pain in this area to be related to the position of the baby. You may want to change your diet and see if this has any benefit. If the diarrhea persists  then the cause should be identified.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I know its hard not a day goes by where i don't shed the odd tear and doubt my fertility.  i am 23 next month so i'm young yet!! if you need to talk don't hesitate to e-mail me on lottiesteele@tiscali.co.uk.  thinking of you\n\n",

    "content": "Let me begin by saying my period is like clockwork. My cycle is every 25 days (give or take 1 on occassion) and lasts 4-5 days. But, last month, my period was two days late then only lasted for two days. I took a home pg test and it was negative so I took a wait-and-see attitude. This month, it came five days early (this has never happened in my 15 years of periods). On the first day of my period, I usually have to change a full tampon every 3-4 hours, but, this time, I only used up one tampon in 6.5 hours and another for the rest of that day and two the next day, although bleeding was much lighter and didn't fill the tampons. On the third day, it completely stopped again. I spotted on the fourth day, noticeable only when I went to the bathroom. Stopped the next day. And spotted again the next (which was the day I was supposed to start my period), again, noticeable only when I went to the bathroom and wiped, although not EVERY time I go to the bathroom. It stopped after that.    Also, my PMS was normal both of these months, maybe not as severe as it usually is, but, after I had my bleeding, PMS symptoms went away.   Here I am two weeks before I'm due again (going by the day bleeding occurred, not by the day it was due) and my breats are extremely tender again.  As I said, however, this is the only part of my cycle that has been normal.  I also noticed that with my tender breasts this month, came a slightly swollen (tight) vagina.  Also, my cervical mucus has changed.  All of a sudden, I'm more dry than I think I've ever been, as I usually have a good bit of natural discharge (always have).  So, do you have any idea if this could be an ectopic pregnancy and what signs I should look for there? I've done some research on hyperthyroidism, PCOS, and ovarian cysts, as those seem to be the only other conditions I could find that would cause an abnormal, light/short period.  I'm so confused, however, because I don't appear to have any other symptoms in any four (including pregnancy) of the conditions that it could be.  Am I missing something?    I do have a doctor's appointment scheduled, but it's three weeks out.  Thanks for any help you can give.  I've search so many online forums and web sites for women with similar situations, but have been unable to find one that is exactly like mine (although i'm not terribly surprised by that, just still without answers).\n\n",

I took two pregnancy test and they both came out negative but the negative sign was so faint that I had to get really close to a light to tell what the result was.  So could I still be pregnant and it not be showing up on the home pregnancy test? Because I've hear that if you get pregnant on the shot that the only way that you can tell is by a blood test.\n\n",

I hope this helps a little!  Best of Luck!!!\n\n",

DO you still have your monthly periods or are you already menopaused? If you still have your monthly cycles, when was your last menstrual period?       With these questions in mind, I would like to suggest you see your physician and tell him/her the characteristic of your condition. That way, proper intervention can be done. An ultrasound of your abdomen will also be helpful.  M.D.\n\n",

I have very tender and sore nipples and 'heavy' and tender breasts, what does this mean? I took a preggers test about a month ago and it was negitive, but I am unsure if the feelings im getting is due to a period coming (although before i was on the injection i never really had any complaints when having a period) I also have been having loose bowels every day, within the first couple of hours of being up and about. I have a docs appointment next week, but like most women, I would like to have a rough idea of what might be the cause of my problems. thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Note:  I am not a doctor or trained in any way in the medical field.  Kiki, I was on Depo-Provera for 4+ years.  Your doctor should have warned you that it may take anywhere from 6 months - 2 years for you to become fertile again.   It somewhat depends on how long you were on it, and just your own body chemistry.  Some people are fertile again right away, but most don't settle back into a normal cycle for about a year.  The feelings you're having may be due to your hormones reacting to not having the injection anymore - I know when I was due for an injection and when I came right off, I would suffer PMS-like \"withdrawal\" symptoms.   These went away after a few months as my body realigned.     On the other hand, you could be pregnant.  I did become pregnant while on Depo-Provera, and it certainly is possible to do so if you've just come off.  I hope this helps, and that you find out what's going on.\n\n",

I can push there and it is terrible pain.I have not had alot of gas but my bowels have changed to diaherria like and not much each time but I am passing gas,burping a lot, and having bowel movements some what so I know it is not a blockage.I feel it is intestinal but it makes no sense.can this still be ligament pain and if so can ligament pain cause SEVERE pain CONSTANT never ending and pain with bowels movements?The pain is bad  I do not want to move it hurts.I already have been diaginosed with UTI that we can't get to go away and chronic cervicitis putting me at risk for preterm labor but I do not think they have any part on this but i do not know.I called my Dr. and nurse said it sounded like pulled muscle but she was not listening about the pain is CONSTANT, SEVERE, and hurts when even passing gas or a bowel movement. I feel it is more but would like an opinion.I am scared and hurting not sure what to think. 3 days and no relief just still severe pain!!Please help. Shannon\n\n",

I am not sure if this is my period, meaning the test was a false positive. I have always had regular periods and this is not normal to me. Please help me dear doctors, Im confused Maybe I should just add the few things that have been happening to me lately. My last period started on the 27th of June and I was expecting the next one somewhere on the 24 of July. But on the 23rd of July I just spotted some reddish-brown stuff , of which I thought my period was starting but nothing happened after that. A week later I did the pregnacy test which was postive. I have been having back aches, but the rest of the things like eating habits have been like those that I get on PMS.  The other thing is I've had a yeast infection which I was treating. Now I don know if this has anything to do with it. I've had  yeast infections before , which have never affected my periods. Please somebody advise on what I should do??

    "content": "Hi. I'm 12 months preg. now and am extremely anxious about everything involing the pregnacy. This is my first and I am so nervouse that it's not funny. It's so bad that I'll deal with really bad headaches instead of taking tylonole even though my od said it was ok. I freak out about the slightest things. I'm so worried that I will misscarry or the baby will be born deformed, even though i would have no reason to.  I have convinced myself that I'm not having a normal pregnacy even though all of my checkups have been fine. I even heard the baby's heartbeat last week.  Every time I get an odd cramp I'm convinced I'm having a eptopic pregnancy, though i've been told it's just due to normal stretching of the muscles.   I even freak out about the thought of having drugs during labor. I don't want them because of the possible side effects but ( don't like the idea of having something stuck in my spine), at the same time I'm terrified of the pain that I'll have. I don't even want to think abotu having a c-section and a spinal block. the thought of that just makes me nauseous.  Yesterday I had two sips of a glass of wine and felt guilty all day long. I will go so far as to hold my breath when I pass by someone that is somking a ciggarette. I never was a parrinoid person before this and am just wondering if it's normal to be this parinoid. I can only imagine that it will get worse for me the futher along I get.    I really need help. I can't go on worrying like this because I know extra stress is the last thing I need being preg. I just want someone to give me some tips to help calm me down that don't require seeing a psych. or reading books, I've read a bunch of pregnancy booksbut they just put ideas in my head because i seem to be attracted to the problems they talk about.  thanks for any help\n\n",

    "content": "Hi crbrooks, First let me congratulate you on your pregnancy. It is such an awesomely amazing event knowing that a life is developing right inside you. You do sound anxious over the upcoming events. Two sips of wine, most likely wouldn't cause any problems although I would advise avoiding alcohol altogether during pregnancy. Occasional cramps do occur during pregnancy because of the mucles and ligaments making adjustments for the changing in size and weight of the uterus. Ectopic pregnancies present with profound pain upon rupture if located in the fallopian tube with a multitude of other symptoms. An ultrasound can detect if a pregnancy is developing inside or outside the uterus.  If your exams have been normal to present then I would have to think that your pregnancy has no current complications. An epidural during labor is for use of analgesics or pain blocking agents and are at the patients choice not forced upon by physicians or staff. Keep in mind that labor although it is difficult, when you take one look at that wonderous being that you hold in your arms anything else seems to dissipate. Meanwhile eat a healthy diet, avoid use of alcohol and nicotine, get regular exercise and enjoy the fact of being pregnant and knowing that a life is develping and changing with every single day. Make a list of your questions and concerns to discuss with your physician at your next appointment. Good luck to you! Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

You may either want to wait an additional week and retest or have a labtest completed (detects pregnancy earlier). If it does indeed come back negative again then then it's likely you are not pregnant and I would attribute it to another cause for which you should be evaluated by your physician.

    "content": "Hi nickky, Although hCG levels are used as guides to development during early pregnancy, ectopic pregnancy, molar pregnancy, and miscarriage, don't put to much emphasis on numbers alone. These levels begin rising at approximately 1 1/2 to 2 weeks after conception and double every 48-72 hours during the first 8-12 weeks of pregnancy.  Was there no gestational sac observed by a regular ultrasound or was there a transvaginal ultrasound completed? In my opinion miscarriage would likely be ruled out as the levels of hCG would decrease rather than increase. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

If you are pregnant, you can find out how far along and details about the pregnancy but if you aren\u2019t and have started missing periods, you need to get that straightened out.   Definitely talk to your doctor right away about your plans for parenthood or non-parenthood and get YOUR mind and body ready for the changes it is going to go through before continuing on with unprotected intercourse.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Evening  With Ortho Evra you can have in between spotting and periods.   If you meet the requirements to be on the patch(weigh no more than 198 pounds, etc.), and you are putting them on the same day you initially decided on (for example, if you put one on every Monday),you should not be pregnant.  The best bet is to get a pregnancy test.  The patch is very effective in preventing pregnancy, but you have to make sure that you follow the instructions enclosed.  Breast tenderness, is not always a reliable sign of pregancy always.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Sweets.  For the most part, even with ectopic pregnancies, you would have a positive test result.  Ectopic pregnancies are very dangerous, so if you think you are pregnant please make an appointment to be seen.  Do you have a history of an ectopic pregnancy?  HCG is the hormone that is released in your urine and your blood when you are pregnant.  Some pregnancy tests do have false negatives, so again, if you have any reason to suspect you are pregnant please see your healthcare provider.  Especially if you have had an ectopic pregnancy in the past. Good Luck and God Bless NICU_RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Medically speaking, you probably had enough between you and your boyfriend but only time will tell for sure. Two things would need to take place for you to become pregnant.  #1 \u2013 You need to ovulate at the right time. Ovulation is the release of a mature egg from the ovary. It usually occurs only once in every menstrual cycle, and it is usually around the 12 - 16 day before your next period.  #2 \u2013 A sperm needs to reach your egg.  An average ejaculation contains over one hundred million sperm. In ideal conditions, meaning vaginal ejaculation, less than one thousand sperm will actually make it to the egg and than only one will fertilize it. The chances of sperm survival starts dropping dramatically when ejaculation takes place outside the vagina.\n\n",

    "title": "HCG and progesterone levels",
    "content": "Hello krodgers,  Congratulations on your pregnancy! Not all women show the same levels of HCG at the same time during the beginning weeks of pregnancy. Some women show HCG within days of conception but most women will show a positive blood level by the 11 to 12th day after conception. Also, if a woman has taken fertility injections they will have HCG in their system when they aren\u2019t really pregnant yet. HCG starts to be released when the baby implants into the lining of your uterus, usually within the first 2 weeks after conception. The hormone level will double about every two days starting off at 5 IU/L and will peak around 8-11 weeks.   Progesterone is the hormone that helps build your uterine lining so the fertile egg has a nice, thick place to implant. Pregnant woman have about 10 times more progesterone in their blood than woman who aren\u2019t pregnant. Low levels of progesterone may indicate the onset of a miscarriage during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy, unusually high levels during the first 12 weeks may indicate multiple births.  The normal levels of PROGESTERONE for a single birth from conception to 12 weeks is 9-47 ng/ml, the normal levels of HCG for a single birth at the 5th week is between 18-7340 IU/L or mIU/ml, and the 6th week would be around 1080 to 56,500 IU/L.\n\n",

Additionally, my breasts usually get very sensitive around my menstruation time, and they are currently slightly swollen and sensitive (which I've read is a pregnancy symptom).   I did take an at home pregnancy test, following the directions exactly, and the result was negative.  I think the delay/ miss might just be change of routine/ stress/ recent decline in excercise, but I'm still worried about the possible pregancy.  I'm not sure if this is involved or not, but I noticed that my left breast had a little blood on the nipple after showering-- but it appeared to just be dryness.

Stopping hormonal birth control can cause irregular periods for months sometimes.  Even if artificial hormones are not involved, It's not uncommon to be late occasionally; women are not always completely regular every month.  It seems to most commonly coincide with increased stress and/or anxiety.  Unfortunately, a missing or late period can increase the stress.  If it doesn't start in a week or so, call your GYN and ask her if she thinks she should see you.  Meanwhile, try to relax.  You're obviously not pregnant, so do not worry about that.\n\n",

I was crying constantly over anything, very sweet one minute and mean the next, I also had discharge from my nipples, was feeling very bloated and tired and realized when he asked that I had not had a period in december.  I took several pergnancy tests at home, over a few weeks, but all were negative, but no period, and symptoms were still there, so I went to a doctor, who did a pregnancy test, and confirmed I was pregnant.  This was very very stressful because my boyfriend did not want a baby, and was pressuring me for an aborton, which I absolutly did not want, I felt like I was being torn in two pieces.  Abotu a week after the doctor told me I was pregnant, I woke up in the middle of the night bleeding. I went to the ER, and they did a pregnancy test and said I was not pregnant, I was having a period.The cramping with this \"period\" was worse than I ever had before.  I do not think they were right, I think I was indeed pregnant, but I guess I will never know. Since then, my periods have been very irregular. The first one I had after that was on time. The month after it was 8 days late. The following month it was 8 days late. Since february, my periods have consistantly been between 33-35 days apart. Before this happened my periods were very regular, every 28 days. My nipples still occationally discharge, it is clear, and very little, and not all the time. If it is of any importance, I had a lazer cone biopsy to remove bad cells from my cervix abtou a year ago. I have been unable to follow up or continue treatment because of no insurance, so I don't know whats going on with that at all.\n\n",

    "content": "I\u2019m sorry for the loss of your pregnancy. The only way a pregnancy test can come up positive is if you have a hormone in your body called HCG, this is made basically, by the baby and you won\u2019t have it in your body any other way unless it\u2019s been artificially put there.   As the baby implants and grows, the HCG level starts to rise, the higher the level, the easier it is to be picked up on a pregnancy test. Obviously, doctors have much more sensitive tests than are sold over the counters so when you checked, it was a negative because the levels weren\u2019t high enough yet but the doctors could pick up the smallest amounts causing it to read positive.  The first few weeks of a pregnancy are the most critical for the fetus. A lot of fertilized eggs don\u2019t develop right, they don\u2019t implant correctly, they are missing vital parts of human formations, all types of things can happen. Sometimes an early miscarriage can be overlooked as a missed period or late period without the woman ever knowing the difference, I\u2019m sorry you had to know, it can be hard on a person.  If your hormones continue to be messed up and you can\u2019t straighten your cycle out or it\u2019s really bothering you, you may want to think about birth control pills to regulate yourself. Another thing to have checked is your blood type, is you have RH negative blood you may need a RhoGAM shot to help you conceive another baby, talk to your doctor.\n\n",

Was your pharmacist aware of your pregnancy? I would strongly advise against taking any medications, supplements etc. without the advice of your physician because there are many medications, supplements etc. contraindicated during pregnancy.

Also by this time your tubes wouldve scarred and there would be no way for the ovum to reach the uterus or for a sperm to travel up a fibrosed fallopian tube to fertilize it!  However nothing is final and I would suggest that you do a simple urine preganancy test. This would make things clear to you! Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Any time you have sex, you risk pregnancy. The only way to not get pregnant is abstinence, or NOT having sex. IF you are going to have sex, using a condom is necessary to help prevent sexually transmitted diseases. Again, the only way to not get an STD is to NOT have sex.  BUT, since you have had sex, let's address that. You only had sex a week ago, and I would think, given the info that I have about your encounter, that she would not be pregnant. I don't know this for sure, though. It IS a possibility.  She can take a home pregnancy test. It may be kind of early for that, though. She can also look in the phone book for a clinic that does pregnancy testing. They can give you answers to your questions, as well as educate you on methods of birth control and disease prevention. If you're going to continue to have sex, I suggest visiting a family planning clinic as soon as possible. These are usually free.  Along with the pleasures of sex comes the responsibility. Remember that every time you have sex you could be creating another life, no matter how \"careful\" you are!!  Good luck to you... and please post again to let me know how this turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, new here.  I was wondering if it is possible to always have low hcg levels with every pregnancy?  Reason why I ask is that I am now 15 dpo and my cycle should have started this past Sunday.  I took an HPT this morning with my FMU and it was negative.  Now with my first pregnancy, I took several hpt's that were negative, had a blood test that was negative later during the week of my missed cycle.  A week later I took another blood test and it was positive.  With my second pregnancy, I was a week later when I finally took an HPT and it was negative (with no sxs - no sore breasts, no nausea, nothing).  I'm late again and was wondering what the possibility would be that I just constantly produce low levels of HCG?    I've been having dry heaves, low back ache, bloating, irritability, headaches and of course the lack of my cycle.  I also spotted on saturday, but it was only when I used the potty and wiped.  TIA\n\n",

    "content": "I have been reading a lot about miscarrying at home and am a bit confused. I have some questions and hope that someone can answer them. What exactly happens when you miscarry? I know there is discharge. Is the fetus discharged as well and if so how do I know? This is not meant to sound derogatory but is everything just flushed down the toilette? Sounds terrible but what else would one do? Is it necessary that I have to go to the doctor? Will there be any papers that will need to be signed/filled out to have a record that there was potentially a baby?   I also read that if one miscarries there is still an option that one is pregnant. That sounds too confusing to me. How could that be? I thought if you miscarry the baby/pregnancy is terminated? Sorry I am confused and would apreciate any help.   Thank you, Nis\n\n",

    "content": "I don't really know the length of my cycles anymore as they have been quite irregular (have PCOS),but I have had 2 periods in the past 2 months.  Last period was on 6 April 2005 - when I went to my gynae for a check-up, he found a follicle on the ultrasound, and advised intercourse over that next week.   I would then expect that my next period would be around 6 April ?  Since 26 April, my breasts have been extremely sore. I usually get sore breasts with PMS and they usually look swollen and feel soft. This time they look bigger than usual ! and feel more firm, and more sore than anything I've ever experienced.  I've also been feeling crampy and achy since 27 April, and on 29 April, while lying down in bed, I felt a stabbing sensation vertically down my stomach, like a dot-by-dot pricking which lasted under a minute.  I have been feeling sllightly nauseous every now and then, but its' so slight, sometimes I think I may be imagining it ?  Could the stabbing pains have been implantation ? Do all women experience frequent urination/fatigue, or does that only come in later on in the pregnancy ?\n\n",

    "content": "I have done my research as most new mothers do and have found that at least two (but usually 3) ultrasounds are done during a pregnancy. Usually one each trimester. I had one at 9 weeks and my doctor won't do another one for the second trimester.  He wants to wait til I'm 30 weeks.  I spoke with the receptionist/nurse about this and she said that I may not even get another u/s at all!!! Just the one I recieved at 9 weeks. She said that it is very common to only receive one u/s. I'm sure my doctor is going to do one at 30 weeks but I couldn't believe the nurse said this. I have never heard of such a thing. It was also upseting that she acted as if it was no big deal...as if I wouldn't be upset by not receiving another u/s.  My question is.....Isn't a 2nd trimester u/s sound between 16 and 20 weeks considered to be the norm?? Being a first time mother I am anxious to know the gender and would like to see my baby. Not to mention just to make sure that everything is going the way it should be.  Would it be wrong to demand a second trimester u/s? I feel like I'm overreacting and I hate confrantation (sp?). I know this is not going to be that big of a deal  after the baby is here but right now it is. So am I right or wrong? Am I overreacting?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Ukesd,        How are your doing right now? when was you last normal menstruation (LMP)? Being a first time mom is quite frightening and exciting at the same time.   It is a normal mechanism for 1st time mothers like you to be what you are feeling right now.        The standard procedure being done on prenatal check ups are as follows: 1. You should have your monthly pre-natal check ups for the first and second       trimesters, then the check ups becomes more frequent as you near your term. 2.  On your first trimester ( 0wks-12wks age of gestation) you should have done the ff.       lab exams: complete blood count, urinalysis, ultrasound, ECG or blood sugar.  3. If you have any underlying diseases like hypertension, diabetes, renal/lung problem,      etc, your doctor will have requested ancillary procedures depending on what type of      disease. 4. On your second trimester (16wks-24wks), an ultrasound may or may not be done.       However, if you want to know the gender of your little angel, it is during the 2nd      trimester ultrasound ideally can be done, since all organs are already formed - it only      needs to grow/mature further (hence 9 long months)   lab exams are optional,      unless an illness occurs which I hope will not happen to you. 5. On your 3rd trimester (week 28-37, max up to 40wks), prenatal check ups becomes       frequent (from every 2wks to weekly as you near your term). lab exams are optional       unless you have an underlying illness. 6. Lastly, you should continue taking your vitamins as prescribed by your OB-Gyn so      that both you and your baby will still be in good health.  Thank you.  Sincerely, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amywillis49,          Having read your post, may i ask the ff. questions: is this secretion coming from one breast or both? is the secretion fowl-smelling, blood-streaked etc or just milk-like? there is any pain on the affected nipple/breast or both? do you feel any mass or lumps on both breast if you do your self-breast exam? if yes, is the lump/mass movable, slow or fast-growing? is there secretions before/during/after your menstrual cycle? and speaking of menstrual cycle, when was your last normal menstrual cycle? does it occur every month?        With the above questions in mind, your doctor will be able to determine whether the symptom(s) you feel is of OB-Gyn or surgical in nature, but based on your initial symptom and description, I think this is more of a benign (harmless) cyst. But I just want to rule out a lot of disease entity first by asking you the above questions. Thank you.  Sincerely  M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "It's normal to have the brown discharge (old blood) the few days preceeding your period, however since you had unprotected sex in the last 2 weeks, it's hard to tell if it's implantation bleeding or you're trying to start your period.  A pregnancy test wouldn't have shown a positive result between the 24th and today, more than likely since it hasn't been but 9 days since your last time having unprotected sex.  The test won't be accurate until the day after you are late for your scheduled period, which in your case isn't scheduled.  Take another test around the 20th if you haven't had a normal period- that will be three weeks after the last risk.  Or you can have a blood test at your doctor's office that are more sensitive.\n\n",

    "content": "It is possible, there tends to be more thick mucous in pregnancy.  You can test even at one day late in most all pregnancy tests you can purchase at a pharmacy.  It would be best to make it first morning urine, tho, it will be more concentrated.  The bloating and cramps are very common symptoms to have right before a period, so I wouldn't put too much stock in that.  If you are only late one day, you would only technically be a couple of weeks into a pregnancy, not really far enough to have symptoms yet.  Sometimes, if you are really worried about it, it will delay your period and cause a vicious cycle of worrying and waiting.  I suggest you do a pregnancy test tomorrow a.m., if it is the result you want, you can stop worrying!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If diarrhea is severe this can lead to dehydration which could put both you and your baby at risk. The cause of diarrhea during pregnancy whether severe or not could be a change in diet during pregnancy, a new vitamin that you are taking, stress related or increased milk intake. Try to reverse any dietary changes while at the same time maintaining essential supplements such as calcium. Another possible cause is infection. If you notice any blood or you develop a fever or other symptoms you should report to your physician.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi legendary, The small amount of blood is not related to pregnancy but by it being the first sexual encounter. This does sometimes occur and has no relationship to pregnancy itself. However, if the sexual encounter happened during the time period during the ovulation cycle, pregnancy is quite possible. The ovulation cycle generally occurs during the 1/2 way point of a menstrual cycle. For instance if a woman has a 28 day cycle, the 1/2 way mark would be 14 days and she would be considered fertile approximately 2 days prior and 2 days after (generally speaking).

    "content": "Hi aporter, There is evidence that smoking during pregnancy increases the risk of having preterm labor, low birthweight babies, babies with medical problems, learning disabilities, etc. The more a woman smokes the higher the risk factors. You are doing the important thing by reducing the amount you smoke and trying to quit, I know, it is very difficult. You are correct, there are women that have smoked during their entire pregnancy and have healthy babies. They have been \"lucky\". The way I see it, it is sort of like playing a game of Russian Roulette. The one thing I can say that may give you some encouragement to quit.....Everytime you light that cigarette, picture it in your baby's hand, your baby is smoking it, you are actually forcing your baby to smoke a cigarette.....is that a picture you really want to see? You wouldn't force the baby to stand in front of a moving car, nor jump off a bridge.....that's about the only way I can sum it up. Good Luck to you and I wish you a safe uneventful pregnancy and delivery  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Numerous disorders may cause anemia. Have they ruled out liver disease, kidney disease, hypothyroidism, etc. as well? What about iron deficiency as your body requires iron to produce red blood cells.

Well, I was just watching a show on TLC, \"When Medical Tools Get Left Behind\" and it got me thinking about my experience... We have been trying to get pregnant for some time now, and I'm wondering if the sponge or sponges being left behind may have created an infection that may have damaged in some way my \"insides\" making it difficult or impossible to get pregnant now!

    "content": "Dear Obxgreys,  I am sorry to hear about your problem. Ofcourse the sponge being left inside your tummy have caused alot of adhesions around it ...it's the body's defensive mechanism... in addition to the normal adhesions following the cesarean section delivery.   Any maneuvers inside the body produce some adhesions...so leaving a foreign body inside it must have caused severe forms of adhesions ofcourse.  and this is a major factor for infertility... and the ability  to conceive(get pregnant).  My advice for you is to seek a Gynaecologist... he will ask for a hysteroscopy/hysterosalpingography and will inject a dye...to see if it passes well through your fallopian tubes...and he can also do an  ultrasound +/- CT scan of the pelvis ...to assess the severity of adhesions and the possiblity to concieve the normal way....and according to his opinion he can tell you if it's feasible the normal way or you will need assisted measures for reproduction...i.e IVF (invitro fertilization).  Best wishes,\n\n",

    "content": "I was hoping someone could give me some information.  I was put on Effexor XR about a year ago after Prozac was no long working for me.  I take 75 mg daily.  I ask at the time that if I became pregnant would it be dangerous to the baby.  I was told Effexor was in a class of antidepressants that could be taken while pregnant.  Well now I'm 13 weeks pregnant and now my doctor is saying I should stop taking it. But now I'm very [/b]concerned about the health of my baby.  Have done it harm?  I was also told to take a dose every other day for a week? Then stop altogether. I heard there are horrible side affects of stoping Effexor that quick?  Any advise?/[/i]\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Momof3, There has not been widespread research on the effects of Effexor and pregnancy however, some of the studies suggest that when Effexor is taken at the later stages of pregnancy prior to delivery the baby may suffer withdrawal symptoms. There also is some documentation that the use of the medication odansetron in combination with tapring doses of Effexor lessen the symptoms but is not recommended for more than a two week time period (during pregnancy). I would suggest that if you begin experiencing side effects/withdrawal symptoms while taping your Effexor dose that you discuss other available options with your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It's an easy question to ask now, why didn't you just use a reliable form of birth control? There are so many to choose from. As far as damage done because of your abortions, can you talk to the physician who performed them for you? If not, do you have a Gynecologist you can go see for a physical? I would recommend getting a good check-up before I tried to conceive just because of your past history, you may have scar tissue in your uterus that may need tending to. Have you been testing for STD's? They could cause difficulty carrying a child also. You want your pregnancy to start off on a healthy, fresh foot.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Anja,  I apologize for the delay in responding to you. Congratulations on your pregnancy, I hope all goes well for you. During pregnancy your body goes through all kinds of changes that are new feeling. You may feel tired, nausea/vomiting, the need to urinate often, constipation, dizziness, hemorrhoids, varicose veins, stretch marks, full breasts, darkening areolas, hair line up your belly, leg cramps, nasal stuffiness, bleeding gums, nosebleeds, I\u2019ll stop there\u2026 not everyone experiences these, some people go right through the entire nine months barely breaking a stitch in their size 4 pants!! But for the rest of us there\u2019s maternity stores!  A bad sign may be one of the following and you should ask your doctor about these or any other symptoms that may bother you: vaginal bleeding, fainting, headaches, high blood pressure, swelling in your arms and legs, seeing spots, seizures, inability to keep water down, diarrhea for more than 48 hours, feeling like you\u2019re urinating when you aren\u2019t, difficulty urinating. There are more that your Physician will tell you about as you progress in your pregnancy, don\u2019t be afraid to ask.   As far as a heating pad or hot tub is concerned, the amniotic fluid heats up with high external heat. The baby can\u2019t control its water temperature so as you set in the 104 degree spa waters, it floats in the 104 degree amniotic fluid. Talk to your doctor about the heating pad, I think it may be alright as long as there\u2019s a towel between you and the pad and you give it a break every 10 minutes or so but TALK TO YOUR DOCTOR.\n\n",

    "content": "jeffshoney_05  How exciting for you! You may be in labor, but don\u2019t start the car yet, it doesn\u2019t necessarily mean you will be delivering soon. There isn\u2019t any sure way to determine delivery by labor pains, some women feel intense pains and aren\u2019t dilating at all, some don\u2019t feel them at all but are fully dilated and ready to deliver (that\u2019s what we all want). Things to watch for \u2013 Loss of water, gushes at a time from your vaginal area, mucous discharge, increased uterine contractions that seem to become more predictable and don\u2019t stop, even if you rest. You may start having bought of diarrhea or nausea. If you do think you are having water loss, it may be your amniotic sac has broken, you do need to go to the hospital and be checked, you are now on \u201ccount-down\u201d. I\u2019m hoping you have an OB or Midwife, call them right away. If you haven\u2019t lost your water yet, delivery could be days away or hours, it\u2019s up to your body, I\u2019ve seen deliveries that I thought would be hours only take minutes. Pushing usually takes longer than a few minutes and most people can make it to the hospital or midwife once they realize they are in labor.   A few things to call your OB on right away, even if you aren\u2019t having pains are: headache, swollen ankles, seeing spots, feeling lightheaded or dizzy or faint, having bleeding from your vaginal area or feeling a ripping or tearing sensation during a contraction.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jeffshoney_05,  I received your email but I\u2019m going to answer it on the forum just incase other have the same question, hope you don\u2019t mind.   Labor is actually put into three stages \u2013 The first stage is the beginning of uterine contractions and dilation of the cervix. The contractions will start out mild and as the baby moves down into the birth canal dilation of the cervix begin causing them to become more intense. Throughout this stage the cervix will soften and thin, called effacement, and open the cervix, called dilation. You won\u2019t be ready to deliver until your cervix if dilated to 10 centimeters so you\u2019ll have to control your desire to push until it\u2019s time.  The second stage begins when the cervix is fully dilated and the baby begins to move down the birth canal and is born. This it the actual birth, the moment everyone\u2019s been waiting for. This stage takes a lot longer than you would think, the moves make it look like it takes 2 pushes and 3 minutes, don\u2019t plan on that, I\u2019ve seen this stage last for a lot longer than that.  The third stage begins after the baby has been delivered but you have not delivered the placenta (afterbirth) yet. When you deliver the placenta the third stage will be complete, this could take 30 minutes or longer but who's counting by this time!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello bethany272,   Has her coughing causing her to have contractions or is your friend in danger of having her baby early for some other reason? You may not know this but the hospital does, they can give her injections of a corticosteroid to help develop the baby\u2019s lungs if her body is threatening delivery. Has she been put on medications to stop contractions? Does she have anything contagious that you may have come in contact with? If  you start having any signs of labor \u2013 water loss, contractions, mucous loss, blood, etc. contact your OB or the hospital right away.  Coughing up blood is a different story; there are a lot of serious causes for this. Bronchitis, pneumonia, respiratory or lung infection, smoking, tuberculosis, cancer, pulmonary embolism, to name a few. Sometimes you can cough and you may have a taste of blood but don\u2019t actually see the blood, that is much different than coughing up blood where you see blood coming out of your mouth. Any time you have blood coming up when you cough or out of your mouth, in your spit, with bubbles or otherwise, it needs to be considered an emergency! Get medical attention right away, this can be very serious. Pregnant woman should always tell their Physicians about uncontrolled coughs, you can cause yourself to go into premature labor from the abdominal stress.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey,  My last period was at the beginning of March around the 3rd and I'm still young so my cycle  isn't really regular yet. However, i had unprotected sex on the 24 and  three more times after that and i haven't came on yet. Now, my other problem is, when i go to the bathroom and wipe myself there is blood on the tissue. It's not like my period and i only see the blood on the tissue, and i wear a pad and there is blood on the pad but it doesn't flow out like my menstraul cycle. This didn't start happening until last sunday evening (April 17). The night before i had sex with someone and i told him that he was hurting me... could that be why im bleeding??? Today will be the 4th day. I guess what i want to ask is could i be pregnant and if the bleeding affecting just me or something else... And could i still get and abortion at this point...\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jus Curious,  Your period doesn\u2019t guarantee you will be ovulating in about two weeks, especially if you aren\u2019t regular. You can go months without having a period and still ovulate regularly or you can not ovulate at all and still have periods. But for the regular woman, when you do ovulate your body will make eggs that are mature and ready for ovulation about 12-16 days after your menstruation cycle would normally occur. This egg is only available for fertilization for about 24 hours BUT a sperm can live inside the woman\u2019s body for 3-5 days. So, if you have intercourse every 5 days you have live sperm inside you almost all the time which means eventually that sperm and egg will meet.   You could be having light menstrual bleeding or you could be having egg implantation bleeding. Do you want to become pregnant, is that why you aren\u2019t using protection?   Home Pregnancy tests, how do they work?  Home pregnancy urine tests measure hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which is secreted by the fertilized egg when it implants into the lining of the uterus and starts forming its placenta. The fastest and most accurate test is a blood serum test, you can get them done by a Physician or Health Department. The hormone hCG will start getting into your bloodstream in about 1 week after fertilization and will double about every two days. The sensitivity levels will very depending upon the maker of the pregnancy test so the best time to test is about 1 week past the day the menstruation was expected. I know it\u2019s hard to wait but the only 100% positive answer to the question \u201cAm I pregnant\u201d is time.   If you keep getting negative urine tests and still haven't started your cycle, go see your Physician and get checked right away. If your test comes up positive, go see your Physician or Midwife right away to discuss your prenatal care or plans.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello magnolia,  I would recommend getting a physical prior to becoming pregnant, get complete bloodwork, pap if one is due and urinalysis done to make sure your pregnancy will start out on the right foot. Have your doctor give you a prescription for prenatal vitamins, they have the right amount of folic acid in them for a new mother\u2019s body. \u201cPrenatal Z\u201d prescription is a good brand for woman that gets morning sickness if you have it in your area. Your husband should discuss his concerns with his doctor about the possibility of low sperm count being caused from the insulin or diabetes. He may want to get a sperm count done just to make sure everything is good.\n\n",

    "title": "Sciatic pain possibly",
    "content": "Hello Thewalkers11,  You may be suffering from Sciatic-nerve pain which is located behind your uterus in the pelvic area. During the second and third trimester, your baby\u2019s head may rest on the sciatic nerve in the lower part of the spinal canal or the weight of your heavy uterus may push on the nerve causing you to experience severe pain in your buttocks and shooting down your leg or legs as well. This pain can cause numbness and/or tingling that starts deep in your buttocks and radiates down the back of your legs. It can be so intense at times that it can incapacitate you with pain. The best thing to do is lie down on the opposite side of the pain, put warm pads on the pain area and let the nerve relax. If the pain gets more intense or hard to deal with, talk to your Physician about a mild pain reliever/anti-inflammatory you can take during pregnancy.  As far as packing goes, you may need to rest for a day or so to let the nerve relax, maybe a friend can come and help while you relax. At the airport, get there even earlier that you already planned and request a wheelchair, they will push you to your gate and haul your luggage, your children will like riding with you on the chair. You\u2019ll be one of the first to get onto and off your plane, request a wheelchair on landing as well. You may need a doctor's written orders, usually you don\u2019t but just to be safe I would be prepared with one.\n\n",

    "content": "I am sitting here crying, and really scared, somebody please respond back to me. I am 18. I have been on the birth control patch for almost two years. My last period was on April 8th, it was heavy, and i had cramps, it ended on April 13th around the late evening. On April 12, i put on my patch, before i went to bed, b/c my patch change day was the next day. My boyfriend came down for a visit, and we had unprotected sex on April 13th...late late evening, almost midnight, he pulled out before he ejaculated. I had been feeling a little strange before having sex with him, and then after wards, my stomach really started bothering me. I had gone much of the day without eating. I remember i kept complaining about how hungry i was. I ate a piece of bread, and went to bed, around 2am  i woke up very nasueated, and i vomited. For the next couple of days i was still nasueated but not throwing up. On thursday i was  feeling queezy on and off, and i noticed i couldn't eat that much, but as the days progressed i feel a little better, except when i am in a car, i get very car sick. I have been using the bathroom more frequently than normal, twice, almost three times a day. i am very concerned, that i had sex too soon after putting the patch on, i had it on 24 hours prior to having sex, and i am scared, what are my chances of being pregnant.???   any answers would be helpful...thank you so much\n\n",

We ovulate approximately around the 14th day of our cycle, counting the first day of your period as day one.  We are only fertile for a short period of time in our cycle (during ovulation). My guess is that you're not pregnant.  Anxiety will make you feel horrible and affect your cycle. I would contribute your nausea to a \"bug\" and the frequent bowel movements, reoccurent nausea and other symptoms to worrying. Or if you've just started the patch it could be side effects from that.  Try to relax, I really think you are okay. See a Dr. if you are really concerned.  P.S. I'm a mother of three and an R.N., I have a bit of experience.  Hang in there.\n\n",

I told my doctor about the cramping and he said it was normal, if fact a lot of women cramp when the egg is finding it's place in your cervix.  He took a blookd tes and my HCG levels matched at where it needed to be with the 2 week diagnosis.  My concern is the cramps.  It is THursday now, and it was been intense cramps for 34 days now.  It was so bad that it woke me from my sleep last night.  I guess I'm really scared tha something is worng, even though I am not bleeding and my doctor is not concerend.

It can take up to a couple of weeks for a positive test to show up in some people - it really depends where in your cycle you have ovulated.  Unfortunately, him withdrawing makes little difference, it really is not an effective method of contraception unless you are charting your cycle as well.   Even small amounts of seminal fluid can lead to a pregnancy - and 'pre-come' - what can be present before penetration can be enough!  HTH  Amber  MD  [/i]\n\n",

I doubt you will find a Physician to give you a prescription without seeing you, it\u2019s illegal. Clomid  (clomiphene citrate) is a nonsteroidal ovulatory stimulant and requires regular blood work and doctor visits before prescriptions can be written. Long-term cyclic therapy is not recommended beyond a total of about six cycles and you should be closely monitored for ovulation during each cycle. You don't want to become pregnant without knowing it, fetal abnormalities have been reported in women taking Clomid during early pregnancy.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been married for 23 years.  Our sexlife has never been exiting.  My husband's libido is low, which can be secondary to our problems.  There is something that has always bothered us.    I cannot achieve orgasm no matter how long or short our lovemaking is.  Physically everything seems to be fine but for one issue - I do not have a clitoris (never had one).  What is the impact of that and can I achieve orgasm without a clitoris.  No manner or method of stimulation gets me \"over the top\".  There is a build up that I experience, but never reach the point of actual orgasm.  Sex has become work rather than pleasure.  Can you please advise.\n\n",

G-spot is a small area located about two to three inches inside the vagina on the top of the vaginal wall. Many women report increased orgasmic response,   ,may be this can help u!?

    "content": "Hi Graham The chance that she is pregnant is probably slim. First of all, women really are only fertile for a very short period of time each month, second; being that you didn't penetrate or ejaculate the possiblitly of sperm making their way up to an egg is slim. NOW, having said all that, I did say the chance is slim but not impossible! Pre-ejaculate does contain sperm and you need to take precautions. I am a registered nurse and a mother of three. I also conceived a baby during my last year of College before I got married. Trust me, when I say to BE CAREFUL. Don't make a bad decision in the heat of passion!. Buy some condoms or even better, see if your girlfriend will go on the pill. If you're already taking your clothes off, you know as well as I do, that it will only progress from there. I had many scares before I got pregnant and obviously didn't learn my lesson from them. I have two teenage sons now and I am not in denial about teenage sex. I will encourage them to get birth control. I know what it's like to have to tell my parents that I've made a huge mistake and a baby is on the way. It's not worth it!! Please be responsible.  Take care, Mrs Trailside\n\n",

    "content": "I am certainly no doctor, but over the last month, I have felt like I might be pregnant. I would like to provide a list of symptoms here and just ask if it sounds like I should test.  My fiance and I have been having unprotected sex for just over a year or around a year, and I am 23 years old.  My period has been slightly irregular all my life, and missing it isn't as normal as it switching days on me, however, for about the last year or so, my period has taken place on about the 7th every month. In January of this year, I had my period on the 7th. Then in February, I didnt have my period on the 7th, and instead bleed for about 3 days from the 23rd to the 26th.  This month, my period didnt come on the 7th or the 23rd, and I was wondering if the bleeding on the 23rd last month was my period changing schedules again or if it could have been implantation bleeding.  I have been having mild cramps, not as heavy or frequent as when I am starting in the last week, but every time I go to check to see if I've started, I havent. I am hypoglycemic and my appetite is usually quite low and in the last week or maybe week and a half, my appetite has improved a great deal.  While getting undressed to shower the other night, my fiance told me my breasts were larger, which I wouldnt notice really, but they have been very tender.  About two weeks ago I was really run down and tired which seems to be improving slightly, but I still have a horrible time getting out of bed.  I cant get comfortable in the positions I've been sleeping in all my life, and have to sleep on my back. I've also had an outbreak on my face like I havent had since high school.  Is there a possibility I'm pregnant? I really don't want to take another test just to see another negative sign, and would really just like to hear from someone else that at this point taking the test would be justified.  I took a test last month when my flow changed and it was negative.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I am really confused right now.  I visited the doctor yesterday because i have been sick to my stomach. the other day i felt as though i were going to pass out and ended up throwing up all morning.  I have felt warmer than usual, as if i'm running a low fever. because i just had my period a little over a week ago, the doctor was doubtful of pregnancy.  However, he did run a couple blood tests, including a pregnancy test. Today, i recieved a call from a nurse saying i needed to come in for further tests sometime next week.  She said that where a \"5\" would confirm pregnancy, i was at a \"2\".  This is extremely confusing because if I am not pregnant, shouldn't my level be at 0? please give me as much information as possible.  I have looked up a lot, but i really just want to hear from an actual person.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Well, I don't know if this will help you relax or not...Blood pregnancy tests measure human chorionic gonadotropin (HCG) and will show \u201csomething\u201d at >2mIU/ml at the lowest level but this is an unreliable number unless it keeps going up. A single HCG level doesn\u2019t necessarily indicate pregnancy, especially at this low of a number. Blood serum tests don\u2019t actually read positive until the HCG level is at >5mIU/ml. Urine tests usually won\u2019t read positive until the HCG level is at > 25-25 mIU/ml. Generally, the HCG level will double every two days or so in early pregnancy.\n\n",

I'm not sure if it makes a difference, but I only menstrate for 3 days (does that mean  I am not very fertile?).  Anyway, about two weeks ago my boyfriend and I had sex using a comdom.  However, I fear I may've been ovulating at that time. Then, just yesterday he put his penis inside of me without a condom.  It was only for a few seconds and he didn't ejaculate, but I'm still worried.  What are my chances of being pregnant?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Well, by now you probably know your answer but I will post my comment for future reference for you and others who may read this reply.  During the pre-ejaculation stage there will be seminal fluid seeping from the tip of the penis and that fluid may contain sperm in it. There are normally hundreds of millions of sperms in the semen during ejaculation, some of this comes out prior to ejaculation. Basically, you are never \u201csafe\u201d from those little guys without some type of protection.  Any time there is vaginal penetration without protection or contraceptives the chances of pregnancy is present.  Home Pregnancy tests, how do they work? Home pregnancy urine tests measure hormone called human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) which is secreted by the fertilized egg when it implants into the lining of the uterus and starts forming its placenta. The hormone hCG will start getting into your bloodstream in about 1 week after fertilization and will double about every two days. The sensitivity levels will very depending upon the maker of the pregnancy test so the best time to test is about 1 week past the day the menstruation was expected. I know it\u2019s hard to wait but the only 100% positive answer to the question \u201cAm I pregnant\u201d is time.   If you keep getting negative urine tests and still haven't started your cycle, go see your Physician and get checked right away. If your test comes up positive, go see your Physician or Midwife right away than too\n\n",

I have had bloating, fatige, cramping in my breasts and pelvic area, but I have researched and seen that these are also symptoms of pregnancy.

    "content": "Hi Adreamb851, Brethine is classified as a sympathomimetic drug. Both amphetamines and methamphetimines are sympathomimetic agents. So this is very possible for the drug test to be positive if you were tested from 2-7 hours to approximately 2-4 days (which is the expected drug clearance time for urine) of receiving the medication brethine. Drugs of abuse tested by blood, urine, or saliva can only detect whether or not a specific drug is present at the time of the test performance. If you tested positive in the time frame mentioned, obtain your record of receiving the brethine and if the positive drug screen can't be removed from your record it can at least be noted that you received this particular drug and is likely the cause. I hope this information is helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "You might want to try anither pregnancy test... depending on how much pregnancy hormone your body produced, if indeed you are pregnant could affect the outcome of the test. By now, you should be able to get a more precise answer from a test. Also you should try urinating on the stick first thing in the morning, this will be when you will have the most appearance of the pregnancy hormone, if you still come up negative, there could many reasons why you did not have a period. One could have been stress from breaking up with your boyfriend, Or if you recently have taken up a physical activity or have increased any physical activity this could change the pattern of your cycles, the best thing to do is to schedule an appointment with your gyn regardless of the reason, just to put your mind at ease and to correct any problem that may be underlying. Good Luck!!\n\n",

You should be OK; the basic one is that of increased risk of rupture of the scar, but that is a very low risk. Now, from the physical standpoint, it's just darn hard on the body to get pregnant again- your risk of anemia is higher and the physical stress is more, let alone the fact that you're now carrying for two other lives.   But hang in there. It's been done lots and altho it may be hectic and tiring right now, as those two grow up, you'll have lots of fun-and noise.  This said from a mother of 5.\n\n",

It is one of the safer antihistaminic drugs that can be used in pregnancy. If it is true that it interferes with the results of a pregnancy test, it would be more likely to give a false negative rather than  a false positive result.  The drug acts for up to 12 hours and traces will therefore not be present in the blood 4 days after discontinuing the drug.    A blood pregancy test is a more accurate test, so you can have that done for confirmation.  I hope this information is helpful.  Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM\n\n",

    "content": "Okay not sure how to go about this so I\u2019m just going to come out with it and say what\u2019s on my mind. I am now 39 years old and only have one child. I had two miscarriages before I had my son which will be 21 this year. When I was younger I was a little on the wild side and was seeing this one guy off and on that ended up giving me Chlamydia and something else. I don\u2019t even remember what it was I was very young and didn\u2019t really realize how bad things like this can be. Anyways I have not gotten pregnant since I had these std\u2019s and that was 19 to 20 years ago and I have never taken anything not to get pregnant. I figure I was probably sterilized from these diseases. I never really paid attention to it because I was never at the point of wanting another child. I am not getting any younger, my son is grown and I have found someone that I would really like to have a child with. I was really really overweight for a long time and thought maybe that might of had something to do with it but I wasnt overweight right away and I never got pregnant so I know that isn\u2019t it. Is there any home tests out there that you can take to test your fertility and if I am sterile from this is there anything that can be done about it? I\u2019m not rich but I\u2019m not poor either but I can\u2019t afford any big bills to get pregnant and I really want a baby bad. It\u2019s to the point that I stay depressed all the time because I can\u2019t get pregnant. Anyone that has any suggestions or help out there I would really appreciate it.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I have a suggestion. Try an ovulation predictor kit. Usually, you can get 5 sticks in a package for around 12 to 15 dollars. Follow the instructions in the package. The ovulation predictor kits will tell you if you are in fact ovulating. The sticks detect a hormone in your urine called LH (Luteinizing Hormone). When you detect the LH surge, it helps you to time sexual intercourse better to increase chances of pregnancy. Another way that is FREE and will give you an idea if you are ovulating is basal body temping. Go to http://www.fertilityfriend.com for an explanation of this process. If you are still having no luck, the only option would be a reproductive specialist. Please keep in mind, even healthy couples with no health problems can take up to one year to conceive a child.

I also use Fertility Friend website and have been charting my BB Temps each morning. I am on my 3rd IUI with Clomid and HCG Trigger shot.  Hoping that this 3rd one works.

    "content": "Okay, here's the situation my periods are ALWAYS on time and ALWAYS 5 days long. Now in January my period came at the normal time, but only lasted two days...no big deal. My husband and I had intercourse on the very next day, being January 12th, then again on the 14th, 15th, 17th, 19th, 20th, 21st and 23rd. On the morning of the 26th, I woke up feeling extremely nauseated and I spent just about all of the a.m. hours in the bathroom, but was feeling better by about 1 in the afternoon. I also noticed that whenever I used the bathroom on that day, there was some light pink spotting, and it was there a little bit on the next day. But then it was gone. For the next few days I felt a little sick to my stomach, but was otherwise okay and I still feel a little nauseated from time to time...just a stomach bug I thought. When I started my \"period\" on the 15th, it wasn't normal, no cramps or anything, just my breasts a little swollen and tender, and it wasn't \"bloody\" like a normal period, it was kind of pink when I would wipe and a little brownish on the pantyliner and VERY, VERY light...not even enough to cover a pantyliner. And so far, it's been gone since late this afternoon. I guess what I'm wondering is if this could be implantation bleeding? Or am I just wishful thinking???\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  Well I understand your concerns since your period is always a certain way and now it is much different. First off, implantation bleeding 'normally' occurs about 5-7 days past your ovulation date. Have you neen basal charting to where you would KNOW your ovulation dates? Are you trying to conceive? Implantation bleeding can vary in appearance but is normally light. And also note that not ALL women experience implantaion bleeding. It looks as if your cycle was about 37 days, is that right? Give me some more info and it will help me to help you more.   Cycle length this time Cycle length normally Charting? Trying to conceive? Tested yet?  Of course you know the only way to know for a fact is a pregnancy test. And there is a good possibility you could get a result at this time.\n\n",

I also know from my 3 previous pregnancies that every single pregnancy is different. My length this time was between 30 and 35 days, I don't have my calendar right now so I can't tell you exactly. My cycle length is normally 35 days. I haven't tested yet cause I don't want to be disappointed. Also, I have not had enough fluid to use anything; however, I was using a pantyliner just in case the flow picked up, but it never did. And it only lasted about 4 days. And the funny thing is that my mother just asked me a couple of hours ago if I was pregnant!!!!! Thanks for any info that you may have!!!! Also, I'm going to get test tonight and do it first thing in the morning before anyone gets up!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Rhonda,   Well I hope you get whatever answer you want.  It is really hard to say. The bleeding/discharge you got for 4 days probably is not implantation bleeding. The only reason I think that is because it seems a bit too late for that to take place. But if it was not like a period at all, you may have missed a period indeed. I would think it could be implantation bleeding if you were telling me it occured like 2-3 weeks after the first day of your last period, but in this case seems like you got this \"flow\" about 4-5 weeks after the first day of the last period. Confusing.....I know.    I know that the disappointment is hard to endure but a test is the only way to really start to piece this puzzle together. Please let me know, I am curious to see myself.   Good Luck.\n\n",

My first level was 86, 2 days later it was 73, then 2 days following it was 46.  This would indicate I lost the pregnacy.  However, 1 week after the third test, I had another level tested and it went up to 86.  What does this mean? Am I at risk for anything dangerous since this is the weekend and I cannot get a hold of my doctor?  Do the HCG levels play a part if a \"normal\" baby will be preoduced?  Can it possibly be that I released another egg and the sperm was camping out?  I did have a 5 day bleeing spell where I assumed that my lining was leaving.  What do I do? Thanks,\n\n",

    "content": "I thougt of answering this question... though it might be too late... I think it is a good question and many people might find the answer useful to them... The difference between test results can be due to a \"real\" change in the hormone level... in this case your tests show that the pregnancy was being lost.. and all of a sudden ...things are returning to a seemingly normal state... now if this is true... then the possibility that your pregnancy is not normal is high... as this pattern of fluctuation in the hormone level is usually seen in pregnancies with an abnormal placenta.... and you will need to see your doctor to resolve the condition.... Having said that... the previous situation is not common...   the more obvious situation is that the test is being repeated too frequently...at a time where the \"accepted\" error in measuring a test is more than the \"real \" difference in level that can be measured...  hope i didn't confuse you there...    but let us assume that when a test measurement is (10)...and the \"accepted error\" in the test reading would be (+ or - [2])...   the \"real\" test result is between 8 and 12..... now let us assume that the first test was \"really\" 8.... the second was \"really\" 10 and the third was really 12.... the test results reported by the lab can show any sequence of numbers between 8 and 12 and still be \"accepted\"    Hope you got the idea    Now hopefully you can tell us now what happened after one month of your confusing tests...may be you could explain it better than me\n\n",

Any discharge from the breast (when not expected, such as during breastfeeding) should be medically checked.  I would also suggest you do a Google or other search on Depo-Provera and see what other women have experienced. We are not all alike when it comes to our responses to medications. And this is true of hormones. It is my belief (from personal experience as well as hearing others' experiences) that any hormone manipulation must be done carefully, delicately and requires specialized skill.  I would not delay checking your symptoms with your doctor, as well as reading up and educating yourself use of hormones and alternative birth control. Please keep me posted on how it goes.

My levels were 0.3!  I tried a cream on my wrists and we upped the levels twice because I didn't notice any change.  I started the cream in July of 04 and stayed on it through September.   My doctor suggested I try Avlimil to see if that works.  I have been on for about 2 months and don't notice any change yet but will give it some more time.  Anyway, we are hoping to try to get pregnant again this fall.  I have had NO trouble getting pregnant the last two times and am wondering if low testosterone will change that.  Also, what more can I do about the low levels?  Is it something I should push with my doctor some more.  I'm so frustrated I've just given up and my husband and I compromise.  He doesn't get sex as much as he'd like, and I do it whether I want to or not.  I'm too young for this and want it to change, but also am worried about it hindering conception.  Please help!  Thanks!!!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Ms. Nahlers:  Perhaps by now you're feeling better. I hope so. I'm always interested and empathic when I hear women having difficulties that may be related to hormones--I am myself recently post-menopausal, and I can see where being only 30 and having these difficulties is distressing for you.  There are so many things that can affect our libido (sex drive), and hormone levels, and the various sex and other hormones (eg. thyroid)  all act with and on one another to create balance in normal healthy folks. You must have a very busy existence there with your two youngsters, and though it may not be your situation, it is not uncommon for mothers to feel as you do just from the stress involved in managing a a busy young family!  And, there are so many things I would want to know about you in order to help: As a nurse, and if we were one-on-one doing an assessment I'd ask you all about your lifestyle, stresses, anxiety, depression, leisure/work habits. I'd want to know if you're taking birth control pills and/or medications; are you breastfeeding your son; are you over/under weight; and much more of your health history and so on. I'd want to know if this occurred after your first childbirth. And so on.  I would not think your difficulty could be diagnosed and treated with just obtaining a testoserone level and taking creams and OTC remedies. You might take a look through the website I've linked here -- I just found it by Google searching on matters relating to your problem. Very good information on hormones.  ** http://www.jeanhailes.org.au/default.htm  ** LISTENING TO YOUR HORMONES, by Gillian Ford, was a marvelously informative and helpful book for me, also.  You may wish to have a more thorough workup by your current doctor, or an endocrinologist, or gyn who is sympathetic to focuses more precisely on hormonal relationship to women's wellbeing. as well as to answer your questions about fertility.  I hope I may have helped you if you're still suffering.   Holly\n\n",

    "content": "I am just a little worried because this is my second month on clomid.  The first month was 100mg day 3-7w/hcg trigger shot and the second month was 150mg 3-7 no trigger shot. The thing that worries me is that my flow the first month was extremely heavy with huge amounts of tissue discharge.  My flow started exactly on day 27 (1/25/05) of my cycle which was pretty much normal. I am usually a few days late or early it doesn't normally come exactly on time, but I have never been 17 days late.  I am wondering if there could be something wrong with me or the clomid might be affecting my body negatively.  I have taken 2 hpt's and they both of come out negative.  My question is should I wait a while longer to see what happens or try to see my doctor?  *lucy*\n\n",

This forum is only here to help you understand. In that sense I will provide you with information but will not answer your question.  It is the first few pills of the cycle which are critical in stopping the process of ovulation. As such \"break-through\" ovulation, though rare, can occur. Implantation bleeding can happen at the time the fertilized egg implants in the uterus, on average between 6 to 12 days past ovulation.   Call your doctor even if this is not pregnancy going into surgery with break through bleeding without telling your doctor may be hazardous!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amy The amount of daily milk produced is related proportionately to the total duration and frequency of sucking - this pattern becomes established on about the third day of breast feeding.  Your milk supply is a matter of \"supply and demand\" -- the more your baby demands, the more your body will make. So you can feel comfortable nursing as often as your baby wants.  You can be sure your baby is eating well if baby if he\\she has 6 or more wet diapers and 2-3 stools each day (after your milk comes in), shows a steady increase in weight (check baby's weight at 1 to 2 weeks following birth), has an alert, healthy appearance, and you can feel baby sucking and hear baby swallowing while feeding.  Your fuel supply for milk production comes from two sources: energy stored as body fat during pregnancy and extra energy from food choices. Adding an extra serving or so from each food group during the day provides the extra energy and nutrients you need.  Drink enough fluids to satisfy your thirst and prevent dehydration. As always, you need at least 8 to 12 cups of fluids daily -- more if you feel thirsty. Sip a glass of water, milk, or juice while nursing your baby. Milk and juice also supply some of the extra nutrients needed for breast-feeding. Hope this helps.\n\n",

Of course, your bleeding could be this, or it could be a period; its hard to say.

At times, there can be issues with an epidural not working, but usually this does not occur. Some things that could cause this to happen would be inproper placement, or in some rare cases the epidural could be pulled out of place. Given your history with your tailbone issue, I doubt that there would be an issue with you receiving the epidural. I think most women agree that it is a wonderful tool for coping with the pain of child birth. There will always be \"horror stories\" about any treatment, but I am sure you will be fine.

This is because approximately 50% of women begin ovulating again prior to the return of their menstrual cycles.

    "content": "I am 25 and my husband and I just started in December to start trying to have a baby. I went off the pill and did not get pregnant in December. The first day of my last period was Dec. 23. I typically have a cycle of 28 days. It is now the 30th of January and no sign of it yet. I have taken so many pregnany test and they have all come back negative. I spoke to my mom and she said when she was pregnant she had really low levels of HCG, so she always had negative pregnancy tests, but when she went to her doctor, she would be pregnant. Are low HCG levels hereditary? I don't want to become disappointed, so I wanted to know when is to eary to go to the doctors. I just went off the pill so I could just be running late, but I've been having unfamiliar symptoms- are these signs of pregancy, last week I ate regulary and had horrible heartburn, I have never in my life had heartburn before and last night I had it agian. I've been constipated and been eating regularly. Also, I've been very fatigued. My breast are not tender but are the ones I 've listed signs of pregancy with in the first 6 weeks, or is that too premature? When should I make an appointment to see a doctor, or should I wait?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Terry, first off, congrats on deciding to have a baby!  Hope things go well for you. =)  Regardless of the fact that your periods seem to be so regular in their appearances, the fact that you have just recently gone off the pill suggests that a late period would not be uncommon.  With the sudden change in hormonal levels, it can take your body anywhere between 1 and 3 months to re-start its own hormone production and get back into its natural rhythm.  I'm hoping for you, but don't get your hopes up too high.   As for the hCG levels, I'm unsure as to whether or not low levels are hereditary, but if you would like, you can try testing first morning urine, when the dilution by fluids should be at its lowest point in the day.  The presence of hCG is supposed to double (approximately) every two days, and this might also help you if your levels are low.  I would wait another two weeks or so and if your period has not come around, either test your urine again or see your doctor.  Heartburn, constipation, and fatigue are certainly common early pregnancy symptoms- the heartburn is caused by the uterus swelling and pushing upwards as it grows and the increasing levels of hCG also slows down digestion and allows for an increase of stomach acids.  Constipation is caused by pregnancy hormones slowing down bowel functions to optimize the absorption time of vitamins and nutrients.  Unfortunately, constipation usually only worsens as pregnancy advances. Fatigue I think is self explanatory.  Hope I've helped at least a bit.  If you have more specific questions, you're welcome to post again or email me and I'll be more than happy to help (I've done extensive studying on the topic for a few of my aunts).  I've had periods delay for more than six weeks simply from a change in hormone levels due to a sudden increase in exercise, so I would wait at least another few weeks to ask a doctor.  Good luck.  -Shoeless\n\n",

    "content": "Sure it's possible.  Both the fact that your mother had low HCG levels and the fact that this is still a bit early in the potential pregnancy show that there is a possibility that the tests simply aren't doing their job.  You have some symptoms and you report that they are irregular, especially the heartburn, which also means there might be a factor that induced them.  Still, don't get your hopes up too high for at least another week or two.  Going off the pill does funny things to your hormone levels and you may just be experiencing side-effects.  There's a chance.  Monitor yourself over the next few weeks and see what happens.  -Shoeless\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Amanda, have to say that's a pretty big stretch there.  Of course, it's possible that you are pregnant, but if you have never had unprotected sex AND you've never missed a pill, I find it unlikely that the two methods would fail in conjunction (though by no means is it impossible).  You have to remember that being on the pill with regular periods does not automatically mean you will always have constant periods.  A simple surge of hormones in your body, or lack thereof, could account for a light period.  And having a period at all would make a pregnancy unlikely, regardless of how light it was.  If you miss your next period, then I'd consider the possibility again, but for now, I wouldn't worry.  If you continue to have very light periods, I would simply ask your doctor about it to make sure there isn't a chemical imbalance that should not be there.  Hope I've helped, Shoeless\n\n",

Sometimes it is also difficult for an ultrasound to pick up certain images in women with a \"tipped or tilted\" uterus. Most generally in cases such as these a transvaginal ultrasound is used and visualizes structures a little more closely. Have you had any problems with the pregnancy to present (bleeding, etc.?)

    "content": "Hi,  The mainstay of diagnosis for pregnancy is a positive pregnancy test.  Certain symptoms and signs are suggestive of pregnancy, but none are diagnostic. It is important to diagnose pregnancy as promptly as possible when a period is missed in a sexually active woman, so that prenatal care can begin early and potentially harmful activities can be halted. Such activities include smoking (which is admitted in your profile), use of alcohol and harmful medications, and occupational chemical exposure (applicable to you as a hair stylist).  Laboratory and home pregnancy tests are at your disposal if a period is missed but the blood pregnancy test is a more efficient procedure because it is accurate at the time of the missed period.  I hope this information is helpful.    Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

    "content": "Getting pregnant isn't always easy. Very few couples conceive on the first try. In fact, even if everything is absolutely in perfect working order, you only have a 20-25% chance of conception each month. If you are under 30 (as in your case), and haven't conceived in 12 months, you should make an appointment to see your doctor as there could be some issues at play with are preventing you from getting pregnant. If you are over 35, and haven't succeeded in getting pregnant in six months, make an appointment to see your doctor, as infertility issues become more prevelant the older you get. If you are over 40, then do not delay in getting medical help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, I think I will hopefully become a person who works on this site soon because I know a good amount about pregnancy, conception, and birth. So I am gonna try to answer your question now:  FIrst of all, it is normal to sometimes measure ahead or behind. Usually, most women measure 0-2 weeks ahead, or behind. On December 31st, you were about 23 weeks pregnant. Measuring 26 weeks could mean a bigger baby, or it could mean a lot of other things.   The important question to ask yourself is, who else did you have sex with around the time you conceived this baby? Did you have sex with more than one person in the month of July or August? If there was only ONE person in those 2 months, it is probably their child; although only a paternity test can truly confirm that.   Best of Luck, Shelly, SN\n\n",

I have had my normal signs before my period starts (tender brests, some cramping, etc.) but still no bleeding. I am just worried and am wondering if either when you have sex the first time your period can tend to be late, or if there were the chance that I was pregnant do you get the normal signs of a period if you were to miss your period?\n\n",

Although it seems that when you use the bathroom after intercourse, the sperm comes out as well, (not all of it). Semen is the sperms transport vehicle, and they may number in the millions. For example, in a ml,(teaspoon) of semen there can be 20 million sperm. One of them will likely find its way to where they belong  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

I shouldn't have to worry, but the thought of a having a child right now, would frighten almost any 20 year old.  I guess another options to enforce birth control, would be to use condoms as well. Of course there's always abstinence...  Thanks for your input.\n\n",

    "content": "I've been taking tricyclin for a year. I have never missed a pill, the most that has happened is that I've taken it a couple hours later than my scheduled time. About two weeks ago, I noticed pink/brownish spotting 4-5 days before my period was due. I went to the clinic and after getting tested, I was told I had a UTI. Since then, my period progressed as scheduled, but was a little stranger than normal (more red) and seems to be prolonged. Also, I'm noticing brown spotting now toward the end of my period. Could this mean that I'm pregnant and the pink/brown spotting was implementation bleeding? Do urine analysis for UTI's detect pregnancy? Or, am I just paranoid?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello: Taking birth control pills a couple of hours late would not cause any problem. It is normal to have some bleeding with a UTI.  Also having brown spotting toward the end of your period just means that the menstrual fluid is drying up and will soon stop.  Unless you are having pain, nausea, vomiting I would not be concerned about the spotting.  However, there is always a tiny chance you can get pregnant even on birth control, so if you miss your next period you might want to check it out. Kind Regards, Carolyn\n\n",

My ring fingers were also slightly swollen and numb. They werent super swollen, but enough that I noticed and that when I bent at the joint they felt stiff.  This lasted about 3 hours. It went away and hasn't been back since.  I am approx. 8 weeks pg and I havent had many symptoms except major dizziness after eating and after showering. I get lightheaded and feel like I am going to vomit, but I have yet to do so. After the numbness went away I had a major episode of dizziness.

It's a cloudy kind of white dishcharge, breasts also feel abit fuller, but no soreness.  I am currently trying to get pregnant (quit birth control Sept 27th).  My last period was a couple days late (it was last week) and ended on day 4.  It almost always lasts all 7 days.  I've taken a home pregnancy test (yesterday), and an in-office urine test (Monday) and they were negative.  I also seem to have a problem with incontinence, and frequent urination.  I've been alittle sickly feeling (but I also have a cold).  I've been tired, but not really a huge change in fatigue, just noticable to me (which may also be the cold).  Alot of fluttering feeling in my abdomen also.  I have a toddler, so I've had the whole \"pregnancy feeling\" before... this just feels quite strange to me, sort of like I am pregnant... but still not sure.  Could these be signs of early pregnancy?  What of the breast leakage??  Please Help?!  Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sally- Hey hun.... I am not a nurse or anything.. however, I experience SEVERE heart burn DAILY due to pregnancy.... ( I am due on the 17th of this month YAY)  Anyway- I was going to suggest that if your heart burn continues, try taking \"SMOOTH DESOLVE TUMS\".... I have found that they work best for me...   Also, the way my OB doctor described to me the reasoning behind the acid relfex is that when a baby is developing, he/she is taking up ALOT of room. (obviousely)... and that you will experience heart burn as a result of the baby pushing upward on your stomach, making it hard for your tummy to do anything more than spasum. that,  in turn will cause your acid reflex... (or so I am told within pregnancy)  Anyway- I think that those smooth desolve tums are excellent. they work fast, and they are soothing to your stomach right away... pregnant or not    GOOD LUCK with everything!  -jessa\n\n",

    "content": "I am seventeen weeks pregnant, I was first diagnosed with a UTI at my first  prenatal appointment at ten weeks, but it was not treated until fourteen weeks. The doctor confused me with another patient ,and never perscribed my medication. The first antibiotic I used was macrobid, it was a seven day perscription twice a day. After finishing the medicine I still noticed symtoms so went to get another urine test , a week later my doctor called and, said I still have a UTI when she called I told her that I had a fever of 100.4 and haveing pains in the right lower side of my abdomen, and right lower side of back, I was also feeling very nausiated  she said I was probally just getting sick from haveing the UTI. The doctor perscribed bactim , My fever has gone away , but I am still haveing the pain in my right side , and back I am still nausiated , witch has not been a problem in this pregnancy, Is it possible that I might have a kidney infection ? I'm also concerned about takeing bactrim while pregnant.           Amy\n\n",

Bactrim is safe to use in second trimester (12 weeks to 24 weeks) and experts recommend avoiding its use during first trimester and at full term. So, I figure you should have no worry regarding it.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Ice_cream00,  Anal sex can not lead to pregnancy, period. Pregnancy results from normal intercourse as the sperms will fertilize the ovum (egg) and there are no ova (eggs) up the other way.  You, having your normal period, in addition to 2 negative pregnancy tests mean that there is no pregnancy.  If your fiance is not convinced, i think the best way is to go to a doctor to have a physical examination and a blood test for pregnancy which is the most accurate.

    "content": "I have been on birth control pills since I started my period because they were very painful and extremily irregular.  That was about 6 years ago.  I used to take a break in between each year but this time I had not taken a break at all.  I have been regularly on Birth Control with no breaks for about two and a half years now.  Just recently I have been having pregnancy symptoms (I think): I had pinkish blood (I think) about a week before my period.  My period only lasted three days and was pretty light.  That is very rare for me. I have been nausious a lot, especially in the morning.  I have these funny sore bumps on my nipples I feel preasure were I would usually feel period cramps but I had that short period about two weeks ago. I have been very tired lately.  Q - Is it possible that I could be pregnant even though I am pretty good about taking my pill every night?  Can birth control pills cause pregnancy-like symptoms if you have been taking them for a while?  I have never gotten these symptoms before and I have always used Ortho Trycyclin (I switched to Ortho Trycyclin Lo about three or four months ago).  I guess I should go see my doctor about this but I think I need a new doctor, she never seems to have enough time to answer my questions.  So I thought I'd ask you first.  If I am pregnant, can the birth control pills hurt the baby?  I'm not sure whether or not it's too soon to take a test.  Let me know what you think.\n\n",

It is also possible that you are pregnant because of the change in the pills as well.  When in doubt, do a home pregnancy test. They have become fairly reliable recently. Of course nothing is 100% reliable, false negatives can occur. The longer you wait, the higher chance that you will get a true positive.  The best of course is to have a blood test for pregnancy.

Sometimes they are not easy to hear because of the continuously changing position of the baby especially at this early stage.  If the fetal heart sounds were heard by your doctor before and now they are not, may be there is something to worry about, but if this is the first time that your doctor tries to hear the fetus' heart sounds at this early stage and he couldn't, i would not be that much alarmed.  Getting an ultrasound is the standard of care to check the fetus for any problems.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.

    "content": "Several weeks ago I posted a question that no one responded to.  I am still qurious and would like an answer.  In February my daughter gave birth to her first child, & my first grandchild.  She reported that she took three hits of marijuana 3 days prior to her delivery date.  She then tested positive for marijuana.  The baby was also tested.  He was negative.  How can this be?  It seems like he would test positive as well.  I have one medical opinion at this point.  My daughter's mother in-law asked a nurse about this.  She made the comment that it meant the mother was not using extensively and this could be an isolated occurence.  I was wondering if the negative test results of the child could determine how much marijuana was smoked, by my daughter, during her pregnancy?  Texas Gramp\n\n",

Galactorrhea may occur normally as during sexual intercourse in some women and may also be caused by several other causes including tumors of the brain that secrete excessive prolactin and some medications may lead to galactorrhea as well.   If this is a continuous problem that does not seem to stop by itself, it might be a good idea to have it checked out.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi sarahw, Stopping lactation is not going to be solution. Most young babies will make the transition from breast to bottle with a little encouragement, but for some it takes more effort. If your baby wants to continue to breastfeed, you might want to rethink why you want to wean at this time.  Sometimes, a mum makes the assumption she is going to wean at around eight or nine months but when the time arrives, realises there is no good reason for weaning and continues to breastfeed. If you really want or need to wean \u2014 for example, if you are going back to work \u2014 then start by substituting formula (for a baby under a year) or whole milk (if the baby is over a year as in your case) for one breastfeed each day. Once you feel ready you can drop another breastfeed and so on. Since your baby is over six months, health visitors recommend you offer her a beaker, rather than a bottle. Try one with a soft, flexible spout to begin with.  With an older, verbal toddler, start by putting limits on where and when you breastfeed by tell your child. When you are at the point when you want to stop entirely, you simply tell him/her.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 22 year old female with a history of anxiety and panic attacks.  Other than the constant anxiety I am pretty much a healthy woman up until a couple of months ago when I started having all these strange symptoms that don\u2019t seem to run together.   The first symptom to show up was this abdominal pain that was behind my belly button that felt like a deep stabbing pain.  I went to the doctor and he said that it may be a hernia from a previous pregnancy (my son is 1 year old) I was thinking that I could be pregnant again so I set an appointment with my OB because I was convinced that there was something more.  It was stressing me to the point where I cried every few minutes.  My OB concluded that it is pregnancy pains and that there is no hernia and when I stressed the fact that was not what it was that there was something wrong he laughed it off and told me I was worrying.    Well the pain has been gone for a week and now I have these symptoms of a cold sinus congestion, chest congestion (with basically non productive cough and achy chest) I also began getting the sore throat which is not tender in the throat but rather on the outside of my neck (is this possible?)  It is not constant but changes from side to side and may or may not ache.  Now that I have had these symptoms for a couple of days, my stomach is beginning to hurt in the same manner except it is no longer located only at the belly button but radiated from there all over my lower abdomen. It is causing me high anxiety and panic attacks which are not good for me to deal with but also I am 8 weeks pregnant.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: A lot of symptoms...Help",
    "content": "Dear ama_nan,  Abdominal pain is sometimes difficult to diagnose. The diagnosis of the cause of abdominal pain relies entirely on the associated other symptoms and the physical examination.  Having pain around the umbilicus (belly button) might point to early stages of any abdominal process like appendicitis or intestinal obstruction or having an infection in the umbilicu or having a hernia in it, but is it specific? The answer is no.  You did not mention whether you are having any other symptoms like burning urination for example (points to urinary tract infection for example) or nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, constipation, is the pain related to food in any way, does it improve by anything, anything makes it worse?  i think that when you went to your doctor, he asked you all of these questins and then he/she performed a physical exam. Now, comes the phydical examination which points to the source of the pain in most of the cases. Sometimes, some confirmatory tests are needed for the diagnosis as well like ct scans of the abdomen or blood tests to make sure that the organs in the abdomen like the liver or the pancreas for example are not either the cause of the pain or affected by the process in any way.  Regarding your cold symptoms and the belly button pain, i think that they might be two different and separate entities.  Is there a possibility that they might be connected to each other and the answer is yes, it is possible, this usually occurs in children who get a sore throat and have inflammation of the throat and then swallow the pus instead of spitting it and this leads to abdominal pain.  Can pregnancy cause the abdominal pain, yes it can and it can also cause the nasal and sinus congestion type symptoms as well.  If you are having cough, that was continuous and hard, it might lead to abdominal muscle strain and pain as well.  Regarding your neck pain, yes the pain can sometime be referred to somewhere else other than the original site of inflammation.  Your neck pain can be totally unrelated to your other symptoms.  If the abdominal pain continues, you have to see your doctor once more, a ct scan of the abdomen this early in pregnancy, i think is not recommended unless it is absolutely necessary.

She is at the beginning of the menstrual flow phase which lasts about 3-5 days so there is no support for a fertilized egg to attach to the endometrium/uterus.  It won't be for at least 8-10 days until she could maybe support a fertilized egg which by then your sperm will be long dead.  Also the chances that she released 2 eggs is so slight that your sperm won't encounter an egg.  This infomation is probably somewhat not correct but what I'm trying to get at is ---don't worry about it but wait for the doctor to settle your fears.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear westcoasta,  Besides being pregnant, secondary amenorrhea (menstruation stopping) can also be caused by other causes.  In some women, menopause (the age where the women starts not to have menses ever again) can sometimes be as early as 35 years especially if it runs in the family.  So, if menopause comes early in your family, then may be this is early menopause. You will have some irregular menses at the begining and then menses are going to stop.  There is a blood test that can be done to verify this. It is called FSH.   i suggest yo consult with your doctor to be checked and examined and have a pelvic exam (to see whether you are pregnant or not) and do the blood tests (both the pregnancy and the FSH) if he/she thinks that this a reasonable thing to do.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear westcoasta,  Thank you very much for the update.  When you had the miscarriage, did you have dilatation and curettage (d&c) or not? How soon after that you had your period, how heavy was it? and how many times have you had your period since?  After a miscarriage if you had a d&c, sometimes they over curette the uterus and it takes a while for the lining of the uterus to come back, sometimes if it was really overdone, the uterus collapses on itself and fibrous tissue is formed and menses never occur.  It is unlikely that you have early menopause with this history of just being pregnant but still a remote possibility.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and waiting for your response.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

There are five different antibodies in human function at different level, although to control infection.  Antibody that involved in graft rejection can not cross placental barrier.  Remember plancental barrier is not foreign matter unlike fetus that's protected by placental barrier Arun\n\n",

    "content": "Dear bkrueger42, I am not a gynecologist or a radiologist for that matter, but I can tell you this: The femurs are one of the things used to assess growth and development of a fetus. It should be seen by the 30th week and is actually best measured by the 14 week of pregnancy. I do not know what your doctor means by saying he cannot see the femurs. It could be a technical problem. If the baby had any congenital abnormalities your doctor would tell you directly or he would request further investigation. You are best to discuss this with your doctor directly. Did the report for the US come in? If so then post it here and I will try my best to help.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "This is my first visit to this site.  I'm not quite sure how much info is needed but I'll try to describe my problem as best as I can.  A few months ago I started noting that my lower back would \"pop\" from time to time when I moved.  (Don't know if this is related to the real problem, though.)  For the past couple of months I've noted that around the time of menses my low back would ache.  I tried massage but it only seemed to irritate the pain rather than soothe it.  The pain has progressed to the point that it has become every day this past week or 2.  THe pain goes from about the middle low back, across the right buttock, down to my knee (backside) and down to my ankle.  It hurts constantly now but before it was hurting worst in the mornings when I first got out of bed.  After I moved around a bit and took some ibuprofen it would improve.  Lately it isn't improving.  It hurts to sit and today it's hurting to drive my car.  I've been sitting on a heating pad for the past week with some improvement.  But the pain returns after a while.  Ibuprofen does little to help.    Can you give me any ideas as to what it might be?\n\n",
