    "title": "Slightest excercise leading to migraine etc...",
    "content": "Hi all, im new to the boards, and having been to numerous doctors/specialists im really hoping someone can help.  Ok, here goes;  Started feeling pretty ill back in 2005, Went to docs and they said its pretty much because i was overweight ( i had been to the gym a year prior to this for a long time, built up muscle etc) But i decided to take their word for it and lose as much as i could. I thought the best way to go about this was the personal trainer route.  Booked in for my first session, this went fine, he really got me working hard and had one hell of a workout.. felt the usual aches ect but felt generally very good.  Now, this it where it all goes wrong. i went in for my second session, halfway through i started feeling very ill, dizzy,faint, sweat was POURING off my head, face went white and couldnt really stand. I talked this through with the P.T and we tried varios options, not eating before the workout, eating before, varios drinks snacks ect but nothing worked, this went on for the next 7-10 sessions until i finally gave up.This was not the usual unfit feeling i have had many many times over the years.  Went to a neurologist and he sent me for Cat scans and MRI and nothing showed up. After these sessions i would experience a feeling like my head was going to exploded then would instantly get a migraine. I have since, for the last FIVE YEARS, tried medication, had heart tests done, treadmil tests, a lumbar puncture and nothing has helped or shown anything unsual. Its got the point since then, that i feel terrible every day,from when i wake up to when i go to sleep. Very lethargic, my legs wont always work properly, sick, sometimes dizzy and spaced out.   a few months ago i decided to try a chiropractor, as it seems all this trouble was coming from my neck/shoulder area, perhaps the muscle or neck itself was tense or out of line and pressing on nerves or bloodflow causing all this.  The chiropractor after 5/6 sessions just made the whole problem worse, i now feel much worse and have regular migraines (which are being helped at the moment by sanomigran) Since this i can no longer shout, or even sing without getting head pressure leading onto a migraine and feeling very ill!  Please if anyone has the slightest idea what this could be, or any advice please reply. Anything at all would be greatly appreciated, i want my life back!  P.S i have now lost 6 stone and down to a healthy weight.  Kind regards,  Chris\n\n",

    "content": "I am 28 and was a smoker for 15 years - I quit just over a year ago and have had headaches ever since. I never got headaches before I quit smoking - For the past 3 days I have had a headache (pressure in my head, eyes and ears) I am also dizzy and feel off balance like my body is weighing to the right - I have also started to have anxiety/panic attacks which I never got before.   I work on a computer all day - I don't know if that could be the cause of it - I have started to take breaks every 2 hours so I am not constantly staring at a screen - since it hurts my eyes to do so - my eyes are also sensitive to light and the TV and my vision is a bit blurry - I have to look at things by turning my head to the side or closing one eye as it hurts my eyes/head when I look straight on.  I went to a doctor about my headaches before and she tried to put me on anti-depressants even though I am not depressed (I did not take them). I went to another doctor because I was having headaches again and woke up one morning confused and not knowing where I was - she asked if I smoked weed (I do not) she said she would send me to get an MRI but I am from Europe and my insurance will only cover me in the U.S for emergencies I can't afford to pay $2000-$3000.   Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Since you complain of headaches after nicotine withdrawal, the important thing here is to watch your coffee intake.Many a times caffeine which is taken to relieve headaches becomes a factor here for causing headaches and dizziness because the absorption of caffeine gets enhanced post withdrawal.So this could be a factor and you should cut your coffee intake by 50%.Hope this information  is useful.

    "title": "MIGRAINE AND SUDDEN MEMORY LOSS",
    "content": "Hi,  I've been suffering from migraines for years. After treatment they went away for about 15 years. In the last 6 months they started coming back but they were very mild.   From saturday morning until monday morning i had a constant migraine but not painful enough to feel that i have to lie down all the time.  This morning my migraine got worst and by 1 in the afternoon it got really bad to the point that i started being sick ... From that point onwards i don't remember much ..   My son found me and he said that i couldn't remember what happened in the last few weeks. I got back from holiday on saturday but i couldn't remember it. He said that i started shouting and panicking and he had to call the ambulance. He said that he took me to the hospital and i still couldn't remember my holiday or what happened in the last week.   The doctor saw me and gave me strong painkillers and the migraine started fading out i started remembering again. I had blood exams and a brain scan at the hospital and it all came out fine. I'm at home now but i still feel a bit confused and my migraine has started to go away.  What do you think caused the memory loss ?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Your symptoms seem to fit in with Transient Global Amnesia, and there is compelling evidence that this occurs in some patients with history of migraine.These patients did not have significant headache or photophobia during attack.The clinical features are typical.Paroxysmal transient loss of memory with striking loss of immediate events.Old memories are retained.This generally resolves in a day or so.Generally it is a single event and recovery is a rule.It is postulated that that the migraine affecting the verebro- basilar blood vessels leads to these symptoms.Transient ischemic attacks and seizures form the differential diagnosis.

About 2 month ago, she had a Grand Mal Seizure. She claims that since that day, she will get headaches and facial pain - more specifically jaw pain. They start faint but then get worse. The only way to make them go away is to go to sleep.  She said that one doctor said that this pain like \"mini seizures\". I don't know if that is correct but i would greatly take an opinion on this case. I cannot remember what medicine she is taking, but I can find out if you need it.  Thanks!!  Evan McMenamy\n\n",

Two further epsiodes, one last month with resulted in a fall and related to turning quickly, no dizzyness but complete loss of balance. One further episode on getting out of bed in the morning, again no dizzyness. Can prolonged symptoms of my dural tap cause this vertigo or could Meniers be triggered by the tap?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi TILLYTWOTWO, Dr.Jagesh has already highlighted the possible side effects of facet injections. Where was the facet injection given in your case? Cervical, thoracic or lumbar? Cervical paravertebral facets are perhaps the most commonly involved. The prevalence of facet joint pain in patients with chronic spinal pain has been established as 15% to 50% in low back pain, and 54% to 60% in neck pain.  If your problem is related to cervical spondylosis and spondyloarthrosis, there could be another explanation for the symptoms that you describe.  The cervical vertebrae have openings in their transverse processes called foramina transversaria. The vertebral artery runs through these foramina (C6-C1) into the base of the brain, joins its fellow vertebral artery  and forms the basilar artery. In their course through these foramina, they can get compressed by osteophytes and cause vertebrobasilar insufficiency which can cause several symptoms including nausea, vertigo and \u201cdrop attacks\u201d( a feeling of sudden weakness in the knees and the person may crumple). This needs to be excluded in your case. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, marci,  What a distressing situation for you!  The combination of the headaches and the anxiety over what may be causing them can be debilitating.  Has someone suggested the diagnosis of pseudotumor cerebrii headaches to you?  Have the related tests (CT scan, evaluation of your visual status, MR venography, and/or lumbar puncture, for example) been done to confirm it?  If you have not seen a neurologist for a complete evaluation of your headaches, please do so.  I always recommend that a person maintain a daily record of their symptoms, including when they occur, their severity on a scale of 1 to 10 (1 being very mild and 10 being severe), their duration, what if anything helps relieve them, what you were doing when they occurred (or just prior to when they occurred), and any other data that you consider significant.  Always take your record with you when you see your physician(s), as it can help your doctor determine any diagnostic patterns and the timing of any medications for maximum effectiveness.  Meanwhile, relaxation techniques during the headaches and a mild exercise program may help while you're awaiting your doctor's appointment.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

I have tried MANY MANY different treatments in the past the ones that helped the most were Inpatient IV DHE (Dihydroergotamine) and Lignocaine infusions and IV Largactil Infusions.  Apart from this Ii take IM injections of DHE for severe headaches/ migraines as well as IM Maxolon for the Nausea.  I have tried many oral medications to both prevent and arrest the headaches but have had either allergic reactions to them or the side effects have been to severe (I have a very allergic nature in general), I also have tried nasal sprays and the like to arrest the migraines/ headaches and they worked a treat for ages but then stopped working as effectively after a long time and the DHE IM Injections (which I do myself, or my husband does for me) are just great (apart from having to get stuck/ stick myself with a needle. They work with 1 hr and do NOT rebound as some of the other med's did, where I got another one the next day or later that day etc as a rebound).  I found a GOOD Neurologist was the best for getting the help I needed, they first ruled out more severe conditions, like Brain Tumours, AVM's. bleeds etc etc etc  Good luck and I hope you get answers and a treatment(s) that work for you soon.\n\n",

He can not sleep unless he take Ambien but he got the shocks in his head before the Ambien so it's not related to that.  The only medicine he takes is 1,125mg of Depakote (for 4 years).  Could this be the Depakote doing this to him.  None of the doctors know what it is and he is suffering in the hospital (psychiatric) because he had a manic attack from stress over no one knowing why he gets the shocks, ringing in the ears and being off balance.  He has had a MRI of the brain and nothing, he has had complete ear testing and nothing.  He has been given several drugs with the depakote and still nothing.  He was so doped up from all the drugs they gave him that he could hardly speak or walk.  He can not live like this.  I really need to find out if the depakote is doing this or if there is a underlying reason physical that is causing this.  Other than this he is very smart (college graduate), a computer programmer, but these shocks in the head, ringing in the ears and being off balance has destroyed his ability to function.

Please let me know as soon as possible so I can let the doctors know what you recommended.  Thanks again, Dee\n\n",

The pdoc is giving him Klonopin and upping his Trazadone to see if it helps if not when he sees the neuro doc I will ask if he can have an EEG done and a sleep study too. Thank you but I'm still concerned about the depakote doing this.  Pdoc said he never hear of it but that doesn't rule of the possibility that it might be the depakote.\n\n",

I also have this problem, and I am currently trying to figure out why I have random shocks coming from my head, sometimes into my arm and hand.  When this happens, it is like being frightened, and I wince.  I also have ringing in my ears, and can actually hear and feel the pulse in my head.  Sometimes,  just looking right or left will bring on a shock, or wave of shocks.  Any sudden movement on my part can bring them on.  I have had a CTScan and it was supposedly normal.  I have recently stopped taking Lexapro, an antidepressant. I am supposed to start Effexor now, but I am hesitant to start any new drug during this condition. A doctor told me it might be neuralgia, but I do not have any pain, just shocks. Please help me, if you know anything about what may be causing these shocks. Thanks!\n\n",

This is  ashame that people have to suffer because of either stupidity or simply do not care, new medical problems that is now occurring with so many new meds out how do you keep up Mr./MS. Doctor,  I hate to think this is a sign of the future to come of the new MD  doctors, yes I know M.D. seem to have all gone south when it comes to more than one disease, if we have to buy a doctor for every problem we have we are in trouble, if you do then the doctor will refer you to another doctor until you run through most specialists, why? Is the medical schools so money crazy that they can't teach our doctors more than one thing at a time?  I understand \"specialty\" in one area or the other but give me  a break on the doctors being so dumb they have no idea what the other parts of the body is doing or not doing, a suggestion or a maybe would be nice but no it is MRI's and a zillion dollars in tests given and still you may not know a thing and I don't after 3 months, I say if you can't fix me you should get no pay, if you the doc. want me to test for a zillion things then go back to school you should have some idea what is wrong,,,a mechanic of any motor driven vehicle can change out parts until he/she hits the problem and you pay for all the unwanted or needed parts plus the extra labor and this is exactly the way it feels when I go to my personal doctor as many others do, if I die while you are working on,me you should not get a dime no matter the excuse/s, my doctor is simply dumb when he says \"I have no idea\" BUT we can run some  tests, well yes we can providing we have the money and not all guess work to replace parts until we get it right or maybe not, we will have to just die because of not truly caring under educated over paid or just too busy with too many patients to care for just one at a time successfully,  girls and boys it has all turned into money, a racket,,not every doctor is a parasite, some do care but damn few,,,oh yes, my now and 3rd MD in 4 years gave me a prescription that will knock me out,  why would you want to patch us up and not research just a tad Mr. Doctor to actually help a paying customer and build a rep. of helping your paying customers thus making them feel better and their lives are worth a little more than a dollar sign, I don't care how you perceive or dislike what I am saying Mr. Doctor it is the truth and I see it every day, I visit the older sweet hearts that everyone has thrown a side, they have pains and mental suffering that no pill will fix,   it would help them and us doctor if we could assume we would be cared for just a hair more than a animal or we were worth a little more the almighty dollar in your eyes, we are human and should be treated a such,,once a sharp dressed Marine recruiter convinced I could stop a bullet by becoming a leather neck well he was wrong,, but you know when you are young folks can snow you pretty easy with words pretty easy  from those we respect. You should by any terms act as a doctor not a bank account or a new graduated Vetenerian or simply state on your front door in bold lettering \"I am a quack\" that is so money hungry that I must first and utmost pay (me) up front or (my receiptnest) before I will make a educated guess at what is wrong with your body, if I can't figure it out I will give you some pills that will knock you out so you will not know what is happing in this world or care what is happing any place, just a little truth would be refreshing, then if I your quessing doctor quack is correct you must worship me as your god and be part of my bank account until death do us apart because mainly I now have your life or death in my hands dear customer, no more bull please, NO if's and's or but's you are either A good doctor or simply a MR QUACK M.D. that sucks the life out of people that are already half scared to death and trust you and your education to correct their problem/s, is this not what you want to do is heal with your expertise for your pay Sir/Ms? Sorry but with all my bad experiances with M.D.s and other doctors recent months I will die without your help or live in one of your nursing homes you invested in and do so proudly at home unmedicated in order to finally get out of this nothing but greed type of world we now live in where there is just to many gods if I count you, where our President can shame the highest office in our land and then stand in our face boldy with a  straight face and lie like a $7 whore by simple wording  \"I did not have sex with that woman\",, or \"I smoked but did not inhale\" nonsense and did so thinking the public is that dumb, yes we forgive but never forget, play with words all you want but sooner or later doctor you will be in the same spot and you better hope your doctor of choice Mr. Doctor is not some quack when you are scared out of your mind or while in that doctor/s care take your last breath in his/hers hands, think about it because if you die I will be there waiting on you to come in with my pitch fork to examine you before you enter,,,,,,Marvin O.

So I have done some research on my own. I have been on Effexor xr for about 4m. They have come out with a NEW  symtom list. and there is was,Dizziness,sweating,confusion,impaired cord.sensory dist(including electric shock sensations) tiredness,ect. This was common in several SSRI's Paxil was another. So, I printed it and am going to take it to him. I also have Fibromyalgia. Doctors just hand out the newst meds, without and concern of what it might do to their patients. Or look at you like your crazy and don't have  a clue. I work at a very large trauma hospital, and it is a shame. I have now lost my job, been there 3 years, due to my being out. So yes stress is also i'm sure a factor in this as well. So now what, I just go all day feeling like I'm sticking my finger in a light socket every five min. i guess. I hope this helps someone. I am now going to try to get someone to help me. Thank you and good luck to all. This is an aweful and scary feeling!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  I completely understand your \"brain shock\" problem as I've had it for over 10 years.  It's absolutely terrifying when it happens.  I have good nights and bad nights.  The bad ones are having up to 20 or more shocks.  Another bad night might be just one but a very very bad one, so bad I'm surprised I'm still alive after it.  I'm just so surprised my brain isn't fried because the shock is so intense. Good nights are when there are no shocks and those nights were rare until the last year or so.  I seem to be going for weeks without the shocks and then they reappear but they reappear worse than ever. It always happens this way. My neurologist can't help, he's never even heard of such a thing and then gives me an antidepressant.  Well I don't take medication unless absolutely 100% necessary and so I won't take this, especially since he has no clue about the shocks so how could he prescribe something for something he doesn't understand. I hate these shocks and I wish they would end but it's been 10 years or more and they just keep slowly worsening in regards to intensity.  The amount of them I have hasn't changed a lot over the years, but the intensity definitely is slowy worsening.  It terrifies me as to what it's going to be like in 20 years.\n\n",

It feels, for lack of a more medically precise definition,  like a pick-ax being hammered into my head.  The strange thing is that it's all very recent.    About five days ago I got a bump on my head, then a few more, and a few more still.  Maybe 5 or 6 in total.  They were red, itchy, tender, non-pustulous, about 1 to 2 centimeters in diameter, and generally confined to the back, left side of my scalp.  The doctor said it was a scalp infection or shingles, prescribed antibiotics, and has since ruled out shingles.    That was about two days ago, the good ol' days.  Now I get the shooting pains described above, and though brief, they're absolutely driving me crazy (just popped a Vicodin an hour ago, so am optimistic on the pain front). Anyway, I really hope someone can answer these very similar posts, and give me some insight as to the origin of this problem.\n\n",

    "content": "I have the same thing!  However, mine have only come twice (knock wood) in the past 3 years or so.  I just had one the other day where it feels lie electric shock waves in the back of my head.  They come in about 30 second intervals.  They physically make me flinch.  No pain, just this weird feeling like someone is kinking a hose and letting a little water out at a time.  Kind of a \"Pffffffft\" feeling, if the feeling actually made a noise.  The first time this happened I went to the ER and the doctor on duty said I was having muscle spasms in my neck / head.  I tried to tell him that it felt like it was coming from INSIDE my head, not my neck.  But he insisted on the muscle spasm theory.  So he gave me a shot of valium.  By golly, it went away!  And didn't come back until about a week ago.    I was at a function with my husband and it started again.  Scared the crap out of me.  Fortunately there were 4 doctors present (3 from Harvard!) who laid me down and talked me through it.  They, too, came up with a spasm theory.  No one had any muscle relaxants, so they told me to drink a glass of wine to see if it helped.  By golly, again, they completely went away.    During the day if I stare (like while driving) or am on my computer (like now), I'll get a single \"shock\" or sensation that travels from my head into my hands.  The same feeling as the spasms, but just in a singular format.  It literally goes to my fingers.  Not a tingling, but this electric shock-like feeling.  I'm at my wit's end.  Its so frightening, it's causing me episodes of sudden rapid heartbeat because I'm flying into a panic stage every time it happens.  Please doctors...someone HELP ME.    (BTW, I\"ve had 3 MRIs over the years - for various dizziness, vertical vertigo and they've found nothing . I have a small cyst on my right temporal lobe, but the doc says it probably has been there since birth and is most likely not what is causing this symptom).    Anyone familiar with Arnold Chiari Malformation?  Could this be what I have?  Again, PLEASE HELP.  I hate even leaving the house because of this.\n\n",

When I was on them I had an epileptic fit and i fell down 2 flights of iron stairs in a shop, and I was taken into hospital and given a CAT scan and everything to determine what the cause of the seizure was. I have trouble going out because of bright sunlight flickering through trees. I can't go to the cinema because it induces seizures. I cannot use a CRT screen for the same reason, I also can't drive. 8 months ago I was walking down the street and I was overcome with this incredible dizziness and confusion, I couldn't see anything [altered vision] I carried on walking holding my head because i was getting hundreds of these headshocks in rapid succession. I managed to make it to the end of the street where i tried to cross the road. I didn't make it across the road, I had a seizure and smashed my head against the concrete. When I came to i was surrounded by paramedics asking me who i was, but i couldn't remember because of concussion. Also i lost feeling in one of my fingers for 3-4 months.  SSRIs are very dangerous, I want to get better but I don't see how i can unless i go back on them and i am worried it might make it worse...\n\n",

    "content": "I have just returned from seeing a neurologist about this problem. I have had a form of what has been described here for about 20 years. It can be very scary. The symptoms vary in degrees, timing, etc. by individual, so there's no real point in detailing my own specific experience. Suffice it to say that it is close enough to most of those described here to be considered within the same category. In any event, this neurologist told me that, while no one has an explanation for this phenomenon, or even an understanding of why it occurs, it is well documented and rather common--once you look into it. He said that he has had episodes of it himself. I'm posting this to reassure those who, like me, have been frightened and wondering what the heck is wrong with them and to let them know that, so far as medical science seems to know, the condition is neither life-threatening, nor known to lead to more serious issues. The neurologist advised me to let him know if they worsened or became more prolonged or affected facial muscles and such, as this could mask the signs of a stroke or other more serious medical condition. But the important thing for me, at least, is to know, after seeing dozens of doctors about this over the years, who never heard of these sleep/shock symptoms, that it is actually quite common and, so far as they know, beyond the annoying and frightening aspects of it, are benign. I suppose that, having experienced it himself, this particular doctor went beyond what other doctors might have done, and did the research for himself. I hope that this posting helps to alleviate some of the fears expressed here.\n\n",

I recently got sick, with what my doctors at the time thought were allergies and sinusitis.  I've noticed my neck gets sore easily from sitting in front of a computer and I get much more frequent headaches.  Within about two hours of drinking maybe two or three beers (with food) I get these throbbing headaches.  This never happened before.  I've had bloodwork done, the regular blood count checks and also immunology and thyroid checks.  Also had a CT scan of the head done.  They found nothing.  Still getting the headaches, neck pain, redness in the eyes, facial fullness, etc..  I realize it's easy to say just don't drink, but I would be equally confused if I drank coffee all my life and all of the sudden it caused horrible headaches two hours after drinking it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Usually the body responds to sickness by showing more than one sign, think about other symptom you may have happening. Do you have a pattern of things going on you can tell your doctor about or is there a specific body system involved (lungs, heart, stomach, joints, muscles) more than another. Are you experiencing anything different such as unusual headaches (other than what you've said), unusual pains, weakness, numbness, difficulty urinating, kidney pain, night sweats, etc.  If it seems to be isolated to only when you consume alcohol, my first thought is to check for hyperglycemia and liver disease. If you have had a liver enzyme test done and a diabetes test done the next thing is to check your medications, are you taking something that reacts to alcohol?  If all turn out normal I would recommend not drinking, you may have developed a sensitivity to alcohol. At the minimum, you should get a full check-up which it sounds like you've done.\n\n",

I went for allergy testing several years ago and was told that I was allergic to Mold.  Apparently, it is the fermentation in the alcohol that gives me a mold reaction.  Has anyone else been told this?  Does this make sense?   More importantly, does anyone have a fix?  I agree - \"don't drink\" is a fix, but not a good one.  I have tried allergy medication but most often it does not help.  I am going to try the Chaser pills I have found out about to see if they help.  Anyone have any experience with these supplements?  thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "I developed these same headaches, and if you could understand being an alcoholic, I had them daily.  I have not drank now for 18 months. They came during or after drinking, starting in the right nostril moving up my head to my eye, feeling like its pulling backwards, then to my temple or the area halfway in between my temple and the top of my head then moving down the back of my neck to an area up and to the right of my spine. Eye and nose  - only on one side watering all the way.  If I start sneezing, I know that it will subside soon - I should mention that before the headaches started, I used to sneeze and get a runny nose, particularily when drinking, but again, is was also usually following or drunk with a meal.  The thing is, when i stopped drinking, the headaches didn't stop.  I got them more.    Now its about 45 min-1.5 hours after eating.  I've been doing blood sugar and my dr says it seems fine, no spikes or anything unusual.  I can not eat all day, and not get them.  Sometimes I have gotten repeated ones also during the night, but those have gotten rarer.  Now, instead of alchohol, unless it was the food taken with the alcohol...  they seem food related, though in some cases, I can eat an apple or drink some orange juice when one is coming on and they subside to bearability instead of the constant pressure in my head (they are not throbbing - I equate them to in icepick in the side of the head.  Ideas as to help guide my doc who is stymied?  I've been to a neurologist and got an MRI which was clean.  My liver has checked okay, but that was only enzymes...   I'm trying to kind of find a check list of \"things\" to check for, as well as playing with what I am eating right now as well as logging it - but that also can take weeks.  I'd rather \"know\" exactly what I'm dealing with, versus continual experimentation and assumption...   Thanks.\n\n",

It seems like the dark beers give me an instant headache after only a couple drinks! So I can't drink a whole bottle. I have been testing different beers and some don't give me a headache like wheat beers such as Blue Moon, Hefeweizens, and Corona. I have heard that the cause is the preservatives that companies put in the beer when they brew it. There is one called Erdinger that is all natural and brewed in the bottle. It's kind of expensive but it doesn't give me a headache. So I suggest you guys try it. Try to buy beer that is all natural, preservative free, organic. I know there aren't many out there! I have heard that hops can you give you a headache and a beer doesn't necessarily need hops, it's just a preservative. Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "This may not be much help, but .....  I have in the last week started having the same problem - every time I have a beer I get an immediate headache in the upper right part of the back of my head.  I had this problem, considerably worse, about 25 years ago (I am 50ish now). I consulted various doctors and they all said the same thing ..... give up drinking! I did give up for 3 months, but very reluctantly. What annoyed me most was that nobody would tell me why; just the same mantra ... stop drinking.  I was determined to persevere, however, and I finally found a more helpful doctor in Harley Street, London.  He explained to me that alcohol causes the blood vessels at the top of the neck / lower part of the head to contract and dilate. For whatever reason, in my case the reaction was happening more violently than with the vast majority of people.   He prescribed me some tablets that I took for a week (I think - its a long time ago) that would stabilise the reaction. I took the course of tablets and the headaches totally ceased.  Until the last week or so!  The trouble is, I have no idea what the tablets were or who the doctor was! 99.9% of GP's will not even consider looking for a 'treatment'.  There is a treatment for these symptoms (assuming it is the same thing) so don't totally concede defeat. If anyone has a helpful, friendly doctor, speak to them about this.  And please let us all know if you find out what the 'antidote' is.\n\n",

I did most of the research myself and found out what other people have tried but it didn't seem to work! At least for me!  So I kept dealing with the pain and just figured it was going to be part of my live until one day my dad gave me Mycelium caps, this is a form of ganoderma plucked at 18 days old. I didn't even think about it and I kept taking them everyday for about a week then stopped because I just forgot! Then my dad asked me today how my head was and it might be coincidence but I know I'm not getting off of Mycelium!!!  This has made me so much more happy!!  Thanks dad for looking out for me and the Mycelium for doing what your doing!!! If you want to try it out its go to \"camscoffee.com\"\n\n",

Usually happens after about 3 or 4 beers and I know the easy solution is stop drinking, but I also get them in the middle of the night even if I havent drank for a week. I'll just wake up and already be in pain, The only thing that has worked for me LEGALLY is BC powder, and thats only about 25% of the time. Other than that I usually buy HEAD ON ( stupid commercial ) and rub that all over the right side of my skull, it starts to burn but it kind of makes me focus on something other than the pain im in. Pretty bad I know.   Any solution would be greatly appreciated, and I don't have insurance for another 2 1/2 months ( just started a new job ) so don't wanna pay out of pocket yet. don't know what else to do. Also I drink lots of water every day so I don't think its dehydration.\n\n",

His blood pressure was slightly elevated (130/80). The doctor noted that the back of my husband's neck was extremely 'tight.' The doctor thinks it's tension/stress. The doctor performed blood tests (we're not sure what those were for) and prescribed Butalbital. I am very concerned since my husband is not one to go to doctors so I know this must be severe for him. My questions are, what other causes could there be for these symptoms and what were the blood tests for?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello terrbeary,  You likely have the results of your husband's blood tests by now, but I will try to provide general information about your concerns.  Tension and stress can indeed cause symptoms such as your husband's, including light-headedness.  It's positive that his blood pressure isn't problematic.  Other possible contributors to such symptoms include a wide range of potential diagnoses, though not all are very likely.  These include neurological/orthopedic conditions such as pinched nerve(s), formation of and encroachment by bony spurs on the spine, inflammatory processes, tumor, and specific infection.  Initial blood tests most likely were to evaluate blood count (which would also reveal if an infectious process was present) and various organ function, to rule out or identify potential contributing factors, or to establish baseline information before proceeding with further evaluation, if needed.  If the Butalbitol is not effective, there are alternative medications available.  If his stress remains severe, he may benefit from psychological evaluation and assistance.  I hope your husband is feeling better.  Good luck to you both.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pressure at the top center of head",
    "content": "Hello, ladyonamission,  Headaches can occur in so many different ways, that it can be very difficult for your doctor to identify the exact reason for them.  Most people describe their headache pain in terms of sharp or dull pain, constant aching, stabbing pain, or pain with pressure, and the pain can occur in any area of the head, or over the entire head.  Headaches are generally classified as migraine, tension, cluster, menstrual, spinal, sinus or combination type headaches.  They are also classified in terms of primary, as migraine, or secondary, as sinus.  It sometimes requires a \"trial and error\" method for your doctor to determine the cause of headache, along with good communication between doctor and patient.  Pain level is often graded on a scale of 1 (quite mild) to 10 (severe).  It can be  invaluable to the doctor for the patient to maintain a headache record, which would include when the headache began (both date and time of day), what the patient was doing when the headache began or before it began,where the pain was located, how long the headache lasted, what if anything helped relieve it and did it relieve the headache entirely or reduce the symptoms, and any other data that seems significant.  With such a record, the doctor can look for diagnostic patterns and get an overall picture of how the headaches affect the patient's function.  So many things can cause a headache, from sinus problems, stress and hormonal imbalances, to more severe causes, such as tumor or circulatory abnormalities, that it can take some real detective work to nail down the diagnosis.  If a patient and his doctor are stymied and have been unsuccessful in identifying the cause, a referral for neurological evaluation may be necessary.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Recently my fiance has been complaining of severe headaches and nausea.  It started when he was out after 2:30 am working a few days ago and has been non-stop ever since.  About two nights ago he was running a high fever.  It concerns me because his family has a considerable amount of health problems from diabetes, high blood pressure, and his younger brother has a brain tumor.  We were able to get his fever down, but the headaches are much more difficult to handle.  Sitting up and laying down have become a chore for him because of how badly those movements make his head hurt. (He says its a contant pain though)  Its also been difficult for him to keep any food down.  He basically works three jobs and never gets a break, I'm concerned that he's overworking himself, but more so I fear that some terrible could be wrong here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It would have been a bit more helpful if you had provided your fiance's age.  Although your concern is genuine, it is too early to seriously consider a brain abscess although the classic triad of headache, fever, and focal neurologic deficit is rarely seen (<5-20% of cases) these days.  It seems probable that your fiance contracted a minor viral illness which precipitated an episode of acute sinusitis.  Acute sinusitis is a rapid onset, short but severe infection of  one, multiple or all the sinuses(pan sinusitis) that could last for up to 4-8 weeks. Chronic sinusitis is when it is  long-lasting(>8 wks) and recurrent.   Symptoms of sinus headache include facial pain/discomfort and a dull, aching pain over the infected sinus, which typically intensify when the patient bends forward or lies down.  Have him examined by your family doctor if it is still continuing. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, i would like to ask a question about this headache i have been experiencing lately, this started a few months ago when i was eating something with a vinegar sauce, i suddenly had a terrible headache on the left part of my head and then it started to hurt but the pain wasn't really much of a problem back then, but now it seems to happen alot more often and whenever it hurts i also experience extreme vulnerability to anxiety attacks almost anything could trigger my anxiety which i was already diagnosed with, it would have been bearable if this was all but when i have anxiety attacks it also triggers something about my left arm getting stiff or tense and my heart also hurts it kind of like a chain reaction, i asked my doctor about this but he said it was probably just my anxiety or depression and told me to go see a psychiatrist which i did and only got xanor 500mg anti anxiety pills, but you see i still experience this headache everyday on only the left side of my head, it hurts a bit like its throbbing and then after some time i feel like the pain goes down and it stops for a while and later its back again, it's nothing extremely painful it's more of annoying, and no it can't be eye problem because i just had new glasses this year, and strangely when my head hurts i feel incredibly sleepy and tired even though i just slept!! and yes i can't really sleep because im not really sleepy it just happens when it hurts and when the pain is gone my drowsiness goes away too, and lastly i have been noticing that i seem to have more saliva than normal so i was also slightly thinking if this could be related to rabies? not sure, but we do have alot of pets here in our home and alot of them are not vaccinated cause my mother likes to pick up strays- and yes i got bitten by then sometimes, and to top it all my mother sometimes feeds them on our plates.  overall im not really sure what this is, i just wanted to see if anyone can help me before i go back to the doctor and get another check up, then on the other hand i don't know what to tell the hospital doctors either, i really hope someone can help me with this and i'm very thankful for any information or even the time you spent listening to me, thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, engarde,  It's certainly understandable that you would be distressed because of such complex symptoms.  I do agree that anxiety could be a major contributor.  If your medications are not helping, you need to have further evaluation and likely would benefit from seeing a therapist regularly, rather than just seeing your psychiatrist for medication.  A psychological evaluation would be helpful.  It's not likely that the vinegar sauce caused these issues; it's more likely that it was coincidental.  Your symptoms do not suggest rabies, so please don't worry about that.  Please discuss with your doctor the possibility of a neurological evaluation, as well, to rule out arteritis or other conditions.  Because of the variable nature and variable severity of your symptoms, I encourage you to immediately begin a daily record of your symptoms.  Include what the symptom is, how long it lasts, what you were doing when it started, how severe it is on a scale of 1(mild) to 10 (severe), what helped relieve it.  Practice relaxation techniques, and maintain a mild exercise program, which will help with oxygenation of your brain, which can help reduce the severity of your headaches.    I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, ccollini,  I apologize that this reply is not more timely.  Your distress at your unusual symptoms is certainly understandable.  You are correct in planning to have your doctor evaluate your symptoms, since there are any number of possibilities that could be contributing.  Your recent bout of flu could have left you with some residual areas of inflammation that are adding to your symptoms, or it could be due to a subsequent, unrelated condition.  In either case, I strongly recommend that you immediately begin keeping a daily record of all of your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, what you were doing when or immediately prior to when they occurred, what if anything helped to relieve them, and any other data that you consider significant.  If your symptoms occur several times a day, record several times a day.  Take your record with you when you visit your doctor; it can help him identify any diagnostic patterns, as well as help him determine the most appropriate timing for any medications that are indicated for treatment.  It may help you while awaiting your appointment with your doctor to do some simple relaxation techniques, such as  slow deep breaths, focusing on something or someplace that you have found enjoyable and restful (as, sitting by a lakeshore or river), meditation, etc.  It's reasonable to feel scared at unusual symptoms, but the resulting anxiety can tend to exacerbate the symptoms and/or your sensitivity to them.  Relaxation techniques can help minimize that effect, so that your doctor can be assured that variable has been addressed.    I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, lealea,  While some of your symptoms might suggest stroke, it would have shown up on the scans that you have had.  Based on that, I would tend to accept the diagnosis of a viral condition.  Some can last for a year or more.  However, the fact that you have an appointment with a neurologist is very encouraging, since that is the next thing that we could suggest.  It is to be expected that you would have considerable anxiety about your situation, and if you feel it would be helpful, you might request an anti-anxiety medication from your physician to help you until your neurology appointment.  If you do this, however, ask your physician if you should discontinue the medication before seeing the neurologist, and how long before the appointment you should do so.  It can be helpful if you maintain a record of all of your symptoms, including when they occur, how long they last, what you do to try to alleviate them, and what you are doing when they occur.  Take it with you to see the neurologist, since it can help him identify any diagnostic patterns and most appropriate timing of medication dosages.  I hope this is helpful to you.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

Add whatever information or notations you'd like.  Take your \"headache diary\" with you to all appointments with your physician(s).

However, the best result of treatment will come with early intervention, which is why neurological evaluation is encouraged.  Don't hesitate to discuss your concerns in depth with your physician, if a referral is required.  It would be helpful to you and to your physician(s) for you to keep a daily record of your symptoms, when they occur, how long they last, what you are doing at the time they occurred, as well as any other concerns that may occur to you.

Sometimes the headache feels like someone is pushing as hard as they can on both sides of my head. I've tried pain killers, 6 different migrain medications, over-the-counter drugs like Tylenol and Asprin but nothign seems to work..

Since the trials of migraine medications have not helped you, your most reasonable next step would be to have an evaluation by a neurologist.  The CT scan may provide an answer, but if it does not, request a referral to neurology.  If you are seeing a neurologist already, discuss the difficulty in detail with him or her, and describe clearly the negative effects your headaches are having on your life, including any impairment in your usual daily activities.  If he or she suggests a psychological evaluation, by all means pursue it.  Anxiety and/or depression can definitely contribute to headaches, even if you do not feel that you are particularly depressed or anxious.  A sleep study may be indicated, since your headaches are worse after sleeping.  I hope these suggestions are helpful to you, and that you are able to find relief from your headaches.  Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: centralized pain in back \"corner\" of head",
    "content": "Hi, The headache that you are describing is probably located in the parietal or parieto-occipital region.  Although, the commonest headaches are the 'tension' headaches, certain other \"extra cranial\" headaches need to be considered.  There are a few such headaches which deserve mention. - parietal headaches caused by entrapment of the posterior auricular nerve,  - occipital neuralgia, & - Nummular headache.  Posterior auricular nerve entrapment: caused by entrapment of the posterior auricular(the first extra cranial branch of facial nerve) nerve by the sternocleidomastoid muscle.Can present after variable intervals following flexion-extension injuries of the neck.  Occipital neuralgia: These nerves, which are branches of the cervical plexus (dorsal rami of C2 and C3), pierce the nuchal fascia at the base of the skull and at this site, are therefore vulnerable to trauma from flexion/extension injuries as well as entrapment by spasm of the trapezius muscle.  Extracranial headaches generally do not respond to standard 'intracranial'  headache management.They are due to nerve entrapment and therefore,need alternative approaches (local injections, surgical release etc).   Nummular headaches (coin-shaped headache): are generally of mild to moderate intensity and confined to a small circumscribed area (side-locked). The pain can be is continuous or episodic. Remissions are quite common & during remissions, the affected area may continue to be minimal sensory phenomena may persist (allodynic, paresthetic, or hyperesthetic). These headaches typically are unilateral, & commonly affect the parietal region. Some cases may be associated with underlying malignancies or diabetes mellitus. Treatment with botulinum toxin, gabapentin, or tricyclic antidepressants may be helpful.  As you seem to be describing pain localized to a very small area, Nummular  headache is a strong contender.Consult your doctor for a thorough physical examination and investigations as may be necessary to arrive at a proper diagnosis. Best wishes!\n\n",

Your symptoms sound like the 'viral' prodromal symptoms of most common flu-like illnesses and many other viral illnesses.These may be followed by fever and a full fledged picture of a viral illness.

    "content": "Hi,  I sincerely hope that your daughter is well by now. Based on your description of the episode alone, it may be inappropriate to hazard a guess.  There is one detail however, that seems odd.You say that she \"she actually wet the bed for the first time since she was a tot\". This could be significant.  Apart from the more common causes of headaches, there is one entity which is capable of inducing such a clinical picture - headaches associated with seizures(epilepsy).  These are classified as - preictal, - ictal, or  - postictal,  based on their temporal relationship to the actual seizure activity.   Unlike preictal or ictal headaches, postictal headaches (PIH) are fairly common. Most commonly, they are associated with generalized tonic-clonic seizures, with complex partial seizures, and are less common with simple partial seizures.  Rarely, headache can be the sole or most predominant clinical manifestation of an epileptic seizure.  The headaches may last from <6 hours(common) to >24 hours(rare).  Pathogenesis: is as yet unclear.Some studies have shown that seizures may activate the trigeminovascular system, and thus cause headaches.  I trust you have consulted your family doctor regarding this.If you have not done so already, please do so. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, chillin602,  Since the initial treatment for your headaches did not relieve or reduce them, that means you need to have your symptoms evaluated again.  Tension headaches can be frequent, but not constant.  I am also concerned about the pea-sized and smaller lumps in your neck.  They may or may not be related to your headaches, but it is very important that they be evaluated as soon as you can arrange it, if you haven't already had them evaluated.  They can be early signs of some troubling diagnoses, and I'm sure your doctor would want to know about them and examine them.  Please ask your parents for assistance in advocating for more detailed evaluation with your doctor.  I often suggest that a person keep a record of when the headaches occur, how long they last, how severe the pain is on a scale of 1 to 10, with 10 being extremely painful and 1 being not very painful, and what you are doing at the time the headaches start and/or grow worse.  That's a lot of record keeping for you, but it will give the best and most detailed information to your doctor to help him or her more carefully assess what is happening.  It will also help clarify it for you.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "sherivery:  Wow!  You must be feeling really awful.  I'm so sorry you're not having any luck getting better.  First of all, I think you need to see your family doctor for complete lab work.  Your symptoms sound like they could be due to so many different things, that you likely need to have a complete lab work up and physical exam.  Another factor that may prove useful to know is your age and race.  You mentioned having gone to neurologists.  I'm wondering if a neurologist saw you after the MRI of your head was done a few months ago.  Did anyone tell you what their ideas were?  Has anyone mentioned that you might have a nerve disorder similar to trigeminal neuralgia?  The burning on the top of your head sounds similar to this, and the treatment for it is generally gabapentin (Neurontin), but other medications have been used as well, with success.  Carbamazepine (Tegretol), divalproex (Depakote), and pregabalin (Lyrica) are the ones I've heard that have had the most success after gabapentin failed.  Good luck--Please come back and let us know what happens.\n\n",

It came out negative so she sent me for 2nd opinion at Wake Forest Baptist University Hospital in NC. There, the Neuro told me it \"could\" be MS but was unsure. After I found another Neuro, he told me it didn't look like MS because of the lesion pattern in the brain. It was different than those who have MS. So now I am going to Duke soon to see one of the top Neuro's there.  By the way, I am on Neurontin. Doesn't seem to help much during the day - only at night...Weird...\n\n",

    "content": "I know this is an old post, and I wish people who suffered with this issue initially are all cured by now..  But this is what I observed.  This burning head ache on top of the head could be due to 3 main reasons..  1) Nerve damage, due to high bp and/or critical sugar imbalance (due to any reason), if thats the case please ask your doctor how he/she can diagnose if thats the case, if he/she fails to support in the right direction, take yourself some over the counter B-Complex, take it for few months and your nerve damages should slowly heal and you should feel better, if nerve damage is something which caused those burning pains, then you should start feeling better the time you start taking B-complex.  2) Bacterias in your head.. sounds very interesting, the bacterias can bore deep inside your skull muscles damaging the network of veins, if that's the case then someone should be able to confirm it for you and prescribe you right antibiotics or similar solution, you should start feeling better if it was deep rooted bacteria which was producing inflammation around your veins.    3) Liver issues, if liver is failing to provide the glucose as/when brain needs it, your brain feels choked and creates issues which are even hard to explain let alone treat. At that point your brain is triggering panic in your body.  Any/All of the above tips could help you move in towards the solution, no promises but may help you ask your physician to get diagnosed with any of these issues which might lead to burning head aches.  I feel such kind of headaches would be reported by the people who were exposed to high BP incidents and or Sugar imbalance issues in their lives which left the critical veins damaged or inflamed, Time should heal it if you do not stress and take sufficient of B-complex.   Hope someone finds this helpful.\n\n",

Severe Headaches and Chronic Neck pain (this only happened after spinal tap and have lasted up to 5 months - the headaces are getting worse).  2.

    "content": "Situation: My roommates 13 year old son has been suffering from severe headaches for the last 6 months, to the point of tears (she says he has screamed a few times at night).   Conditions: Her husband pasted away a few years back due to cancer which spread to his brain. Her major concern is her son might have cancer now, as a MD told her it (being cancer) can be passed down from generation to generation.   Questions: 1) She wants to get an MRI done, the time frame they are giving her ( roughly 4-5 months)  is not to her liking, is their anything she can do to expedite the time frame they are giving her? *Her main through is she just wants to either strike cancer off the list of possibilitys or start treatment NOW*  2) Are their any really good over the counter meds that could help more then ibprofen, asprin, ect ( the normal head ache stuff) or vitamins/supplements that might help lessen his headaches?  3) I know this is a horrid question because the list is probably to long.. but besides cancer and migraines what else could this be?    I appreciate any time put in this, I am not looking for a magic pill, just more of some silver lining to show her to help support her and her son alittle peace at mind.   Sgt J.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: headache, vision fades out, numbness",
    "content": "Hi there -- From the symptoms described, my first thought is a variation on the migraine theme, because of the visual aura (loss of peripheral vision), tingling in the extremities, and then the highly localized, unilateral severe headache often relieved by sleep. This is a pretty classic pattern for migraine, and most often there is no clear underlying cause that can be isolated, especially by imaging techniques, although it was a good idea to have the MRI done anyway, just to rule out some other cause. It seems migraine would be a reasonable default diagnosis and if no dedicated anti-migraine medication has been offered, you might (if you haven't already) try Aleve at the first sign (aura) of the syndrome, as whatever is used is generally most effective if used early on. If you can get a doctor to treat for migraine you still want to start with the least noxious medication, so something in the NSAID family (like Aleve or a stronger prescription variant) might be helpful. Sometimes also a beta blocker, especially propranolol, can be used to abort the headaches. If none of these work there are drugs speficically intended to abort migraine attacks, but they do have some potentially nasty side effects so they should be a last resort in most cases.  If you've not been seen by a neurologist this may be the best way to get a proper diagnosis and medical management. I'd be willing to bet this is fairly classic migraine and treating for it should not be a problem. If treating for migraine relieves the episodes you have a pretty clear default diagnosis for sure.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Porencephalic cysts are cysts within the cerebral hemispheres lined by white matter of the brain.  These can be  - congenital or  - aquired. Postnatally aquired cysts may be due to a number of causes including - intra-cerebral hemorrhages & - traumatic brain injuries. Size can vary considerably as well.Usually they communicate with the ventricular system.   Certain other cysts (arachnoid cyst, hydatid cyst, gliosis or cystic brain tumours) may at times be mistaken for Porencephalic cysts.  Frontal 'arachnoid cysts' have been known to be associated with depression. Arachnoid cysts on the left temporal lobe have been associated with psychosis.Treatment for arachnoid cysts is needed only when they are symptomatic.Arachnoid cysts do not communicate with the ventricular system.    The nature of the cyst seen in your MRI scan has to be conclusively confirmed before management options are considered. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Positional and Valsalva type headaches",
    "content": "Hi, Headaches, like many ailments, have aggravating and relieving factors. Some of them can be aggravated by certain activities such as the 'valsalva maneuver' (forced expiratory effort against a closed glottis), by body position or by exertion.  Based on these facts one of the ways of classifying headaches would be as 'orthostatic' headaches (those which increase on standing erect) and 'non- orthostatic' headaches.   \u201cValsalva-type maneuvers\", including sneezing,straining,coughing, bending, and heavy lifting,  can aggravate any type of headache, but exertional headaches are actually provoked by such maneuvers.   Exertional headaches are more frequently associated with intracranial lesions (63%) versus than those that are not (37%), and when no structural cause is detected by imaging, these are referred to as \"benign exertional headaches\u201d.  You complain of a headache that is non-orthostatic (exacerbated on bending forward) but, aggravated by valsalva maneuver.This could be a 'sinus headache'.  Finally, i must mention on other type of headache that is being reported more frequently of late, ie; Spontaneous Cerebrospinal Fluid Leak Syndrome (SCSFLS).This is known to initiallly start as a 'non- orthostatic' headache and later progress to an   'orthostatic' headache.  Personally, i doubt if your headache has anything to do with the prolapsed cervical intervertebral discs. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- The initial dual ear infections was enough to cause a great deal of pain and other complications. The weak eyelid and constricted pupil the day after seeing the doctor suggests something more than simple ear infection. The first thing that comes to mind is a possible ethmoid sinus infection that may have predated the ear infections and probably would have involved both sinuses, with one side having a more severe infection, perhaps with some deep regional cellulitis. This would account for the severe one-sided head pain and the Horner's sign (sometimes a sign of Horner's syndrome, which could be caused by a cellular or cystic infection somewhere inside the front or side of the head). Since the eyes, sinuses and ears are all connected by common blood vessels and nerves this is an unusual but entirely possible problem. Normally you'd also have a fever if this were the case, but not necessarily. It definitely warrants further investigation by a medical doctor, preferably an ear, nose and throat (ENT) specialist. It is a moderate cause for concern since it seems there may be a pocket of infection not reached by the antibiotic, which is fairly common in deep sinus infections.   I'd seek an ENT consult ASAP, to rule out any lingering deep infection which could evolve into meningitis, as you've already had some superficial neurological symptoms (the eye).   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed and also update us as to how things are going. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Thunderclap Headache",
    "content": "Hello -- Thunderclap or \"exploding head\" headaches generally are more nearly global or at least hemispheric and not so highly localized as you describe. Also while sudden in onset they generally last longer than what you're having.  What you describe sounds, based on the pain alone, like a problem with a segment of one of the cranial nerves. The \"icey hot\" sensation also sounds like possibly a nerve issue, although this is fairly unusual with cranial neuralgias, so it raises the question of whether or not there is something inside your head pressing on this never. Since there are few moving parts inside the skull this seems fairly unlikely, and tumors and aneurysms don't generally pulsate or lash out randomly. This pulls us further away from a mass and nearer the possibility of a neuralgia, most likely, based on the location, probably involving a branch of the VII or trigeminal nerve (which innervates the face, so most often is known for causing stabbing pains in the face or eye on one side). This particular presentation you describe is fairly common (although the \"icey hot\" sensation is fairly unusual to my knowlege). This shouldn't be a cause for concern so long as it does not progress and there are no addtional symptoms. If this is a cranial nerve branch it should respond well to over-the-counter anti-inflammatories such as naproxyn (Aleve). There is also the possibility this may be the herald symptom of shingles, and if that's the case there will shortly appear some blisters or scabbing right on or very near the site of the pain. These little vesicles generally follow the path of an affected nerve.   I of course could be wrong about this and there could be something else going on. The best course, if there is ever doubt, is always to consult a medical doctor directly. We are only equipped, in most cases, to speculate here on line. Given the description I would strongly suspect a transient neuralgia which should respond to non-steroidal anti-inflammatories. If any additional symptoms should appear, however, as always, you should immediately be evaluated for possible obscure intracranial problems. It seems extremely unlikely, but I would be remiss if I didn't add that caveat. I really think you have a cranial nerve irritation that will likely pass shortly, although it may very likely recur at some other time, and could herald shingles or even be the result of a limited case of shingles from the past which was missed due to the location on the scalp.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It would have been nore helpful if you had provided details of the MVC (motor vehicular crash) and the symptoms you experienced immediatly following the crash(amnesia, loss of consciousness-if any,etc) and some of the signs(periorbital edema,conjunctival chemosis,proptosis etc).  As you seem to have been diagnosed with post-concussion syndrome, i take it that direct eye trauma was ruled out.  Symptoms referrable to the eye following an MVC may result from - blunt(closed injury to the eye globe) or penetrating/perforating eye trauma and - extra ccular injuries(including orbital injuries).  It is difficult to hazard a guess without examining the patient carefully.Therefore, i suggest that you should consult an ophthalmologist as soon as possible. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I must confess that i am unable to reach any firm diagnosis from the description of your symptoms.However, i will mention some possibilities.  This could be a type of \"Pulsatile Tinnitus\" of which there are many types.  \"Pulsatile Tinnitus\", a pulsatile sound in the ear (sometimes may be described by some as 'popping sounds' or 'thumping' noises), which are thought to be mostly vascular in origin(an idiopathic variety also exists) and which are transmitted to the cochlea via the skull bones(and in some of the sub-types,transmitted pulsations via the CSF(cerebro spinal fluid).  It could be arterial or venous in origin. Both increased blood flow and stenosis of the arteries(atherosclerotic, fibromuscular dysplasias, aneurysms and dissecting aneurysms) can cause this condition. The venous cause is often a dural vein thrombosis.Apart from these, AV(arterio venous)malformations also implicated. Obesity & female sex increase the risk.This condition can be associated with neck pain, head ache and papilledema(on fundoscopy).Increased ICP(intra cranial pressure) are usually seen.  CT and MRI are said to be frequently normal.  I do not know if you had undergone an ENT check.  Diagnosis involves a clinical evaluation (including auscultation around the ear for 'Bruits'), audiologic and electrophysiologic testing as well as metabolic workup, Duplex carotid ultrasound,and MR angiography(as needed).

Everyfay I experience 3-9 small headaches a day, my vision gets screwing will take about 2 seconds to focus when in movement. I feel this weird major pulse in my head that feels like needles and hurts when in motion once a day, i am taking prescribed head pills, about 2-3 months ago i went to a doctor/hospital because of a migraine that lasted 3 weeks, the pounding in my head is unspeakable there is both pouding and pain in my head, i've seen the doctor but he didnt seem very interested....He is sending me to see a pediatrition about a cat scan, but no call within about 6 months. My head aches get really severe that even headache pills wont help this, if your wondering I am writing this with a severe head ache, i usually get head aches around supper time, head aches during school, never outside, i was told it could be the lights but i doubt it, when i lay down during a migraine its not possible because of that i end up sitting in a chair sleeping.I see these weird (red, blue,black) colours when i have a head ache everytime i look at white paper and i cannot read the wording.

    "title": "Re: Sever Headaches, Migraines, pulse in back of head.",
    "content": "Hi there -- Migraines often do behave as you describe them, and sometimes they are also interwoven with seizure activity in the brain, focal or partial seizures, which are not the sort one thinks of in terms of \"epilepsy\", but more like the odd sensations and distortions you experience. Sometimes the two, migraine and seizure activity, become fused into one event. You really need to be evaluated by an interested neurologist, have an electroencephalogram (EEG) test, and perhaps some other neurological testing done, to find what will best manage this medication-wise, since I suspect the headache medicine is simply treating one of the symptoms and not the overall problem. This is a really common phenomenon, and is often misunderstood even by medical people, who zero in on the migraine symptoms alone, not understanding there is more to this than the headaches. Different or additional medication could well make a lot of this quiet down, but you have to see a specialist to get to the bottom of it.   Please ask to be set up with a good neurologist and that this be taken seriously. You could be able to get largely symptom-free in a fairly short time with appropriate medication.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here, and keep us updated as to how things go. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Headaches and Panic Attacks",
    "content": "Hi there -- It sounds as though you have possible panic disorder (PD) with associated migraine (not unsual, and often seen in conjunction with some benign heart abnormalites as well, though not always, and again, they are benign, just peculiar). The migraines seemed to ealier respond to classic treatment (ibuprofin and caffeine) but this no longer works. The panics, as I understand your post, seem to follow or are almost triggered (?) by the migraines. This may actually all be interrelated and was perhaps originally triggered by stress, but once the genie is out of the bottle it can be triggered by things that only seem as though they could (or should) be stressful, but may not seem to be. The problem with this group of disorders is that they begin to take on a life of their own after a while, and the obvious triggers no longer seem obvious, so the sufferer tends to deny a problem in precisely the area where it exists. For instance: Your having to fight off a panic attack during orientation for a new job (something that would be at least moderately stressful for most people) suggests you may have gotten good at pushing past the avoidance of stressful situations to the extent you no longer recognize they are stressful. Panic attacks then begin to seem to come out of \"thin air\" for no apparent reason. It gets much more difficult to recognize what's bothering us, and often there just isn't time to think about it or, if we did think about it, we might find we're not able to move forward, so we block it out.   I would strongly suggest a combination approach to this. See a neurologist for the migraines. The neurologist may well, in addition to prescribing something more effective for the migraines, refer you to a practitioner of cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a self-limiting, interactive type of therapy which is not just \"talk therapy\" but is a relatively short program that helps the patient to recognize and control anxiety/panic and other mood problems. You may also be prescribed a temporary \"rescue\" drug such as Xanax to abort the panics, if they continue after the migraines are controlled.   So this isn't as simple as it should be, but really it's manageable and not all that unusual, so you shouldn't feel bad about it. You're in good company.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

With all  the workups turning out negative it doesn't leave much to guess at, but have you been seen by an otolaryngologist? It sounds as though you could have Menier's disease, and there are clinical tests specific to this (especially an electronystagmogram, which helps at least confirm a problem with the equilibrium system involving the eyes and ears). If you haven't had this test performed, I would specifically ask for it. An otolaryngologist, neurologist, or ENT specialist could order the test and the results might -- hopefully -- reveal something all the other tests have not.  This is my best guess at this point. This sort of problem can be infuriatingly hard to pin down sometimes, so hopefully you're being treated symptomatically for the dizziness/vertigo.   Best of luck to you.

I was initially told by the Otolaryngologist that I did indeed have Menier's disease. I saw a different doctor in the same practice who told me that I did not have Menier's disease because I have constant dizziness. Menier's disease comes by way of attacks and is not constant. I have no relief from my dizziness. I wake up dizzy and I am dizzy all day. Someone in another post mention a problem with sinnitus that mimicked my symptoms. I do have a history of drug abuse (cocaine). Sinnitus also runs in my family history. From what I have read, there are different theories about sinnitus causing dizziness. Most say it does not or cannot cause dizziness. I am really trying hard to find an answer to my dizziness problem. It is really causing me problems and also putting a strain on my marriage from the inability to perform my functions as a husband and father. Once again, thanks for your reply.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You're very welcome and I only wish I were able to offer more in the way of ideas. I'm convinced there is something going on, very likely in the inner ear, which is causing this, but when the tests all come back negative it really makes it difficult to pin the thing down.   I'm not sure whether you meant sinusitis or tinnitis (you used the word \"sinnitus\"), but am going to assume, for our purposes you meant tinnitus, although sinus problems certainly could be playing a role in this as well. However, tinnitus and vertigo are seen together in Menier's disease. While your doctor is correct in saying that Menier's is partly defined by its episodic nature, there's no rule that the same root cause couldn't bring about a more or less constant state of the same quality of symptoms such as you're having. The root cause is, I believe, still somewhere near the base of a diagnosis for Menier's disease. I can't prove it, of course, but it seems almost to be a given.  Please keep us updated if anything changes and I do hope this problem will either be solved or will resolve spontaneously on its own. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Theresa,  There are several approaches to this problem.  First, if there is concern of a tumor, doing an MRI is the best way to find it.  A normal MRI essentially excludes tumor from the list.  (Tumors too small to see on an MRI would be unlikely to cause significant symptoms.)  Migraines most certainly can happen in children.  Treatment is generally dependent upon how often the headaches are and what they respond to.  Given that it sounds like your daughter is having very frequent migraines, it may be worthwhile considering a daily medicine to help prevent the migraines from happening.  I would recommend you talk with your doctor about some of these medicines.  If your primary doctor is not comfortable managing pediatric migraines, a neurologist would be the specialist to see.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I suffer from some sort of severe headache.  My neurologist does not know what is causing the headaches, but he says they are NOT migraines.  There is no particular pattern and no known trigger.  They get so bad that I am usually hospitalized for at least 24 hours.  I have been in the hospital more times than I can count already this year for this.  Usually, if I take Stadol (nasal spray) on the onset of the headache, I can control it.  However; there are times where there is nothing that I can do to control the pain.  Most the time the pain feels like my head is swelling from the inside out (like it is going to explode).  The nerves behind my eyes hurt upon moving my eyes side to side, which tells me that it is some sort of inflammation.  A very renouned Neurologist told me I had Behcet's syndrome (which most my symptoms fit).  However, upon one hospital stay an Infectious Disease doctor saw me for about 5 minutes and said it was not Behcet's.  This has been going on since 2002, two days after a flu shot.  I was hopitalized for severe vertigo (no headache yet).  While in there, my heart rate fell below 40 beats per minute and I was sent to ICU.  I recieved a spinal tap and was diagnosed with viral meningitis.  Three other times that year following this I was hospitalized with severe headache and diagnosed by spinal tap with viral/aseptic meningitis.  I haven't had  another spinal tap since 2003, but the headaches are the same.  I am looking for help.  My doctors are stumped and I am scared to death to get another headache.  The pain in unbelievable.  I am open to anything at this point.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Behcet's syndrome would certainly be one of the top suspects, based on your reported symptoms. The cause isn't known, but it can often predispose to meningitis (probably aseptic but not viral), which happened already, and most of your symptoms are consistent with a probable diagnosis of Behcet's.   Have you also had any apthous ulcers (oral canker sores) or elsewhere? Any joint  stiffness? These are also commonly seen with Behcet's.   I am uncertain what would qualify an infectious disease specialist to rule out Behcet's, especially after a five-minute quick-look exam. It's not known to be an infectious disease.   Increased intracranial pressure is sometimes seen, which not only would help explain the exploding headaches but also the one recorded drop in heart rate which frequently drops precipitously.   If you could get back for a consult with that renouned neurologist I think you might well get on the right track to having this managed. While  there is no known cure, so far, for Behcet's, it is usually manageable with steroids. I really feel the symptoms  tell the story in this  case. I could, of course, be totally wrong, but when a distinguished specialist confirms the impression it would seem to be a really solid starting point.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck to you and please do keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your response.  You asked me if I had oral (Canker) sores.  I did at the beginning, but then was given famvir and I don't get them very often at all.  I have been in the hospital a handful more times since my last post.  All the same type of headache.  I have had bronchitis and a sinus infection for at least a month now, which is making the pressure worse.  Also, when I blow my nose, the corner of my right eye experiences so much pressure and tears squirt out as well.  Is there any test I can do to be a little more certain about the Behcet's diagnosis?  I know there is some type of skin prick test.  I haven't done that, but when I simply scratch the surface of my skin to itch it, I get red welts that don't last very long.  Does this mean anything?  I have researched all types of migraines and my symptoms don't add up, except that I often get these severe headaches the day before a front moves through.  I will update you again soon.   Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "You're very welcome. If your canker sore problem improved or resolved with Famvir, that may have been a coincidental problem. If that is the case (theoretically for now) then the headaches, as you describe them, also sound a lot like cluster (histamine) headaches, so you may have had several different things going on at once that collectively mimic Bechet's disease. This is one possible explanation.   There is no specific test available in the US for Bechet's, although one research group in India did develop something like what you're talking about, a patch test, which seems to yield reliable results. Unfortunately it's not universally accepted yet and not used in most parts of the world. Instead, it's a default diagnoses by ruling out other things. I'm now wondering if overlapping but unrelated things have managed to look like Bechet's in your case.  One other thing you mention is welts forming when you scratch an itch on your skin: this is normally called dermagraphism or \"skin writing\" and people who have this phenomenon are actually able to do things like write words on their skin my carefully scratching out the letters. Then they disappear. It's not an especially important sign, but not everyone has this, mostly people with allergies and/or very sensitive skin. It may also have some relationship to a possible Bechet's connection.  I neglected to mention this the first time around, but people of Asian and middle eastern extraction (especially those of Japanese, Indian, Turkish and Iranian descent) are far more prone to develop Bechet's, although some strictly caucasian and Afro-American people have been known to get it too, probably through some obscure ethnic connection. This should be considered in the differential diagnosis.  At this point I am more suspecting you have cluster headache, possibly related to post herpetic infection which caused the canker sores (and those responded to anti-viral medication, making this even more likely). This avenue should at least be explored.   Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "I was hospitalized yet again this past weekend.  A couple of new things happened this time.  I contracted a pretty bad case of thrush on my tongue.  The doctor thought it was from all the anti-biotics, but the sensation on my tongue began while I was sitting in registration, waiting for my room....before I received the anti-biotics.  Also, my IV was infiltrated and my hand is currently full of edema.  I have had this happen before, but never this bad.  The doctor saw it yesterday and checked to make sure I wasn't developing a clot.  I don't know if I mentioned before, but for the last month, I have had extreme pressure behind my right eye.  So much that when I blow my nose, tears squirt out of the corner of my eye.  I read about cluster headaches, but the area of pain and the length of pain don't really add up, though I am not dimissing anything at this point.  I am going to make an appointment with a rhemotologist at Shands Hospital in Gainesville.  I also read about Behcet's being more prevelant within the Asian community.  I am married to a Japanese man and we have a 10 year old little girl.  However, you did mention that this isn't infectious right?  The other thing that I think about is the fact that this started in my early 20s and right after I received the flu shot.  Also, when I was getting allergy shots, every week that they increased the amount of allergen, I ended up in the hospital.  Does any of this raise any red flags at all?   I am at the point where I have no more vein access and I don't want to end up getting a port put in.  I will keep you updated as the need arises.  I appreciate your prompt responses.  They have been very helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "You seem currently to be suffering from a medical \"cascade effect\", which is similar to Murphy's Law or just \"one of those days.\" Thrush, and infiltrated IV, and all that on top of another really bad headache. I'm so sorry!   You had mentioned the tear-squirting thing before, which was one reason cluster headaches came to mind. It's still not absolutely ruled out, but other possibilities remain as well.  Speaking of \"cascade effect\" and weird coincidences, no, Bechet's syndrome isn't infectious in nature, so there's one more really strange coincidence.   As for connection with your flu shot back prior to all this staring up, any connection would be tenuous and doubtful. There was a release of swine flu vaccine back in 1976 that seemed to have been the cause of a number of cases of Guillain-Barre syndrome, but that's a whole different sort of problem. It is, however, a neurological one. It only happened in measurable numbers that one year, and otherwise the chances of developing G-B syndrome (or presumably some other neurological problem) on a routine basis is something like one in one million annually, so that really seems unlikely. Even if it could be proven to be a fact, however, it wouldn't be of much practical use to know it now, as the problem already exists and that's what needs to be corrected. Same thing holds true (only moreseo) with allergy shots. So no, no real red flags pop up from that (yet another coincidence, and you'd be amazed at how frequently, statistically, coincidence will complicate what should have been a simple diagnosis).  Please do keep us updated. I wish there were something more to offer at this point, but so far your doctors will have to continue their detective work.\n\n",

    "content": "Everything is important as a rule, and your more precise definition of your headaches makes it both less likely they are cluster type (although not impossible) and also raises the possibility of something like pineal cyst, a technically \"benign\" condition that can cause increased intracranial pressure (ICP) which, in turn, can cause some of the symptoms you describe. However, symptoms with pineal cyst specifically are usually fairly constant. There could be something, though, causing intermittent increased ICP, which would result in the sort of signs and symptoms you describe.   I'm just glad things are better, at least for now. It would be wonderful if they continued on that way, and maybe that's what will happen, but until and unless you're able to learn what's caused them, you'll probably feel a certain degree of anticipation, which is natural.   No debilitating pain is certainly better than the other kind!\n\n",

Some of these may cause secondary problems at times, however, and the headaches may be related to something in this department.   If the cyst hasn't shown up in imaging procedures then the greatest likelihood is that it doesn't exist. They can sometimes be difficult to image when just starting out, but then they are also unlikely to be causing symptoms, which usually are in direct proportion to the size. For that reason I think it's safe to say there's not one there. And that's good news!\n\n",

I got to the hospital around 3pm, but didn't get meds until around 7:15.  I had absolutely no vein for them to access.  I ended up getting pain meds PO, which didn't work whatsoever.  The pain ended up spreading into my jaw and the back of my neck.  My whole body was red and I was inconsolible.  Finally, after shift change, I asked the new nurse to try to find access again.  She used a smaller guage (24) and finally found access.  When the nurse called the doctor on call (which wasn't my PCP), she refused to change the orders from PO to IV.  I was rolling around in pain with ice on my head.  Finally, after the nurse called on my behalf 3 times, she changed it and I finally got relieve around midnight.  She said the MRI showed total blockage or opacification (I think was the word) of my right maxillary sinus.  This is getting ridiculous.  I have had surgery on my sinuses 6 different times.  You would think that would be enough.  Does that mean I have some kind of sinus disease?  Anyway, she released me today on Leviquin (500mg) and percocet as needed for pain and didn't release me back to work until Monday.  That is the latest update.\n\n",

    "content": "It has been quite a while since I have updated my condition on here.  This has been the worst year I have had since this started in 2002.  However, the Friday of Memorial Day weekend, I was taken to the ER and they performed a lumbar puncture.  This was my 4th tap since this whole thing started.  The doctor did a terrible job performing the tap and I felt pain during this procedure that I have never felt in my life.  Shortly afterward, I had such a severe headache that I couldn't sit up.  I was misdiagnosed 3 times with regards to this particular headache.  The following Tuesday I was given a blood patch, which fixed the spinal headache immediately.  The strange thing is that I have not had a single headache since then.  That was the end of May and it is now the end of July.  It makes me wonder if I have had a SLOW leak in my spinal fluid the whole time.  The headaches did not start until after my very first tap.  I don't want to get my hopes up, but could this nightmare finally be over?  The change in weather does not even affect me anymore.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm going to list everything unsualy about my health for the past few years. Whether they are all related or not, I don't know.  I went to the doctor a couple of years ago for headaches and because I was just feeling so tired. I could sleep for 12 hours at a time and still be exhausted. The first thing she did was get some bloodwork done on me. When the results came back, it showed I had a positive reading for ANA. Because my father has rheumatoid arthritis, she prescribed me some vitamin B for the fatigue and referred me to connective tissue specialist. I had more tests done, and it was negative for RA, lupus, and basically every other connective tissue disorder. That doctor then sent me to a neurologist, since my primary complaints were neurological in the first place. I was examined for Parkinsons and it was immediately dismissed as a cause of my symptoms. The neurologist said it was just migraines, and that would also be why I've been having fatigue.   Now, I had migraines in my adolescence, and they were BAD. I would feel sick to my stomach, my hands would go numb, and I had lights \"following\" my eyes. My headaches aren't debilitating, just a nuisance. The best way for me to describe them are \"pressure\" headaches. Usually in the back of my head, or on the front above my (usually right) eye and around it. The Topamax I was prescribed didn't help, and I'm fed up with going doctor to doctor and wasting my time and money when I don't seem to get anywhere.  I've been trying to count up everything I can as far as health issues, and a couple of other things that I've thought might relate to this bigger problem: blindness and bad vertigo. 3 years ago, I was admitted to the ER because my right eye suddenly went half blind. There was nothing but a big splotch in my line of vision. The optometrist had no idea what happened. I've also always been a big rollercoaster fan... over the past couple of years now, I've been getting more and more dizzy spells. I even wake up in the middle of the night if I fall asleep completely straight on my back with such nausea it takes me forever to get back asleep. Often times, if my head moves too quickly in any direction, I have to steady myself and close my eyes.  Now, in the past few months, I've also noticed twitching in various parts of my body. At first it was mostly confined to my thumb and my eyelid; they would just twitch a few times. Now, I fell them elsewhere. Different places in my arms, and my thighs. They also last much longer, sometimes a couple of minutes at a time. Most of them are visible too.   I've also noticed I'm worse during the warmer weather/heat. I get so heat-exhausted and tired, I slug through most of the day, and my headaches are even worse. I've even been preferring cooler showers to warm ones.  Is there any chance these are all related? And how do I go about pursuing all this to a doctor? It seems I'm not taken seriously enough, but on the other hand, I don't want to be pushy or seem like one of those patients who thinks a splinter is somehow a precursor to cancer. What should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While some of your symptoms can be grouped into sub-syndromes (such as migraine) you would seem to have a larger galaxy of symptoms that are likely related in the sense that people with certain autoimmune diseases and/or dysautonomia have interlinked sets of problems. This requires a very astute and interested team, usually of rheumatologist and neurologist, as well as an internist to serve as quarterback and sometimes tie-breaker as well. It's a huge nuisance, usually no more than that, but can be a big drag on one's functioning and enjoyment of life. There's no clear single factor that ties these things together except the fact that many of the symptoms and groupings are seen in similar patterns in random patients.   In other words, it is poorly understood and sometimes difficult to manage, while not usually a major threat to life or limb.  A huge part of getting a handle on this sort of problem (which may someday arrive with its own clear-cut name and set of diagnostic criteria) is managing to find at least two doctors with equally high levels of interest. For instance migraine is never \"just\" migraine. It is always highly annoying at the least, and can at times be debilitating. A doctor who confuses quality of life and sustainable life isn't who you want managing a challenging condition. While work on this phenomenon has been going on for well over 40 years, the ball gets dropped often. If you can find a doctor who specializes in dysautonomia you'll be ahead of the game.   I wish I could give you a more concrete answer, but this is where we stand with this cluster of problems. They are severally recognizable, but also related. The problem is finding what that relationship is. Meanwhile you'll need enthusiastic medical help. I hope you're able to find it. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  While this could be classic migraine with exaggerated visual disturbance, the fact that it has lasted more than 24 hours and continues to cause visual disturbance is good cause for a neurological workup to rule out other causes. If this is done and nothing other than migraine is discovered, a management plan can be set up so that your wife can deal with future episodes with less disability and discomfort. If there is something else going on you're both going to need to know what it is and what it will  require to manage it properly. The possibilites are extensive, but the most likely suspect is still migraine so far.   I hope this will be helpful. Good luck to you both and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "My 10yr old daughter experienced what I would consider a classic migrane. It started at dinner when she said she had \"dots\" in front of her eyes. That was followed by an intense headache on both sides of her head. She was rubbing her temples and said it hurt there. At this point she was in such pain that all she could do was cry and say please take me home. Then she had extreme nausea and eventually threw up. This did not take care of the pain. Then, this is the part that scares me, she said her tongue was numb and her fingers and hands. She said it felt like when she goes to the dentist and receives novicane. She did fall asleep before I could give her any medication and slept all night. She went to school today but felt wiped out and said she just has a \"regular\" headache. This has never happened to her before and neither her father or I have a history of migraines. Should we see if this happens again? Call our family doc? Call a Neurologist? I don't want to over or under react, but this is my child and I feel helpless.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While this may in fact have been either a migraine or cluster/histamine headache, the sudden and intense onset in a child with no family history and bilateral head pain (classic migraine is often unilateral) probably should be evaluated to rule out some other potential cause, perferably by a neurologist. While it is entirely possible (and quite likely) this was one of the more innocent but annoying headaches, it also could have been caused by some underlying congenital defect which, if present, would better be diagnosed and managed now, rather than waiting for something more to happen.   I wouldn't be overly concerned but I would at least have a healthy concern over this, especially because of the anesthesia in your daughter's tongue and hands. While migraine often can be accompanied by numbness of the tongue (again, usually on one side), extension to the extremities is unusual, so is one more reason to have a thorough neurological workup. This would be appropriate anyway, since if this was a migraine or cluster headache it is likely to repeat anyway, and the sooner there is a management plan in place, the less your daughter would have to deal with the often disabling symptoms.   Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Is my husband getting rebounds and is he addicted?",
    "content": "My husband was diagnosed with Cluster Headaches years ago.  We have been through more medications than I can even recall.  Little has worked and what actually has only works for a while and then stops.     My concern now is if he's actually suffering from Cluster Headaches or if he is suffering from rebounds and withdrawals from the medication he's been perscribed.  I first started to be wary when I noticed that nearly every time he would go to the ER where he would receive a shot of Dilaudid, a bad headache would follow between three and four days after the visit.  That was when I started monitoring more closely his medication.  In addition to Verapamil my husband was perscribed 3 mg. suppositories of dilaudid. He gets 24 suppositories for a months supply and goes to the ER when the medication doesn't work. There has been times where I find he has taken his months worth of meds in a week or two. He says he didn't realize he did it, and that he takes them as instructed - \"as soon as the pain comes on\" (rather than waiting to see if it's going to be a bad headache or not).   Not only am I worried that his headaches are now more rebound and withdrawal than Cluster but I am also very worried that he is becoming addicted. But I don't want to accuse him of something like that if he's just desperately, clumsily - maybe even stupidly, trying to manage his pain.   So I guess, what I want to know is this... Does this sound like addict behavior? Are these rebound headaches from the medication he's being perscribed? Is it rebound headaches he's getting three days after an intra-muscular shot of Diaudid?   How can we tell the difference between his rebound headaaches and his actual Clusters?? Now what do I do??  Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  You're to be commended for your attentiveness and concern regarding your husband's behavior regarding his use of dilaudid. While it is difficult to say for sure whether or not he's suffering rebound headaches (these usually would occur a lot sooner than the time lapses related in your post but it still is possible) he has for certain been using his allotment of suppositories far more rapidly than the prescription will support. While this is unusual it isn't beyond belief, as some people do have far more severe and frequent migraines than the average, and some cannot tolerate the standard migraine medications.   That being said, the fact that he not only uses a month's worth in a week but, more significantly, cannot recall having done this when questioned about it does strongly suggest abuse if not outright addiction, and in either case the danger to his health becomes increased, since at these rates of use there is potential for overdose. If you can discuss this with him, explain your concerns, and persuade him to discuss it with his doctor, then there's probably little problem with addiction. If he avoids or tries to divert your discussing it, then the likelihood of addiction is much greater, and if this is the case then you are warranted in approaching his doctor with this information so as to hopefully plan an alteration in his medication schedule or, if this is already out of reach, an intervention and wholesale change in approach to his pain management.   There is a great deal of sympathy owed the sufferer of out-of-control migraine or any severe and chronic pain. However, this doesn't mean abuse of the substances used to manage it can be justified. If he were taking the medication on the prescribed schedule and wasn't getting appropriate relief he would likely bring this to the attention of his doctor on his own. Since he either doesn't know (a serious sign) or doesn't wish to account for his use, someone may have to act on his behalf. As his wife you become the person of first responsibility. If you're unable to get him to work with you then his doctor may have to assume his legal responsibility to take care of the patient and avoid him harming himself, whether accidnetally or due to a frank addiction.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 26 year old male that has suffered with dull headaches for over 10 years.  My doctor usually just tells me that it is probably a tension headache and to make sure I drink water and get good sleep.  In the past, these headaches have not been much of an issue because they disappear upon taking a nap.  However, recently, because of my new job I am not able to take naps and these headaches persist through the day.  The headache usually starts in the morning (in a mild manifestation) and progresses very slowly into the afternoon.  The headache at first is not really focused one location in the head but rather just presents itself as discomfort in the head.  Then, as the afternoon goes on by 3 pm I usually have a achey pain around my right eye (sometimes left eye but more often right eye).  I have tried to drink more water and sleep regular cycles, but I always get these headaches at least once a week.  They do not follow any pattern (ie. food, weekday vs weekend, etc.) and I have no idea how to prevent them or treat them once I get them (pain killers like tylenol and advil do nothing to relieve the pain).  What is likely the cause and type of these headaches and what can I do to feel better?  Because they are beginning to bother me at work because once I get one of these headaches, I feel very fatigued, and unable to focus.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Dull Headaches",
    "content": "Hi there --  These do, at least superficially, sound a lot like simple tension headaches, and they may well be. Tension headaches often don't respond well to the usual remedies, as they are often caused by muscle tension, so the napping would sometimes help you relax tense neck and shoulder muscles, which is where that sort of headache usually originates. However, since they are now starting to concentrate around one eye or the other they could possibly be histamine (or cluster) headaches. No more serious than a tension headache, but they can be more pointedly painful sometimes, and are also difficult to treat with the usual OTC remedies.   I'd start taking notes, keep a journal for a week or so, as to when they take place, what you've been doing, and what your emotional state of mind has been. Some people are prone to both types of headache and both are often triggered by tension (and the tension headaches always are, but they come on more subtly).   If you still don't see any sort of pattern you might bring this back to your doctor's attention with an eye toward some sort of prescription pain medication or administration of something like Toradol (a very strong anti-inflammatory). There are also other sorts of medications that may be helpful that are precribed only.   I think this is a fairly benign problem, but headaches, needless to say, are a nusiance at best. Relaxation exercises may be another option for you. Again, this is something you might discuss with your doctor. This doesn't sound like a serious problem so much as a really annoying one.  Good luck to you. Follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While the tests and exams have all been appropriate and seem to have ruled out the most obvious potential problems, there is still a range of autoimmune stuff that's left to rule out, and which could be narrowed down some by a trial of a pain blocking medication. Since you apparently do not have multiple sclerosis (MS) or any central cause for this, you may have either polyneuritis (a sometimes virally mediated, sometimes autoimmune, system-wide inflammation of nerves throughout the body); it also could be peripheral neuropathy, a similar problem but frequently without a determinable cause. In both  cases anti-seizure medications which are also used to block pain sometimes can produce dramatic (or at least significant) relief from symptoms.  This also could, conceivably, be polyarteritis, an inflammation of arteries (sometimes large, sometimes small, sometimes both, sometimes highly localized and sometimes widespread) which can cause lots of pain, organic dysfunction, etc.  There are some other autoimmune diseases which also should be ruled out and which haven't been as yet. While SSRI medication is sometimes helpful with symptoms of this sort, drugs like gabapentin and pregabalin are usually more helpful and might well help narrow down the range of potential disorders to be identified. The relief alone, if one of these meds should help, would be a big step forward.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here and keep us updated.\n\n",

If anyone still has any suggestions please let me know. I will keep this post updated as I continue to seek answers. Is a neurologist perhaps the right kind of specialist to go see?  Oh also, was tested for gall bladder problems and they found small stones and sludge. One doctor has suggested removal.

I had surgery approximately one year ago and had half of my thyroid removed because of a 3.5 cm cyst on the left side that was pressing on my airway. Don't know if this could be related to current problems or not, although all my thyroid hormone level tests have come back normal.\n\n",

    "content": "This ANA result confirms my suspicion of autoimmune problems. This will probably be managed best by a rheumatologist with \"tag-teaming\" possibly with a neurologist, if the problem is affecting nerves as it seems to be. The pain blocking medication still seems a possible avenue of help, although once the basic problem is identified steroids may be more effective in the short run.  With all this going on it may seem overwhelming to consider having your gallbladder removed, but since this has become such a simple, routine procedure, and since it can really add to your physical woes, it probably would benefit you greatly to have that out of the picture and not clouding the collective symptoms. Also, you'd feel better in general once that's done.   Please do keep us updated. Having a diagnostic direction is a big first step.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm back and better in some ways and not in others. The rheumatologist sent for xrays from head to toe and A LOT of bloodwork. The only two tests that have come back abnormal is the ANA and D Dimer... both pretty nonspecific findings. Everything else normal-  60 labs, and everything falls in the normal range.  I had the gall bladder surgery, which came with some minor complications, but an overnight stay in the hospital along with extensive testing for clots (because the leg pain seemed to get much worse after surgery) and a few days later I returned to my version of normal.  I saw an allergist as well, which helped determine that I have severe allergies- both indoor and outdoor, including severe dust and mold allergies. I also had lung function tests which determined I have a pretty severe lung deficiency that was improved by bronchodilators. They concluded that I had significant asthma that required treatment.  So now I am on a regiment of inhaler, allergy meds, omeprazole (for GERD), and unfortunately ambien. I don't think I have slept through the night without it in several months now. I get the tremors in the night still when I don't take the ambien. Its like being shocked with an electrical current, but not in the jerky body falling asleep kind of way because its rather painful. Still have leg pain and burning in my feet. I am trying to work on exercising more to see if it helps the legs. But I am not overweight. I am pretty average.   Now that you have my whole story I will conclude by saying I still have chest pain after two months of regular inhaler use, severe headaches, intermittent stomach pain, pretty constant leg pain, feet burning, and insomnia. I have found a new primary care but the doctors don't have much more they can do really.  Any suggestions?\n\n",

I began to get upset, then the right side of my lips, cheek and tongue went numb with the same feeling as in my right hand. The whole thing lasted just a few minutes, followed by a throbbing headache, I went to bed and woke up the next morning feeling like I had a terrible hangover, even though I had not consumed any alcohol. This is the second time I have had one of these \"attacks\" and I also would love to find out what is wrong with us!  Thanks Hayley\n\n",

    "content": "Hello both of you,  I am relieved to find this post too... I have an issue similar to yours but, if I comprehend your post correctly, mine are more frequent. I suffered seven head trauma's since I was six. Two years ago, I got in a fight with a guy and I got my head smacked pretty hard into a concrete floor and I lost consciousness for a few minutes. Since then, I often get weird symptoms that don't seem related to any doctor I have seen. I get a sensation in my head that it is half filled with wet cotton filling and I get suddenly onset double vision and speech impairments. Like Matt, I can hear what  I want to say in my head, but I can't say it right out loud. I get numbness in the left side of my face and twitching in my left eye. I can't walk unassisted without tripping over my feet, and both of my hands will go frightfully cold. Last time I went to the hospital for it my blood pressure spiked at 188/96. Ten minutes later, it was normal again. I would really appreciate an answer to this... I get hurt often because of it.   Katsuko\n\n",

Because stress and anxiety is the usual culprit behind headaches but there are also some cases that a person has brain tumor, head injury, cervical or cranial disorders, and a whole lot more...

    "content": "I'm a 25 year old mother of three. During my  last pregnancy I had a few very  scary attacks. I was 7 months pregnant, when I woke up I noticed that I coudnt see the left side of my son's face, it wasnt the hole side, more like just his left eye. It was like I looked at a very bright light, or like a sun spot. well my vision clear up but about 10 mins later i had tingling in my left arm that spread to my right arm, around my mouth, it was like my teeth and touge were tingling. 911 was called, my vital's were fine, and the tingling went away. I had a CT scan, it came back normal, blood work, all was fine, but i was still told it was a TIA. I do have factor five leiden, a blood clotting disorder. I told my OBGYN I had a TIA, she said she believed it was a migraine since they were common with pregnancy. I had three more of these attacks, with two of them it started out with my hand seeming to be really far from my face then came the spot in my vision. I began to look it up on the computer, I could not see the first two letters i was typing. Does this sound like a TIA?  or a migraine. Would somthing have showed up on the CT it was a migraine ? also I still get tingling in my finger's a little, also have slight dizziness, doctor said dizziness was from allergys.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Migraine or TIA ?",
    "content": "Hello -  Unfortunately, the symptoms of migraine often mimic TIA symptoms, which is what's happened in your case. The odds are great that this was migraine because of all the classic visual symptoms, plus the fact that migraine is very common during pregnancy, and it sounds like you've been having optical migraine without the headache. Further stuff which makes it likely to be migraine-related is that the tingling you experienced in one arm eventually spread to the other as well. Strokes or TIAs are always unilateral unless there has been a catastropic bleed on the brain (in which case you wouldn't likely be typing  anything or doing much else for quite a while). The clots that are sometimes associated with Factor V Leiden are sometimes the cause of a stroke, more often a pulmonary embolism, but in either case the clots are usually too large to cause repeated TIAs with complete recovery in between. While this condition does place you at some slight risk of a DVT and possible pulmonary embolism (or even, though less likely, a stroke), it really does sound as though you've experienced multiple episodes of optical migraine. You didn't mention any headached developing, but you did mention the sense of having looked at a bright light, which is also classic for optical migraine. If you don't get the headaches you are ahead of the game, although the aura symptoms you've described can be pretty disturbing, at least until they've happened a few times. If you do happen to get the headaches, I'm going to assume they develop during or after these more bizarre symptoms, and that would also argue in favor of migraine, since TIAs or any sort of cerebral embolism almost never causes headache (although cerebral hemmorhage, which is not a feature of eboli, causes exquisite pain as a rule). Based on all this, it seems extremely likely your problems have been due to optical migraine aggravated by pregnancy.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hair Line Fracture and Headaches",
    "content": "Hello --  It is remotely possible this could be some sort of sequel to or result of the minor fracture you sustained 40 years ago, but it is unlikely. However, it is possible the sensation  would be similar if local nerves were affected at the time of injury and this might be a logical site for a neuritis to arise, although probably with no direct connection to the old injury. These sorts of healed areas are sometimes more inclined to have this sort of inflammatory problem or it may just be that the location of the current pain determines its quality. Again, it is highly unlikely to be a direct result of the old injury, but could be indirectly related or could be simply that the injury site is more sensitive due to overgrowth of nerve tissue along the path of the fracture. The headache itself is the real issue, and the best way to treat it is the real mission.   I hope this helps. Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

It only happened 1 other time besides that time and now I get these weird feeling headaches and I have had this weird vision problem ever since that day happened, it's an everyday thing for me, the vision problem is, it's like I can look at something for a few seconds and it will appear to look 3-d and everything kinda fades when I look at it for a few seconds.    When I look at my window blinds at night the light from outside hits my blinds and then makes a shadow on each 1, and when I look at that shadow they all turn white, everything does, but mostly everything I see looks 3-d.    And also I feel outta my head most of the time like im not in my body or like my head is empty, I get dizzy at times and my eyes feel like they have alot of pressure behind them,they feel real hard like a rock sometimes. I've had a cat scan and a mri done on my head they didn't see anything but I went about 2 months after it started happening.    I've read if you go to soon that sometimes they can't tell what it is like if it's a tumor they might not see it, I get real worried at times and I would like as much info and help I could get. Please reply back thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Head Pressure - Vision, Ear, Chest, Period, etc",
    "content": "Hi there.  I am a 26 year old female and I'm about to sound like a complete bag of ailments! Please bear with me -  this reads like a novel!  I will empty the bag below:  - Head pressure, right side only. Located behind eye, more recently extending towards temple and ear. Until approx mid last year I had very few headaches (would only experience perhaps 1 headache per year!). Headaches more frequent in past year, fullness feeling is more frequent - squeezing/pushing sensation behind right right eye. - Pressure has been particularly distracting this week and exhausting. This caused me to take 1 day off work (yesterday).   This morning, I woke with a bizarre soreness (to touch) around the right temple - cheekbone. Almost like sunburn.  Fullness in head arrived again approx 1hr after this.   - Vision. Have noticed mild vision changes over past few months. slight \"glassiness\" / Blurred vision in right eye. Only mild. In last 2 weeks black spot/floater appeared in the LEFT eye (resembles a small fly flying through my vision). This is still here. In past 3 months, noticed (while doing make-up) that my right eyelid had become less visible (skin under brow hides crease). This has become far more prominent in last 2 weeks (the drooping skin now rests on my eyelashes and feels heavy). I catch myself raising my brows to ease it. I also experienced a spell of  frequent \"twitching\" around the eye about a month ago.  Ear - Hearing in right ear has deteriorated slightly over 2 years or more (not sure if this is related to other symptoms). Mild ringing has appeared over last year (usually only noticed when in quiet room/bed).   Periods - Over the last year my periods have become irregular. My cycle has always been normal. 33 days with 6 days on - for years. Over the past year, my cycle has been anything from 44 - 64 with different durations (my last cycle was 64 days and the period only lasted for 3 days).  Tiredness - I feel tired more easily that I used to. I generally sleep for 8hrs (or more) per night, generally have a good diet (my boyfriend thinks I'm a saint!) and until the last 2 weeks or so, go to the gym regularly/exercise at home. (i've not felt well enough to train more recently).  Unusual - Particularly since the start of this year, I have noticed that I have had more difficulty in concentrating/absorbing information and \"thinking on my feet\". I would normally consider myself to be very articulate and quick witted. However, more recently, I have had strange episodes of mental block/freezing during conversations/not remembering words. The most recent being 2 days ago during a meeting. I became lost whilst describing something simple. Also, I have no reason to feel unhappy, anxious or stressed (lucky for some) but have recently felt myself become agitated for an unknown reason/more easily. Work colleagues have also commented (either directly to me/or to each other) that I seem quiet or not myself. They have also commented that I do not look well/look tired.  - I have also been experiencing episodes of nausea and gagging/heaving. Certain sights and particularly smells which I was previously indifferent to, now cause a gagging reaction (?!). I feel as if i will be sick.  Chest Pains - I have been experiencing unusual sensations in the chest. Approx 2 months ago, whilst washing up, I experienced a strong pain in the chest (central/right) and had shooting pains along my right arm. Due to my age and that I should be more concerned by pains on the opposite site, I was not overly worried. However, later that day and for the following  week, I had bouts of the same sensation (albeit milder) along both arms. I still occasionally get a twinge now. I thought it best to mention this as I have a family history of heart problems.  Please can I get some feedback on the above. I'm fully aware that this may appear totally and utterly unbelievable (and this is why I have been reluctant so far to go to a doctor) but I can assure you that each symptom is 100% genuine and is now beginning to cause me some concern.   Many thanks\n\n",

    "content": "You certainly do have your share of challenging symptoms.  I see the potential for something systemic that is causing multiple symptoms, such as relating to the endocrine system, or a variety of unrelated problems.  First thing you need to do is see a doctor for a complete evaluation, including blood tests (especially thyroid, etc.).  This could be done through an internal medicine doctor, an endocrinologist, or a family practice physician.  Before your appointment, print off this list so you won't forget to tell the doctor about everything that is happening.  Each piece could be a part of the big puzzle and it's necessary to have all the pieces.   If additional testing is indicated you can then be referred to the appropriate specialist.  It is complicated and certainly requires some hands-on care that you cannot get through a general online forum such as this.  I'm sorry I cannot be more specific but it would be a huge guess at best.  Good luck.  Please keep us posted.\n\n",

He prescribed antibiotics to rule out a sinus or ear infection and bloods to check for aneamia and  thyroid disorder. I had exactly the same thought to print off the list. However, I stupidly felt too awkward to read it out. I had mentioned it but he did not seem to be too interested. The things which i therefore missed were chest pains, the memory/concentration problems and muscle shakes.  I'll go back next week to discuss the results of the blood test and will let the forum know what happens. Thanks again.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Tension Headaches- no cure in sight",
    "content": "Hello,   I am a 22 year old female currently experiencing chronic painful tension headaches. These headaches have been occurring for 3-4 months. When I went to my PCP for this problem he advised me to continue to take naproxen 2x daily and prescribed me Firocet and Treximet. The Fiorocet knocks me out, so while helpful, does little to calm my headaches until I can take it at bedtime and Treximet (like Imitrex) does little to eliminate my occasional migraines, and also makes my heart race and makes me very dizzy.   Both my Psychiatrist and Psychologist agree I will benefit very little from therapy if I am constantly experiencing this pain. I am uncomfortable and exhausted from the constant pain.  As for my medical history, I have been diagnosed with MDD and Panic disorder w/o agoraphobia. I am currently taking Cymbalta 60mg, Klonopin 0.5 tid, clonidine 0.1 bid., and fiorocet PRN every six hours. I do not believe the medications are causing these headaches.   I have had a CT in the past year that came up normal.  My mother has a history of migraines. and at age 12 I had a skull fracture with some amnesia due to a car accident,  My current blood pressure ranges between 142/90 to 140/110 when I am stress and drops back to normal when am calm.  I give all this information in hopes of possible getting answer. This pain has severly affected my quality of life.  Amanda Baker, Psy B.S.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Chronic Tension Headaches- no cure in sight",
    "content": "Hi Amanda  --  First, have your headaches been diagnosed as tension type? The reason I ask is that I get the impression they are a little more severe and intrusive than normal tension headaches and since you've been given Treximet (normally used for migraines) wonder if they may be histamine/cluster headaches instead. The treatment is usually drawn from the same group of medications as for migraine, but the mechanism of pain is somewhat different, and drugs like Treximet are less likey to be helpful and can have some pretty unpleasant side effects. While the Fioricet has the unfortunate sedative effect, Fiornal plain might well work adequately during the day, and since you tolerate Fioricet well  (other than sedation) you should be okay with the non-opiated form in daytime. Also, you take Klonopin,  which would of course act symbiotically with Fioricet to make you drowsy,  but with plain Fioricet during the day the two might well balance each other out in terms of sedation and be helpful in terms of awareness and especially the work  involved in productive psychotherapy, not to mention quality of life.  I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: right upper jaw pain, and right side to temple pain",
    "content": "Hello --  I strongly suspect you have an abcessed tooth and the abcess has made its way, via fistula, into a sinus cavity causing a drain which causes now an expansion of the infection. While the tooth may or may not be a wisdom tooth, it doesn't matter at this point; whatever tooth it is, it will have to come out or at least have a root canal done, as well as sinus irrigation and infection care.   Lack of insurance often leads to far more serious problems which absolutely have to be manged medically. This appears to be where you are now. Dental insurance is usually pretty limited in its usefulness anyway, and can easily be exhausted in a few months, so you'd likely be in this situation anyway, if you did have that coverage. For this reason we need to make sacrifices where the problem becomes serious enough to demand dental/medical attention. Fortunately many dentists and quite a few doctors also will work on a sliding scale or at least work out a payment plan for people without means to pay up front. If worst comes to worst you could  present at an ER and seek treatment since they are not at liberty to turn you away due to inability to pay. While I really don't endorse this approach, I find I am having to suggest it ever more frequently because of the breakdown of healthcare coverage.  Having worked in ERs for a good part of my career, I really don't like suggesting this, but the patient is the bottom line,  not the money. It's something to consider, since what you describe sounds as though it is becoming an urgent if not emergent situation, and it certainly could become an emergent one quickly.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck, and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all. My name is Perry and I'm 22 years old.  Since I was a kid, about 10 or so, I would expierence severe headaches.  They would wake me up in the middle of the night, and I would puke.  They always made me really dizzy, and I couldn't get rid of them. As I became older, the headaches seemed to become less frequent, but when I get them now, they are still bad.  Something else has also came up since I've grown up; extreme dizzy spells.  I will just be sitting in a chair, not spinning, not moving my head, just sitting and relaxing. All of a sudden, the room goes from normal view, to inverted extremely fast.  So, like looking at the horizon, then the horizon goes vertical.  This lasts for about 5 sec. and while this is happening, I lose my ability to hear anything, vision becomes very blurry if not temp. blinded, cold sweats, and shaking.  There is also a loud ringing in my ears as soon as the room tilts and the ringing fades out after 1 min. or so.  After this has passed, I am very dizzy for about 15 mins or so, still shakey and I feel very anxious.  Sometimes this happens when I am standing up as well, like at work the other day.  Honestly, the only time this hasn't happened is when I am laying down.  Any advice?  Thanks.\n\n",

You really should see a doctor but before you do, keep a food/headache diary for a couple of weeks - what you eat and when the headaches strike. This will help the doctor determine what might be causing the headaches. If the two of you can figure that out, you might be able to cut down on their frequency or even eliminate them altogether.\n\n",

He has had every test you can imagine to find out what it is as well as being taken off blood pressure meds thinking that might be causing. Recently I was a guest in his home for 5 days. On the 5th day I woke up with severe dizziness! It lasted on and off that day but when I left his home and went back to mine the dizziness quit. Could it be something at his house/environment that is causing these dizzy spells and if so, what? Thank you!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sharp shooting pain in head",
    "content": "Hi there --  This pain is characteristic of inflammation of one of the cranial nerves, usually the VII or trigeminal nerve. If it becomes too frequent, extremely severe, or otherwise disruptive or disabling, there are methods of treating or managing this, but often it will go away on its own, although it usually will recur from time to time. When it becomes too disruptive you'll have no problem  deciding to take action. In the meantime,  it's worth trying over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain meds like ibuprofin every eight hours (or naproxyn every 12 hours) during times when the pain is active. Sometimes this will get the drop on it and prevent it or make it less intrusive. If this doesn't work the next step is to see a doctor for possible referral to a neurologist.  Hope this helps. Good luck to you with this and please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

Went to the doctor years ago and they diagnosed it as sinus headaches.  But for the past couple of days I have gotten a type of headache I have never had before. Its more of a dull pain in my head. They each usually last for 30 minutes about 5 times a day. So far I have had the pain on the left/right side of my head also once in the back of my head.   The pain is so dull sometimes I question myself whether it's really there (but it is there). The dull pain is also constant it never gets any worse its always the same\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While the former headaches really don't sound like typical sinus headaches, they seem to have resolved, so we'll stick with what you're having now, which sound like global headaches, probably tension type.  Needless to say theres are usually related to stress, although they can be caused by physical tension as well, without a stress trigger. Either way, they are treated the same, with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and sometimes muscle relaxants as well. It would be worth bringing this to the attention of your doctor, however, just so someone can do a face-to-face, cursory neurological survey before sending you to the drugstore. They really do sound, at least, a lot like classic tension headaches, however.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  While the calcification should be explored further, I don't think it's likely the cause of the skull/scalp tenderness, nor the headaches.  More likely there is an inflamed cranial nerve or neuritis causing this. It is  likely due to a viral cause, but is treated symptomatically regardless of cause unless there is a mechanical basis for it, which is possible but, again, unlikely. I hope you'll have a neurologist follow up with this, since it compromises your child's quality of life and probably is amenable to fairly simple  medical treatment. Again, I doubt the calcifications have anything to do with it.   I hope this helps. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a fairly active 24 year old Male.  Seven weeks ago During sexual activity I experienced a very strange pulsating headache on the back right side of my head. I figured I was getting sick or something and brushed it off. The following week the pain would happen during sex or heavy physical activity. I went to my Doctor and he sent me to the er for a ct scan to check for bleeding. At that point the headache was still there however dull and not as painful however constantly pulsating. The results came back negative and they set me up with a neurologist. However, the appointment won't be until 5/9/09. The headache has stayed there this whole time, at some points it is worse than others and will move around only on the right side of my head. I have also suffered from mood swings, nausea, blurry vision on right, and numbness of limbs. The headace has gotten more and more nauseating so I went to the ER this week and told them the symptoms, they sent for the ct scan and after they got that they sent me back for a MRI. The results came back negative for anything serious such as tumor or aneurysm. However that was the opinion of the radiologist and er doc, so his advice was to follow up with a neurologist soon. He also thought it was strange that you could touch the back of my head and feel my heartbeat which is probably the most annoying thing about this headache.   Thanks for your response and input.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 7 Weeks of Constant Headache",
    "content": "Hi there --  Oddly, one of the first things that I wondered as I began to read your post, and resolved to ask you, was if you could feel arterial pulsing on the surface of the area where the headache is occurring. You answered that in the last part of your post. This can often suggest a sort of migraine variant, although there could be something a little deeper causing the prominent superficial arteries, such as giant cell arteritis, which often shows up on the temple but can occur anywhere in the body. This is something that will need to be ruled out,  assuming the diagnosis isn't obvious to a neurologist when you finally get in to be seen. That's a long wait, and the ER isn't persuing or referring or otherwise helping to move up the date of your appointment. Sometimes the emergency department is able to push things along, sometimes not. Since you aren't going to be seen for about three weeks, my suggestion would be  to go easy physically in the meantime, and if there is any change or flareup of the symptoms, to go back to the ER and ask they at least test your ESR for signs of inflammation  that might indicate arteritis, which is my number one suspect right now, based on their readings of the MRI and I'm surprised the matter of palpable pulsing didn't suggest arteritis to them at the time. Hopefully you could at the least be prescribed a small amount of pain medication to hold  you until you can be seen,  and if this is giant cell arteritis you may wind up being referred again, this time to  a rheumatologist.  Hope this is helpful to you. Please stay in touch and by all means update us after the neurology consult. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Two things: first, a general rule is if you experience a headache that you'd describe as the worst you've ever experienced, you should be evaluated for a possible serious problem. While this may have been some other, relatively innocent sort of headache, the severity, along with the other symptoms you've described, strongly suggest something wrong inside the head or perhaps involving out-of-control blood pressure.  Second: for future reference, if you ever have another severe headache, please do not take aspirin for it. Even something like Advil or Aleve could be contraindicated, but aspirin increases bleeding tendencies, and if the pain were due to a bleed on the brain this would only make it worse. For these situations Tylenol is by far the better choice, even though it's not always as effective.  Now then: you did have a strange interlude. It could be innocent, but you really do deserve a thorough neurological exam to rule out any abnormal blood vessels in the skull and also to check and see if you have a tendency toward spiking blood pressure at peak exercise. There are sometimes relatively easily managed conditions that can cause this, but you can't afford to let this happen again. I hope you'll bring this to the attention of your parents and your doctor, and the sooner the better. If it's all okay, that's great. But on the chance that it was due to something more serious, repeat performances of this cannot be allowed.   I hope this is helfpful to you. Please follow up with us here. Good luck to you, and take it easy til you've been examined thoroughly, okay?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: diagnosed with cyst on back of my brain",
    "content": "Hello --  I'm assuming the urgent care facility performed am MRI to diagnose this cyst. Most anything else wouldn't yield an accurate picture. That being the case, your neurologist will have to determine whether this particular cyst is arachnoid or ependymal, although both types frequently are left alone in the absence of symptoms. Since you're having  symptoms  (severe headaches) you'll at the very least need symptomatic treatment to relieve the headaches, and since this may indicate the cyst is under pressure, there may be a need to reduce, drain, fenestrate or otherwise invasively downsize or remove the cyst, which is probably filled with cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These are generally not new, are often present from  birth,  can resolve spontaneously and are most often not a problem. Again, since you're having some symptoms, a neurologist will  have to confirm the diagnosis, assess the  size and location of the cyst, initiate symptomatic treatment, and decide whether or not the cyst needs to be disturbed in order to keep things on the level. This  should be fairly simple, at least up to the point where there is a decision on surgery required. You'll then work together, if it  is needed, to come to an agreeable conclusion as to what needs to be done, how and when.  I hope this is  helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed, and update us for sure once you've been seen by the neurologist. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband is 30 yrs old and about 9yrs ago he was having a bowl movment and got a excruciating head pain and a feeling in his stomach that felt \"like his insides were going to come out\". He then blacked out and was taken to the hospital, they ran a cat scan found nothing and gave him a shot n sent him home.  Recently this past 19th of march he again was having a bowl movment and the same pain occured it lasted about 30 minutes and didnt happen again for the rest of the day. i took him to the doctor they checked his blood, and all that came back was that his white blood cell count was a little up. She gave him prescription headache medicne and told us if it happened again to go to the emergency room. On the 23rd it happened again but MUCH MUCH worse. (Every time he gets one of those major headaches (feels like alot of pressure)his face turns really red, he starts to sweat alot, breathing hard, vomiting, and nothing but a hot shower running over his head helps. all the doctors weve seen are casting it off as \"just a headache\"but until they see his reaction and what he goes thru when its happening i guess they wont understand)  We rushed him to the emergency room and they did a lumber (spinal tap?), blood work, and a cat scan, everything came back normal exept again the white blood cells were a bit high. That same day he started vomiting continuisly, since then he's had a lesser pained headache as if the one that happened that day never went away and hes been getting at least 2-3 major headaches a day and vomiting about 3-4 times a day. im very scared hes lost about 15lbs within 3-4 days his appitite is gone and anything he eats he vomits, its gotten to the point the only think that comes out is bile or dry heaving.... i need some sort of direction to go, im very scared and need help.  I did take him to a neurologist  but LITERALLY all he did was a reflex test and said  he had cronic headaches and prescribed him a prevenitive pain medicine, a medicine if a major headache occures and a \"rescue\" nasal spray if he got a major headache . He had a attack at the the appt. and all the doctoar offered was for him to go to the hospital but we don't have alot of money to keep taking him to the emergency room for the same results.  he still is getting the headpains and vomiting please any suggestions would help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  The poor care your husband has received for this is amazing, especially having seen a neurologist who blew this off so quickly. There are a number of possible causes for this, from the relatively innocent to the very serious, and it needs to be narrowed down, diagnosed, and managed, even if it is a relatively minor thing, because the symptoms must be near intolerable for your husband.  He may suffer from a form of \"exploding head\" headache triggered by straining at stool, which is one form of what's known as a Valsalva maneuver. This maneuver will raise the blood pressure and intracranial pressure, slow the heart rate, and sometimes trigger headaches, vomiting, etc. Most often people who perform this maneuver voluntarily will make themselves lightheaded and sometimes even pass out, but when it's more or less accidental (as in your husband's case), it can take on a life of its own momentarily and trigger terrible headaches and somtimes dangerously high intracranial pressure. This is usually secondary to a brain tumor, non-specific brain swelling, a bockage of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) at the base of the brain, or several other things, all of which need to be ruled out by careful neurological study, MRI of the brain, certain maneuvers, etc. A second neurolgy opinion would be extremely important, as this has the potential to be a very serious problem (although, as I said earlier, it could possibly be less sinister).  By all means find a neurologist who actually takes an interest in his patients and have him do a thorough workup with the necessary exams to uncover why this is happening. Please also follow up with  us here as needed. Good luck to you both.\n\n",

They checked for flu, checked my blood, did a scan of my head, and a spinal tap.  All of the tests came back ok... Only thing they knew was that I had a fever and that my white blood cells were a little high.  They sent me home telling me to take Tylenol for the fever.... Now that Im home and have slept, the headache is coming back... Any info??\n\n",

I also start to feel the headaches coming on when I am lifting weights at the gym, but I stop lifting as soon as I feel it coming on so it doesn't get bad.  The pain came on very quickly the first time, probably within about 2-3 seconds.  I kind of feel nauscous, but have not actually vommited.  I don't really know how long they last becasue I usually just try to fall asleep as soon as possible.  I also notice that even in the mornings I feel a very mild ache.  The pain is in two spots in the back of my head, probably about two inches apart, about at the height of the middle of my ears.  The only other thing that I have noticed is that my lymphnoids, at least i think thats what they are called, in my armpits swelled up for a day or two, but have since gone back down, but the headaches still persist.  I thought maybe it was just tension in my neck so i tried to masturbate with my head back and relaxed but it still gave me a headache, alothough maybe not quite as bad.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  What you describe sounds much like what's known as exertion  headache. This is not uncommon, but since it can be caused by underlying serious problems, if it continues it should be looked into. Ten per cent of these are caused by organic disease of various sorts. The rest are mostly due to a form of migraine, and they  usually last just minutes but can go on longer.   It's best to have this evaluated if it is consistent. While it's probably just normal (90 per cent are) there's a 10 per cent chance there could be a serious underlying cause, and 10 per cent is relatively high in terms of medical statisical data.   Hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Occasionally when I yawn I get a really sharp pain in my head (just above the ear - on one side only, although the side varies I think - most recently in the right side).  It only lasts for a few seconds, and feels like (I don't know if this is possible) a blood vessel getting trapped momentarily then snapping back. Although the sharp pain only lasts for a few seconds, I do sometimes get a regular (dull) headache later (a few hours after) which is not in the same area of the head - and maybe unrelated. Any help as to what this is and how to avoid it (apart from not yawning, which I can't control very well!) gratefully received. Thank you. x\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Rather than a blood vessel being temporarily trapped (wouldn't feel the way you'd think it would) this is probably a nerve being trapped or plucked for a moment, and it may well be due to temporamendibular joint (TMJ) problems. Often we don't know we have such a thing going on, because the symptoms are often away from the jaw and sometimes not seemingly related (headaches, dizziness, pain in the head when yawning, etc.). TMJ problems can be caused by evolutionary changes, nocturnal tooth grinding (bruxism), trauma, dental misalignment (often very slight), etc. This seems the most likely cause of your head pains. The later headaches could be unrelated -- or not. It's hard to know. If this is due to TMJ,  then the headaches may also be related. Often a dentist is the one who discovers some evidence of the problem and is a good starting point for trying to uncover the cause.   Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

When I say lower neck, the area is close to where one would consider a \"hump neck\" to be, however, I do not have a hump neck.  The nerve pain is on the right side of the bone there, and limits the movement of my head.  For this, I have been taking Tylenol Extra Strength and using a topical analgesic heat rub, such as Icy Hot for the pain.  It relieves the pain, however, has not made it go away.  Lately, for the past week and a half, I have started to recieve throbbing headaches which seem to be in the temporal lobe area; primarily right between my temple and my ear but sometimes stretches towards the top of my head when the shooting pains occur.  I am not able to bend over and/or pick things up without this intense throbbing pain.  Sometimes talking can even cause intense pressure in this area, causing me to have a constant headache the rest of the day.  I have been taking Tylenol Extra Strength to try and relieve the pressure and pain of these headaches, but it is not working....  Could the pain in my neck be causing the pain my head?

    "content": "Hello Lady J. --  There's a very good chance the neck pain and the headaches are related. While  this can sometimes be due to a casual and benign relationship, there's enough going in the area you describe (cervical vertebra or C7) that a problem there could cause disabling retrograde headache as well as other symptoms. It also could be something more troublesome, so I'd strongly recommend having this evaluated by a neurologist. You may benefit  from physical therapy or my find there's something far enough out of alignment to warrant consideration of surgery. In the meantime you'll probably need something more than over-the-counter NSAIDs for the pain, and this will require a prescription most likely.  I  hope this is helpful.  Please follow up with us here as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Headache and facial pain, swelling",
    "content": "Hi there -  This sounds very much, first of all, like it might be  due to a dental problem rather than the second-most-likely cause, which would be a sinus problem.  Sometimes  the two can co-exist and cause this  sort of thing, with an abcess either at the root of the tooth or in the form of a fistula into one of the sinuses nearest the affected tooth.   Normally antibiotics would be a short-term fix for this,  but a dental and ENT workup together would probably yield the best result. Also, a specific CT of the sinuses would be indicated, as \"CT of the  head\" can be  fairly non-specific and aimed at the cranium rather than  the  sinuses. Sometimes this misses all  but the most gross sinusoidal cysts.   Since you did, at the time, have some sort of sinus infection, this is  probably related to that, but the larger problem may well be a tooth. This is usually what will cause swelling, pain and discoloration in the cheek.   Probably, since you had so little luck with the ER (because they are going to look for the most serious things first, and  not finding them,  move you down the ladder), a dentist may well be your best bet right now. A well equipped dental  practice will  even be able to do a panoramic x-ray of both the full mouth (teeth) and sinuses.   I don't think there's much likelihood this is due to a pinched nerve, and the swelling and discoloration (among other things) argue against early MS. Think  tooth, then sinus, perhaps tied together via an  abcess.   Good luck with this. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Nightly unilateral headaches",
    "content": "Hello -  Your description of the symptoms very closely approximates those of cluster headaches, with the exception, as noted, of the duration and severity. This could be an atypical presentation of the classic cluster syndrome, or it could be something else masquerading as virtually the same thing. The fact that cluster headache pain is usually described as a \"pushing out\" from behind the eye on the affected side, the regular timing of cluster headaches, etc., strongly argue for atypical cluster or histamine headaches or something similar caused by irritation of the trigeminal (5th cranial) nerve. I strongly suspect you're experiencing a variation on this theme, with less than \"worse pain ever experienced\" headache, but spread over longer periods of time. Evaluation by a neurologist would probably be the most  expedient route to relief for this, and could also rule out some unlikely oddball cause. The timing and location certainly do agree with the cluster phenomenon whereas an aneurysmal dilation would cause the pain around the clock.   I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Juli --  I take it there's been no concrete diagnosis as to the cause of your pain. This could be a neuropathy caused by either some obscure orthopedic problem or could be the result fo a viral problem. While physical therapy (PT) isn't a panacea, it may well be helpful. If it is, you'll be enouraged to expand on it. If the problem is due to some undiscovered orthopedic problem, PT may well help relieve the headache and other pains as well. It's certain worth a try. No guarantees, but it might just be the thing that helps turn this around, since all the most serious problems seem to have been eliminated by testing.   Best of luck to you.

    "title": "Re: I suffer fr. Migraines, Low bp & Sinus Tach, is Inderal OK",
    "content": "Hi there -  Inderal LA is generally helpful with both inappropriate sinus tach and also often with migraine as well, so two out of three may work for you. Here's why: \"low\" blood pressure is relative. So long as the patient is functioning and up and walking around and not fainting, the blood pressure clearly is adequate for the tasks of living. The problem is largely dependent upon height, weight and the responsiveness of the individual's baroreceptors, which help maintain proper blood pressure. While Inderal will likley cause your BP to drop some, at least initially, if you're able to observe the precautions you mentioned (regarding standing up slowly, etc.), and are able to push past the lower blood pressure by keeping physically active, well-hydrated and perhaps even increase your salt intake slightly, you'll probably do fine with it. It's at least well worth a trial run. The  initial lethargy and possible lightheadedness should be transient if it happens at all. Your regular blood pressure is actually excellent, and some people, especially petite females, often manage to function well with much lower average pressures (think 80/40). It just varies from individual to individual, and there's no rule about BP being too low, so long as the patient is functiioning well.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with  us as needed. Good luck to you with this.\n\n",

The strong anti-inflammatories you're taking might well help somewhat in most cases, and nortriptyline may in some cases, but there are other, generally more effective drugs which might be tried, such as pregabalin and gabapentin. It might well be worth a trial of either or both (trying one and, if it doesn't work or doesn't agree with you, then  trying the other). This could possibly help during the slow recovery phase. It may be worth mentioning to your doctor.  Please follow up with us here as needed, and keep us updated as well.\n\n",

The headaches came first, and I went to my doctor, who said I just had a tension headache and gave me amitriptyline. Shortly after I left the doctor, the pain in my jaw and ear began. The amitriptyline helped, but I tried taking naproxen so I could have pain relief during the day, and the naproxen worked just as well. I have also just gotten over a cold, and I thought that the pain might have been a sinus infection, but now the cold symptoms have gone away, leaving behind the original headache and jaw/ear pain.   What could be causing this pain? Could it be TMJ problems - I have caught myself clenching and grinding my teeth, and I do bite my nails. Or is it something more serious?

    "content": "Hello -  This definitely sounds like TMJ involvement. The fact that you know you grind your teeth may only be the tip of that particular iceberg, too. The symptoms are classic for TMJ. Amitryptiline won't work better than naproxyn, since this isn't primarily a nerve problem but an orthopedic/orthodontic one. Sometimes a dentist turns out to be best at diagnosing and treating this. At least it's a good starting point.   Not a serious problem, unless, of course, you dislike pain. This can become quite painful in some cases. Bruxism (the grinding of teeth), if it takes place during waking hours, probably also happens when you are asleep, which is why it could be more severe a problem in the long run. Well worth having it checked, as it is often a fairly easy fix.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with  us as needed.\n\n",

We are currently in a poor financial status and are awaiting approval into a low-cost insurance program so we have been waiting to take him to the doctor however my husband and I are both terrified.

The symptoms that your son are experiencing should not be taken lightly.  I understand that you are in the works of organizing an insurance plan, but in the mean time, please consider an ER visit.  It is not uncommon for children to experience aches and pains, and sometimes headaches (associated with sinus congestion) during something like the flu that he has just experienced, but it is not something that should be getting progressively worse and more frequent.   Although your son may be suffering from something simple, and viral in nature, these symptoms are linked with many, many minor, and not so minor things. The only definitive answer you can get is with tests that can only be provided if seen by a Doctor.  In the meantime, please be mindful of his symptoms, vomiting on and off for weeks can really deplete a child of their much needed hydration, watch for any changes in behavior or mental status, treat the aches and pains, and most importantly, please see a Pediatrician.  Good luck! Wish you both well!  P.S.: It wouldn't hurt to ask for a vision exam on your little one too ;)\n\n",

You mentioned waiting for word on the low cost plan so I don't know if this is what you are talking about or not but you might call your local health department and inquire about low cost clinics that might be available.  You mentioned that he had been ill with flu and some viruses do remain in the body to cause other problems.  Be sure the doctor you see has the complete history of his symptoms.  They will take into consideration possible causes for the infection relating to your locale because some illnesses such as Lyme disease are native to certain areas and can be hard to diagnose.  The complete picture will include this information along with a physical exam and labs.  I agree with the other professionals that you need to find a doctor to see your child.  The emergency room is an expensive option but it is always available so if other resources fail you, that would be your route to care.  Children sometimes need medical attention sooner than adults because their little bodies can sometimes have a harder time fighting infection.    Good luck and best regards.\n\n",

A full neurological exam is needed since there are much more significant things in the possible list of causes.  His doctor will want to look for subtle physical exam findings that may be an indication for further evaluation.  If it is migraines, there are some very effective treatments.  The link to the recent cold may be that often viruses can trigger migraines.  Debbie is correct that there are often clinics that can see pt.'s without insurance on a free or reduced fee scale.  Your health department can help you find these if needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The unilateral nature of the  headaches do sound like migraines, but perhaps of a different (evolved or mutated) variety, since they allow you to function unlike classic migraine. What I find a little troubling is the weakness of the arm along with the headaches. Now bear in mind that almost always a problem on one side of the brain will affect the opposite side of the body, so this makes the problem all the more odd, and it is possible there is actually a different locus of origin of these headaches and it may be due to compression of more than one nerve, causing both symptoms on one side of the body. If this continues I'd strongly suggest you arrange a consult with a neurologist just to be on the safe side.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Although there's no known clear connection between varicose veins, Raynaud's and migraine, your fundamental theory seems fairly sound. I think at least the migraine  might well be related to Raynaud's,  since it could  be actually rebound headache, which is rather  similar to the mechanism of Raynaud's, and both, in your case at least, are affected somewhat by the weather. While the varicosities may also somehow figure into this, that might just be a \"bonus\" item. It is vascular, though, as you say,  so it can't be dismissed out of  hand; it just doesn't have any known relation to the other conditions, including mechanism (the other two haven't been conclusively linked, but there is at least a measurable similarity).

    "content": "Hello -  This could be a neck problem,  although it's difficult to tell from a distance and with little information and no imaging studies to look at. There are a lot of nerves which travel from the base of the skull and the top cervical vertabrae which operate in the area where the musculature of the neck/shoulder begin, and these can become  inflamed or irritated and cause low, back-of-the-head pain on the affected side. If careful movement of your head in circles causes the pain to increase or if doing this makes you dizzy, this is a good possibility. There are also other apparatus in the area -- mastoid process (behind the ear), tendons, etc., that can cause this sort of localized head pain. If it continues or gets more intense, it definitely should be evaluated. As it is now, especially if head movement worsens it, it  sounds like an orthopedic problem. That doesn't make the headache go away, but may help you narrow down the possible causes. Consider how you sleep (on that side?), how you sit at a computer, etc. Faulty posture can often cause this sort of pain.  Again,  if it continues and/or becomes worse, please have yourself evaluated by a doctor. It sounds, however, more like a postural-related nerve or muscle problem.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, When you see your doctor, be sure to mention your anxiety and worry over the possibility of aneurysm.  I am sure this serious condition is something the doctor will be certain to rule out.   Unfortunately there are many types of headache and the doctor can evaluate based on symptoms you report.  Don't underestimate the damage stress can do to your health.  If the doctor feels it is stress related, that does not mean it is unimportant.  Even if there are other physical causes of the headache, reducing stress through yoga, meditation, therapy and exercise can help your condition.  If anxiety is the main problem, medication might help that would help reduce these symptoms.  Good luck in your search for answers.  I hope your appointment is helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Sinus infection that is untreated can spread in the body and due to the close proximity to the brain, this can be a risky thing.  Simple congestion itself is not going to do this kind of harm - only if there is an infection, especially bacterial that needs antibiotic.  In that case you would likely develop fever and symptoms that would alarm you.  Follow your doctor's instructions.  Hopefully you will find the right solution.  Sinus congestion can definitely manifest itself as headache so you are probably on the right track.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello! I have been experiencing bizarre symptoms since November 2008 and I'm wondering if anyone could offer some guidance as to what tests I should have done or what kind of specialist to see at this point. I am a 33 year old female who is normally in excellent health. I'm usually very energetic, I exercise regularly, and run marathons. About mid-November I began to experience a persistent headache on the top of my head. I'm told that this is a vertex headache. The headache is accompanied by tenderness when the area is lightly touched. Several days after the headache began, I came down with a bad cold. My doctor told me that I had a bacterial upper respiratory infection and he prescribed antibiotics for 7 days. On the 8th day my cold symptoms were gone, but the headache remained. My doc told me to \"wait it out and see if it gets better.\" I waited until mid-December when the pain became unbearable. I was sent to a Dermatologist who ruled out and skin disorders. Subsequently, I was placed on a 20 day course of antibiotics to treat what my doc thought was a type of sinusitis. It's now 2009 and the headache is getting worse. OTC meds do not alleviate the pain. The pain is minimal in the morning and increases throughout the day. Nighttime is the absolute worst. Sometimes the pain is a burning sensation and the area is always painful to light touch. I now have new symptoms of nausea and fatigue. The fatigue hits me so hard that walking is a chore. My limbs just feel so tired. I had a CAT scan which was negative. I'm told that the CAT would have shown sinus issues if there are any? I'm following up with my MD this week to receive the results of a thyroid test and receive a referral to a neurologist. I'm wondering if this could be a thyroid disorder or perhaps Lyme disease? Are there specific tests I should ask to have done?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Persistent Vertex Headache & Fatigue",
    "content": "Hi there -  This doesn't sound, to me, like typical vertex headache. While it is in the right location, there are certain features that make it sound more like something else. Specifically, it would seem there might be some irritation of the xiii cranial nerve, possibly a herpes simplex infection or something pressing on the nerve near its outlet. I say this because of the tenderness to touch, which seems to persist much longer than usual. This is often seen with herpes (shingles), but your episode has lasted long enough to make me wonder if there might not be some structural interference  with the nerve.   A neurological workup for this problem could be fairly simple. It's relatively easy for a neurologist to trace the nerve pathway and an MRI of the brain might not be a bad idea, to rule out some sort of compression of the XIII cranial nerve, but a cursory exam might well expose a long-lasting herpetic or post-herpetic syndrome. This is often easily treated wtih drugs like gabapentin or pregabalin, which block the pain until the inflammation (if present) finally resolves. If this isn't the problem then there may be some mechanical pressure on the nerve causing a similar symptom, and this would need to be identified (thus the brain MRI). The increasing fatigue also suggests something viral, but this also could be a herald symptom of something more like MS (again, the brain MRI would be invaluable in ruling  this out). A neurological consult is a very good next step. I'm very sorry you've had to put up with this for so long,  but now maybe you can finally get to the bottom of it and get it managed  or even resolved.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed. Keep us updated, also.\n\n",

After going through many test and medications and an MRI we still are not sure what causes them.  I do have a slight herniated disk in my neck. Sometimes I can feel my neck \"pop\" and immediately I will get an awful headache.  Sometimes it is like a migrane that causes nausea and light and sound make it worse. Sometimes it is just an awful pain in the back of my neck, at the base of my skull that radiates up to my right temple.  I have tried various medications, physical therapy and chiropractic care.  Nothing seems to help for long.  This morning I was fine, then I turned my head and heard and felt the pop, now I have a terrible headache as well as almost unbearable neck pain.

    "content": "Hello -  It seems reasonable to suspect cervical disk herniation as a possible cause of the headaches. It certainly can be the culprit at times, and can also cause vertigo (dizziness where the room seems to spin or the floor to suddenly move). While  other causes for the headaches should definitely be ruled out, but if you're having symptoms (with the \"pop\" feature) when turning your head, you probably do have something going on in the cervical spine. A neurological consult is probably in order at this point.   I  hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with  this, and please let us know how things unfold.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The headaches may be related to something that happened during your fall this past summer, but the numbness in the outside three fingers is  more suggestive of an injury or impingement of a nerve (probably the ulnar nerve) which could tie in with the headaches and may or may not have been caused as a result of the fall. You'll need to see a doctor to determine the cause of the headaches and possibly the numbness in the ulnar aspect of your left hand. If that doesn't yield results you may have to be referred to a neurologist to determine what's causing this. Whether or not it's related to the fall (which could at least help located the focus of the problem), the residual issues need to be addressed and it sounds as though you may have some cervical injury which is causing pressure on a nerve and affecting your hand. It may also be contributing to the headaches, but this could be an incidental thing.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds as though you've been  suffering a long-term case of post-concussion syndrome (PCS), which usually doesn't last longer than one year. I'm wondering if, during the past six years, you've had consistent followup or, if not, when that ended. If you haven't been seen recently for this problem (within the past year at least) you really need to be re-evaluated for certain complications such as a vestibular concussion injury (inner ear damage caused by  the initial trauma). This can sometimes cause many of your symptoms for a long period of time, but it's fairly rare to have a remote trigger point such as you describe, so this really does need to be looked at. An MRI of the brain, possible electronystagmogram, and EEG should all probably follow a face-to-face office neurological survey to confirm vertigo and nystagmus.   Depending upon the cause discovered, this could be treated symptomatically or via a number of therapies or even possibly surgically. There is too much that appears to have been overlooked or ignored, so a fresh start with a new neurologist may be in order.  I hope this is helpful. There's definitely some unfinished business here, and you deserve to have this diagnosed correctly and made as close to right as possible.  Good luck to you with this, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi:  Your description of the quality and location of the pain suggests that it is something called trigeminal neuralgia.  The trigeminal nerve is primarily responsible for facial sensation.  It has three branches (trigeminus is latin for \"triplets\") that radiate across your face.  It is not uncommon for the middle branch (maxillary branch) to be compressed (usually by a blood vessel) causing the exact pain that you describe:  Sharp, shooting, lightning-like pain that lasts several seconds.  In medical terms, this is called \"lancinating\" pain, and it is highly suggestive of nerve impingement.  Pain is often triggered by lightly touching the affected area (in men, shaving will often be a trigger).   Your family doc will be able to diagnose this condition.  You may need an MRI/MRA to take a look at what is causing the nerve compression.   There are special medications for neuropathic pain that should alleviate your symptoms.  I hope this helps!    -Reid\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am not sure about the location you are referring to. Are you referring to the top of the skull (as in the highest point) or the top of the face (as in above the eyebrow).   How often does it recur? Does it occur early in the morning / late in the evening? Is it related to change in posture? Did you have a recent history of trauma in the area of complaint?  Several possibilities based on your description: If this is a recurring problem this could be some sort of neuralgia depending on the location of your symptoms. Another possibility is tension type headache although this is characteristically bilateral in nature. It could also be a local muscle problem, nerve problem.  Although pulsating character is associated with migraines, they typically last much longer than a few seconds.  It would be a good idea to have a physician examine you.  Please keep us updated.  Happy New Year!\n\n",

It took 4 weeks for me to be able to open my mouth enough to eat the size of a fast food burger. I figured they just opened my jaw too much when i was in surgery. During this time I was having pain in my jaw from my temple to my ear. It came and went. Well the past 2 weeks it has gotten worce. I have a constant migrane type pain in my right side, it pulses, I can take a migrane pill (relplax) and it takes the constant migrane away but doesnt take the pulses away - they are random however come often - severe pain. The top of my temple to the top of my cheek bone is swollen, not bad - but to the point that you can feel the diffrence when touching my right side and left side. I also am experiancing a decrease in my vision - almost like it is cloudy in my right eye. I am going to try to get an appointment with primary Dr tomorrow - just saw this post and thought it was familar with what I was experencing\n\n",

    "title": "Headaches, neck pain, warm feelings, taste issues",
    "content": "Hello.  I am a 23 year old male and have been having  some strange symptoms for the last month and a half or so.  The first symptom that I noticed, was a strange taste that seemed to be coming from the back of my throat.  At first, it was rather subtle, but now it is quite constant.  The taste comes in many flavors - bitter, sour, sometimes a bloodlike taste.  I have also noticed that my tongue has a strange white furry covering and in a bit bumpy.  I think I also see some raised blister like things on my tongue, near my tonsils.  When I eat food, the taste is masked by the flavor of the food, but always seems to come back soon after eating.  About 2 weeks later, I had a few panic attacks ( I was diagnosed with General Anxiety Disorder about three years ago, but had been panic attack free for almost 2.5 years), which kind of just came out of nowhere.  Since then, I've head constant headaches all over my head. They seem to to come in short spurts, lasting only a few seconds each time.  At first, I thought it was related to my TMJ because the pain was primarily in my temple regions, but now the headaches are scattered. Back of the head, behind the eyes, front of the face..Usually if I massage the spot of the headache, it will fade, but will then reappear in another spot.  I have also been feeling what seems like hot air being blown on different parts of my body.  Even when I am outside in the cold, and the rest of my body is freezing, it will feel like someone is holding a blow dryer up to a certain part of my body. Usually, I feel this in the side of my face, but have also felt it in my legs and hands.  My most recent symptom is a really stiff  and cracking neck.  Sometimes, this feeling is very intense (like a pinching feeling) where my head meets my neck.     Of course I have considered that these symptoms are related to anxiety (as I had seen a plethora of different symptoms a few years ago), but some of them (like the taste thing, headaches, and warm feeling) are things I have never felt before.  I appreciate any feedback.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for your question. You have given an intelligent assessment of your own condition. Given the nonspecific (changing) nature of some of your symptoms coupled the previous diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), I would put anxiety at the top of the list also.   I think one of the first things in combating this serious and otherwise debilitating disease is to recognize its presence. Once that happens you are a step away from knowing how to overcome these symptoms.  The headaches you describe as well as the warm feelings are probably as such since they do not fall into the category of any classic symptoms due to an organic disease.   The taste however, may or may not be related to anxiety. It appears that you may have an infection in the mouth and this can of course cause taste changes. Are you a smoker? Do you have diabetes? Unfortunately, I couldn't find any medical history in your profile. Please be sure to update that.  As always of course this could be wrong and the only way to make sure is to have yourself examined face to face with your doctor.  Good luck and Happy New Year!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I'm looking for advice on where to go next. I'm a 24 yr old female with severe migraines and the occasional fainting spell. In 2003 I started to have migraines. I had my first 'episode' then as well. During my 'episodes' this is what happens: Symptoms during the day: \t-shortness of breath  (early morning while going up stairs, probably nothing) \t-tiredness (throughout the day) \t-headache (started to get worse in the afternoon) \t-twitching (legs and arms) \t-muffled hearing (all day, but got worse) \t-difficulty staying awake \t-weakness (all over feeling) \t-difficulty concentrating \t-difficulty understanding or comprehending \t-slurred speech (slightly) \t-difficulty speaking (it wouldn\u2019t come out right) Driving home: \t-extreme tiredness \t-difficulty staying on road                  (eyes wanted to shut, I could feel them rolling back in my head) \t-headache (worse than before) \t-severe weakness (all over) \t-eyes started to roll back in head (I tried my hardest to stay awake. Cold air and  loud music wouldn\u2019t help) \t-muffled hearing (got worse) \t-made it home and in bed I slept for 3 hours before I could get up again. After I woke up I was disoriented and very moody. I kept running into walls and still couldn\u2019t think clearly. I slept from 5p-8p and 10p-730a.  I've had about 3-4 total 'episodes', but now for the last 4 weeks I've had a headache/ migraine EVERYDAY. One day it was so bad I went to the ER and they gave me Darvaset (sp?).  I've had an EEG (it was normal, no seizures) and I've had an MRI (the neuro. saw shadowing and small viens (?), but my regular doctor said they only see that in older adults). I've also been taking Vicodin (I have to take 2 500mg to make the headache stop) since I went to the ER, which was about 2 1/2 weeks ago. I'm not sure what to think anymore, but I need an answer and something to get rid of this headache. Does anyone have any suggestions??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I am sorry to hear about all your suffering. I am however, glad to know that you went to the ER and that the results of your scans were all negative.   Headaches are difficult to diagnose. It is very important when one has a new headache or an increase in the symptoms of an already existing headache to get a check up.   Your symptoms are not typical for migraine which is why I think you need to be evaluated by a headache specialist. I would suggest that you look up a headache clinic in your area and pay them a visit.  Migraines are usually aggravated by physical exertion. Depression causes headaches that are worse in the morning, while tension type headaches are worse towards the end of the day. Temporal arteritis is worse towards the end of the day also but is more common in individuals older than 55 years of age.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

She went over my MRI with me and told me about how with every decade a person lives they are supposed to get a white spot on their brain (I guess to indicate age). She also noticed a larger white spot on my MRI, but we determined that was when I younger and fell on my head, but she said it wasn't the cause of my headaches. She diagnosed the headaches as benign migraines. She said it isn't uncommon for my symptoms to be associated with migraines. She put me on Prednisone for 12 days and gave me Propranolol as a preventive. I still have a slight headache, but that is mainly behind my eyes and frontal portion of my head. The other strange thing that happened was that I was a week late on my period and just now started and it hurts very badly, but I'm sure that is caused by stress or something.\n\n",

    "content": "Sounds like a trigger point (muscle spasm) in the occipital area.  Try applying heat (rather warm, not hot) to the back of your head while lying down, some very gentle massage to get good circulation going to the area, and gentle stretching leaning head to the sides and front for about 10 seconds each.  Do NOT lean head back as this only contracts the muscles in the area that you are trying to relax.  These headaches do last for a few days.  The spasm can be so intense that the muscle will feel bruised or sore even after the tension has been released.  If you have someone around, ask for their help in massaging the neck and scalp, starting with gentle pressure at the base of the skull where you described, slow circles, then going to a full scalp massage with both hands even going to the temples, above and around the eyes and facial cheeks, including the jaw area.  Blood circulation and relaxation are key.  Do the stretching several times a day when you have a chance even if you do not have a headache.  Do not force your head to go further than the pain allows.  The flexibility will return as long as you listen to your body as you are stretching.  If these become more frequent (3+ times per week), get in to see your physician.  If you begin to notice swollen lymph glands, fever, dizziness or any other new symptom, see your physician.  I hope this helps.  This headaches are awful and it feels like you have a hump sticking out of the bottom of your head.  Try to refrain from any muscle relaxers as this will mask your symptoms and could cause you to further injure yourself if you overdo the stretching.  Contact your physician or his/her nurse for suggestions for a gentle pain reliever.  Good luck!\n\n",

I was massaging his neck and found that the back of his skull is extremely swollen, and theres no telling how long its been that way because he had no idea about it. he just sits in his chair all day and watchs the tele. he's also expressed all of the symptoms you have mentioned in the quoted text. By any chance do you have any ideas of the top of your head as to what ailments may accompany those symptoms if they do occur for long peroids of time?   -he is seeing a doctor, but he's very poor so its every month or so because he has bollocks medical insurance. -he has not discussed this with a doctor yet though, im just interested in trying to get a head start on saving this old bastard.   any ideas would be wonderful thank you very much  (i'm sorry if this post depresses you, we're really quite happy people, its not all that bad.)   -meche\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Throbbing occipital headache",
    "content": "Hello -  I'm not convinced either. The symptoms you describe sound like they might be caused by increased intracranial pressure (ICP). I'm not sure why this would be happening, as I'm sure you've had your blood pressure checked and that's obviously not been elevated. That leaves cerebrospinal fluid either increased in volume or not circulating properly as a possible  cause. The main concern with this is damage to the optical nerve, and again, there are routine parts of a casual neurological exam which should show some evidence of this.   Another possibility, if it hasn't been ruled out, would be a chronic deep sinus infection or blockage (the latter not necessarily an infection, so would have no fever associated with it).  Checking the cerebrospinal fluid via lumbar  puncture might be a consideration.  The dizziness would be consistent with increased ICP as well as a blocked sinus. The palpitations could well be normal (we all have occasional premature beats from time to time, but not everyone is aware of them). Propranolol, while a perfectly good drug, is also the oldest of the beta blockers, and, while sometimes used to treat migraines (that's not what you're describing) used to be prescribed for management of uncomfortable palpitations. However, there are now far more agreeable and effective beta blockers available, most of which only have to be taken once per day.  I think you may have some coincidental overlap of symptoms, but am most concerned about the headache and would like to know if increased ICP has been ruled out. Hopefully your doctor will take this into consideration as a possibility. The medications  prescribed are an odd and somewhat dated bunch (aside from propranolol, amitriptyline is an old tricyclic antidepressant now usually only used as a nerve pain blocker,  but again, there are other, newer and more agreeable ones). Clonazapine is an anxiolytic. You haven't mentioned anxiety as a possible problem, but it's a good one for that if that figures in.  Somehow I suspect your doctor feels your concerns are more anxiety-driven than and psychogenic. Again, I'm not convinced. You might want to consult a neurologist if this doesn't improve under the current regimen.   Good luck to you with this.  Please follow up with us here as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Cluster Headache Diagnosis",
    "content": "Question:  Based on the information below is Cluster Headache (cause unknown as I understand) the most probable accurate diagnosis or are there other possible more cause specific possible diagnosis?  Depakote medication does not seem to be working for me.    Hstory of recent (2008) symptoms:    March/April slight random tingling in left side of my head, left arm, left leg.  April, progressive fatigue begins and worsens (very unusual for me).  May, left side of face feels numb at times but no constant.  Left half of lips feel \"lazy\" and numb at times but not constant  Mid June I had a mild chest cold which went away after a week or so.  End of June I had a sudden left ear ache (pencil driving into my left ear) with severe left temporal area headache.  Numbness in face and lips returns and remains.  Tingling becomes more recuring.  Urgent Care doctor diagnosed ear infection, prescribed antibiotics and pain medication.  Sever headache disapated to be constant (about a 3 on scale of 0 to 10) with random severe headaches (a 12 on a scale of 0 to 10).  Severe headaches make my left eye hurt severely and water.  Severe headache episodes are random and pain engulfs the left side of my head down to my neck.  July, headaches persist, ear aches returns.  Family doctor diagnosed ear infection and prescribes same regiment as Urgent Care doctor.  Ear pain relieved but other symptoms remain.  Family doctors tells me to see an Ear, Nose & Throat (ENT)specialist.  Overly warm rooms (summer heat with no air conditioning) maky symptoms worsen.  Casual social alcohol bring on severe headaches instantly.  Sept, ENT visit with continued symptoms.  Speech is somewhat slurred as reported by my offiice Admin.  Thought process is quicker than my words coming out of my mouth - I stumbled over words at times.  Hearing test confirms my long term (20+ years) of deficient higher mhz range hearing in left ear (I can not hear crickets in my left ear). ENT orders an MRI with contrast of auditory canal looking for acoustic neuroma.   MRI report notes no acoustic neurome but identifies  2 lesions:  1-19 mm left periventrical leison, 1-9mm right side occipital lobe leison.  ENT suggests I see neurologist.  Radiology report suggests \"....possible early stage Multiple Sclerosis...\"  Oct, Neurologist reads MRI images and finds possible third leison \"shadow\". I am told symptoms suggest no MS by location of leisons as well as 3 leisons is below the MS specific 6 for qty to be considered MS and MS symptoms do not worsen with alcohol (see above).  Suggests diagnosos is Cluster Headache...this type of headache reacts to alcohol instantly.  Neurologist orders a host of blood tests (including lime disease) and MRA brain scan, no contrast.   Prescribes Depakote 500 ER once daily, Prednisone (high dose for one week / step down doseage second week until finished) and Imitrex at onset of severe headache episodes with a follow-up Imitrex 2 hours after the first.  Nov,  Blood tests all normal. MRA normal.  Neurologist suggesting Spinal Tap but will not be ordered until next office visit in December.  Response to medications:  Slight softening of constant headache for 2 to 3 hours of the morning.  Severe headache (left temporal area) episodes continue randomly without eye specific pain and watering of eye (left side).  Numbness in left side of face continues, constant left temporal area headache continues, lazy left side of lips and numbness unchanged.  Left jaw muscle seems weak (new) and mouth bite not aligned (right side teeth hit before left).  Had cracked tooth,  root canal and crown on top right tooth last month.  Speech continues to be slurred randomly and mental processing seems \"slow\" at times.  My morning walk time from commuter train to office has slowed from 10 minutes to 12 minutes on the average over the past 3-4 months.  tingling in left side noted previously continues randomly.  Statistics of self:   Age:  48   Gender: Male  Occupation:  Structural engieer / Office Manager of branch office, Chicago  General health:  Good.  Blood pressure always excellent (even now) at 110/70.  Heart rate always 76 or so.  Previous injuries / surgery:   1976 to 2006 various right knee surgeries, current degen arthritis.   1977 automobile accident with whip lash.  Numbness in both arms for 18 month period before full recovery. 1996  Broken right wrist from fall from single story roof to pavement.  Right arm nerve compression from injury with surgery for nerve decompression of anterior anterosios nerve (spelling is likely not right with the nerve). 1998 Spinal fusion L5-S1, surgery from back side.     Thank you in advance for your thoughts,  HeadPain\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your history and symptoms certainly do fit a possible diagnosis of cluster headache, there are questions raised by the lesions  (plaques?) found on your brain, even though the are apparently quite small. It also sounds as though you may be having irritation  of one of the cranial nerves in addition to cluster headaches, based on your description of the sudden, sharp pains in the ear on the  affected side. This could be related, if there is an underlying cause, or it could be coincidence.   It would seem appropriate to seek a second opinion, not so much because cluster headache doesn't seem like a viable diagnosis, but rather that it seems there is more than just that going on. There may not be, but it certainly would be worthwhile to know.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Follow-up appt with my neurologist notes the following change in overall diagnosis:  He took notes on my report of present conditions and the effect that Depakote has had with me (softening my head pain).    He did a brief exam.  We discussed the results of the blood tests and MRA brain scan.  He found nothing of significance in the blood test results. After receiving the radiology report he requested the scan images to study himself. He said he found a slight thickening of the artery wall on the left side in the images (whatever it is called).  His take on it this is early Athero / Arteriosclerosis.    He said he studied the MRI scan again in length since I last saw him in October. All things considered - the effect of the Depakote, the long term nature of my headaches, my numerous other symptoms (noted above), the findings of the MRA - he now gave a diagnosis of early MS with Arthero / Arteriosclerosis of the cerebral artery on the left side of my brain.  Rate of progression is undertermined for both.  I am to continue on the Depakote and add 81mg aspirin tablet daily.  My next appt. is in June unless I have symptomatic changes.   I will be on meds now forever and require MRA and MRI scans yearly to check for changes with the 2008 scans as the baseline.  Sound right ?  As much as my neurologist comes high recommended, would a second opinion be worthy?  Thank you for your input, HeadPain\n\n",

My blood work was all good except it showed my Seg was slighly high indicating a possiable Bacterial Infection.

He also looked up my nose with a scope and said all was fine.I was surprised becauce i really thought it would be a sinis infection. I am stumped.I Hate these headaches everyday. They are causing me to be depressed. My pain is hardly ever real servere just enough to be annoying and always behind the right eye and sometimes the pain will shoot to the back of my head. ANy help you could give me would be great. Tynonol does not help at all. The only relief i get is when i am rubbing my right eye ball with a little bit of pressure applyed.

    "content": "Hello -  While your symptoms would suggest a sinus infection, since that appears to have been ruled out you could have something going on inside the orbit, involving the optic nerve, or perhaps even the tear duct. Pressure on the eye relieving the pain somewhat suggests it may even be a problem of the sixth cranial nerve.  I'd suggest seeing an opthamologist in order to complete the differential diagnosis between an occult sinus problem and one of the  possible ocular-related problems. There is a very close association in terms of nerve service and related discomfort.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

But since November of 2007 I have been having dizzy spels not to where the room is spinning but my head feels like it, I guess its called feeling light-headed. It happpens when I yawn and lean back and come forward I feel dizzy. I notice anytime I lean back and come forward I get really dizzy and I have constant headaches. The dizziness started when I found I was pregnant, I also found I had hyper-thyriods which I had with my first pregnancy but went away after birth. Unfortunately this baby didn't make it because I was too sick. But I still have those dizzy spells, I don't know if I still have hyper-thyriods. Could that be a factor? My blood pressure is normal everytime I check it. I had joined the gym recently while I was doing a work out with the PT he had be jumping up and down I immediately became really dizzy and felt sick to my stomach.. I stopped working out.

    "title": "Re: Dizzy and lightheaded feelings",
    "content": "Hi there -  Although your description of the dizziness doesn't sound exactly like benign positional vertigo (BPV), the way it's triggered does seem most likely to be just that. While the problem could also be related to your eyes (the eyes and ears work together to maintain a sense of balance), and the headaches and blurred vision certainly could have been due to eyestrain, this could also relate to the dizzy spells. You specifically describe moving your head backward and forward as one trigger, and that you've also had an episode triggered by jumping up and down. This latter could have been related to exertion or to the sudden and repetitive change in position (vertigo can be felt vertically as well as horizontally). Your doctor might have done (or could do) a very simple test in his office: having you follow his finger with your eyes, and seeing if, when they moved to one side or the other, they seemed to bounce. This is called nystagmus and is a cardinal sign of vertigo, a very easy way to determine if that's what's happening.  If you're having vertigo frequently (or any other sort of dizziness) you need to find a way to control it. Vertigo is usually responsive to a simple over-the-counter drug, meclizine (brand name Dramamine Non-drowsy Formula). Antivert is  a prescription version of the same medication.  Trying this is another way to pretty much rule in BPV, if the symptoms respond to this drug.  Your doctor should also have done a few cardiological tests, especially an EKG, just to be certain the  dizziness isn't due to an arrhythmia (heartbeat irregularity). It's probably not since you don't mention having palpitations, but it's good to know. You probably need to have a neurological consult to determine why these episodes keep happening. I strongly suspect it is a simple problem (BPV), but the only way to know for sure is face-to-face. There are some tests a neurologist might  order, as well, if the visual exam doesn't show up the diagnosis.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck. I hope you're feeling better really soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Agatha,  I'm sure you're aware of how common pineal cysts are and how unusual it is for one to actually produce symptoms. If the cyst is large enough (rare) it can cause mass effect against the tectal plate (flattening). This could account for your symptoms but also may not. Much would depend upon the size of the  cyst. Do you happen to know the size of the cyst? If so, that might help, as they rarely are symptomatic unless they surpass 10 mm.   Please follow up with us and if you have the information that would be a big help. Good luck to you. We'll await your followup.\n\n",

She immediately helped me into the house and sat me on the couch and within a few minutes I was slightly shaken up, but no worse for wear. Since then the same sensation has happened a few more times, but with far less severity and a much shorter duration. (2-5 seconds, max)   I brushed it off to being overly tired or some sort of effect my pollen allergies were having until recently. On August 23 I was sitting on the couch, reading an article online, when a large, fuzzy spot clouded the center of my vision. Assuming it was eye fatigure I closed the laptop, only to find the problem to get worse. Within ten minutes my vision was reduced to something that's very hard to describe, but giving it my best attempt was something of a ring. No perefrial vision, no center vision, but sort of a ring. Also, in the center there were squiggly lines of a sort and a near instant sensitivity to light. I immediately went to lie down in a dark room and quickly succumbed to what I can only assume was a migraine. The pain began at the base of my skull and felt as though someone had stabbed me there and began to radiate into my eyes. (predominantly on the left side) Since then this headache as stayed, varying at times in intensity, but is always persistent. Also, it seems to be on sort of a schedule as it intensifies at night. Just of this weekend though, I've began developing a sort of vertigo with a very, very mild form of confusion at times. I suppose confusion isn't entirely accurate, but I seem to go through brief spells where I'm having a harder time concentrating. These pass quickly, but I felt should be noted.  Now, this all sounds somewhat like an aura migraine, but I have one other sympotm that is the most recent addition (within the last two weeks) that I'm not sure is related or not. At night, right as the headaches seem to intensify the muscles in my entire body seem to sieze up uncontrolably. The pain seems to come in waves and usually affects single parts of my body more intensely at various times. The pain is always there, but it feels as though electric shocks are being sent through a leg, my spine, an arm, etc...It is such immense pain that I've been taking Flexeril 10mg (the generic) that I was perscribed approx two months ago for a torn muscle. The medication seems to dull the intense muscle pain to the point that I'm able to lay in bed, as pressure from anything makes it worse. Even with the Flexiril, which put me to sleep the first time I took it, has been unsuccessful in creating any sort of significant relief. It's almost as though I'm able to sleep only once exahustion overrides the pain at around 3-4am, though I wake up at the latest by 9am from the pain once again. All the while, battling the intesnse headache and senitivity to light.  I know this is long, but I also think it should be noted that I have had one cousin pass away at 12 from a brain aniurism and another have a golf ball sized cyst removed from his brain at approx 6mos old. I'm not sure if this is relevant, or if the muscle pain is relevant to the headaches. They could be two seperate issues. Either way, it is affecting my school work and I've become incredibly lathargic, which I can only assume is due to insufficient sleep. I haven't spoken to a doctor about this and I suppose I'm wondering if this is worth a trip to the doctor and if so, what should I bring to his attention. Please note, the physician I've recently been seeing isn't exactly worried by much and short of going in there bleeding, I've never been able to receive much attention to any problem I've had. Any advice on what this could possibly and/or how to phrase this so I'm taken seriously would be greatly appreciated!  Thank you so much!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I hope you are feeling better. Any change in the character of your headache requires that you be examined by your physician just to rule out the presence of any new conditions. The fact that your headaches are still 'migranous' in character (ie, they occur in recurring attacks and are unilateral) is reassuring of course. If a new cause is ruled out then it is true that migraines can switch sides sometimes.   Regarding aspirin as well as other Nonsteriodal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are used in both the acute setting as well as a preventive drug (as in your case). NSAIDs have an added benefit of being preventive against stroke although I don't think this concerns you nor is this the dose or regimen for stroke prevention. I really think you should ask your doctor about the mechanism of action of aspirin given in that dose in the prevention of migraines. I have searched the literature looking but to no avail. The only studies I found related to naproxen (another NSAID). It would be nice if you could post the explanation here. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

I've seen 3 doctors for this, and they haven't been able to diagnose me.  It started with a swollen lymph node for which I was given antibiotics for.  It brought it down, but not back to normal size, and it's been \"half-swollen\" compared to the other one since the antibiotic treatment.  It always starts off with the throbbing lymph node which then sets off a excruciating headache at the base of my skull.  During these episodes, I always have dark yellow urine, not matter how much liquids I drink that day.  One doctor that I went to suggested that it may be that the lymph node is filled with toxins, and that is why it is still swollen and that time to time, it leaks out the toxins.  What can I do to treat this?  Please help. Thank you for your time.\n\n",

Tingling sensation over skin of neck. Tender on one side of neck C2-3 facet joint.

    "content": "Hello,  I am 22 years old and have been in good health my entire life.  However, I've had a chronic headache for about one year. It all started one night randomly...I thought I was getting sick. However months later I still had a bad headache.  It's never gone away. At times its better than others...but has definitely gotten worse over the past year.  I've always noticed that my hands shake a little, especially when the headaches are bad. I also feel shaky inside...like I had too much caffiene at times. I get cold and hot at the same time, and anxious too. The h/a's are concentrated in my forehead, back of my head, and neck (but mostly on the left side of my head).  Sometimes I just feel bad..like something isnt right in my body. The headaches seem to come from the neck and eating something often helps ease the pain a bit and help with the shakyness. However, the h/a is usually always severe at one point in the day.  They are less severe in the morning, but still there. In addition, exercise seems to help them a bit, but they always come back with the same intensity if I sit still fortoo long.  Otherwise I don't have any other symptoms....so it's so hard to diagnose.  I've had an MRI and CT scan to rule out anything serious...all came back normal except for a small curviture of the spine.  I had my eyes checked, blood tests done for mono, lymes, meningitis, and thyroid.  In addition, I've been on antiobiotics, migraine meds, steroids, had acupuncture, cortizone and novicane shots, spinal manilupations from a chiro, muscle relaxors, anti-imflamatorys, and tried various anti-headache meds. (topomax etc).  Right now I am seeing a nutritionist who said my urine levels were off...and thinks something is up with my nutrition, perhaps hypoglycemia or hyperthyroidism.  I'm currently taking gluclose suppliments and Angelica Root (herbal stuff)...no relief. The only thing that helps is fioricet. IB profin doesn't do a thing. Any clues as to what this sounds like? I cant get rid of these headaches. They are severe and never go away. HELP! My doctor thinks it's a muscle contraction of some kind as it stems from my neck...but there's no way! Please help in any way you can. I am going to a headache clinic in October...hopefully they might be able to help.  Thanks very much! -J\n\n",

It's good to know that other more serious causes have been excluded.

They are differentiated from migraines by the absence of a family history or aura symptoms.  Other causes of chronic headaches include: #  Depression # Cervical spondylosis # Drugs  Other causes of pain in the back of the head: Recurring occipital headache can occur due to     * Occipital root headache due to compression of occipital nerve root by conditions in neck vertebrae (spinal column). May be unilateral. Tingling sensation over skin of neck. Tender on one side of neck C2-3 facet joint. X-ray.     * Occipital neuralgia: greater occipital nerve is injured/inflamed as it leaves back of neck.     * Cervical spondylosis and other vertebral body disorders tend to cause pain in the back of the neck. This would have shown on your CT/MRI.     * Pain may be referred to the back of the neck.     * Subarachnoid hge may be worse in the occipital region. This would have been ruled out by your CT/MRI.  Were you able to reach a diagnosis at the headache clinic? Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While videogames can sometimes, in certain people, cause headaches (mostly migraines) and even seizures, the combination of symptoms you're describing sounds more like an inner ear-related problem, and these can cause headaches, nausea and, eventually, generalized upper respiratory infection symptoms such as body aches, etc. I'd definitely bring this to the attention of your family doctor, as it seems to have begun in the ears (probably secondary to a sinus infection) and this kind of thing can become drawn out and make you feel pretty awful. Sometimes, if it can be determined to be a bacterial infection, antibiotics can usually knock it out and have you feeling much better in short order.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with  us as needed. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: dull pain on the left side of my head",
    "content": "Hello -  There are generally two causes of  this problem: sometimes it is due to an inflamed nerve, which is more likely when the sore area is painful to the touch; the other is mastoiditis, an inflammation of the mastoid process, the bulbous bony protuberance behind the ear. This latter is usually due to an ear infection. If there's been no suggestion of an ear infection (in which case you should be seen by a physician to make sure it is resolving properly and if it needs an antibiotic), then it is probably an irritated cranial nerve and should respond to over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain meds such as ibuprofin or naproxym. Rarely, this inflammation can be caused by shingles or a localized herpes infection, which is often obscured by the hair.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please  follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  There is always the possibility of strains and other types of injuries from lifting weights.  Your pain continued to worsen and was accompanied by blurry vision.  Even after taking time off, exercising replicates the pain and you are not able to work out at the intensity you have in the past.  I would not continue with your work outs until after you are evaluated by your doctor.  You don't want to do any damage, or any more damage if you have done some already.  Your doctor may suggest simply resting for an extended period of time or even imaging studies.  But the point is, pain and blurry vision after an injury is not something that should be ignored.  Best of luck to you.  Tracy F. RN\n\n",

The headaches only last a few seconds, and I can handle them.  It seems to get better as the day goes on and after taking medication for it.  It seems to not bother me as long as I don\u2019t really think about it.  Also it pretty much hurts more on weekdays like when I have school so I\u2019m thinking stress may trigger it, but on weekends I still have the headache, it\u2019s just not nearly as bad and I go a good couple hours without feeling any pain at all.  I\u2019m thinking it\u2019s just chronic tension headache because it hasn\u2019t been getting worse over the days, and if anything, its been getting better or showing no change as teh days go on instead of getting worse.  It also doesn\u2019t get worse during any physical activity.  I get seasonal allergies REALLY bad too.  When I get my allergies, my nose runs almost non-stop and I sneeze like crazy.  I've been worrying like crazy that it's a brain tumor =(.  Have any ideas as of what could be the problem with the headaches?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  You didn't state in your post if this is headache is something new or if you have suffered with headaches in the past.  At any rate, because it has been going on for 6 days, you should be evaluated by your doctor.  The fact that you are worrying about your headache can add to the tension you are already experiencing.    You are in school, studying, and exercising.  You don't mention work, but you do have a lot on your plate.  Be sure you are keeping yourself well hydrated with plenty of water, limit caffeinated beverages, maintain a well balanced diet, and get proper rest.  Too much or too little sleep can trigger headaches.  You need to find the appropriate balance for your body.  If you can, try an ice pack or a hot shower, or relaxation techniques and avoid medicating your headache when possible.  You could be experiencing a rebound headache from the medication.  In the meantime, schedule an appointment with your doctor and let us know how it turns out.  Good Luck.  Tracy F.  RN\n\n",

    "content": "You have done the right thing by having the MRI with contrast. Ruling out a serious cause of your headaches is the first step.  Unfortunately, as you have stated in your post, the very thing you are using to control your headaches, tylenol and motrin, is most likely the very thing that is continuing to cause them.  Rebound headaches.  Having busy lifesyles, being able to take a day or two to just relax isn't always an option.  But you have to stop treating the less severe headaches and let them be.  Ride them out.  That is only way to stop rebound headaches.  Try warm or cold compresses, relaxation, meditation and drink plenty of water.  Headaches can be a sign of dehydration.  Drinking a lot of caffeinated beverages like coffee, tea, and colas can exacerbate the problem acting as a diuretic and making you more thirsty instead of relieving your thirst.  For every caffeinated beverage you drink, you should drink a glass of water.   Breaking the rebound cycle is difficult, but worth it in the long run.  Good luck to you.  Tracy F.  RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Headaches are very common, but persistent headaches should be checked out to be sure they aren't a signal of something serious.  It may not be; just smart to be sure.  So if you are able to see a doctor about this, I would recommend it.  Of course there could be something environmentally that is bothering you, even a sleep position or something you are hypersensitive to (allergy).  Sinus infections and even visual problems can also cause headache.  It would be helpful for your doctor to know if the headache responds to acetaminophen or other analgesics, if you have accompanying symptoms such as nausea or even a sense that one is coming on.  does it, in fact, come and go, or has it been constant, day and night, throughout the past two weeks?  Are you under any specific stress in your life?  Different people respond to stress in their own way and it often shows up in physical symptoms.  If this is the case, relieving the stress or learning relaxation or stress-reduction techniques can be helpful.  I know this is a very frustrating situation and there probably isn't a quick fix for it, but monitoring details about the headaches and your life when they occur might help you get to the cause.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Also my right lower eye lid has been twiching off and on. All of This comes and goes. I also have been feeling this in different spots of my head.

I have just got a ct scan of my brain but the doctor said the results came back normal. I am still suffering from this and i seem to have NO answer on what is causing this wierd feeling iam having. One more thing back in July of this year i fainted and after i woke up from fainting i felt the same sharp pain in the left side of my back head. The hospital did a ct scan as well and they said everything was normal. Now it seems the same sharp pain is moving to different spots of my head. I also want to mention i get twiching in my arms and leg as well sometimes. If the ct scans came back normal then what do you think is causing my new symptoms of sharp pain , headache and eye twiching?  Thank you for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Medical Background: From age 9 months to approximately age 6 I had feberal seizures on a regular-enough basis to be medicated with Phenobarbitol, as did my maternal cousin and maternal uncle. I am now 24 years old and have been medicated for Epilepsy since age 14 when I experienced my first \"adult\" seizure. I am currently taking 600mg of Tegretol CR twice daily (totalling 1200mg), and regularly get my bloodwork done to ensure my levels are in a good level; the last bloodwork showed excellent Tegretol levels approx. 4 weeks ago. I am also taking oral birth control medication. Please also note that my mother experienced dibilitating migraines from approximately age 25-35 for which she required daily medication for control of these; she is no longer requiring this medication and has not had a migraine in several years.  Current Concern: In the past year I have been experiencing pain at the base of my neck, which often radiates into a migraine. Mostly the pain in my head stays on the right side (FYI this is where the EEGs have shown abnormal brain activity, which they believe is the root cause of my seizures), but lately the pain has become more of a \"whole-head\" pain, and has included various parts of my face, including my cheekbones and rear teeth. This new pain causes almost instant nausea, light-headedness, a dry mouth and my temperature to rise so that I am sweating (although I have never been in a position to actually take my body temperature with a thermometer). I also am extremely sensitive to smell during these periods, and my heart rate increases significantly, although I am not sure if this is a result of these symptoms, or my anxiousness of having an epileptic attack based on these symptoms.  I often take 2 Advil Liquid-Gels to aleviate the pain, however there have been times (mostly on Saturday afternoons, I have noticed) that they are ineffective completely.  Can you please advise if, based on this information, these symptoms could be the result of my epilepsy and should be discussed with my neurologist, if they are simple migraines, or if another cause can be suggested by you? Also, would you recommend any control mechanisms when I experience these symptoms? I am especially concerned by the nausea and light-headedness.  Thank  you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  It sounds as though your two coexisting conditions, which are probably related to start with, may be merging. By that I mean there are seizures which sometimes involve pain rather than loss of central control. Sometimes they are abdominal, in others they are global headaches. They can be confused, rightly, with migraines, as they are directly related.   This is not a \"regular\" migraine you're experiencing. It may be amenable to the same treatment as a \"regular\" one, or it may require additional study to see if the central cause of all this trouble has changed and is maybe even now within the reach of more effective management techniques.  You should definitely let your neurologist evaluate this change in symptom pattern. I don't know what I could recommend to manage this on your own; that's definitely a specialized area your neurologist should determine. However, sometimes when symptoms change it means there's been an essential change in the root cause. Even if there's not such a change, the approach to treatment my change. I've seen global migraines before, although they are rare. It definitely is worth evaluating.   Please let us know how things go for you. I hope this answer is helpful and  please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Erin -  While I've been unable to find any refernece material which quotes even an approximate success rate for the treatment you're asking after, I do know there is significant enthusiasm for it in cases of intractable migraine and cluster headaches, so long as the protocol isn't interrupted because of a reaction to any of the medications involved. I've seen the \"short version\" of this done in the ER, and have also found that the occasional patient admitted for the multiple-day combined course of treatment seems to come away from it greatly improved and sometimes with lasting improvement, although migraine does recur with these patients.   This is the most I can tell you: that it seems to have been well worth the aggravation in the few cases with which I've had some direct exposure, and that the doctors involved seemed quite enthused about the prospects for not only breaking the status migraine but also for overall long-term improvement of the problem. Perhaps someone else here at The Lounge is more familiar with the protocol and how successful it is in a larger population of patients.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I started getting frequent severe headaches about 7 years ago. At that time a neurologist diagnosed migraines based on my description (unilateral pain, sensitivity to light and noise etc) and a family history of migraines. I got these headaches fairly often (8-10 times per month) for 3 or four years, and the headaches typically responded well to immitrex.  A few years ago the headaches slowed considerably and nearly stopped altogether, and I stopped seeing the neurologist and stopped filling the immitrex prescription.  Over the last year I began getting headaches again with increasing frequency (up to at least 2 times a week most weeks), but now they are always focused at the bottom back part of head where it meets my neck. These are not usually as debilitating as the migraines, but they can be, and I find it nearly impossible to focus and concentrate with these headaches. I have also recently begin to experience episodes of extreme dizziness (lasting a minute or less at a time) and blurred vision - even after having my glasses a lenses prescription very recently updated. Are these headaches probably the same migraines despite feeling totally different? Tension headaches?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  While  this could for sure be a variation on the original migraine theme -- this does happen occasionally -- there is also the possibility that it represents a change in the central cause. While migraines do usually begin in the area you describe, they generally expand unilaterally forward rather quickly.   The concern with this sort of headache that you're having now is that one can't be certain whether this is simply a variation on that theme or if there is something that's not been evident before, now showing itself more specific to the affected area. You'll need to bring this to the attention of your doctor or neurologist, who may be  able to tell you right off the bat whether this is just a new variation  or if you'll require a more thorough workup to be certain there isn't an abnormality of the blood vessels at the base of the back of the skull,  which sometimes turns up later on in migraine sufferers. It's not necessarily anything to worry about, just something you owe it to yourself to know, since if this were the case (unlikely but possible), then the symptoms could continue to change and  become more troublesome. Best you rule this out early on.  I hope this is helpful. Please let us know how things progress.\n\n",

    "content": "9 weeks ago ( I was 6 weeks post partum) I woke up with a splitting headache that has not gone away since.  24/7, it's always here and no meds are working.  1 week after the headache, I lost a bit of sensation in my left hand and had a stiff neck and since then, I have black spots in my right eye.  I was admitted into the hospital under suspecion of mennigittis, only to find out 3 days later, they contaminated it.    I have had a blood patch (because of 2 spinal taps and having an epidural), seen 2 neurologists, chiropractic care, trigger point injections, accupunture as well as the DHE45 treatment.  I even paid for lyme testing that has come back negative.  I am now planning to head 800 miles away for a headache clinic.  I have had labs, MRI's, MRA, MRV and CT's that supposedly all showed just fine, that is....  Until today when I got a report from my last MRI from 1 month ago.  The neurologist at the time told me it was fine, but now I am seeing that there is information that shows things may not be fine.  Can anyone tell me what this means and what my next step(s) could be?  I was just told today that I will be losing my job if I don't come back soon.  ....There is a single subcortical white matter lesion in the right frontal lobe.  There is a focus of the T2 hyperintensity in the right central pons.  MRI cervical demonstrates normal aligment of the spine.  There is minimal intervertebrak dusease at the c5-c6 level with mild disck ostephyte complex....  At c5-c6 there is disc osteophyte complex asymmetric to the right, midly indenting the thecal sac withut significant stenosis.  Could these findings be the cause of my headache since no headache medication works?  Any help is beyond appreciated!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Headache for the last 9 weeks",
    "content": "Hello -  The MRI findings are difficult to interpret without the doctor's point of view and your complete history to consider. The white matter lesion is something that is often seen as a \"wear-and-tear\" matter only, although it can be associated with any number of progressively more serious issues as well, up to and including multiple sclerosis (MS). However, it seems most of the disorders associated with these lesions don't have headache as a prominent feature. There are a few rare ones which might cause this under rather specific conditions. It would be worth a look, for sure.  On the  other hand, the cervical osteophytes, innocent as they seem in the report, could be causing pressure on some structure which could be causing the headaches. This is not,  in itself, especially serious, but the constant headache is enough to warrant a full investigation. Either abnormality could,  conceivably, be  causing the problem, and you certainly deserve some sort of diagnosis and effective treatment of the  constant pain. Hopefully the  MRI findings (where the white matter lesion  is concerned) are on the lower end of the scale of seriousness, but whatever it is, it needs to be explored. You may find the cervical spine problem is the true culprit, but you'll  need some sort of pain management either way.  Please follow up with us regarding this once you know more. Meanwhile, try and take some comfort in the knowlege that you may at last be on  the trail of what's causing the intractable headaches. We'll look  forward to hearing more. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Some people when stressed (physically and more mentally) get similar clinical picture and with the presence of dental or jaw problems their pain threshold is lowered and they start feeling severe jaw pain in addition to the generalized aches.  Chronic kidney, liver diseases, joint and muscle disorders can also give similar clinical picture. Infections especially chronic ones, immune or autoimmune disorders and tumors should be all excluded.   With thorough history and clinical examination your physician can find out the more likely cause and start investigations accordingly.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.

    "title": "migraine symptoms worsening due to stress?",
    "content": "I have a history of migraine headaches for seven years (diagnosed by a neurologist after an MRI), with symptoms including severe pain on one side of the head lasting 2 to 4 days, dizziness, light sensitivity, eye pain (on affected side), nausea, vomiting, flashing lights, neck pain, and blurred vision.  My headaches generally come on with changes in the weather and my period.  Recently my symptoms seem to be worsening (since about March), with pain lasting more than 5 days, excruciating eye pain, intolerance to light, pain switching sides (from one eye to the other and back)... I've also been experiencing low grade fevers, sweating, loss of apetite, mouth sensitivity (difficult to eat), sore throat, congestion, and ringing in my ears.  Now recently I awoke one night to find my tongue completely numb, and last night I had an episode of double vision (during an extrememly painful headache peak), the next night I felt my arm go numb from the shoulder down to my fingers, lasting about 5 minutes before sensation returned.  My headaches have become so debilating I am unable to keep up at work... typically during an episode lasting a week or more of these symptoms, my headaches start in early to mid-afternoon and last until late into the night.  I had a complete blood workup (CBC, chem panel, thyroid, liver, and hormones plus EKG) by my doctor about a month ago - which were normal, after the fevers and sweating started but prior to the numbness and double vision.  My doctor has suggested stress may be exacerberating my symptoms.  I have moderate stress at work (worsened by my inability to keep up because of my headaches).  Should I worry about the numbness and double vision?   My migraine meds barely work and sometimes not at all.  Is it stress, or should I ask to be tested for other things?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: migraine symptoms worsening due to stress?",
    "content": "Hello -  While stress can certainly exacerbate migraine, you are now having some symptoms unusual for migraine and one or two that just don't fit with it at all. For instance, migraine almost never causes fever. Second, migraine is almost always confined to one side of the head (and the corresponding eye -- it doesn't usually switch sides as you describe). Also, while  there can be numbness of the tongue with migraine, it is pretty unusual. Given all the symptoms you're having, I'd strongly suspect there is something additional going on aside from the usual migraine problem. You may have an abcess somewhere, perhaps in a sinus cavity or some other sort of infection that would produce neurological symptoms or aggravate existing ones (such as Lyme disease, for an example).   It's difficult to guess at this sort of thing without adequate clinical findings to look at, which is why you should follow up with your doctor -- or seek a second opinion. I don't think  stress, alone, is responsible  for all that is presently going on, and you probably should rule out an infection.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, and please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it would seem there are two different things going on (the headaches and the inability to comfortably tilt your head backward) the two could be related, since both involve the blood vessels (especially the basilar artery). There may be an anatomic abnormality which causes the impingement  of blood supply to your head/brain when you tip your head back (a not terribly unusual problem), and this may also be contributing to the headaches.   A neurologist should be consulted with an  eye toward determining if there is need for additional  consult  with a vascular specialist, as there may be either a skeletal or blood vessel malformation involved, and whatever is causing this, it needs to be diagnosed and proper management begun.

While  there are obviously other potential causes, this one does jump out at the top of this list. I'm not sure what can be done about it, however.

    "title": "Re: Debilitating Headaches with no relief",
    "content": "Hello -  From your description of the headaches it sounds as though this could be due to one of several causes related to retroperitoneal fibrosis. The sensitivity to light, loss of vision, along with excruciating headaches, would normally sound like classic migraine. However, due to the other factors and the fairly constant nature of the headaches and the setting of the primary disease, plus the finding of \"something\" in the temporal area but \"too close to the brain\" for excision suggests this mass may be causing reflex headaches of the migraine type, since it is located in the same area where the dilated blood vessels which cause classic migraine do their mischief. I'm wondering if a) the mass, cyst, whatever it is, may be causing the headaches (and if it truly cannot be excised or at least reduced somehow) and b) if it isn't possibly an \"orphan\" mass that has been seeded by the primary mass in the retroperitoneum. These are questions that need to be posed to your father's doctor, as the case is complex and certainly can't be diagnosed from a distance, but you've provided some pretty interesting and suggestive evidence.  There is also the matter of your father's passing out when he stands up, which is more likely caused by some interference with normal blood pressure maintainance due to the retroperitoneal mass pressing on the aorta. A guess, but it seems reasonable.   If your father's resting blood pressure is normal or at least not wildly out of control, then this seems the most likely explanation  for the fainting spells. If the blood pressure is grossly elevated, this could have something more to do with the headaches, but seems, to me, a stretch. I'm sure his doctors have looked past (or through) the temporal mass as a possible cause of the headaches, but because of its location I really suspect your dad's having chronic pseudomigraine, which, since it's not caused by dilated blood vessels, won't respond to the usual vasoconstrictor drugs used to treat migraine.   Powerful pain medication may be in order in the short-term; mepergan seems an odd choice, frankly.   Please follow up with us, especially if you have any further details to add. In the meantime I'd strongly suggest a consult with a neurologist regarding the headaches, which I believe may be psuedomigraine. A neurologist who specializes in pain management might be optimal.   Best of luck to you and to your father.\n\n",

I haven't had a headache like that again, but I have had a constant dull pain not exactly in my temples but around that area and in the back of my head. I am very nauseas, I never feel full. My right eye seems to be twitching every few hours or so.   Maybe I should also throw this in, I was in an accident in 2003. I was hit by a city transit bus I had multiple contusions.   I am not pregnant, I thought that could be it. I took a blood test today so that's out.  What could be causing all of this? And what/who could I see for it?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Constant headache, nausea, fatigue",
    "content": "Hi there -  Headaches in general are some of the  most difficult things to diagnose. While your initial severe headaches fit either the cluster or migraine pattern, including the nausea (Phenergan is a really effective anti-nausea drug that can make one feel very drowsy in some cases). The residual chronic headache, nausea and other  symptoms, though, are more difficult to pin down. It would be hard enough in person, but is really difficult, of course, at a distance.   I would suggest this: a CT scan won't reveal nearly as much going on inside the head as an MRI would. Now that you're no longer pregnant it would be perfectly OK to have an MRI of the brain, which could at least rule out most serious causes of this. A complete physical and neurological workup might be in order, since you did have an abnormal EEG once, in the past.   This is about as far as I can take the process via this route. A second EEG and an MRI of the brain, as part of a neurological consult, would seem to be in order. This may wind up being one of those annoying things that never get accurately diagnosed, but all the resources certainly haven't been exhausted as yet.  Hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

I saw a nurse today about it, but I think she was anxious to go home, or something, because I felt rushed and I didn't feel like she was really into helping me. I hope someone on here can help me. I'm on depo prevera, so I know I'm not pregnant and I don't think it's a bug because no one elce in my home has caught it from me and it's lasted too long to be a bug. I just feel plain lowsy - everyday - all the time - and I'm really sick of it. I have no energy to do anything, I'm tired all the time, bad headaches, diarea, nausia, stomach pain, chills - then sweats, my body aches terribly, I feel lame like I worked out really hard, but didn't - I just feel aweful. I hurt from my head to my toes. It seems as though it never fails - everytime I eat anything, I get diarea afterwards. Sometimes not even through with my meal yet and I have to run to the bathroom. I'm too afraid to go out to dinner with my husband, or friends, because I know I'll get sick and the last thing I want, is to get sick out in public. What is wrong with me? I've always been a healthy person - I haven't had all kinds of health problems, or anything, so this is really strange to me. What should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  As I was reading your post I immediately thought you sounded as though you may well have mononucleosis -- and you well might -- but then I got to the lower GI problems,  which are not typical of mono, and so am not quite as certain as I was before I hit that part. While mono can cause this, especially by way of liver involvment, this also opens the possibility of liver disease, specifically hepatitis A (viral hepatitis). Symptom-wise both mono and hep-A can be similar, but hep-A is more likely to show up with  lower GI symptoms as well. In other ways both diseases run similar courses, and hep-A usually resolves on its own, but should  be followed by a physician. The only way to be certain which it is (or if it's some other, obscure problem) is to see a doctor and have some blood work done to uncover the  cause. In the case of both mono and hep-A, contagion is usually by direct and repeated contact -- not everyone you come near will get the bug. So it's entirely possible for one person in a household to have either.   I would recommend getting tested for the various possible viral infections mentioned above and possibly some other related ones (like Epstein-Barr, if neither of the first two show up), then follow your doctor's advice, which will include getting lots of rest (your body will force you to do this anyway), and proper nutrition. Treatment otherwise is mainly symptomatic (something to control diarrhea and possibly for nausea, headaches, etc.). It's no fun, but it's generally pretty benign.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cluster Headaches",
    "content": "Hello -  While much of the symptomology you describe does sound a lot like cluster headaches, cluster headaches almost always occur on one side of the head. Yours, from the description, seem to be bilateral, which would suggest some other type of problem, especially since cluster headaches also usually present with some histamine-related symptoms such as runny or stuffy nose and watering of the eyes among other things.   Headaches are one of the most difficult problems to diagnose (with certain special types excepted), and it is all the more difficult to make a guess long-distance. You might possibly be experiencing some sort of seizure activity (based mostly on the timing of these headaches) but  that is really just a shot in the dark. You need a referral to a neurologist, most likely, to  find out what is causing this. It could be a variant type of cluster headache, it could be a lot of things, but I wouldn't want to put up with that sort of pain and sleep disturbance for very long, and it would be wise to get to the bottom of what's causing it sooner than later.  I hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "First off i am a 29 year old male, i have a history of migraines both in my family (my paternal grandmother and father) as well as myself when i was in my pre and early teens.  They were so bad that many times i would cry from the pain and on one occasion i felt like i was going blind.  My Dr. put me on some pills that eventually made them far less frequent, instead of every day i eventually had them every other month of so.  Ive always had headaches small or large, but lately it seems like i have them all the time.  If my hair gets too long i get headaches, if i'm overly stressed(which given work and cash flow issues i've been alot of lately), if i do not get enough sleep, if i get too much sleep, and lately my nose has been stuffy quite a bit and that also has given me some headaches.  Most times these headaches are very subtle, just enough to make me not wanna do anything but not enough to cripple me should i have stuff to do.  A quick pop of aspirin works but i'm finding that i've sorta become immune to normal doses so to really get rid of a headache id have to pop 3 to 4 Advil, Aleve works the best but even with those i'm having to take 2 or 3 these days  to make it work...and i'm not comfortable doing that all too often.  Is this a sign that my migraines are coming back to being a serious issue and there something else i could try...i'm currently without health insurance and hours away from the primary care physician i have been going to for 20+ years...  Sincerely, Migraines in the Mitten\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Subtle Headaches/migranes",
    "content": "Hello -  Your current headaches could signal a return of migraines, but it sounds from your description more like either sinus or possibly tension headaches. Have you had any nasal stuffiness or cough lately? Allergies are another related possibility.   Regardless of the cause, non-steroidal anti-inflammatories (NSAIDs) such as Advil and Aleve do work for many sufferers of both migraines and non-specific headaches, and are preferable in most cases to the more potent dedicated migraine medications where practical. Also, while the instructions on the Advil and Aleve containers both tell you to take no more than two tablets every 4-6 hours, the effective dose of Advil (generic: ibuprofin), which is also a prescription  strength,  is 600-800 mg (3-4 of the 200 mg. tabs or caps).  With Aleve (generic:naproxyn sodium), the effective dose is usually 3 (660 mg.,close to the prescription 500 mg. dose, although there are a number of variations on the prescription strengths  of this one). So basically you aren't overdoing either right now, although you are wise to try and limit their use, since some people can suffer injury to their stomach lining by chronic use or greater-than-recommended doses. What many people are advised to do is take the increased dose along with an over-the-counter product such as Zantac (generic: ranitadine) to help protect the stomach lining when using these medications. It's not a bad idea, to be on the  safe side, may help, and won't do any harm.   If the headaches continue or increase in severity, or if any additional related symptoms evolve, of course, you'll have to make arrangements to be seen and evaluated, but it sounds as though your current NSAID use is sufficient to manage them.   I hope this is helpful to you. Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am new to this forum. I am asking anyone for help as a last resort. I have been chronically clenching and grinding my teeth for 10 yrs, i am 29 yr old female with no other medical condition. I feel now i am at my wits end and am starting to become really really depressed about my situation. My teeth clenching/grinding is always at night and it is chronic. I have seen various dental professors who have fitted me with upper, lower, soft, hard slpints, i have had the height of the splints adjusted many many times. I have been on diazepam, prothiaden, propanolol, amitriptyline, herbal products etc etc. I have tried massage, hypnotherapy, exercise etc etc. I also have an NTI-tss which cost a lot of money and i have twice had botox injections into my masseter muscle. So, to the point, i have had chronic daily headaches for about 10 years now, i wake up with a headache every day, it lasts all day, i go to sleep and the cycle continues. Once or twice a month the headache is very bad and i will vomit and be confined to be for three days at a time. I have seen a neurologist and i do not have anything 'serious', he is convinced that all my symptoms are from the night time clenching. The problem is now i feel like i can't go on living my life like this. I am totally miserable every single day from the pain in my head, jaw, ears, neck and shoulders. No one seems to be able to help me and i am desperate for ANY information or ANYTHING i can try as i feel i have now exhausted all other possibilities  many many thanks in advance  regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, let me just say that I sympathize with your frustration as well as your daily pain. It must be exhausting. While it has long been believed that bruxism is caused by misalignment of the jaw, and I suppose this is possible, the more common causes are believed to be psychological and include stress, anxiety, competitiveness, difficult work or relationship situations and suppressed anger. This being the case more often than not, is it possible any of those conditions are obtaining in your life now and over the past decade that this has been happening to you? If so, evaluation by a psychotherapist specializing in biofeedback and/or cognitive behavoral therapy techniques might just be the  solution to the problem, especially since all the mechanical interventions  have failed to make a difference. The condition is now producing stresses of its own which need to be dealt with anyway, so it would be an ideal time to look into the possible psychological causes as well as how to deal with the immediate stress of the disorder.  Since orodental mechanical approaches have failed to make any difference and since your patience is, understandably, running thin, I would strongly recommend looking into this possible cause. I think you might be really surprised at how much difference it could make. Please at least consider it.   I hope this is helpful. Please hang in there, and do stay in touch with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  There is some neurological issue that needs to be addressed here. It sounds as though you've started to experience some sort of central nervous system reflex in response to certain stimuli (ingestion of foods, exposure to artificial lighting). This is sometimes the way migraine presents itself. The response to the wine by itself would seem fairly ordinary (\"wine headache\" is fairly common), but given the fact that this also happens with apparently random foods and in response to lights suggests possibly some variant of migraine, or perhaps some other problem which would best be evaluated by a consult with a neurologist. Hopefully you can arrange for this.   I wish I could be of more help, but the symptoms are just random enough to make it difficult to even guess at a distance, except so far as I already have. Have a neurological workup and it may be that there are some simple things that can be done to relieve the symptoms.   Please follow up with us here, especially if there are any other factors you may not have mentioned in this post. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  Well that accident (and it was quite an accident!) does make a difference, since it probably accounts for most of the neurological symptoms. The \"dried blood\" is probably a small hematoma (a bleed, in this case, between the brain and the skull, and which has probably dried somewhat, perhaps to the consistency of jello) and that could very easily be causing the problem, if, in fact, there is such a hematoma still up in there. Some of the smaller ones dissipate with time, while others remain to cause intermittent symptoms.   The test you had was probably an EEG (electroencephalogram) to see if you were seizure-prone. If you do have an intermittent problem between the skull and brain it might well not have been causing any problem at the time and could have caused the test to be negative. If there is some blood or a hematoma still up there and it's causing enough problems, there are relatively simple ways to remove it surgically, in most cases. First it has to be proven, however, by imaging studies.   Hopefully this all continues to get better with time, although some of the orthopedic injuries causing nerve impingements may need work. Best of luck to you. Please do stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My fiance has been getting some really severe headaches at the base of his skull right where it meets his neck. It usually happens when we have sex,(which we stopped) but it now he says it feels like it's going to happen if he stretches his arms up above his head.. The first time it happened it was crippling to him. He immediately laid down and clutched his head in pain.. he said it felt like someone had slammed an ice pick into the back of his head. He was also frightened by the fact that he could feel his heart beating and pulsing in the back of his neck like it was having a hard time getting through and said that he had unimaginable pressure in his head, like it might explode. The first one happened last thursday, and on Saturday he had his worst one yet. He was in the shower trying to figure out what was triggering it and accidentally made it happen. He said he wasn't sure if he should even be standing up so he threw on his clothes and went to lay in his bed. I had been trying to get a hold of him on the phone while this was happening, but  the pain was too bad for him to even be able to get up and answer the telephone. These attacks of intense pain usually last about 15 minutes and then taper off into just a bad headache. During the bad one, he said that  he noticed his vision going black and white and then back to color with his heartbeat (which becomes very very fast) His blood pressure also goes up quite a bit when this is happening. He also mentioned that when he had the one on Saturday, he felt his heart beating very irregularly. He was on Prilosec for heartburn for six or seven days before these started happening and he stopped taking it after the first one.. but it doesn't seem to have helped. He had another one on Sunday, Monday he was fine, and Tuesday he had another. We went to the doctor on Wednesday, and the doctor didn't give us any idea as to what might be causing it. He ordered a head CT scan and took a blood sample. The blood sample he said was just to test his kidney function and make sure that the dye they would use during the CT scan would filter back out correctly, but when we went in for his CT scan the next morning, they didn't use any dye at all.. (is that normal?) Now he's just had a lingering headache for several days that gets worse at times and he mentioned that he will feel a suddenly sharp pain every once and a while..   This whole thing is really freaking me out... We've read up on everything we can find online... for a while we thought maybe it was a sexual headache or an exertion headache.. but now, my fiance said that he feels the symptoms of a Thunderclap headache is much closer to what he is experiencing. He has no vomiting, slight nausea, but he said that may be just because of what he's going through when it happens and not actually a symptom...  Radiology said that we would get the results of his CT scan in a couple of days, but I don't know if they meant business days or just days. He also has an appointment coming up with Internal Medicine on the 15th. They couldn't get him in any sooner..   Any information or help or.. anything would be really appreciated!   Thanks for taking the time to read all that.. :-S\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While there could be any number of innocent causes for your boyfriend's headaches it is extremely crucial that the  more serious possibilities be ruled out (or in -- either way is important) first. From the detailed description of the symptoms you provide here my first thought is that he may have an arteriovenous malformation (AVM) in or on his brain. This can  be extremely serious and needs to be ruled out first, followed by the just-as-serious-but-usually-not-as-complex arterial aneurisms. The field is narrowed down from there.    The reason I think of AVMs first is because of not only \"thunderclap\" headaches but also the pressure, pulsing, and visual disturbances, all of which are often features of a maturing AVM,  which is a congenital defect that usually doesn't show up right at birth and  may take years to start causing symptoms, and is a tangled cluster of small arteries and veins which have not developed  a connecting set of capillaries, and so develop pressure where the arterial and venous blood makes the return loop back to the heart. Since capillaries allow the exchange of oxygen from blood and change arterial to venous by exchanging oxygen for carbon dioxide, there is a slow buildup of pressure at such a site. Eventually it starts to cause damage to surrounding structures and  that's when the symptoms begin to show up. Depending on the location in the head, the symptoms can vary, but what you've described here suggests an AVM first and foremost.   While a CT scan is usually the first step in imaging to try and demonstrate an abnormality, an MRI is usually more specific once the  lesion (if there is one) has been  located and if it is not located, the MRI, often with contrast (cerebral angiogram, and sometimes done with flouroscopy instead of MRI, depending on anatomical considerations) must be done in order to locate and define the lesion (again, if there is one).   This  is a rather urgent matter,  and hopefully the heavy work has already been done. AVMs (or aneurisms and other malformations  of cerebral blood vessels) are often repaird by surgery with very good results. Aneurisms now can sometimes be repaired or at least managed by less invasive procedures such as placing a coil via a catheter. AVMs usually do require surgical repair,however.   Please follow up with  us here and let us know how things have gone so far. Hopefully this was something less serious, but if it was what it sounds like,  it needed to be diagnosed and treated fairly quickly to avoid a more dangerous situation.   Best of luck to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While it is difficult to guess with reasonable certainty exactly what is going on here, it sounds as though something is irritating one of your cranial nerves where it passes through the scalp. This can cause extremely severe and sudden, shooting headaches as a rule, and the bump may be a cyst of some sort, perhaps ganglionic. A consult with a neurologist would be in order. I don't think this is a nothing, and it is both painful and at times a major inconvenience (the fainting at work part, I would think). Please do have it looked at and taken care of. If I'm right, even in part, about what's causing this, there are often easy cures for them, although they somtimes involve surgery (depending on the precise problem and the location. This one sounds to be on the outside of the skull from the description).   Best of luck to you and I hope you will see someone and be feeling much better soon. Follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: headaches dizziness and weakness",
    "content": "Hi there -  It seems likely there is more than one thing going on here. While dizziness, fatigue and headache can all comprise a viral syndrome, the clicking in your ear and being treated for vertigo suggest you probably have had labyrinthitis (an inflammation of the part of the inner ear that helps maintain equilibrium). Sometimes you can have this without the other  symptoms, but it is often the most disturbing of the three and the one that sends people to the doctor's office.  Vertigo is the sensation of dizziness in which the room seems to be moving (usually described as spinning, but it can be vertical or every which way as well). Vertigo can be detected by most doctors by a simple visual test where you're asked to \"follow my finger with your eyes.\" When you do this, if vertigo is the problem, your eyes will seem to bounce when reaching the far left or right position  (depending upon the affected ear). This is what your doctor diagnosed and it fits the overall picture. Since this if often due to a viral infection of the ear or a general viral infection, that would also explain the headaches and fatigue. Hopefully by now you're feeling much better.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Worrysome Headaches Almost Daily for a Week",
    "content": "I am a 22 year old female. No previous history of headaches, active (about 4 cardio sessions per week), full time college student. Only medication I'm on is birth control.  In the past few months, I started getting headaches here and there. In the past week, however, I've gotten several, almost daily headaches of unprecedented intensity. It usually feels like pressure on the top or back of my head, towards the right side.   A particularly bad episode was 2 or 3 nights ago, when I had pressure all over my head that kept me from going to sleep. 2 rapid release Tylenols helped it go away. For the past couple of days, I've gotten similar pressure/pain in the back of my head on the right, along with a feeling of stiffness in my neck.  I have also been having gastrointestinal issues for the past few months, and I am not sure whether or not they are related. I've had frequent abdominal pains mostly in my right central/lower quadrant and bouts of constipation. I went to see a physician about this 2 months ago and she prescribed Miralax to ease the constipation, which helped for about a month before the pains returned. In the same week that he headaches intensified, I started having mild nausea in the mornings or after meals. A few times, I felt extremely weak/faint, especially after a bowel movement. I'm getting an ultrasound of the abdomen done in a few days to look further into the GI problems.  I also had a blood test done, which came back normal, except with a low glucose level of 57. This is what made me think the headaches may be related, because that first really intense headache came within 30 minutes of eating a meal and a bar of chocolate. I've also been paranoid that alcohol yielded a similar reaction.   What puzzled me are the subsequent headaches of the past few days. They are pretty much confined to the right side of my head, sometimes radiating to what feels like my sinuses (behind/above the nose). My neck has been feeling very stiff for the past two days, along with my jaw at times. And not to add yet another factor, but my gums have felt swolen/irritated as well (wisdom teeth coming in?). I haven't taken any medication for any of this, and the headaches seem to be almost gone at times, but as soon as I think about it, they seem to return. Is there a chance these ailments are related to the gastro problems, or should I get the headaches looked into?   I hate the uncertainty, because I've been anxious and on edge about all of this for the past few weeks. I've gone to the ER with what turned out to be a bout of anxiety before, so worrying about the uncertainty of my health has been making me feel even worse. I haven't felt like myself for weeks and all this stress is starting to interfere with my classes, two jobs and activity. Can anyone shed some light on any possible causes of these symptoms or how may be related? Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  While your headaches sound a good deal like classic migraines (one-sided, severe, with  nausea), and the stomach pains  could even be GI  migraine (a fairly rare variation on the theme, but it does happen), the stiff neck concerns me a little. While it doesn't sound as though you're acutely ill with anything, headached with a stiff neck does deserve a doctor's attention. It's probably nothing (except migraine, most likely), but with the added neck symptoms it does cloud the picture a little and I'd strongly suggest a neurological workup. I realize you've had some anxiety problems in the past and even this can of course cause neck stiffness due to tension, and while  I don't want you to be unduly concerned (the stiff neck thing is just a general sign that is considered a potential flag, usually doesn't mean anything), but I do want you to take care of yourself when it's appropriate, and if only to ease your own mind and perhaps find a better way to manage the headaches, I'd see a doctor.  That's the only way you're going to get to the bottom of this.   Good luck, and  please do follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 17 year old male. For a while now, I've been having episodes where, out of nowhere, my vision will tip on it's side and then attempt to right itself. It's hard to describe- picture a plank of the wood floating in the ocean. A wave goes underneath the wood, and it rocks- my vision does the same thing, only much much quicker, and repeatedly.  If I attempt to stand, I feel sick to my stomach- I can only stand for a few moments before I fall to the ground. My head is also in pain during these episodes. My vision rights itself after a few minutes, but for about an hour afterward, if I stand my vision swoons and I feel sick again. I must remain laying down. These episodes happen once every month or so, and I may be doing anything at the time. As well as this, I've been experiencing fake memories- or perhaps they aren't, and someone else has just forgotten, but if the events really never did happen, I thought it would be relevant to add. Also, which may also be completely unrelated, I've been experiencing headaches more frequently- once about every two to three days. Do you believe these symptoms could be connected? And, more importantly, do you believe the first symptom may be something serious? I would ask a family member to take me to see a local doctor, but they try to brush everything off as either a cold or growing pains. Anyway... any assistance that you could give would be immensely appreciated, and you'd have my gratitude. Thank you very much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  At first I was really perplexed by your symptoms (and if I'm wrong, then I'm still perplexed) but then I realized you could be describing violent vertigo. The description is the way most people would put it, but the bottom line is the same, and amounts to feeling like being on a rocking boat or that the room is spinning or has flipped on its side. I could be wrong, but this would be the first suspicion. There is a very simple  neurological test (\"follow my finger\") which a doctor or nurse can do to check for nystagmus (abnormal eye movement associated with these episodes) and which can actually trigger the phenomenon in some people. A provocative test (if you decide to try this, don't do it alone) is to lie with your head hanging off the end of a bed, then turn your head one way and then the other. If it is benign positional vertigo (or Menier's disease, which causes the same symptom, but often with more nausea as you've described) you may not make it past hanging your head over the end of the bed, and definitely moving the head once to the side should set it off. If this is the case, it is BPV or Menier's both of which involved a problem with the inner ear and eyes' balance interaction. There are simple medications which can usually control the symptoms effectively.   If I'm totally wrong in my connecting of the dots, please let me know. Otherwise, follow up with us here and let us know if there's anything new or if you've found you do, in fact, have BPV.   At any rate, this is not something that ought to be blown off -- by you or by a doctor, and I strongly suggest seeing one, even if you decide to test yourself for BPV and find it brings on the symptoms. The headaches could indicate an inner ear infection or other problem inside the head that could be more serious than simple  vertigo.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

All medicines have side effects and getting into a habit of constant painkiller is never a good thing.  I suggest you get in touch with your primary care physician and get  a general health check up incliding Pulse, BP, general and systemic examination, routine blood and urine work up and any Xrays that might be indicated.  This will point to the reason of your pounding headaches, dizziness etc. Generally your kind of headahes are seen in people who have developed a recent high BP. On the other hand some gas, hyperacidity and dyspepsia can also be a known but unrecognized cause.  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

I work at a Law Office in which I spend 8 hours infront of a computer (but not the 8 hours do I actually use the computer), I used to have PERFECT vision, 20/20, but in the past few weeks I have noticed that my vision is very poor now.  Signs seem very blury and I have to drive up very close to be able to read a street sign.  My alarm clock numbers look blury from my bed when they had never seem like that before.  I wake up with pounding headaches, and throughout the day I randomly get a sharp pain around my temple area.  I used to think it was because my wisdom teeth are sprouting, so it would cause tension, but my teeth seem to stop sprouding for the moment and now my headaches are not just around my temple area, it is my whole head that hurts.  My headaches seems to go and come. Sometimes when i'm driving, in the car, or even just at home, I get this feeling of NOTHING.  As strange as that sounds thats how I feel.  I just sit there and I get this weird feeling as if everything around me was not real.  My memory has also be getting worse.  I seem to forget where I place things, I could be talking and suddenly I forget what I am saying.  I get bad confusion sometimes to the point where it is affecting my work.  I am always misplacing files, forgetting where I put things, forgetting what I was supposed to do through out the day.   Also, when I'm sitting down or even standing, the left side of my body (around my rib cage/stomach area)  gets very tingly! It starts numbing up.  It is a very strange sensation.  Lastly, I have fatigue all the time.  I always have a good night sleep, getting 6-8 hours of sleep a night, sometimes even more. Yet, I always feel extremely tired, irritable, depressed, to the point where I just want to go home to sleep ( I don't have time for naps though).  I just want to know what may be causing this, or if all my symptoms have any correlation. Thank You\n\n",

Get your eye tested and if your optometrist says so, get glasses done.   Suppose you have numbers and you are not wearing glasses, it may give you headaches. On the other hand headaches at your age could be due to tension, stress, migrain, vascular headaches, cluster headaches, and lastly acidity. All these causes of headaches ate benign and can be easily controlled with some proper diagnosis and treatment by your GP.   Your constant feeling of fatigue, sleepiness etc may have its origins in some exogenous or endogenous depression. Try to find out what is bothering you either at work or at home. But first you must get a routine health check up to rule out any specific disease, ask your GP about this.  Take care,  Apurva\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sever headaches and blackouts",
    "content": "Hello, To have a rare occurrence of fainting or blacking out is quite normal and usually does not require follow-up.  If it happens frequently or you are \"out\" more than a few seconds, it should be checked out with a doctor.    It is true that testing can run up huge bills but if you let the doctor know your situation, I'm sure they can do only the truly necessary testing to be sure you are not in danger from something serious - even if you don't actually have an answer for why it occurs.  Many times we still don't know even after extensive testing because some disorders can be quite evasive to diagnosis and we have to just wait and watch, realizing that some things really are just part of a person's makeup.  But, until we rule out possible problems we can't be confident about it.  Check your community - perhaps call a local hospital or health department to find out if they have any low cost clinics with sliding fee scales.  Or, when making an appointment ask if they offer discounts on visits for cash-paying, non-insured patients.  Also, keep in mind that if you had insurance you would have been paying monthly copays.  Sometimes one visit to the doctor is still less cost than you would have paid in the previous year had you had coverage with copays and/or deductibles besides the premiums.  And, start a health savings account with a little money put aside for such things as this in the future.  If you don't start now you will always be in this dilemma, but putting aside a little while you are well can add up quickly to cover such things as the occasional office visit.  I understand how frustrating this is and insurance certainly is important, especially when serious illness is involved, but it is still not free so you have to keep these things in perspective.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I've already tried reading about migraines and different types of headaches as well as looking through the forum. However, some of what i'm experiencing don't match. So i'm hoping someone might be able to help here.   I'm a 17 year old female and have had headaches since grade 8 although i never really paid attention to them until the last few years. My headaches usually occur on the left side of my head and may be accompanied by a stabbing pain in my left eye. Sometimes the headaches happen around my left eyebrow area. What really bothers me is that sometimes I see flashing lights in different shapes and sizes and they usually last about 30mins (sometimes only a few minutes). Once it occurs, I won't be able to get anywork done since it becomes difficult to read and write (can't judge distance). It used to happen more often (about once or twice per month), then less often (once a few months), but now they're occuring more often again. Usually it only happens in my left eye, but there have been some cases where it happens in both my eyes. I researched this and found out that it's called aura...due to migraines. However, my \"aura's\" aren't usually accompanied by headaches. I don't think I have migraines either since i don't experience any nausea and I don't have headaches bad enough that it will land me in bed.   I did go see a doctor at my university and she said that she doesn't think I have migraines either since my headaches aren't bad enough. She made an appointment for me to see an ophthalmologist, but I had class that day so I couldn't make it to the appointment.   What can I do to get rid of the flashing lights (It makes studying and concentrating in lectures difficult)? And if they're not caused by migraines, what else can they be caused by? Also, since sometimes my headaches are accompanied by a stabbing type of pain in my left eye, should I be concerned about this?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I think seeing an eye doctor would be an obvious and easy thing to do to find out if there is any concern there.  Flashing lights usually do not indicate any serious eye problem. If a large number develop or if they seem to be much worse over a period of time, an examination by an ophthalmologist is recommended.  Also, if you see \"floaters\" or blacking out of some of your vision in addition to the lights, this might be a more serious eye condition such as retinal detachment so you would not want to delay.    It is also possible you have a mild form of migraine.  Each person responds differently and they don't all get the same symptoms for any disorder.  Ruling out eye problems is definitely the place to start.  You may need to see a neurologist if it continues.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Persistent headache worse with orgasm, swollen eye",
    "content": "27 single white female,   For the past three weeks I've had a persistent headache that doesn't respond well to any OTC treatment.  It ranges from a dull ache to a pounding behind my eyes.  The onset of the headache three weeks ago was the most painful,  debilating headache I've had. The headache is nearly manageable except for at the onset of orgasm, when it becomes pounding and extreme. This happens every single time I orgasm, so you can imagine it puts a damper on my life. I've done some research and read that sometimes sex headaches are associated with exertion, but the headache occurs with masturbation as well, not just vigorous sexual activity.   I've also had, upon waking in the morning,  a red, swollen eyelid that becomes crusted and wrinkly as the day progresses. The eyelid condition has come and gone over the past three weeks.  In addition to these factors, I am experiencing bleeding gums in spite of the fact that I have excellent oral hygiene - Sonicare toothbrush and floss every day...the bleeding is so bad that sometimes just touching the gums causes them to bleed.   Could these be associated or a sign of something  serious?  I don't have health insurance or the money to visit the ER;  my area doesn't offer free clinics.  Any help greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Persistent headache worse with orgasm, swollen eye",
    "content": "Hello, There are many causes of headaches - the most common are stress related, allergy or sinus problems, migraines and even high blood pressure.  Sex headaches, as with orgasm, are also fairly common.  Some people experience them in clusters - where they occur for a few times, then it may be weeks or months before another cluster occurs.  Sometimes it is related to tightening of muscles which can occur with sexual activity.  An increase of blood pressure can cause the cerebral blood vessels to dilate, resulting in acute headache.  Low blood pressure, anemia, sinus infections, birth control pills have also been associated with sexual headaches.  If the headache is most pronounced with orgasm itself, you might try stopping activity before orgasm.  This would provide more information on the situation.  This is not usually anything serious but it's always good to consult with a doctor to be sure.  Worrying will probably make it worse so peace of mind can be worth a lot.    The eye problem sounds like it could be pinkeye or allergy-related.  You may need antibiotic drops in case it is a bacterial infection.  Some people get relief with eye drops for allergies.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I was given pain killers and was told as a result of a neck MRI that there was a straightening of my spine in the neck area. 6 months ago I had another car accident and the pain has gotten worse. I wore a neck brace for a while, this helped a little. But the real problem is my migraine. I didnt used to have them till about 7 months ago. I get an attack at least twice a month, lasts for 4-5 days and I sometimes end up hospitilized. My neck stiffens a lot during the attacks and I get a fever everytime I have pain. Lately I ended up forgetting a lot. I couldnt recognise my fiance the other day - it was only for a second but it was enough to scare me. I see lights every now and then and I am not sure if this is because of the severity of the pain or not. I have been to a neurologist and she told me the pain was due to my neck injury. But it is not getting any better and I am tired of using pain killers. I am tired and sleepy all the time no matter how much I sleep and I get dizzy very frequently. What could this possibly be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your doctor is probably right that it is the result of your injury.  You may want to try some alternative pain therapy such as acupuncture if nothing else is helping.  If the headaches are migraines, as you said, you may benefit from medications specifically for that.  Did your doctor prescribe something for that, as opposed to narcotic pain relievers?    Headaches can be one of the most frustrating problems for people because they sometimes come and go for years without a clear cause or effective treatment.  It is believed there may be a hormonal connection since women get migraines much more frequently than men.  But, there is nothing that is a sure cure.    You may also benefit from chiropractic care since this may be spine-related.  I would at least explore that avenue if I were you.    Good luck.\n\n",

Insurance benefits for vision are not typically that great and cost of an exam is usually reasonable so I would do that but still follow up with your doctor if the symptoms continue, get worse or you just sense that things aren't as they should be.

    "title": "Re: Morning headache due to dreams",
    "content": "Hello, If the headaches are due to the dreams, as you suggest, you might try a sleeping aid because sometimes these medications disrupt your brain wave patterns, affecting the amount of dreaming you do.  I am not suggesting this as a long-term thing but as a trial to see if it alters the REM, delta wave and other brain waves that might make a difference.  Talk to your doctor for a recommendation or prescription.    Afternoon naps often leave a person feeling worse than before they slept so it is recommended that if you do nap, don't do it for more than about 15 or 20 minutes.  Again, this is related to the brain wave patterns.  You could also try relaxation exercises, meditation or yoga before retiring at night.   Changing your current routine could also affect your sleep.  There are also sleep clinics where any type of sleep disturbance can be studied and sometimes there are treatments that can help.  Good luck with this very frustrating problem.\n\n",

    "content": "I am writing today to see if someone can help me find out what is wrong with me.  I have a pressure in the back of my head (from ear to ear, and the top of my head to my shoulders.)  Ok Here is a little history on what has been going on with my health. 1 year ago I had an incident where I passed out cold for a matter of moments, my friends where there to get me up and give me some orange juice.  From that day on I have never been the same!  After I fully passed out that one time for the next couple of months I would be driving down the road and have a major sensation that I was going to pass out again, I would have to call someone to let them know where I was just make sure I wasnt going to die. (These are the things going thru my head).    SO I saw the family doctor and gave them every single one of my symtoms.  Also at this time I was having migraines very often.  So I did all the blood work with the family doctor and then she referred me to a Cardiologist, when her we did an EKG and that came back perfectly normal.  So then we moved onto the Neurologist! She had blood work done, MRIs of my head and spine with and without contrast, and an EEG, and you guessed it everything came back fine. She worked with me on the migraines mostly, gave me meds for them and I started to see a chiropractor at the same time and that did wonders for the migraines.  While I was working with the neurologist we came across some blood work that said I was positive for Lymes Disease. My symptomes included being overly tired, very moody at times, fainting sensations when i would do anything strenuous, and this pressure in the back of my head that feels like someone has placed a balloon at the top of my spine into my head and just blows it up whenever they feel like it. So to be very aggressive I started on the antibiotics the same day. I did a 21 day cycle of an antibiotic and this little miracle drug did the trick for the most part.  I still had mild anxiety about there being something else wrong with me that noone was catching.  But I was able to talk myself down with that one.   So then I was fine for about 2 months, not perfect but better.  Then 6 days ago I started to feel a little strange again, so I have tried to contact my neurologist again to do some more blood work to see if anything has changed. 3 days ago while I was at work I had another almost fainting incident and then an anxiety attack and had to be carried out of work. I have this god aweful pressure in the back of my head.  There is nothing I can do to make it better not a position a medicine nothing. My mind races with all the things that could be wrong and it makes the anxiety so much worse.  I have to take a Xanax to sleep and I am afraid of getting addicted...  Someone please help me cause I feel like I am going insane cause everyone says there is nothing wrong on paper, but I believe the total opposite.  Symptoms: *Extreme pressure in the back of my head from ear to ear and shoulders to top of the head. *Headaches from pressure (not migraines) *Random shooting pains thru head and stomach *Food goes in and out very quickly *Anxiety/ Panic * Sleeplessness due to anxiety *Overly tired *Abdominal pain *Overly tired\n\n",

For the past couple of months I have been getting a different type that I have never experienced. It\u2019s a very sharp excruciating pain that only last for about 5-30 seconds. The pain is always on one side of my head\u2026and feels the worst in the back of my eye and makes it hard to keep that eye open while I feel the pain. Is this something I should see a doctor for? Do you know what the cause could be? Anything helps..thanks :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jenlokk,  The location and intensity of pain you are describing fits with a type of headache called a cluster headache.  This type of headache typically does not come and go so quickly, though.  It is a variation of a migraine that often will recur around the same time of day for several days then go away, as if they occur in clusters.  This may also be a variation of a tension headache from some eye strain.  It is less likely but may be worth having your vision evaluated also.  Look for any causes of eye strain also, such as viewing a computer monitor for extended periods of time.  If these persist is it worth having your doctor evaluate this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "22 year old college student male.  I have had this weird kinda chronic neck pain and headache in the back of my head.  On a scale from 1-10 the pain is about a 1-2, but it always seems to be there.  I have no trouble sleeping, and when I wake up, the pain is gone, but fades in as the day goes on.  The headache stays in the back of the head, but sometimes will move to the top for short periods.  I saw the Nurse practicioner that the school provides, she said I most likely strained my neck, she said to lay off the heavy backpacks, take some ibuprofin for 3 days (600mg 3x a day) and use a neck heating pack.  I did all of these, and by the end of the three days, I was feeling much better.  I was fine for about a week, and now the pain seems to be coming back again.  It is a very annoying, and makes it hard to concentrate and be active.  Is there anything this could be outside of just some neck stress and stress related cause (busy college student)?  I started using the heat pack again, and I am going to take the ibuprofin again, Any ideas on what this could be?  Or is it just some neck pain?  If so, who should I visit?  A chiropractor? Neurologist?    Thanks in advance for your advice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jtrowe,  The description of your pain is very consistent with neck tension as the nurse practitioner suspected.  This can be triggered by wearing heavy back packs, etc.; however, it may also be caused by problems with posture, etc.  You may want to try some neck relaxation techniques such as massage to help relieve this pain.  Using the heat pack, etc. is also an appropriate treatment.  Take a look at your posture and make sure it is straight.  Also, it would be good to look at your work area (desk, chair, etc.) to see if these are causing you to be in a position that is causing some increased neck pressure.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I would suggest you see a doctor for an evaluation to check everything out. Occassionally there can be some ongoing electrolyte issues, etc. that can occur with heat stroke.  Staying well hydrated will help as well.  It may take you several days to fully recover from this.   Until then you should probably be self limited in your activity level.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was given pain killers and was told as a result of a neck MRI that there was a straightening of my spine in the neck area. 6 months ago I had another car accident and the pain has gotten worse. I wore a neck brace for a while, this helped a little. But the real problem is my migraine. I didnt used to have them till about 7 months ago. I get an attack at least twice a month, lasts for 4-5 days and I sometimes end up hospitilized. My neck stiffens a lot during the attacks and I get a fever everytime I have pain. Lately I ended up forgetting a lot. I couldnt recognise my fiance the other day - it was only for a second but it was enough to scare me. I see lights every now and then and I am not sure if this is because of the severity of the pain or not. I have been to a neurologist and she told me the pain was due to my neck injury. But it is not getting any better and I am tired of using pain killers. I am tired all the time no matter how much I sleep and I get dizzy very frequently. What could this be, what should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Angel242,  Headaches commonly will follow neck trauma from car accidents.  In particular, if a person has a history of headaches or migraines, the resulting neck trauma can worsen the occurrences and make them more common.  Sometimes some physical therapy can help with this.  Occasionally, what happens is that there is some slight malalignment of the neck due to the accident that then causes the muscles to tighten up to protect the area.  This, in turn, leads to the headaches.  Physical therapy can help loosen the muscles and ease the tension in the neck.  With your other associated issues such as the memory problems these headaches may represent complex migraines or basilar artery migraines (migraines due to spasming of the basilar artery in the back are of the neck/brain).  I would suggest you see your primary care doctor or neurologist again to see about using a prophylactic medication to help prevent you from getting so many headaches.  Best wishes.\n\n",

However, for informational benefit, your pain may be due to a viral infection or an atypical bacteria infection (such as mycoplasma, the cause of atypical or \"walking\" pneumonia).  These infections commonly cause chest tightness and shortness of breath.  They, in particular certain viruses, can also cause muscle inflammation of the neck muscles.  In some cases, they can also cause meningitis, which can cause neck pain and stiffness.  If, by chance, you are still having the pain I would strongly recommend you have it evaluated by your doctor.

    "content": "Hi Stephan,  There are several causes of eye pain.  One of the more common causes is a migraine headache.  This type of pain would be unlikely to come and go quickly, though.  I'm not certain but based on your description I am presuming that these pains are relatively brief.  There may be a component of eye strain causing these pains as well.  This can still happen with a normal ophthalmologic exam.    Transient ischemic attacks (TIA's), or \"mini-strokes\" can cause eye problems but I would not expect this to be such a chronic issue with no other symptoms.  It's possible but unlikely.  If these pains continue I would recommend that your wife see a neurologist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ashme,  There are a few possibilities.  You may be feeling an inflamed lymph node.  The other possibility is that a small blood vessel broke leading to the bump (basically a blood clot under the skin called a hematoma).  Hematomas themselves are usually not painful but the area can hurt because usually there was some trauma that caused the hematoma to form.  If this persists I would suggest you see your doctor.  Occasionally, lymph nodes or hematomas can become infected and need antibiotics to help them clear up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Can a tumor or aneurysm show up in a CT scan without using a contrast dye?  My worry is that the radiographers just wouldnt to get me out of the  way and just did a quick scan without the dye.

    "content": "29, M, the doctor I saw is assuming migraine but since the Imitrex he prescribed did nothing, he wants me to go to a neurologist.  Nice suggestion, however not possible at this time (money being the reason).   The MRI w/ contrast of my brain came back normal.  I've got a headache that is primarily localized in the right temple ( I feel it sometimes in the left temple, and forehead, but usually its in the right) and I have inflamed blood vessels in that right temple and under my eye.  OTC nsaids do nothing or make things worse.   I decided to try some prednisone I had left from a lower back problem that cleared up about a month before the headaches began, but it had no effect (I assumed a inflamed nerve was to blame for the headaches).  I have a family history of migraines, but those presented in typical fashion (light sensitivity, msg trigger) whereas this headache is constant and is not light/noise sensitive.  Just looking for suggestions here ... I'm trying yoga, aromatherapy, heat/ice packs ... but obviously not getting anywhere.  I'm not using any medications.  Occasionally my neck will be sore, though thats not something that became a problem until a month or more after the headaches began.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My guess is that you are having tension headaches, which are the most common type.  Stress is believed to be a primary cause of these.  You may have more luck treating this if you combine the pain reliever (in sufficient dosage to do the job, so go with the maximum allowed on the package) and some stress reduction.  People have been successful with relaxation exercises or even just taking a 20 minute nap.  This seems to give the best outcome - better than either activity alone (medication or rest).  You can also learn some other relaxation techniques such as yoga or visualization.    We don't actually know the cause of the most common headaches but if they persist, you should see a doctor to rule out any underlying medical condition.  You do want to be sure your blood pressure is in the range of normal.    Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 20 y/o male. I have had migraines all my life, likely inherited from my mother. I have learned to deal with them very well. I stopped using pain killers a while back in an effort to better understand what causes them and how to get rid of them. For the most part I am successful.  The reason I am here is because I have a symptom that I have never heard of anywhere. When I get migraines I often have to urinate excessively. For example, I had a migraine today and went to urinate about 7-8 times in about 6 hours. The irony is that dehydration is often a factor in the severity of my migraines. I try to drink water but it just comes straight out; the urine looks completely clear. Any ideas as to what might cause this?  other info: I'm generally very healthy. I get lots of exercise and have a good, balanced diet.   Thanks\n\n",

You may want to discuss this with a neurologist.  I suspect that really the thing to do is try to treat the migraine to get it to go away and this is not a particularly dangerous issue as long you can keep from getting too dehydrated.

    "content": "I am 28 yrs old, female. 86 lbs (4'11\")  I've had Social Anxiety Disorder since age 15 (have made progress - am going to make more)  I have a B12 deficiency (getting B12 shots as of yrs ago)  minor Hypoactive Thyroid (on Synthroid as of yrs ago)  have Geographical Tongue (as of Summer 2005)  Get full easy (started Summer 2005 - doc stays it's IBS)  have Low Blood Pressure sometimes  I have a benigne tumor on my liver (hemangeoma?)  Have Acid Reflux - Rolaids etc don't work.  I occassionally get a weird feeling in my chest that takes my breath away at that moment - doc says as long as my heart doesn't race afterwards, not to worry about it.  I bruise easy, mostly on my legs (I usually can't recall how they happened, sometimes they're very big, and I still don't recall when it happened)  Recent:  In October '07 I broke out in Hives for a week (Benadryl helped) Allergy test showed nothing.  Mid-November '07 I started getting a flashing dot in one eye. Test showed nothing.  Been crying off and on since Mid-Nov '07 Moved out on my own again, Mid-Nov '07  I get headaches a lot, but as of a week or so ago, it's been worse. I've had three dizzy spells (usually when getting up from what I remember) I get flush and clammy. Tired. Can't sleep well.  My neck is stiff, shoulders hurt, my face is blotchy, my jaw is a little tight, I get the odd spasm in my back (not enough to make me twitch or anything)   Diabetes runs in both sides of my family. My Mom thinks I'm either anemic, have low blood pressure, or it's a blood sugar thing (which would be new for me)  Is this stress... or does it sound like it fits something else? I kind of hope it's something else because I'm really tired/embarassed at unintentionally making myself feel sick here and there (anxiety disorder) I didn't think I was stressed though.  I sometimes feel sick too, but that might just be my worrying about whatever is going on with me.  Sorry to ramble, I just wanted to make sure I didn't forget anything that might be important.   Thank you so much for this forum, and for taking the time to read/reply to the msgs. I think there is something wrong with me - maybe a different deficiency or something, because I haven't felt physically right since Summer of 2005, and now other things are happening as I just mentioned. I hope someone has an idea of what this is. I really want to feel better. This is depressing.  Take care, and Happy Holidays to everyone.  ~ Kimberly\n\n",

But when i eat to much i throw it right back up. Other than that i don't have an appetite to eat. I eat maybe once a day. I eat Breakfast that is it. Could my headache be from not eating. Could it be stress, depression? No one knows. I would like to kno because this is affecting me in many ways. I cant go to school or work. I want to get better but i don't know what to do. Should i see ym doctor again or get a prescription for an MRI or CAT scan?  Please HELP me.. Thank you!\n\n",

However, with headaches that are worse when standing and better with laying this suggests a pressure problem in the brain.  The pressure is increased upon standing making the pain worse.

    "content": "Hi Acegolfer7,  Your description of the headache and location are consistent with a tension type headache.  These may also be migraines.  Tension headaches often will occur in the afternoon, can be pounding, and are often located in a headband distribution including the temples and/or back of the head.  Migraine headaches can also occur in the back of the head.  Typically with migraines, light hurts the eyes, sound can hurt the ears, and they may be associated with a sense that the headache is going to occur before it begins.    I would suggest you see your doctor to discuss this if your headaches occur.  It is reasonable to try using a pain medicine such as ibuprofen or tylenol if you have not done this already.  Also, you can look for things that may be triggering your headache, such as certain foods or activities that you are alway doing before the headache starts.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi again,  It doesn't really fit a specific headache that I can think of.  This certainly doesn't mean that it can't be this.  The area you describe is classic for tension headaches but it would be a little unusual for a tension headache to just be on one side.  A migraine is well known to cause a one-sided headache but migraines don't generally resolve so rapidly.  If I had to commit to a headache I would say a tension type headache is most likely.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I can understand your concern because any time there is a constant pain such as this, you know something is not right and you want to find out what is causing it, especially when it develops suddenly.  Naturally your mind jumps to the worst case scenario.    Typically an aneurysm will have other symptoms beyond the headache, which is usually described as \"the worst pain or headache of my life.\"  I would be surprised though if you did not also have other neurological symptoms such as visual disturbances, behavior changes, nausea/vomiting, balance problems, fatigue, or stiff neck.  Of course these symptoms can also go along with other conditions, even the labyrinthitis.  The diagnosis of an aneurysm would be verified by a CT scan.  If your headache does not improve soon, follow up with your doctor.  There are many different types of headaches with a myriad of causes so it may take a while to be sure of the cause of yours.  Hopefully you will get some relief soon.    Talk to your doctor about certain maneuvers or exercises (Brandt and Daroff exercises and Epley maneuver) that may speed your recovery from the labyrinthitis.  There are also some home remedies that may help.  Reduce salt and sugar intake, avoid chocolate, caffeine, alcohol and tobacco.  Lie still in a comfortable position, on your side (flat).  There are medications that sometimes help so if the one you have doesn't work, let your doctor know.  If you should have additional symptoms, especially if they seem like stroke symptoms (weakness especially on one side, speech difficulty, extreme and sudden pain, unconsciousness, etc.) get emergency treatment.  Best wishes for a full recovery.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello. I am a 21 year old female who is in need of some advice for my headaches. A few months ago I started developing really bad headaches while I was at work. I tried over the counter pain relievers with little luck. I started wearing my glasses full time (I am only required to use them when I drive). I also cut down my caffeine intake while drinking more water, in case the headaches were do to dehydration. Nothing seemed to work. I currently wake up with headaches everyday, although they are much less severe now. My problem is, I was woken up around 3 am last night with a severe pain above my right brow bone that instantly spread to the top of my head. The pain then quickly traveled down in front of my ear and into my neck. The pain started to dull shortly. Within 15-20 minutes, the pain seemed to be just a normal headache. I also started to notice a tingling needle-like feeling on the right side of the back of my head. It started to travel around the back of my head and formed a \"band\" type shape across the back of my head. I did check the my pupils to make sure they would dilate/constrict properly, which they did. I don't have any nausea or marked dizziness with my headaches usually. The only medication I am taking is Mobic for arthritis. Any help would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

This is a little unusual for a migraine so I would suggest that you see your doctor to have a thorough neurological examination performed.    If it is felt that these are, in fact, migraines you may want to talk to your doctor about trying a preventative medicine to keep you from getting these headaches so often.  Also, continue to look for triggers to these headaches if you can.  Look for foods you've eaten recently, activities you were doing in the immediate time before the headache, etc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

But, of course there are many causes of headaches and it would be impossible to say for sure.  If it does not respond to acetaminophen, rest and reasonable food intake (to verify it is not caused by low blood sugar) you should have it evaluated by your doctor.    If it is an allergy-induced headache, you may get relief from an antihistamine and/or decongestant.  Try to record any patterns you notice about the headaches so you can report these to your doctor.

I do have a history of migraines, but they are always related to either food or stress triggers, and are not tied to any part of the day. No one else in my family has had this sort of thing, I've had no surgeries, and currently I take hypothyroidism medicine and vitamins as part of my daily regime.  These headaches are medium bad, and I've already taken the maximum dose this week of my migraine medicine. Last night, also, when I went to bed I felt like I could hear and feel my heartbeat. It was loud and uncomfortable, and sounded like it was coming from my neck - if that makes any sense. I'm a fairly fit person - I bike about 10 miles a day - so my heart thumping seemed odd, as I hadn't done anything that strenuous. Any idea what this could be about?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be hard to tell obviously without a careful assessment. To answer your question: headaches that are worse in the morning are commonly depression and hangover headaches. Cluster headache also causes morning headaches but these usually wake the patient from sleep.  Palpitations on the other hand may reflect anything from anxiety to a change in the heart's rate, volume of output, or more commonly, rhythm. Also anything that can lead to a change of rhythm can obviously lead to palpitations - so diseases such as thyrotoxicosis or pheochromocytoma can also lead to this picture. Please understand the limitations of internet communication in assessment of any medical presentation.   More commonly the cause of your symptoms would be something a lot more benign and may even be self limited. I only mention the more alarming causes to convince you that there is no replacement to a proper direct assessment by your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

Cluster headaches are a possibility - my sister suffers from them - and these are waking me up. I was up three times last night to take medicine. But I thought that cluster headaches were more severe. These aren't horrible as far as my migraines go, just sort of middling.  Also, I had read that morning headaches may be linked to high blood pressure, so I went out and had mine measured. It was 54/100, which I assume is on the low side.   I'm thinking perhaps the headaches are linked to undiagnosed sleep apnea of something of the sort. My tonsils are constantly swollen and I wake up many times in the night as it is. Now I'm having morning headaches, which I read are also linked to sleep apnea. As per your recommendation, I'll be seeing a doctor this week. Thanks for your time.\n\n",

Follow up is important for a period of time after surgery for fear of recurrence.  Endometrial cancer is curable if caught at an early stage.

    "content": "I'm new here. I'm a 31 y/o female with a strong family history of migraines. My father died this past year from cancer and I've been recently diagnosed with migraines with auras. I also have a history of chronic diarrhea ever since I had my gallbladder removed several years ago, and I manage the diarrhea with cholestyramine 4 gm twice daily. I'm on topamax 75 mg daily, I have prn axert 12.5mg, prn phenergan 25mg, prn lunesta 3 mg, and I take a prenatal vitamin daily due to family hx of MTHFR mutation. (it's just precautionary, I haven't had any blood clots, and my labs have always been ok)  The situation is that I have just finished up a debilitating 10 day migraine, aura with bright lights, dizziness, photophobia, phonophobia, vomiting, diaphoresis, diarrhea, stabbing pains in the eye, tinnitus.  I tried taking axert with no effect, I had some fiornal left over from an old script and took it occasionally just so I could sleep, I took a total of 8 pills over a 7 day period. Phenergan was not effective, and by day 4 I was vomiting uncontrollably.  I was unable to take by cholestyramine due to vomiting. So I went to the family med clinic, recieved IM phenergan/stadol discharged home. To ED the next day for uncontrolled vomiting, recieved IV reglan/decadron one liter of fluids discharged home. Spent next 2 days (weekend) in dark room clutching emesis basin. Then became so weak I could hardly stand and the diarrhea was watery, so back to family med clinic, where I fainted walking back to room. Seen by PA, no labs done, given shot of vistaril, refused pain meds(was told my headache was from \"taking too much pain meds), given neurology consult and sent home with a script for phenergan suppositories when I complained oral phenergan wasn't managing the nausea. The pain in my head was so bad that on the way home I was curled into a fetal position and crying. The very next night back to ED because I was vomiting so hard I was having chest pain so bad I could hardly breathe and was sweating. This time my husband was threatened that he would be forcibly removed from the ED for speaking up for me. I was given an  EKG, IV compazine, 1/2 bag fluids, no pain meds and sent home.   Is this standard care for migraines???  I feel like I've been treated like such a low life. I have no history of drug use, no psychiatric history, and now I'm scared to go back to the clinic or ED for anything, But the next nearest clinic that accepts our insurance is over an hour away, and they aren't accepting new patients. I just took my last axert for a migraine a few hours ago, and my insurance won't pay for a refill till next month. I've been out of work for 2 weeks and I don't have $150 to pay for the script out of pocket.  My brother has offered me his meds, but he's on a different triptan, and I'm scared to mix meds.   Any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "1. 27 2. male 3. no past diagnoses 4. no past surgeries 5. no family history 6. no current medications  So, I had posted a while back because I've been having problems with my memory.  But lately, things have gotten worse.    I constantly have these sharp headaches, that come in bursts one after the other.  they last for only a few seconds each time, but I can always pinpoint them to the same location, center of the left side of my head.   I also feel exhausted every part of the day, no matter the amount of rest I get.  My eyes are glassy, pinkish, and burn, as if I haven't slept, and i'm unable to concentrate or think clearly, and my vision is a bit blurry.  When I try to think or remember anything, the headaches kick in.  My eyes make it look like i'm stoned, and that's pretty much how I feel.   I can't think or retain information.  About a month and a half ago I began taking Ginkgo Biloba, in an attempt to help with my memory problem, it didn't help and I haven't taken it in about 3 weeks now.  the only other medication I've taken were sleeping pills.  1 dose about a week ago.  though this problem has been on going for about 2 months now.  My memory problem, longer.    All this has caused my grades to plummet, and is causing me a great deal of grief overall.  I hope someone can please give me an idea of what I might do to regain my intellect. I am without an income so doctor visits are pretty much out of the question, unless someone can recommend a free/cheap alternative in the Southern California area.    Thank you for reading.  Alex\n\n",

Diabetes runs on my Mom's side of the family,but I don't know anyone by name who has had it.    Sometimes later at night,such as last night,I get pressure in my head,mainly the back. It didn't last long but of course I'd like to find out what causes it and get it to stop. When I lay down,I also felt weird in my head but not the pressure. I guess it was a shaky type feeling and maybe kind of light headed too. I don't always get enough sleep and have had insomnia but I wasn't *that* sleep deprived. Maybe I got 4.5-5 hours of sleep. I don't know if lack of sleep could be causing it. Thanks.   Michelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  Recurring headache in the back of the head (occipital) can occur due to several causes. Cervical (neck) nerve root conditions can lead to pain in the back of the head, neck and may be accompanied by tingling sensation in the neck. It can be diagnosed by a CT scan of the neck vertebrae as well as clinical signs.  Other causes include muscle spasms and tension headache which can occur especially after periods of stress.  If this is a recurring problem, I would suggest you inform your doctor and have it properly assessed.  Good luck and keep this thread updated.\n\n",

    "title": "Do I need an MRI scan?",
    "content": "Hello, I really could do with some advice. I have suffered with headaches and migraines for a few years now but the headaches seemed to have increased in frequency. I now can get about three headaches a day; I can normally cope for a while but often have to take pain killers at least once a day. I often wake with a headache in the morning which clears quite quickly. When I get really bad headaches/migraines I can only lie on my left side as the pain is too intense. Walking bending forward and straining make the bad ones worse. I have recently developed blurred vision and weakness down my left side, which have also developed a burning in my leg and nausea I also get terrible neck pain. My doctor seemed concerned and sent me to see a neurologist, as I have CFS and Fibromyalgia he thinks it is probably my illness causing these new symptoms. I am not 100% sure. I also get dizzy, tinnitus, facial pain all down the left side very bad memory. But have had these symptoms for a long time. My doctor recently done tests like getting me to walk on my heals and toes, which I could not do, any idea what that is about? When I saw the neurologist he said he did not think it was a neurological problem. He said it is probably due to the other illness although he did notice the weakness down my left side. I had a 10 minute MRI about 9 months ago but it concentrated on my ear as tinnitus is worse in left ear, this was fine. As the MRI was looking in a certain area would it have picked up if something else was wrong? My doctor seemed to imply he wanted me to have a full brain and maybe body scan but this did not happen, I am in the UK and am an NHS patient but wondered if I should go private and have an MRI scan as I am obviously worried by the amount and severity of the headaches, Is this normal? Should I be worried? Someone mentioned contrast with an MRI scan would this help. Sorry so much information any advice would be helpful. Thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Butterflyhugzs,  You have mentioned a few things that make me concerned.  With a past history of migraines it is certainly possible that you are simply having worsening migraines. However, waking up with a headache is very atypical for a migraine since sleep generally relieves it.  Also, migraines do not typically cause weakness.  Given these things I think it would be very appropriate to have an MRI of the head with contrast to look for any possible problems.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

If you do not get relief for a headache with rest, pain relievers such as acetaminophen and you aren't having blood sugar problems, you should probably get it checked out.  A severe headache like this could signal some kind of problem, or it could be a migraine.  In any case, seeing a doctor should help you to rule out serious concerns at least and at best perhaps you can get some relief.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi HGVCBoy,  There has never been any conclusive evidence that cracking joints causes any distress except for the possibility that some stress over the long term could  subject the tendons and bones to unnatural pressure. Over a long period of time, body tissues do not recover so well from such manipulations. This can create joint pain similar to that of professional athletes after years of repetitive muscle/ligament stress.  The idea that it could cause arthritis has not been substantiated.  It is unlikely that it is causing the headache unless you are just feeling tense due to the desire to \"crack\" and that tenseness itself is causing headache.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter, age 7, has been having recurring headaches for the past several months.  On average she has about 3 a week.  They come on suddenly and she complains that they are quite painful. When one starts she will complain of sharp pain (kind of like an ice cream headache she says) and press on her forehead with her hands.  When she has one she prefers to sit or lie down in a dimly lit place with little noise  and she waits out her headache.  The headaches usually do not last terribly long, perhaps 30 minutes to an hour.    We have tried to figure out what is triggering the headaches but we can't seem to find a common cause. She has had headaches at school, at home, during the day, in the evenings,  even during times when she is doing something fun like playing with friends or participating in an acitivity she really enjoys. When a headache starts she will stop whatever she is doing  hold her head and just want to lie down somewhere.   Once the headache is gone, she is back to her old self.  Our daughter is healthy and has had no major health problems.  She doesn not have vision problems. She is not on any medication. We do occasionaly give her childrens Tylenol for pain, but we first wait to see if the headache will go away on its own. She is happy and social, enjoys school and is an overall content child. It is just these headaches that are interupting her life and causing her pain several times a week.  Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

Sure enough, the nurse called to tell me the xrays showed a sinus infection.  I was  surprised because my daughter had not shown any symptoms other than the headaches. She hasn't had a fever, or a cough, or even a runny nose.   But we were very happy at the thought that antibiotics would alleviate the headache problem.    My daughter has now been on the antibiotics for a little over two weeks and has still had three headaches during that time.  The most recent was two days ago.  I don't know if she just hasn't been on the medicine long enough, or if I should be concerned that the headaches are still there.  If the headaches continue, could that mean the sinus infection and the headaches were not related?  We just really want the headaches to go away once and for all.  Thanks for your input. I very much appreciate it.\n\n",

Maybe i should mention one detail that happened few moths ago that can be connected with theese symptoms. In abaout four or five months ago i had a wierd symptom that made me stop working out. The thing is that while i was dooing exercises i started to have headace. I neeed  to describe situation. I was dooing incline bench press exercise when i felt a sudden sharp pain in back left side where head and neck join. second day pain was more severe and third day it made me completely  quit working out. Pain was trigered ONLY by exercise. Later i didnt had any symptoms apart from short ocasional pains such as one that i described above  untill 3 days ago when i felt discomfort in described place.    in my family there is no history of malignant deseases that i am aware of but there is rich history of strokes in family, great grandfather, and grandfather died from stroke, one grandmother survived severe stroke while other survived mild stroke. i did some bload, and urine tests. My sedmentation was a bit higher than normal 13/30 and that is only thing that was out of referal values ...  coul it be stroke or tumor?  i really would apriciate if you could give me your opinion    thanx for your time\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 yr. old female with migraine headaches, dx'd since 2002.  I now take Elavil 50 mg, Cartia XT, and Tizanadine daily, and Relpax or Maxalt at onset of migraines.  I have a PFO, with a lot of blood flow through it.  They are on my left side exclusively, and I recently noticed I have a 30% loss of sensation on my left side, from my face down to the soles of my feet.  I discovered while in the ER last time that my left side was sluggish and no response with the babinski test on my left foot, butI got a hyper response on my right foot.  I might have a bit more sensation today, 3 days later, but the loss of sensation is constant and worrying.  I only noticed it last week at physical therapy.  My question is, what is this new symptom caused by, is my body worsening in some way?\n\n",

Had lots of thyroid bloodwork, MRI you name it.  I've had some problems with human error in my labwork and my insurance is nearly used up. The trigger seems to be heat. Whenever I get slightly hot, due to weather, exercise I get a horrible headache behind my eyes that doesn't go away till I get up the next morning. It gets so bad I sometimes vomit and am useless the rest of the day. It doens't appear to be thyroid, I tested neg for all auto-immune disorders,  My creatnine was high, but I don't remember what other values were off-that one was the most significant. I've not been able to find any patterns except that they are usually caused by heat and always behing my eyes. Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 27 year old female. I have been under a lot of stress lately. I suffer from anxiety. Lately I have been feeling a sharp stabbing pain on the left side of my temple which goes behind my left eye which causes me to close my eye till the pain is gone. The pain will sometimes go to the top left side  of my head, a burning tingling sensation or goes to the back of my head. Sometimes I feel like a nerve or something is about to burst. I wake up at night from the pain. The pain comes on throughout the day. I also tend to clench or grind my teeth at night. My jaws will be sore. I also have a lot of tension & pain on my neck especially the left side.  I do sometimes see little flashes of light or get dizzy.I also have been feeling more tired & weak. My hands sometimes shake, but I do not know if it is just my nerves from all the stress I am under.I have had these pains for the past two weeks.  I do not know if it has anything to do with me getting off my medication propranolol. I was off it for about four days then the headaches came on more frequently. Today the headaches have not been so bad. Although I have been feeling pressure on the bridge of my nose or cheeks sometimes on my forehead.. I used to feel these pains when I my first panic attak. I had my first panic attack about 3 years ago. I was prescribed paxil, but got off thinking I got better. I was off paxil for about a year or so. Recently I have been under a lot of stress from our recent move, new job &  family issues. I went to the doctor & they placed me back on paxil, it made me feel worse. i had to stop at the fire station because I was shaking & was having shortness of breath & chest pains.I think I was having another panic attack. They took my blood pressure it was up to 150. I went too the doctor the next day, he told me to get off the paxil & gave me some propranolol & hydroxyzine.I told him about my headaches. They say it is migrane & stress related.  I tried that for a couple of weeks. I still did not feel any better.I no longer take those medications. I had another attack & went to the hospital & they prescribed clonazepam when needed. I am no loger taking that medication either.  All the doctors say I am suffering from anxiety other than that I am healthy. They did a blood tests, thyroid, urine, and whiteblood tests. Everything was normal. They say my blood pressure is normal. The propranolol was to slow my heart down. I have also gotten my eyes checked. Things from a distance have gotten blurred. My left eye seems to be much worse than my right. The doctor says I will need the glasses when I am driving or at night. I am a frequent vistor to the doctors office. I feel like I am losing my mind.  I have had 2 ekgs done. My heart is fine, but my head still feels worse. I also got into an accident ten years ago. I got hit by a car crossing the street. I have a plate on my left checkbone. They had to take a bone from my skull for my fractured cheekbone on the left. They also had to make the incision on the left side of my face. One of the doctors say my headaches might be caused from my nerves where they had surgery.I also still have my anxiety attacks. Please help. Is it just anxiety?  Am I just suffering from tension, cluster, migranes, or chronic headaches or something more?\n\n",

Yesterday they were not so bad. I notice if I am under a lot of stress they become more severe. Still on my left side they go from my left temple to the the back of my head on the left.I have also started burping constantly. I feel like I am falling apart. If it is not one thing it's another. I wish it will just all go away. Thank you for replying.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 38 years old, Male. During a flight around 5 years ago, I had an very sharp pain when the plane descends, starting from the top of my left eye, shooting up to the top of my head. I had similiar pain on the flight before, but not as excruciating. I am worried that my blood vessels may burst or get stroke because of that and I didn't fly after that. My question is : 1. will my blood vessels burst or will I get stroke because of that? 2. What can be done before the flight to prevent such sharp pain? 3. What are the risks if I do fly again?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Princetonlim,  I suspect that your pain may have been due to occluded sinuses.  The area you are describing is the area of the frontal sinus.  If the opening was blocked, perhaps due to congestion or sinusitis, the air pressure in the sinus would not be able to adapt to the new air pressure.  This can cause tremendous pain.  This phenomenon is essentially the same as what happens when your ears pop during take off and landing.  Using a decongestant medication prior to take off or landing may help to make sure your nasal passages and sinuses are open to reduce the issues with this.  It is unlikely that you would get a stroke from the pressure changes during landing.  It is possible to develop some blood clots during long flights that could potentially cause a stroke if they were able to bypass the lungs some how (such as through a small opening in the heart called a patent foramen ovale) and get to the brain.  To help prevent these clots from forming it is advisable to get up periodically and walk around during long flights.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Not having been to an eye doctor in many years I went and even though I think I can see and read fine the Dr. gave me glasses. Now I use the glasses, esp. for reading, but the headaches have gotten worse. I wake up with the back of both eyes hurting. Advil, Tylenol or Excedrin-migrane don't touch the pain behind my eyes. At the doctors he checked for Glycoma and said everything looked fine.  Is there something else that could be causing this pain. It is not so strong that I can't go on with my daily life most of the time...but it is there constantly and is becoming worse. Who should I go see?

Benadryl (diphenhydramine) is also safe.  Use caution when buying over-the-counter cold medicines because they generally have two, three or more medicines in them.    You can also ask the pharmacist at your local medication store to help find a medicine that is safe for you.  Best wishes.  I hope you feel better soon.\n\n",

Often for nose trauma, as long as the patient is otherwise OK, there isn't much that is done.  If the nose is fractured it generally will heal on its own.  It would be unusual for the fracture to need surgical repair.    It may also be that the swelling is due to the soft tissue injury which can be significant.  This, too, will generally heal without incident.  If she is otherwise OK, it is probably fine to wait to see her regular doctor.  If she has worsening headaches, mental status changes or nosebleeding that won't stop after 10 minutes of direct pressure she should be seen sooner.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It is entirely possible that there is no connection between these varied symptoms so you should check out each problem individually.  It will be helpful to try anti-gas medications that you can get over-the-counter to see if you can get that problem under control.  (Gas-X, simethicone, even Mylanta).  That's an easy thing to try and won't do any harm if it doesn't help.  I wonder if your leg problems that are hard to describe might be restless leg syndrome.  You may find that some regular exercises such as daily walks or jogs might help this.  Your doctor may also be able to prescribe something if this seems to be the case.    Headaches can be caused by a myriad of things from foods eaten, allergies, sinus congestion to stress, inadequate sleep, eye problems and many other triggers in between. You should have this evaluated by a family practice doctor or neurologist.  Be sure to describe all your symptoms when you go in.  Good luck.\n\n",

I'm a computer programmer and have been working with computers and monitors for years without issue, at least until recently.  I use a 19\" monitor (1280x1024 res) at work and my laptop at home is a 17\" widescreen (1900x1200 res).  My eyes have gotten used to my laptop at home I think as I never have problems there but once I get to work, after a while, I get a headache, usually at lunch (when I take a break) and after I leave work.  Is this common and is there a solution to help it other than getting a new monitor with the same resolution at work?

    "content": "Hi LittleBUGer,  Some monitors and some monitor settings are known to produce more eye strain and eye fatigue than others.  It certainly may be that your new settings are causing your  eyes to work harder.  After hours of eye strain, headaches commonly develop.  If you have a human resources department at work they often have people working for them that deal with ergonomic issues to help prevent overuse injuries.    If you are able to modify the settings of your monitor this may also help.  Additionally, it may not be your monitor by itself.  Take a look at the lighting and the rest of the set up at your desk to see if you can arrange things better to minimize eye strain, such as making the monitor eye level, etc.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Bo,  I figured I would post something to your post due to the fact I hate when I ask a question and no one responds as if no one cares.  First of all, do you do a stressful job ?  If you do the things you list sound very similar to tension headaches especially since they are dealing with areas mostly full of muscle.  When tension headaches arise, its mostly because you have super stressed or tensed the muscles in your scalp and other areas and the neck pain sounds very similar to the symptoms as well.  If these things continue though, and you are worried, it never hurts to ask a physician about them.  Is the pain so intense it is unbearable?  If so this is always a good sign to seek help.  I so feel for you as I have had migraines/cluster headaches all my life and sometimes I feel so lost and sad when they come on and nothing works to stop the pain.  I have been through so many surgeries, but I am here to tell you nothing puts you down worse than head pain.  I would rather have the otherside of my colon removed than to experience another headache for the rest of my life.  It would be such a good trade to be honest.  Recently, this year my migraines and cluster headaches have increased and I am at my wits end.  It is so sad to have to have my husband bathe me and put me in bed because I am crying and delirious with sadness from feeling so horrid.  I pray that you can find some relief soon.  And again, don't hesitate to go over this with your physician if you find no relief or if it continues unbearably.  On the days you are feeling most stressed, I would suggest taking tylenol or ibuprofen every time a dose would be due to avoid maybe having the tension build up in those muscles and see if this assist you in anyway.     Best of wishes to you , ~\n\n",

The headaches occur in different places but typically are centered around the temples.  They're rather sharp pains at first then gradually subside into duller pain.

Up until a few weeks ago I'd never experienced anything of this kind, although I have been prone to occasional migraines my whole life.  I'm a 28 year old male, slim build, a former smoker, with a mostly vegetarian diet.  I'm also somewhat high stress, prone to anxiety and depression.

    "content": "Hello all, I am 20 years old and I have been suffering constant, meaning 4-6 days per week for several years and in more recent years constant 24-7 headaches, since at least the age of 13. I have seen several (about 8) doctors all in hopes of solving or diagnosing the problem. I do not respond to painkillers such as acetaminophen, aspirin, or ibuprofen. I currently always have a headache of 3-4 on a 1-10 pain scale and it goes to 8-10 probably twice a week. It is often the case that these worst pain will last overnight and through the next day. The headache is predominantly along the top of my head and more in the front. Any recommendations would be greatly appreciated. Thank you\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Headaches - HELP Please!!!",
    "content": "I have suffered from a chronic headache since mid-January.  My family doctor ordered an MRI with the following results:  Brain volume is normal without midline shift, mass effect or extra-axial fluid collections.  The visualized intracerebral vessels demonstrate normal flow voids.  Single non-specific 3mm white matter hyperintensity is noted on Image 15.  Visualized paranasal sinuses and mastoid air cells are clear.  There is no MR evidence of acute infarct.\"  Daily, I take the following medicines (1 each at night): Crestor 20mg, Lotrel 10/20, Zoloft 100mg, Detrol LA 4mg, and Aygestin 5mg.  A month ago, he prescribed Limbitrol 5mg/12.5 mg to see if that would help rid me of the headache.  Today, in addition to all the meds above, he has asked me to take Topamax 25 mg.  Literally, this headache has not left me since January.  It ranges from mild (2-3 on a scale of 1-10) to extreme (over 10, to the point of wanting to go to the emergency room).  I have kept a diary and there is no dicernable pattern of when the headaches ramp up or down.    My bloodwork, all done within the last month is normal with the following exceptions:  Chloride 114 CO2 20 ALK Phosphatase 49 Iron 54 MCV 101.7 % Lymphocytes 13 % Neutrophils 81   Any thoughts of what to ask my doctor to look for?  He won't provide a referral, but I have scheduled an appointment to see an Internist, but the appointment isn't until the end of August.  Any thoughts, suggestions, would be very much appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Nschmid, I wish I had an opportunity to evaluate you live and in person. The lab results you present are not significantly off, in my experience, to contribute to severe headaches.  If the MRI was negative (as you indicated), then other sources of the problem need to be considered.  I would venture that your primary MD has already considered the medications you are on, and has determined they are not either a contributing factor.  I would like to throw out a thought:  Since these headaches started in Mid-January, and I would assume you have not added any medications to your routine, then I would suggest you consider another source:  Stress.  Have you experienced any increase in life stressors since December?  Has there been any major changes in your personal or business life?  Stress doesn't only have to be negative stress (such as divorce, separation, death of loved ones, job changes, residence changes, etc.) Stress can also be extremely positive ones: getting a great promotion, getting married, getting a new home, etc.  I have a saying:  The body will scream what the mind is unable to vocalize.  A headache is the number one symptom to show up when a person is experiencing abnormal stress.  I suggest your weigh this consideration and see if it may be indeed true for you. If so, then stress-reducing and stress-eliminating strategies are in order.\n\n",

For the past couple of months, my right hand goes completely numb at the fingertips and from the elbow on down when I'm sleeping but it goes away when I change positions. There have been days when I'm so dizzy I can't walk, and all I can do is lay on the bed. Sometimes I have this pressure in my head, and I feel like if there's nothing but smoke inside it. My left eye spasms alot, as well as my left shoulder, forearm and left upper thigh. I've been having alot of flem, and the left side of my throat swollen and hurts if I press on it. I've been  sneezing constantly, but I have no allergies. I had this sneezing episode last year as well, and the doctor kept on saying they were allergies, so she gave me medication that didn't help at all. I also have some ringing in my left ear, and I've missed my period for two months already. My body aches all over, and I've quit smoking for two weeks seeing as if that might be the problem, but it's just made the headache pressure worse. Both my parents have diabetes and high blood pressure, my dad has asthma as well. Any ideas on what this could be?\n\n",

This past week, I have been having dizzy spells, which now occur in the morning before I rise....If I turn prior to getting out of bed....my vision is greatly disturbed for several seconds.  I don't awake with a headache but sometimes during the course of the day a headache develops.  I am currently residing in Florida and have been diagnoised with sinus's - which with all my travels (prior Military) I have never suffered before.  While sitting during the day I experience vision blurs.  If i turn my head to either the left or the right towards my shoulders the vision blurs are ever present.  I have been taking Excedrin for Migraines to help with my headaches prior to this and have continued the use even now.  I haven't taken anything today (Excedrin).  My doctor continues to tell me I have some sinus issues.  Pls help. There is no history in my family, nor have I had any surgeries other than birth ones.

Recently, to help with daily chronic headaches, my doctor prescribed 10 mg of Amitriptyline HCL once a day before bed.  It has helped the headaches VERY much.  However, for the past couple of weeks I have been seeing eye \"floaters\" or spots.  The only other medication I am on is Birth Control. Could these \"floaters\" be a side effect of the medication or is it something more serious?  Thank you!\n\n",

If he has not had one, I would recommend a lumbar puncture to measure the pressure of the spinal fluid (called opening pressure).  If it is elevated this would be consistent with a condition called pseudotumor cerebri.    Pseudotumor can cause tremendous headaches and would not show up on an MRI.  Beyond this, I can't think of much else.  Sometimes it is helpful to keep a headache diary tracking when the headaches occur and what was going on during the time preceding it (what foods were eaten, etc.) to see if there are any triggers that can be avoided.

    "content": "Hi,I am 28yrs old and was diagnosed with rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia 3 years ago.I had bilateral functional endoscopic sinus surgery about 3 wks ago as I was having recurrent sinus infections. 2 wks ago I experienced earaches and said to my ent specialist who said my ears were fine and maybe was my jaw joint.About 4/5 days ago I started to experience a strange pain on right side at back of my head.It gets worse when I move my head back and usually at its worst in the morning,can last for a good few hours and can occur again during the day or evening..Could this be something to do with my sinuses or something else? Should I see a dr.about it? Would appreciate any help or advice,thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Julie,  I hope you have an appointment with your neurologist soon so you can get definitive answers to your questions.  I am sure your regular doctor is not giving you a diagnosis since the results of the MRI really need to be reviewed by a neurologist who can diagnose the problem. Since internet discussion of disease processes are limited, diagnosis of specific problems with serious tones such as you relay, really needs to be done face to face with a specialist. If the results of the MRI are accurate, further differentiating tests may be necessary.  One of the demylenating diseases is MS (multiple sclerosis), and there are treatment options available, and support groups available all over the country. There are diagnostic tests that can either correlate or refute these findings, and the neurologist would be the best one to make the determination which to order for you.  Then, once the root cause is identified, the best treatment plan can be put into place.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Irene, You did not mention how long ago you bumped your head.  I would gather fairly recently from your post.  You also did not mention if you were knocked out when you hit your head, or if you experienced any loss of vision.  I would guess maybe not, so what I will tell you is based on assuming you were not knocked out.  Soft tissue injury anywhere on the body causes the body to swell as a protective mechanism, and it can take a long time - several days even a week or so for the swelling/bruising  to go down.  Did  you try an ice pack? At this phase, a warm compress may actually help better by increasing circulation to the area and allowing the body to reabsorb the swelling.  If you are experiencing any dizziness, or increasing pain it is strongly advisable that you go to the emergency room if you do not have a primary care physician to get it checked out.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dan: There could be several reasons for having a headache that doesnt seem to go away and tension is certainly one of them.  One of the reasons most common for forehead types of headaches is sinus infection.  If you press your fingers on the eyebrow area and also just under the eyes next to your nose, is it tender and painful? These are where your sinuses are and an infection in them can cause a long lasting headache.  You certainly do need to see a doctor to evaluate whether it is a sinus infection or something a little more serious.  Tension headaches while they can be along the forehead tend more to be on the sides of the forehead at the temple area and stretch to the back of the head and into the neck where there is a lot of muscle tension contributing to the headache.  A good evaluation by your doctor should be able to determine what is causing your headaches and give you some treatment to relieve them. Best wishes, Carolyn LPN\n\n",

Using nasal sprays with a sinus infection can in fact spread the infection further so I would not use them till the infection has cleared.  Warm packs though across the forehead can ease some of the congestion that develops from the infection.  But, you need to be treated by a physician for the infection. Best wishes, Carolyn LPN\n\n",

First of all you need to find out what type of infection you have, whether fungal or bacterial. That requires a swabbing or flush of the sinus to procure washings to culture.  Then only the correct antibiotic or anti-fungal that works with your particular infection will clear it up.  You can actually have both fungal and bacterial infection at work here.

    "content": "Headaches that are worse with standing are suspicious for \"spinal\" headaches.  A simplistic view of this is that there is not enough spinal fluid to adequately float the brain so that when one stands the brain is not properly supported.  This causes the brain to pull down on its attachments and causes a tremendous headache.  It is relieved some by being in a position that takes pressure off the brain such as being flat.  Usually this type of headache occurs after a procedure such as an epidural where a small hole is created in the epidural space that can allow spinal fluid to leak out.  In this situation, if nothing is done the headache will usually resolve in 2-3 weeks.  3 years is almost unheard of for this situation.  If, by chance, you have a chronic CSF (cerebrospinal fluid) leak that is not healing you could have this type of headache.  I am not aware of such a condition; however, it is theoretically possible.  Sometimes theories don't translate into reality well, though.  I would recommend you see a neurologist or possibly a neurosurgeon to see if any testing can be done on your CSF pressures or to look for a CSF leak  Best wishes.\n\n",

There is no history of migraine headaches in my family, however I started getting them since I started taking birth control when I was 18. I just started taking Verapamil and Midrin as prescribed by my neurologist.  Here is my question: The other day I woke up with a migraine and took an Imitrex (previously prescribed) at 8am. It worked and I went about my day at work. Around 12:30pm, I began feeling dizzy and nauseated. I layed down and then began getting muscle spasms in my face and buttocks. I became very weak and couldn't barely talk or move my hands or feet. I then began getting  chills and my blood pressure started to become high 158/106 (usually run 90/60) Pupils became fully dialated. They took me to the hospital via ambulance. The hospital ran CT scans, MRI's, bloodwork, and everything came back ok. They diagnosed me as having a migraine, however I did not have a headache at the time of the incident or after. After this whole episode, I felt exhausted. Do you think it may have been a migraine with the symptoms I had and no headache, or could this be some type of Stroke symptoms. My neurologist is sending me for tests for Stroke. I'm not sure.    Thanks!\n\n",

Subsequently, in response to the low blood pressure you likely had a catecholamine surge (the same hormones involved in the fight or flight response).  This would cause your heart to race, your BP to go up and your eyes to dilate.  It is common after such an event to feel tired.  It is also possible that you were experiencing some side effects of the Imitrex.  Imitrex is known to cause nausea/dizziness as well as high blood pressure.

These can cause dizziness or feelings of being off balance (dysequillibrium) as well as head pain.  You may also have an inner ear infection although these tend to be severe and cause the room to spin (vertigo), nausea and headaches.  Another possibility is an otolyth or small stone that is lodged in the motion detecting parts of your ear.  This typically will cause vertigo more than a headache.  You may wish to see a neurologist for an evaluation.  They can recommend any specialized testing that you may need and hopefully get you on a treatment to relieve your symptoms.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The pain has lasted no more than 20 - 30 seconds at a time. My scalp feels very tingly/prickly & for the first two days even the hair folicles were extremly painful if touched. Now on the 3rd day I have not had the sharp pain (head is still a little sensative) but the left side of my face (from under the eye to the bottom of the cheek bone), from the outside of the left nostral to the outer cheek bone has felt numb, but is ok to the touch.  I thought at first it might be shingles but there is no rash & it is not itchy.   thank you for your reply\n\n",

    "content": "The areas you are describing are innervated by different nerves.  The scalp is mostly a spinal nerve in the c1-c2 area.  The face sensation is provided by the 2nd branch of the 5th cranial nerve in the area you are experiencing numbness.  It is possible that you had some irritation of your scalp from brushing your hair or possibly pulling it too tight.  It is also possible that you had a little pressure on the nerve somewhere along its course causing your pain.   It is difficult to tie this to your facial symptoms.  The best way I can think of is that you may have had a viral infection causing your initial symptoms that now is producing a post-infectious syndrome.  Occasionally post-viral syndromes can include neurological finding such as you are describing.  I would suggest that you be seen by your doctor to get a full neurological exam and look for any other more subtle involvement of the nervous system.  This may help in providing a diagnosis.  You may need a referral to a neurologist if your symptoms don't improve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 34 year-old female with a history of intense migraines.  Over a week ago, I got a headache that has since not went away.  It is not a migraine, but it doesn't quite fit a tension headache either (no vice-like pressure or feeling of a band around my head).  I have a constant pain across my forehead only, intensity varies throught the day.  It is not a stabbing, sharp pain like my migraines, but rather a steady ache.  When the intensity increases, it is difficult for me to concentrate,think clearly, and I even jumble my words when speaking.  I am becoming increasingly more sensitive to light (but not sound), and my neck often feels tense and sore.  My Dr put me on Fioricet, which gave me no relief, as did no OTC medications or Vicodin/Percoset.  It is not a rebound as I do not take a lot of meds back to back.  It it a tension headache, or something else?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Syeera, I commend your efforts to remain unencumbered by medicinal interventions by not taking medicines back to back.  I also feel for your having to battle ongoing headache issues for so long.  I would suggest you explore some non medicinal interventions for this current headache.  If this pain does not fit the profile you are used to with your ongoing migraines, and the traditional pain relievers are not touching it, it may be worthwhile exploring other options. I believe you may be correct in feeling this may be a tension headache, and if so, the more you are concerned about it the longer it will linger and plague you.  Have you explored massage therapy?  There are excellent LMT's (licensed massage therapists) who have been specially trained to address tension pain, you may wish to contact a local school to find one, or even ask your primary physician if he/she knows one they would refer you to.  You may also wish to seek evaluation by a DO (Dr. of Osteopathy) or a chiropractic physician, who may be able to assist you with this current problem, due to their holistic approach to healthcare.\n\n",

    "content": "My boyfriend had a weird headache experience today...he awoke feeling all right, but within an hour he had excruciating pain behind his right eye, and was vomiting.  The nausea subsided after a few hours, but the pain continued all day.  Because I have chronic, classic migraines, I was interested to discover that he seemed to have no sensitivity to light or noise, like I always do,  and the pain was not pulsative, but steady.  Migraines always throb, because they are vein-related, right?  I did some research about cluster headaches, and it wasn't like one of those, either, since there was no tearing of the eye, and clusters don't seem to come with nausea.  Any insight would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "There are a few possibilities.  Most likely, your boyfriend actually did have a variant of a migraine.  Commonly migraines are as you describe with the pounding head pain, sensitivity to light/noise, etc.  However, they can occur without these things.    He may also have an inner ear infection.  In this case, dizziness is also often occuring.  It is also possible that a nerve along that area (possibly from the sinuses) became inflamed causing the pain.  I think this is less likely given the progression of his symptoms.  When one has a sudden headache with vomiting, increased intracranial pressure must be considered.  A CT scan may be needed.  If there is any concern that this is not a typical headache (i.e. the pain is getting worse, the vomiting continues, any new symptoms develop) I would recommend that he be seen right away.  If your boyfriends headache does not get better or if anything else concerning develops I would strongly recommend that he be seen by a doctor.  Along with being able to do a thorough neurological exam and make a proper diagnosis, his doctor can likely give him some medication to help stop the headache.  Best wishes.\n\n",

They aren't powerful, just rather dull pain at the top of my forehead. I'm not quite sure how long this has been going on, but at least a week.  I also get headachelike pain when I bend down or kneel...I guess this has to do with blood rushing to the head, though I don't know why this is happening.   Stresswise, I just applied to college as a transfer student, but I normally don't get stress-related headaches. I don't have any coldlike symptoms like nasal blockage.   I'm getting concerned that this could be serious. Why is this happening?\n\n",

I am now also getting sharp headaches and have noticed that on one side of my face I have a small blotchy area.

I usually get sinusitis once a year, around this time of year, so I'm wondering if it could be a strange form of this, or whether you have come across this before and it's something else, as my doctor seems to be at a loss as to what to do next.\n\n",

If you are currently or recently ill your lymph nodes may be swollen due to the infection.  Beyond lymph nodes, I really can't think of much that would produce lumps on the head.  Your doctor may wish to do some imaging studies such as a CT or MRI scan to get a better look at what the lumps are and where they are coming from.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The Nausea and Flu sometimes go away but the headache remains daily all day including when I wake up, About 20-25 days ago I went to the ER for serious stomach pains and had blood/urine tests and was x-rayed and was diaganosed with a stomach ulcer, surprisingly the stomach pain went away 2 - 3 days later and hasn't returned. I went to my doctor about 10 days ago regarding the head and neck ache and was told it was just a muscle problem and was perscribed Anti inflammatories and Muscle relaxents, they did not provide any sort of relief. Today I was feeling pretty good, not feeling sick at all, but when I got out of the shower later in the day I started feeling horrible and the headache came back, I thought having a hot shower was supposed to relieve headaches and muscle pain.. not make it worse, I was just curious to your opinion and suggestions, thanks.  I am 18 years of age, male and have had no past surgeries  Also headaches havn't been a problem to the rest of my family  P.S I spend alot of time on my computer and sitting in a chair.\n\n",

    "content": "I have a few possible ideas for you.  You mention you sit at the computer for long periods of time.  This alone can cause headaches and neck pain.  Be sure to take frequent breaks.  Do some neck stretches while working.  Try to sit with good posture.  Make sure your chair is adjusted properly.  You may be able to elevate your monitor some so that it is at eye level and you don't have to look down.  Another possibility is a migraine headache.  It would be a little unusual for a migraine to last for a month, however.  With a headache and neck pain, one must consider meningitis.  This, too, is pretty unlikely given that it has been going on for a month.  Meningitis typically will make you very sick or gets better after several days (neither of which, it seems, apply in your case).  I would be most suspicious of your symptoms being caused by chronic muscle tightness in your neck from your computer.    If your headaches do not improve I recommend you see your doctor for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "45 year old female, diagnosed 2 years ago after a fall with cervical ddd with minor stenosis and mild to moderate spondolitic changes (also found I had OA in both hips), history of migraines in high school (oh so long ago :o) ) and neck injury that was never treated (most likely the instigating factor in the ddd now), no past surgeries for the neck issues but about 6 months of physical therapy which helped at the time. For the last few months I have been having more and more trouble with my neck sticking then letting loose with a pop. It always hurts to some degree but it can be extremely painful and set off what my physical therapist said she thought were occipital headaches (i.e. pain at the base of the skull running over the top of my head and down into my neck as well as pain in my jaw and deep inside my ears, behind my eyes, around my cheek bones and the front of my face and forehead like a sinus infection...sometimes, when they are really bad I even have light and sound sensativity and nausea/dizziness like with the migraines I used to get). My question is, and I realize you can't tell for sure without MRI's or x-rays, could the discs in my neck slipping over each other cause my neck to stick and pop in turn irritating the nerves, etc. or is it more likely that I have something floating around in there that is causing the problems...like a peice of bone from a bone spur that's broken off? Any info I can get on occipital headaches and issues that could be causing my symptoms would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for your time :o)\n\n",

It does not sound like you are having cluster headaches.  You may be experiencing inflammation of your galeal aponeurosis.  This is the band that connects the muscle of your forehead with the muscle of the back part of your head.  (This is the muscle system that allows you to raise your eyebrows.)

    "content": "Hi I am a 21yo F and for almost 3 months now I have been having these pains that are in the left side of my head and sometimes the right they are kind of stabbing and they move around but mainly are in one location. I also have  tight pain above both eyes in the eyebrow region with pain raidiating from the base of my neck into my head. Also been having dizziness/lightneadness for 3 mothns. I went to the ER and  i had had a CT scan w/o contrast of my head and it came up negative and had a MRI of neck and they gave me a diagnosis of a bulgded disc with cervical radiclopathy. I was wondering could there still be something that the CT missed. Also if this diagnosis would be causing the symptoms I am having. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "You may be experiencing migraine headaches, cluster headaches or even severe tension headaches.  Certainly a bulging disk can cause a headache but this is much less common than other symptoms related to this.  Often, with a bulging disk one will get shooting pains down the arms or other areas depending on which disk is the problem.  Keeping a headache diary can be helpful.  Record what time the headache started during the day, anything you were doing before hand, any food/drink you had in the recent time period, etc.  Occasionally this can reveal triggers to your headaches that can then be avoided.  This information can also be helpful to your doctor in diagnosing the problem.  If you do have migraines and are experincing these attacks somewhat frequently, you may be able to take a daily medication to help prefent the headaches from occuring.  I would recommend that you discuss your symptoms with your doctor.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Headaches w/burning sensations",
    "content": "I am a 38 year old female with no headache history, but have low immune system and known for having chronic infections. On Feb 2, 2007 I had a horrible sharp pain and burning sensation shoot up the left side of my neck and head right behind my left ear. My head was extremely sensative to the touch as if someone had slammed me in the head with a hammer or something and bruised my head. This was extremely painful and brought tears to my eyes and I was going to go to the ER, but then the pain went away. It only lasted about 5 minutes and I was completely fine afterwards.   Three days later on the 5th, I developed these horrible headaches that I haven't been able to get rid of yet. Two days after that on the 7th, I developed a sore throat and sore neck, no coughing, no sinus drainage or anything else. When I developed those symptoms, I just automatically assumed the headaches were probably just part of that. However, my other  symptoms went away, but the headaches have continued. It has now been one month and 2 days.   The headache is a constant headache and it is not one sided, it bilateral, on the back of my head, the crown and forehead. It feels like something is squeezing my head really tight. There are times when I have burning sensations (not tingling, actual burning sensations) that accompany the sharp pains that I also get along with the constant pressure. I also have eye pain, but NO visual changes. Lights, sounds and smells do not bother me at all. No nausea, no vomiting, no other pain in neck or shoulders. These headaches were also waking me up out of a dead sleep in the middle of the night. I went to see my doctor finally on Feb 20th. All my bloodwork came back fine. He put me on Mobic and Butalbital-Apap-Caff which didn't help with the headaches at all.   I went back to see my doctor on March 1st because the burning sensations were starting to move into my face around my eyes and in my forehead. My blood pressure was up this time, it was 129/90 which is a little high, but he wasn't concerned about that because it was normal on the 20th when I was in his office. He said it wouldn't be uncommon for it to be elevated a little with me having such a bad headache. At this point, he took me off the other meds and now has started me out on 25mgs of Topomax and I had a MRI done. The MRI came back normal with the  exception of a small spot the size of the end of pin point in the white matter of my brain which the nurse said the radiologists didn't think it was anything to be alarmed about. I was told it could be from the onstart of possible migraines or possibly a dust particle on the film.    However, I have always understood that patients with migraines can't tolerate light or sound and none of those bother me, nor is my headache more one sided, nor do I have nausea or vomiting. Also, would a migraine last 24/7 for over a month?  Yesterday, I started having pain in my ears and the same burning sensations that I have had all over my head and in my eyes. My PCP said I may need to go see a neurologist at some point if the headaches continue, but now I am having the ear pain. So, does this sound more like something I would need to see a neurologist about or an ENT specialist?  I would also like to mention that I had abdominal surgery for a recurrent inguinal hernia back on July 24, 2006. I had a lot of post op swelling that caused the swelling to go over into my left thigh and put pressure on my sciatic nerve. I had to have a CT aspiration done in August to remove all of the fluid, but due the pressure that was put on the nerve in my leg. It irritated the nerve in my left leg leaving it numb from my inner thigh down to my knee with intermittent burning sensations. I'm still having problems with this, but surgeon assures me this will get better in time. Is it possible that this could all somehow be connected with the nerves?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Kimi,  Headaches has so many causes starting from brain tumours going through hypertension, sinus problems, ear problems, eye problems, neck problems, tooth problems and ending with stress.  Your doctor ruled out the most feared and the most dangerous.  i think the next step would be to see an ent specialist and may be an optometrist to make sure that your ears, sinuses and eyes are not the cause behind your headaches.  If check out fine and you still have the headache, i would strongly recommend that you see a neurologist because this might caused by conditions such as trigeminal neuralgia and need expert opinion for treatment.  If you are under a lot of stress, this could be the cause behind the headache as well.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.

    "content": "I have a male friend, 43 years old.  For the past several months he has been having a problem with lightheadedness, occasional numbness on the left side of his head, tingling and a \"pinching\" sensation in his extremities.  The more marked symptom he has been experiencing, is an increased production of a foamy, yellowish saliva.  He sometimes has periods of mild confusion.  He has always been a runner, uses no drugs, very little alcohol consumption, healthy eater, has good physical relationship with wife, no history of mental disorders.  Is there a possibility that some type of reaction to an allergen or toxic substance would produce these symptoms?  There is no set pattern to the onset of symptoms, and there has been nothing specific which seems to alleviate them.  He has been experiencing these symptoms for the past several months and is becoming very frustrated at not knowing what the problem is and how to cure it.  Any help would be greatly appreciated.

    "content": "Dear jsabella, It would be better if you can give us more details about the pattern of headache he has, is it unilateral or starts as being in one side probably the same left side where there is numbness. Did he notice that this headache increase after stress, physical effort, some types of food etc. Is their any family history of migraine or another neurological disorders, diabetes mellitus? Did he check for Diabetes mellitus? Anyways, these symptoms can be part of migraine headache. Migraine is more than just a headache there is two types of migraine, classic one the headache is preceded by an aura of 15-60 minutes which normally occur before the headache begins; most commonly visual disturbances including blind spots, flashing lights; confusion, inability to concentrate, problems with articulation or co-ordination, or tingling, pins and needles or numbness on the affected side. The other form is common migraine that lacks this aura. Patients suffering from migraine  may complaint of some of these symptoms ( intense throbbing headache, often on one side of the head only,  nausea and/or vomiting and/or diarrhoea , increased sensitivity to light , increased sensitivity to sounds , and or increased sensitivity to smells ).  They may also experience stiffness of the neck and shoulders, tingling or stiffness in the limbs, an inability to concentrate, difficulty in speaking, or in rare cases paralysis or loss of consciousness. Although headache is the most obvious event during a migraine some patients start to feel \"strange\" a day or so before the attack begins. These strange feelings, known as the prodrome, are the first signs of the attack and can include cravings for certain foods, excitability, hyperactivity, tiredness, yawning or a change of mood. The causes and mechanisms of migraine are still under research however it is believed to be due to release of neurotransmitter called serotonin in the body. Many factors can trigger attacks in susceptible people: stress or sometimes the relief of stres, overtiredness (physical or mental), Extreme emotions (e.g. anger, grief), toothache or pain in the eyes, sinuses or neck, anxiety/Depression, sexual arousal. Regarding the frothy yellow saliva, it might be part of the condition with increases vagal tone during the attack or he might have another dental or mouth infection. Now what he should do, migraine is a complex and individual condition and it is important to persevere until we find the right treatment or combination of treatments and/or diet/lifestyle changes, which work, for each one. Your friend should visit a neurologist for full clinical assesment including full history, examination and investigations. This is the only way to find out the right diagnosis and to prescribe him the proper treatment since his complaints are not typical. Hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi SM, Thank you for your response.  I may have miscommunicated something.  He does not have a problem with headaches, it is occasional numbness on the left side of his head and lightheadedness, sometimes accompanied by mild confusion.  The saliva is not constant, it is periodic, without any set pattern.  On what he considers a \"good\" day, his saliva is clear and not excessive.  On \"bad\" days it is foamy, has a yellowish tint to it and is produced to such an extent that he often packs cotton into his cheeks to absorb it, changing it every five minutes.  One thing I did not mention before is that he said his teeth have a kind of \"silky\" feel to them when this saliva is present.  We have tried eliminating certain things from his diet for several days at a time, but nothing seems to stand out yet as a cause of these problems.  Diabetes has already been ruled out. Is there some type of toxin that may cause these symptoms?  How about any kind of bite?(although he does not remember being bitten).  It is very frustrating as there is no set pattern to these bouts.  This is a man who has always been sharp and mentally alert, now, there are times when he has difficulty following along during business meetings at a flourishing business he established fourteen years ago.   Please, anyone,  offer any suggestions no matter how outlandish they may seem.  Thank you so much and God bless you.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear jsa,  Saliva is produced by both the major and minor salivary glands. There are three pairs of major salivary glands: the parotid, submandibular, and sublingual glands. These glands produce approximately 1.5 liters of saliva daily: 70% is from the submandibular glands, 25% is from the parotid glands, and 5% is from the sublingual glands. The secretory innervation of the salivary glands is primarily under the control of the parasympathetic nervous system.   True hypersecretion is seen in response to local irritation e.g. stomatitis (inflammatory disease of the oral mucus membranes), gingivitis (inflammation of the gums), dental disease, and in side effects to tranquilizers and anticonvulsants. Indirect causes, such as nasal obstruction, poor positioning lead to sialorrhea because of chronic mouth breathing or open mouth posture. Also some metabolic disorders and chemical or insect stings.  I could not understand well the silky sensation he gets. However, a metal taste some patients experience means an acidic saliva which is common with mostly kidney and gall stones, and tooth decay. A lso all degenerative diseases , including cancer, heart disease, arthritis, osteoporosis are associated with excess acidity in the body.  The pattern of fluctuation you have described goes more with local cause like dental problems or any sort of mouth infection that became chronic.  Thorough dental and medical evaluations including complete history and investigations are important to determine the causes of hypersalivation. Treatment includes control of the cause and prescribtion of specificdrugs that control secretion of the salivary glands.  With my best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi.  I am a 28yr old male from Cape Town South Africa and have had a problem with hypersalivation over the last 15 yrs or so.   This condition affects my work life, social life and life in general and is really very frustrating.  I have approached my gp on the matter but so far, no solution has been found.   I am healthy, eat well and exercise fairly regularly.  My dentist has even pointed out that this is a sign of good health but I feel there is definitely some underlying cause.  Usually, I get a silky feeling in my mouth and at times the saliva is very thick or very thin and seems to run profusely at different times during the day.  Subsequently, my speech is impaired, I have to swallow more often which has become uncomfortable and I suffer from great anxiety.   This problem occurs in a resting state and seems to be worse some time after exercising.   There is pattern I've noticed in which during one week of the year, normally in January, all symptoms disappear and I notice no problems, my speech is clear  and I don't have to force my words.  After a week the problems slowly re-appear and the anxiety returns.   I've heard of surgery techniques that can reduce the saliva flow by blocking certain ducts or repositioning them, I wouldn't know if this is an option.   I would be very grateful for any feedback on the problem and just hope I have listed enough information.    Oliver\n\n",

    "content": "Jessica718:  Good evening, dear.  I'm sorry you're not well.  Have you told your parents about this?  If not, is there a particular reason?  To sort this out, let's first think about the infected ear lobe.  Just under the ear are some lymph nodes, called the anterior cervical chain.  If you have any \"bumps\" along that area of your neck, then you are on your way to a serious infection that requires a physical examination by a physician.  You also mentioned hurting all over and being tired all the time.  An infection of the ear lobe can result in systemic (body-wide) infection that can be very serious.  Since you mentioned dizziness, I have to wonder if that's what is going on.  There is another condition that could explain your symptoms.  You did think you might have depression.  Your symptoms do suggest anxiety, which goes hand-in-hand with depression.  Some patients have difficulty distinguishing between feelings of depression and anxiety.  Symptoms of depression include:  1.  depressed mood 2.  loss of interest in activities of daily living and previously enjoyable activities 3.  marked change in appetite 4.  marked change in sleep pattern 5.  feelings of guilt that are in excess for the situation 6.  distractibility 7.  low energy 8.  feelings of hopelessness/worthlessness 9  recurrent morbid thoughts (feelings of wanting to be dead) or suicidal thoughts (feeling like actually killing yourself)  If you have any thoughts of killing yourself or recurrent morbid thoughts, you must tell your parents immediately, or simply call 911 or go to the emergency room immediately.  Otherwise, proceed as follows.  You should definitely be seen by your doctor to take care of the infected earlobe, and while you're there, make sure you mention any and all symptoms of depression and anxiety that you have.  Get well, and come back to let us know how you're doing.\n\n",

    "content": "Jessica718:  You really do need to go to your physician to talk about the infection that you may have.  An infection left to \"stew\" can become life-threatening.  You may need an antibiotic which is a medicine that kills bacteria, which cause such infections.  They need only be taken for a limited period of time, such as 10 days.  I would still urge you to also tell your doctor about your symptoms of depression.  You don't necessarily need to take an antidepressant to get help; psychotherapy alone helps many people.  Your doctor may be able to refer you to a counselor.  Good luck.\n\n",

Doesn't like meds, no smoking, no drinking, etc.  No fam history of migraines or headaches. Paternal and maternal cancers. Previous history of serious anorexia (for several years as adolescent...)  Currently:  Has had a headache every day since the end of Oct.  It occurred on Oct 27th (no reason, no trauma).  She awoke to a terrible headache with severe nausea and general unwell feeling.  Ibuprofen didn't help.  She has awoken to the headache every day since then, except one morning but headache came later that day.  It is worse in the morning, pounding, eases off through the day (sometimes goes away completely for periods of time), comes back at night and various times through day.  Pounds in her temples, stretches across front of her head.  Not tight, more pounding when at its worst.  As it dies away, it becomes a dull ache.  She has nausea, decreased appetite when the headache is on. Tingling in face (both sides, across top of head). Pain meds don't help. She tried some off and on but they didn't seem to help so she doesn't bother.  Has had what she thinks of as migraines years ago but says this is completely unlike any previous headache and is unrelentless.  Her spirit is broken, she cannot handle it anymore.    Went to a neurologist today.  NO bedside manner.  Completely condescending, had her in a box before she opened her mouth.  Read her description on previsit paperwork and had her pegged as rebound headaches.  Told him she doesn't take many meds, but he insists that must be it.    Went to ER this weekend b/c she had blurred vision with one of the headaches.  Blurred vision lasted all day, and she had swelling on her eyelids (which has seemed to have mostly gone away now).  She had a D&C last week (abnormal bleeding for 6 months) and we thought blurred vision was perhaps from Anesthesia as it occured the next day?  Went to ER, they did CT which showed nothing.  Gave her twice her body weight's worth of Toradol.  30mg IV, she's 110lbs with clothes on.  Bad reaction... scared her.  Gave it before CT.  I've read that Toradol before CT can skew results?  Now contsant burning in stomach, aggravated by foods since ER visit.  Headache was relieved to dull ache with Toradol but was back with vengeance by the time we got home from ER.  She had been on 800mg Ibuprofen 3x day for last few days after D&C and that didn't even touch the headache.  Anyway, this Neurologist didn't even ask her to describe her headache or what may be different about it than normal, what concerns her, etc.  Gave her rx for ??  something for migraine w/rebound headaches and sent her away.    Is it possible that that's all it is?  She's frightened and so am I.  Would have felt much more comfortable if he had done MRI or MRA.  What if???   Gulp.  Any advice?  -Emma\n\n",

My last thought to my problems is seeing if i have a food allergie is my problem. so maybe for your headaches it could be a food allergie. its a suggestion. if you find some type of solution please post to let me know i would love to find one for my problem good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   It would be more helpful if you can inform us more about the characters of this swelling like size, associated scalp infection, history of recent trauma etc.   This swelling could be : - Folliculitis, it is an infection of the hair follicles. Forming small, white-headed Bumps in hair follicles (roots).  Lesions may be Itching. Superficial folliculitis resolves spontaneously in a few days, while deep or recurring folliculitis should be medically treated.   - Seborrheic dermatitis, which occurs where the skin is oily or greasy like the scalp. Secondary bacterial infections may occur forming swellings that need antibiotic local treatment.  - An enlarged lymph node as reactionary to infection in the area drained by them like scalp infections or lesions.  Most of the lesions are soft to firm , may be painful and tender.  - A traumatic lesion which may pass unnoticed. The swelling is felt as hard but pain and tenderness may be present.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "My husband (male, 49 years old) has a severe headache at his left temple. These come and go but occur everyday, most times twice a day and has been going on for 4 weeks. These headaches last anywhere from 1 to 3 hours.  ER doctor did a CT scan thinking it was sinutitus. Primary physician has ruled out Sinus and Migrane and is sending him to a Nuerologist, can't get in till end of next week. The pain is bad. Musinex D does not relieve the pain. He was prescribed Hydrocodone 5mg/500mg - 1 tablet 6 hours. This does not help. 2 tablets does get him some sleep, but he won't take two (except once). He had graves disease 8 years ago and had surgery to put his eyes back in the sockets, and now has plates and screws in the eye area. The headaches include a pin pricking sensation followed by a feeling of someone pounding the pins in, a buring sensation accompanies and then just horrific pain. Always at the left side temple.  He takes levoxal - 1 daily.  He has had normal headaches over the years but nothing like this ever.  Any help to releive the pain or suggestions as to cause is greatly appreciated.  Thank you, Tena\n\n",

What he needs is to be examined by a neurologist. Examination may yield more information as to the cause of headache.  The sensory symptoms he is complaining of could be aura of a classic migraine. Why did his doctor exclude migraine?  Best regards,\n\n",

The nuerologist believes that my husband has Trigeminal Nuralgia and has prescribed Lurika, once daily for 1 week and then twice daily for a week and we return for our second visit on the 22nd of January. I have read on the web, more about Trigeminal Nuralgia and it does not show any real cure or cause. The nuerologist said that the CT Scan does not show any tumor or anuerism, good news, but called the illness idiopathic. I don't know if he will be on this medicine for life or only when the headaches occur. My husband had 3 really good days with only twinges of the pain. I really can't call them headaches but it is real pain.  Thank you for responding, I appreciate your input now and in the future. I will update again after our next visit. Who knows, perhaps this information will help someone else.  Tena...\n\n",

    "title": "Frustrating headaches...",
    "content": "Hi, I am a 26 year old female and I am suffering from sporadic but painful headaches. The pain is located on the right side of my head, behind and above my ear.  It starts suddenly and it can last for hours.  It isn't debilitating in so much as I can function at work, but it is really painful and distracting. I thought that it might be a migrane, but I have no nausea or sensitivity to light or sounds.  When I touch the area that I have pain, it hurts almost like it is bruised.  Pushing really hard on the area also tempoairily relieves the pain for some strange reason. Taking advil sometimes helps and I have visited a doctor who reccomended massage.  She had also reccomended a CT scan, but I had one over the summer on an unrelated matter and it was clear. I'm beginning to worry, however, because I had initally thought the headaches were a result of working at a computer, but they have been gone for over a month now and are suddenly back.  I have also had blurred vision for about 2 weeks.  I've recently gone to my eye doctor, but he is convinced that my previous perscription was too strong and that is why I had headaches/burred vision but my perscription is fine now and i'm still getting the headaches. I don't have any family history of tumors or migranes or anything.  We do have stroke and other cancers in our family.  It may also be worth noting that I get sinus pressure sometimes and it almost feels like going up in a plane, that kind of sensation. Should I push to have an MRI done?   A family friend (optamologist) had suggest occipital neuralgia, but i have no pain around my eye.  I do have slight scoliosis (sp) and some issues with tingling around my upper spine. I'd appreciate any advice you could give me. Thank You.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many causes of chronic headache. It could be a manifestation of an elevated blood pressure, neck problems, eye problems, ear problems or sinus problems.  Sinus headache is usually worse in the morning and on bending over. It may feels like a painful fullness. The area over the sinus is usually tender. If present it may show on the CT scan.  There are two types of migraine classic and common types. Common migraine has all the characteristics of a migraine but lacks the aura. It is important to differentiate common migraine from another form of headache called common tension headache.  Tension headache is diffuse, steady with band-like distribution and occurs mainly in the evening.  I hope this may have helped.\n\n",

I didn't go to the doctor, but I did have confusion and nausau and extreme dizziness. These symptoms and Headaches lasted about a week and a half. It has been a few days short of a month since my accident and I still have a bump the size of a marble that is tender and doesn't seem to be minimizing. I thought otherwise I was fine until today I participated in intense exercise. I have always been an athlete and exercise has never been a problem I was a hair short of fainting today, experiencing nauseau and dizziness. Is it likely this is due to my supposed concussion? Do I need to seek medical attention or will this fade away?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  My dad's been having a terrible headache for quite a while now. some of the symptoms are pain in areas around the eye bones & the cheek bones. The back of his head (sometimes full back side) or sometimes the right/left side. There is a redness in one of the eyes, with a dropping eyelid. The pain starts to occur in from 2 to 3 hours after he falls asleep. severe, stabbing pain centers around one eye I forgot to mention that too. He was diagnosed by more than one doctor, they said its nothing serious (Thankgod) with the brain part, its sinus symptoms. Do you have any suggestions on how to treat this or atleast minimize the pain cause I really feel helpless although I try making him relax from time to time; Somethings like herbs, or something to drink . . . Its cold where we live, plus he smokes. (Just added it if it may help).  I'm really greatful in advance.  Thanks a million.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is very similar to migraine headache although not typical. Focal neurological symptoms may occur with the headache and persist temporarily in case of a migraine variant. One of these variants is ophthalmoplegic migraine in which a third nerve palsy, with ptosis may occur. Although rare , it is reported in some adults.  The attack usually lasts from days to months and resolves spontaneously.  A thorough neurological examination should be done to exclude conditions involving the parasellar, orbital, and posterior fossa which also present with headache and ophthalmoplegia..  Sinusitis give similar headache but the pain is often exacerbated by leaning forward or head movement, the involved sinus are the sites where the headache is felt and tenderness on palpation of the involved sinus is present.  Direct clinical examination is essential for diagnosis. If his condition is not improving, I advise you to follow up with his Doctor and to go for further investigations to exclude other causes.  Hope this information is useful. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   The swelling you have described that is felt on the left upper side of the neck is probably enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.   Following infection Lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender.   A history of scalp infected lesions, or Ear infection may be present, as this lymph node could be a reactionary to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group.   After treatment of infection with adequate course of antibiotics, they regress in size but never to normal size.   Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are significant and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes like abscess, bone lesion, etc.  Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be helpful if you can inform us about how you have been diagnosed with Carotidynia and what was the cause of uveitis?  Headaches associated with orgasm is thought to be due to increased blood pressure which result in vasodilatation of the cerebral blood vessels.  Sex headaches can affect anyone especially stressed individuals or those on certain treatments like decongestants.  However, the fact that it is your first  time to feel this type of headache and the similar episode during skiing . Moreover, the history of medical problems you have mentioned are very considerable and MRI of the brain is recommended.  Carotidynia is believed to be due to a virus and in a study of a likely associated with carotid sheath inflammation is found and MRI carotid is recommended in these cases.  This type of headaches may indicate a serious underlying problem, of central cardiovascular events.  Reference Lisa D. Grunebaum, Edmund A. Pribitkin, Vijay Rao: MRI Findings in Carotidynia. The Internet Journal of Otorhinolaryngology. 2003. Volume 2 Number 2.  I advise you to consult your doctor as soon possible. Best regards.\n\n",

Drugs can broadly be given (adminstered) topically (locally) when the drug substance is applied directly where its action is desired (eg, skin creams applied on the skin is topical adminstration of the cream).  When the desired effect is systemic (non-local) the substance can be given either via the digestive tract (tablets or capsules) or parenterally (eg, intramuscular injections or intravenous injections).

One thing to consider, though, is that headaches, fatigue, and the other symptoms you describe can all be signs of the depression coming back.    If you are feeling depressed again, or think this may be causing your symptoms you should talk with your doctor.  Zoloft is one of many antidepressants.  Several have generic forms that may be cheaper.  Also, occasionally drug companies have programs that can help supply medications when people can't afford them.    Another avenue to think about is counseling.  Often, this can be very effective in conjunction with the antidepressants to help in ultimately trying to alleviate the need for the medicine.  Generally there are clinics that will provide free counseling if needed.  I hope you feel better soon.  Headaches and depression can be very difficult to deal with.  Best wishes.  Incidentally, some antidepressants can help you stop smoking as well, if you're interested.\n\n",

    "content": "There is a good body of scientific evidence that what you eat, or don't eat can cause depression and headaches.  I would encourage you to consider a radical diet change for 2 weeks.  As a guide, I recommend the Paleo Diet for Loren Cordain, PhD.  The premise of this diet is to eat fruits, vegetables and lean meats.  NO DAIRY, NO GRAINS!  I have cured patients of depression and headache simply by eliminating these foods from the diet.  Also, consider supplementing with St. John's Wort and Fish oil capsules.  Both will address the depression and headaches.  To look further into the Paleo Diet go to http://www.thepaleodiet.com.  there is a 45 minute adio interview with Loren Cordain and lots of recipes, testimonials and articles to read.  The book can also be purchased from his website.  The first thing you will probably notice with these diet changes is increased energy and usually some weight loss.  Not bad side affects!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  it is difficult to tell without direct clinical examination what this swelling could be and whether it is related to the migraine history or not (although remote possibility).  This swelling could be: - An enlarged Lymph node as it occurs in a Lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by direct examination.  Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.   Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter. Having tenderness, soreness around and other signs of inflammation make an infectious cause is more likely to be considered. Usually a course of antibiotic is tried to  improve the symptoms and to allow further management.   - An abscess: Abscess is the body responds to bacteria or to a foreign body as white blood cells migrate to the affected area, attack and destroy them forming pus. An abscess may form on top of any other swelling or mass.   Swelling in this part of the neck may alone cause severe headache,  increase the severity of already existing migraine.  The personal and medical history as well as the clinical examination gives a good idea about the possible nature of this node. Further investigations include, US guided FNAC or biopsy.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Sinuses, Vascular, TMJ, or Worse?",
    "content": "In November I started experiencing lightheadedness that would turn into a headache whenever I would be out shopping, I felt like my head was not attached to my body, the more I would walk and move my eyes the worse it would get, my head felt shut off from everything.  I thought maybe an ear issue, this went on for about 2 or 3 weeks before i went to a dr.  No fluid was seen in my ears, but he gave me flonase in case it was something going on in my inner ear, no help. .  I would check my blood pressure when this happened and it was normal, pulse rate in high 90's low 100's.  The beginning of January I got a sinus infection, and was given a z pack for it, a 3 day antibiotic, a few days after i finished the antibiotic, i started getting intense pressure headaches, my head felt like it was about to explode, pressure in my ears with ringing, popping of ears, pain in my neck on the sides, below my ears.  I went to a ent and he said absolutely nothing, a complete waste of my time and money, did do a sinus x-ray, which he said was fine, but i question what it would show versus a ct scan or mri.  When i lay down the pressure sometimes intensifies,  i can feel my heart beating in my head or my pulse, my ears will sometime pulsate.  I went to another dr. and she gave me amoxicillan, now on my 2nd day, see no improvement, when should i see a change, if it was truly some sort of sinus infection?  I am also taking entex to try to open my sinuses.  i feel like i can breath fine but the pressure is still there.  I worry about vascular problems since i can feel the blood pumping in my head.  I was told it was TMJ by the first doctor also.  How will I know what is going on?  If it is sinus blockage and infection  when will i get relief from the antibiotic?  Would something vascular go on for this long without something finally bursting in my head?  TMJ, i am going to a dentist the 22nd to find out about it.  I am really worried that it is something serious.  All signs point to sinuses but who knows and why can't i get relief from it if it is?\n\n",

After 2 days of 102+ fever, only controlled by 1000 mg of tylenol every 6 hours, she visited the ER.  It was diagnosed as both a bacterial and viral infection, in addition to a urinary tract infection.  She was given Axid and Cipro and seemed to be fine as the fever broke and is no longer present.

    "content": "Hi. I am a male - 27 years old.  About a week ago I started having a tingly sort of feeling wiht a little pain in the upper back of my head.  I took an aspirin at about 6:00 at night and the feeling didn't really go away.  I took another aspirin around 10:00 at night and the feeling still didn't really go away.  Then at about 2:00 in the morning I took another aspirin and a little while later I started getting very dizzy and had very bad pains in the back of my head behind my ears. After a while, the pain went away.  I went to sleep and when I got up the pains were gone.  The next day however I started getting frequent feelings of spasms or pulsating in the left side of my head above my ear.  They are very quick and only last a second, but I kept having them.  They lasted all day and I had a pretty bad headache on that side of my head.  I don't take ibuprofin because I have acid reflux and for some reason it seems to interact and give me a burning sensation in my middle and upper abdomen.  I had been taking aspirin but it didn't work that well for my headaches so I just started taking tylenol.  I keep having the spasms but not that much of a headache.  Sometimes it seems like when I'm having the spasms and take some tylenol, it makes me have a headache, and vice-versa.  The spasms were really bothering me a few days ago and it felt like the whole side of my head was swollen so I went  to the emergency room.  They did some neurological tests and examined my head.  They said that my scull is actually just a little more prominant on that side and it wasn't swollen.  They told me they didn't know what the spasms were but that it was nothing serious.  They said my scalp was a little irritated in that area and it might be causing the symtoms.  I don't think that is really what is causing my symtoms though.  I generally have dry scalp and I didn't bump my head or have it disturbed in any way.  The doctor said to look out for a rash and that it could be early signs of the shingles.  I haven't seen any signs of a rash since then.  I keep having the spasms though. They just aren't going away. I sometimes have mild headaches on that side of my head, but not that painful.  I thought they were going away, but they just keep happening.  Does anyone know what this might be?\n\n",

    "content": "I am posting this for my son who is 32 years old. Has no headache history. His current meds are only aspirin.    He started a daily headache two months ago while he was painting an apartment.    He has daily headaches that are in the mid back of his head. The pain starts due to lifting something heavy, laughing too hard or raising his voice. The pain often starts when he gets up out of bed. The pain is relieved by aspirin but returns immediately when he exerts himself by daily normal things such as lifting something or at times even when he turns over in bed or a cough.   He went to see his PA a week ago and she said that all his neurological signs are good and not to worry. To keep taking aspirins and to call back if not better in two weeks. Well at that time his head already had been hurting for close to 7 weeks .   I urged my son not to wait another day and call the PA back now for some medicine to try. Maybe tests aren't warranted with no other neurological signs. I don't know. He has no neck pain.    I am extremely worried but like the PA said wouldn't my son have other symptoms if something were seriously amiss?     Thank you very much for any help.      Chris\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Approximately 60% of headache onset occurs in those older than 20 years.  There are many causes of headache. It could be a manifestation of an elevated blood pressure, neck problems, eye problems, ear problems or sinus problems.  Migraine is defined as severe, episodic, unilateral, throbbing headache. There are two main types of migraine, classic and common.   In the classic one the headache is preceded by aura of 15-60 minutes duration which normally occurs before the headache begins. The aura are commonly visual disturbances including blind spots, flashing lights, confusion, inability to concentrate, problems with articulation or co-ordination, or tingling, pins and needles or numbness on the affected side.   The other form is common migraine which has all the characteristics of a migraine but lacks the aura. It is important to differentiate common migraine from common tension headache.   In tension type headache both muscular and psychogenic factors are believed to be associated with tension-type headache.  As mentioned earlier it is also very likely to be a sinus problem.  I would suggest that since you are having headaches on a daily basis that its imporant that you pay a visit to your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21/female/normal BP and weight. I had an MRI with and without contrast about a month ago which came back normal. However, I have had moderate unilateral temporal headache for the past 1.5 months (every day but not getting worse in intensity or frequency), along with extreme pressure in the area. The headache is very deep,dull, and intense, and localized directly over the temple. Some of the time it feels hot, pinching and inflamed with a raised, puffy blood vessel (superficial temporal artery?). This all started after a slight cold I got after moving from dry MN to humid FL. An ER dr. diagnosed me w/ otitis media and sinus irritation and put me on 10 day course of amoxicillin after 3 days of symptoms. The headache and pressure did not respond as I have had it for nearly 2 months. My GP did not diagnose me but sent me for an Mri around 3 weeks into the symptoms.  According the what I have read on the internet, my symptoms mimic sinus thrombosis due to infection or something else.  My question is, is it possible to have a sinus thrombosis for the duration of 1.5 months, with no increase in intensity/frequency, and a normal MRI? Also, would the MRI have shown a sinus infection?\n\n",

However, one disease known as temporal arteritis may be worth consideration. Then again I wouldn't put it at the top of the list either but it may be worth while to discuss this with your doctor.  Temporal (giant cell) arteritis is an inflammatory disorder of arteries that frequently involves the extracranial carotid circulation. Temporal arteritis occurs mainly in white women in their late life. Autoimmune processes presumably provide the cause.  New, severe, sustained, steady or throbbing headache most often located in the temporal region of the scalp and accompanied by a tender, nodular, or incompressible artery in the area. Head pain also may affect the masseter or sterno\u00adcleidomastoid muscles, occasionally as the chief symptom.  Associated symptoms may include malaise, fatigue, weight loss, low-grade fever, and proximal myalgia affecting the pectoral or pelvic girdle areas (polymyalgia rheumatica). The erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) usually rises to 60 mm/hr or more.   A firm diagnosis requires a biopsy. Pathological examination of the offending temporal artery usually shows an inflammatory response, often with partial or complete occlusion of the lumen.   Temporal arteritis represents a medical emergency, since delaying proper treatment increases the risk of retinal artery occlusion, thereby producing partial or com\u00adplete functional loss of vision.  High dose corticosteroids is given in the presence of a probable clinical diagnosis. Remarkable resolution within 24hrs is the rule.  Follow up twice monthly for symptoms and ESR to detect relapse.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Stabbing head pains at the point of falling asleep.",
    "content": "I am a 49 year old man.  I have had migraines since age 18, treated by Migril and now Rizatriptan. These are usually caused by citrus foods and drinks, pork, wine, the usual things, so I avoid them. Since July 2004 I have had short stabbing pains in  the right temple at  the very point of falling asleep, just as my mind loses consciousness. These  jolt me awake again and the cycle can continue for  hours. I have seen my  Doctor a number of times,  searched the  internet at length, but have not found anyone else with this condition.   In late 2004 I saw a consultant and had an MRI scan that was normal. He put me on  Indomethacin, 25mg of  which usually works fine and other than nightly very unpleasant dreams  was dealing with the problem. I went along by  invitation to the London  Headache Group, who were  baffled.   I have over the last 18 months had maybe 3 or 4  periods of a few days  when the drugs haven't worked, and found that  increasing the dose  usually fixed it. However, I have now had 2 weeks  where the drugs are  not working. I have increased the dose from 25mg  through 50g to 75mg to  100mg without guarantee of success. Last night for  example, I took 100mg  at 10.15pm, went to bed at 11.15pm, and the pains started  as I fell asleep. I got about 4 hours sleep.   I am only getting 3, 4 or 5 hours sleep a night, the  rest being  interrupted by these short pains, which are like  someone flicking the  inside of my right temple. I usually have, and need  7 or 8 hours sleep a  night. I am very worried and very tired.       Any help really appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 21, female, in general good health. For the past week I have had intermittent, sharp, sticking headaches in the left side temple area, right over a vein that I can feel there. If I lay on that side, the sticking pain returns almost instantly. Other times it comes and goes at random. Also at times there is a \"sore\" pain in the top of my eye socket on that side. I think I may have TMJ, as the left side of the jaw pops and clicks, but I'm not sure if this headache is characteristic. I very much worry about it being an aneurysm, but I heard they usually do not have symptoms. Any ideas? Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  - In most of the cases with neck, (upper back) pain, spasm of the back muscles, is the primary cause. This usually results fromMuscle fatigue, Heavy exercise and wrong posture.  Muscle spasm alone can cause the pain which can be an unidentified cause.  In these cases, self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial.   If these measures fail to relief the pain or to improve symptoms in 48 hours, you should visit your doctor for better evaluation and for exclusion of other causes (like cervical disc prolapse) that need specific therapy.\n\n",

    "title": "Occipital Neuralgia or Migrane?",
    "content": "Hi I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on this...  About a year ago, I had a horrible headache that stemmed from the base of my skull, and radiated pretty much to my entire head.  I was told it was occipital neuralgia, and that trigger point injections of local anesthetic would work to break the cycle of pain.  That time it did.   Jump to about a week ago, I had the same sort of horrible headache crop up.  It started out tolerable but landed me in the emergency room by Friday night.  I could barely think through the pain, my eyes were sensitive from light, and sounds hurt my ears. I couldnt eat because my stomach was so upset.  I had tears streaming down my face and my hands were balled into fists when my Mother took me to the ER.    I told them about the bout with occipital neuralgia about a year ago, and that the pain was in the same area... stemming from the base of my skull on both sides, and radiating up around my entire head.  The doctor wanted to be thorough though and did a lumbar puncture to be sure (he said he was looking for blood etc)  Then he put me on an IV with 'Procglorperazine' and benadryl. And then a second IV bag with Dexamethasone (steroid?) He said he was looking at this as a 'vascular' headache.  My questions are this:  I read that prochlorperazine is an antipsychotic? Would this have worked on occipital neuralgia? I did feel the medication 'kick in' and it seemed to lessen the headache.  Could this have been something other than occipital neuralgia then... more specifically could I have had a migrane? I have not really had migranes before though....  Second question is... the original headache was dampened down quite a bit by the medication they gave me, but not totally gone.  And now a few days after the ER visit, I have a different headache.  If I stand up or cough or move around more, its worse.   read that lumbar punctures can cause a headache... so I am wondering if this could be what I am experiencing now.  I am hoping its not the original headache making a come back.  Thanks in advance...\n\n",

About a year ago,I began having very strange night time only headaches.The normally occur between 3:00 - 4:30 Am..Never later...I am usually in bed between 10:30 -midnight. The headaches normally awaken me..with a vise like grip around the back of my head.I have found if I awake early enough,before the pain gets too severe,and walk around and do deep breathing..It will go away.If I remain lying down,the pain remains,increases to unbearable.Sometimes if I lay down after they go away I am OK.Other times they reoccur stronger. When they are the strongest,again if I get up and walk around,it will lesson.Taking baths alternating very hot and very cold water,usually eliminates them all together.They usually last about 2 hours when they are at their worst.I have never had one last past 7 AM and have never had one during the daytime hour.The timing of them seems to occur about a week before menstruation and half-way between,which leads me to think it may be pre-menopausal.But have found nothing to support this. Have also suspected mild sleep epnea,due to loud snoring,but no other symptoms... I have never gotten one of these headaches during daytime napping..  Mother,now deceased from complications to Diabetes,congestive heart failure and sarcoidosis..Had sever alergy headaches. I have associated a possible link with tomatoe based products,but have had them without consuption as well...  Have also suspected additives such as MSG....But again,prevailing factors are same time of the night,same time of the month...Any input would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

However, since this can not be concluded without a physical evaluation by your physician, I would suggest this be completed to rule out any underlying cause. If you are somewhat embarrassed, especially with disclosing this information to your wife, then just tell her that you have been having headaches lately and are going into have an evaluation. Masturbation as long as you feel comfortable doing this, is by no means an unheard of practice. When you go in for an evaluation, explain to the physician, that the headaches occur primarily with sexual activity, as masturbation is a sexual activity. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Heightened Blood Pressure Induced Headache",
    "content": "Hello,  I am a 21 year old male, 6'0\", 195 lbs with an athletic build.  I attend a large university and go to the gym a few times a week.  Primarily my workout consists of jumping rope, push ups, sit ups, leg ups, and medicine ball work; easy stuff.  A few weeks ago something went wrong.  When I do my pushups I alternate looking left and right on the way down.  This makes me feel like I'm getting an equal workout for both arms.  On the way down I looked right and then something seemed to release on the back of my neck/head and a terrible headache ensued.  It was localized to strictly the back of my head and is a throbbing headache.  I continued my workout regardless of the pain.  Since then I have noticed that the same headache, although reduced in severity, occasionally when my blood pressure/heart rate goes up.  The frequency and severity is going down.  I can go to the gym and have no problems.  I do still get them however for certain.  What is happening or what had happened?  Thanks.  Matt\n\n",

    "content": "Hi matt20017, Exertional headaches sometimes occur, ie, in people that are more susceptible to episodes of migraines. However, they may also be caused by underlying abnormalities. Any sudden, severe headache, especially brought about by exertion, warrants a diagnostic work-up. I would strongly suggest that you have an evaluation by your physcian to identify if an underlying causative factor is present. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "hi  I have recently seen a dermatologist for my skin which has become quite sensitive, accompanied by lots of red dots of various sizes on my shoulders, back and legs, and I seem to bruise quite easily.  Recently I have had several really quick yet exceedingly painful headaches. I have had a couple of dizzy spells, which have had me grabbing furniture to keep me upright.   Up until 8 months ago I would have considered myself a healthy specimen, though my family have a history of eczema. Could these headaches be due to stress and worry, or something else? I'm in my 30's, and don't want to make a mountain out of a molehill, but must confess I am quite concerned.  Any advice would be welcome\n\n",

    "title": "headache just about everyday...",
    "content": "My husband is experiencing headaches about everyother day atleast.  He says he got headaches when he was a kid but now it's getting worse. This evening he started to get a headache around 3 pm, and he layed down and fell asleep. He woke up in pain from is head hurting about 12 am. He said the pain starts at the top of his head, and when he lays down the pain moves to whatever side that he is laying on. He tries to lay on the side that isn't hurting and when he does, he feels as if there is a brick laying on his brain. If he tries to lay on the side that is hurting, he said it hurts worse and feels as if its pushing against his skull, and the pain moves to the back of his head a little.  He also has pain in his neck. He has been to a doctor that did a MRI on his neck, and the doctor said the vertibre in his neck, the cartledge may be sticking out a slight bit cause his vertibre was compressed slightly from a neck injury around when he was 13, he is now 19.  I don't really know if that has anything to do with the headaches. He has had some surgical history, which is... 16 years old he had windows drilled into his sinuses to help  lower the occurance of sinus infection and pressure. Within 6 months of that surgery is nose was broke in an inncident. The same doctor that did sinus surgery also did the follow up reconstructive surgery to mend the broken nose and damage done to the facial bones during the inncident. When he was 15, he had wisdom teeth removed surgically because they were inbedded in his sinus cavities. Those are the three main ones he has had on his head. He does not have as many sinus problems   as he did before the sinus surgeries and has has know complications since. After the wisdom teeth surgery, he was diagnosed with having TMJ, which means (which he was told) meant the cartledge in his jaw was out of place which caused it to click when he chewed.  That is still a minor problem to this day, but is dramatically better than it was.  This is all the information I can give whoever can assist me on this headache problem, that I think could have something to do with his headaches maybe. We will definatly go see a doctor when his health insurance is straighten out, which could be months from now. I just need a few opinions from a doctor or anyone that knows about this kind of problem. If you think it is a serious problem please tell me, cause with or without insurance his health is more important than money.                                Thank you,                         Andrea Hubbard\n\n",

Boy was I wrong!   I have had a non-stop migraine ever since. I was only on reduced two nights and without one night, and I have been back on it full strength for three days. I have tried everything to make this go away. I have tried to lay quietly, meditate, take caffeine, aspirin, ibuprofen, midrin, xanax, vicodin. I don't know what else to do, or how long a migraine should last. six days?   I knew I had migraines, but I thought that only meant really bad headaches. I feel like such a fool now because I thought this was a whole seperate problem, double vision and my face tingling and my ears over sensitive and speech problems. Nobody mentioned that could happen! Sorry so long.   Thanks for your help before. Any suggestions how to make it stop?\n\n",

I have tried so many different drugs and am currently working with a neuro doc to find the right combo of daily meds as well as ones to take during an attack. Unfortunately if it is migraine you are having it can be quite a process to find what works for you but as suggested in the previous post you should definately get a work up to make sure that is what is going on. good luck, hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 22 years old and have been experiencing chronic sickness for 5 years now. Everyday since roughly 5 years ago (Im unclear as to when this started exactly, it seemed to just come on me slowly, seemingly when i moved into the back room in my parents house) i have been experiencing constant pressure in top/front of my head. it is nonstop, and it is often accompanied with nausea and a feeling of iminent sickness.   Other symptoms that have accumulated are a constant ringing in the ears (subtle, can only hear it and is bothersome when it is quiet or relative silence) and pain when using q-tips. I also have dark spots in my eyes, and what i call heat/mirage vision which is like tiny little black spots and a 'heatwave' like sight (only noticeable when looking at white objects or the sky for example) as well as seeing transparent 'shapes' usually like a string with a loop in it or something, hard to explain. I have also had a chronic cough, which depending on the time of year will produce phlegm usually green or yellow with brown spots in it and shortness of breath and fatigue. And I don't smoke, however I do smoke when I occasionally drink on the weekends.  I have seen an ENT, received 2 left frontal sinus surgeries because of a cyst/infection. As of now my sinuses are clear, so I went to the Houston Headache Clinic and stayed in the hospital for 5 days on intervenous IV medication as well as oral. My symptoms were never relieved, and barely alleviated. I now take Depakotee 500mg and Cafergot for the 'headaches' which don't really help, pulmicort and albuterol for the cough and recently taken Azithromycin and Ketek for sore throat/coughing/etc.   I have also done several CT scans, a CAT scan and an MRI, all of which were fine, and these were taken about a year ago. Ive also seen a neurologist and a psychiatrist, was prescribed geodon for paranoia type symptoms but other than that, nothing. Ive seen all these people and never have my symptoms gone away. All i know is that they never go away, and for some reason the nausea/pressure and headache discomfort are much worse after I take a hot shower or steam, or when I excercise, and i feel really 'out of it' like im kinda not there, a terrible feeling.  Needless to say I feel helpless about this, and i have many symptoms other than this i wasnt sure where to put this thread. Nothing so far has helped so I am asking a doctor on this board to please look into this, check it out. My name is Eric Giebel and live in Midland, Texas. Im beginning to wonder if it isnt something in my enviromnent (my home) is keeping my sick, as I am quite allergic to black mold. Is that possible ? Sorry for the length but I feel like everything must be explained. thanks in advance\n\n",

    "content": "I need my mind put at ease.  I have had what is being called a migraine/tension headache (depending on which doctor you talk to) for the past going on 8 days.  It is on the left side of my headand sharp at times, sometimes feeling like it is pulling if I move my head down or a certain way, my temple is very tender, and it extends up behind my ear and down towards the back of my left side of my head.  It is there when I wake up in the morning and has woke me up before if I roll over on that side of my head.  I have had no nausea, vomiting, sensitivity to light or sound, sinus pain, loss of appetite, change in vision, or dizziness.  I have not had any recent injuries.  It is there all day in varying degrees, getting jabbing and throbbing at times, sometimes with movement, sometimes not.  I have taken Tylenol, Darvocet N-100, 800 mg of Ibuprofen, Flexeril, and today I actually got a Toradol shot at the doctors.  The only thing that worked was the Toradol shot, but it did come back after about10 hours (I actually thought it would be gone after that long, I couldnt believe it came back AGAIN!).  Today in the waiting room at the doctor, I had a brief ringing in both of my ears that also felt like someone put their hands over my ears and everything sounded very dull.  The only med I am on on a daily basis is atenolol 25 mg a day.  I have no prior history of migraines and I am a 38 year old female.  The first doctor I saw (5 days into the headache) told me it was a tension headache and totally normal for it to last this long, even longer.  She gave me some Midrin (which I havent taken yet due to the other medications I had tried).  She also told me it should be gone by the end of the weekend.  Well, today (Monday) I was back in in tears because of the pain.  I wake up in pain every morning.  This doctor told me it was a migraine even though I had no other migraine symptoms and no migraine history.  She gave me the Toradol shot and told me to take the Midrin if it came back.  She also drew some blood and will call me tomorrow if anything showed up as abnormal.  She said very rare causes could also be stroke or arteritis, which she says I am too young for and have showed no other symptoms for.  I Googled a lot of information and have never heard of a headache lasting so long. I am getting worried that it may be someting more serious.  Now that the pain has just come back after the Toradol shot, I am also feeling a bit of tingling in that area of my head where the headache is and some very slight face tingilng on that side.  What is happening?  Will this EVER go away?  I just need some reassurance that this will end.  Thank you so much.  Please be kind  enough to reply if you have any answers.  I cant find anyone who has had the exact symptoms as I have on the message boards as of yet.  Thank you in advance, ~A\n\n",

    "content": "Hayley,  So very sorry to hear of the pain you are in.  You're in the right place though, the people in these rooms are great.  I've been there before, so you're not alone.  I had one last 14 incredibly painful days.  I also am having the problem of left sided facial and neck pain/numbness.  Try not to consume caffeine, as that seems to make matters worse.  However, you should have your doctor send you for an MRA of the Carotids.  It could be a TIA or a \"mini stroke\".  Don't be afraid of that, finding that could end your pain.  You'll have to make a few lifestyle changes, but it's worth it.  Good luck, and look on the bright side.\n\n",

I spoke with my doctor on the phone last night, and she asked me a bunch of questions and told me that 10 days was a little strange and she wanted to see me if they were still there the next day, which they are.  So, I am off tomorrow to see what she wants to do.  I am so scared it has something to do with my brain that Im sure my stress about it isnt helping any.  I guess we will have to wait and see.  I cant find ANY answers online, my headache doesnt seem to fit into any category that I know of.\n\n",

As a doctor of chiropractic, I see this all the time in my practice.  It usually is a problem with the one or two of the upper three vertebra in the neck as well as some suboccipital muscle tightness.  The numbness could be a mononeuropathy which means that there is some compression on a nerve causing numbness.  Consisder seeing a doctor of chiropractic.  This stuff is our specialty.  to find one in your area go to http://www.amerchiro.org and click on \"find a doctor of chiropractic\" in the top of the page.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Well, they are telling me I have GREATER OCCIPITAL NEURALGIA.  My doctor consulted a neurologist, told him my symptoms, and it took him all of 5 seconds to say that is what it is.  She was going to send me to the CAT scanner and after she talked to him, he told her to hold off, because he diagnosed me with the neuralgia.  They put me on 800 mg ibuprofen 3 times a day, Flexeril, and nortryptiline for 3 weeks.  The ibuprofen is for the inflammation because apparently the nerve exits out the back of your neck and goes over your skull, and if the muscles are tight they can compress the nerve, irritating it.  The Flexeril is a muscle relaxant, and the nortryptiline is actually a tricyclic antidepressant that is used in a low dose for nerve pain.  Apparently, this condition is pretty chronic, so Im expecting it to not completely go away unless I am able to get some kind of physical therapy or something.  They said if the pain is still there in 3 weeks, they will give me a nerve block injection in the area of my head where the nerve is.  This is only temporary though.  I still do have pain, although not as bad.  It is always there and worse when I first wake up in the morning.  It usually dies down during the day, and then can come back either in the side back of my head or in my temple area on that side at different times.  I also tried buying a pillow with more support to see if that helps support where the nerve is during the night.  Anyone with any input or knowledge or experience with this, please feel free to post.  Of course, part of me is still scared they misdiagnosed me, but 3 weeks later, and I am still walking and talking,so who knows!  Ciao!\n\n",

And tons of it too! It is a watery secretion, same density as water and is colorless and odorless. I was wondering if anybody knows what this could be. Maybe it is related to my migraines... I have no clue, it has only happened like 4 or 5 times, not enough to see if I can find a relationship between it and something else. It doesn't hurt when it comes out, but I find it odd, and would like to know what it is.   Can anybody help me?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 26 year old female.  On Dec. 3, I woke up feeling like the room was spinning in circles and this lasted for about a week.  My doctor thought it was either vertigo or labrinthitis.  The next week, I began having headaches which have escalated to being constant.  The pain is all across the back of my head and seems to \"surge\" in nature.  My vision and hearing are fine, but I would describe my vision as \"just not quite right.\"  I have been unable to concentrate and everything just seems a little off.  Three days ago, after having a horrible headache for 48 hours straight, the right side of my face went numb and I got very disoriented.  My hands were shaking as well.  I went to the hospital where they did an MRI and bloodwork - all normal.  I am now waiting about a month to get into a neurologist for further testing.  I was initally prescribed STA-D (for ear drainage) and antivert for dizziness.  My ears never hurt, but have been popping- could this be due to the STA-D, though? I have also been prescribed Fioricet for pain and advised to take Exederin Migraine (which does not really help).  I have been unable to work as looking at a computer screen only makes things worse.  Light and noise aggrevate symptoms.  I want to just stay in a quiet,dark room - it is the only thing that lessens the symptoms.  My eyes feel a bit heavy and I have slight pain behind the eyes; I assume this is from forcing myself to focus and concentrate.  Sharp head movements, bending over, and other fast movements all cause slight dizziness/disorientation (but the room spinning stopped about 2 weeks ago).  No one seems to have any idea what this could be and I don't know if I'm taking the proper meds for the symptoms in the meantime.   I don't take any regular medications.  I have been on Depo-Provera birth control for about 9 years.  No history of headaches or major medical problems.  I have been an athlete all my life and eat very healthy.  No drug use and non-smoker.  Any ideas or recommendations would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "I am losing my mind. I had an episode in October of 05, it started with a bad migraine followed by vertigo, followed by left sided facial/neck/shoulder numbness and slurred speech. Saw my PCP that day, and got a CT scan which was \"normal\". Was given T#3 for pain. Saw a neurologist 2 weeks later and had MRI and EEG done. MRI was \"normal\" and EEG results were not explained to me, but it's was referred to as an \"EE Wow\". It is now January of 06 and after an emergency room visit for pain I could not tolerate, I was given Butalbital 50mg and told to see a neuro. The next day I saw yet another and I am now being sent for an MRA of the Circle of Willis and an MRI with IV GAD. (About time) Was given yet another script for Topamax. Was told of possible \"mini stroke\" or TIA with possible atherosclerosis in the carotid's (which my mother had). Blood was taken to rule out MS (again, MOM) and Lyme disease as well as a battery of others. Symptoms still persist, the migraines are more frequent at once a week lasting 2-3 days of hellish pain since my October incident. Have been on a braod spectrum of medication over the past and found little or no relief at times.   Don't give up, and keep pressure on your doctors.  Do research on everything, and ask for copies of all your scans and correspondence between doctors and hospitals.  Keep changing doctors if you don't get answers and push for more tests.  Don't just let them throw more pills at it.  Good luck!\n\n",

He said he gets a sudden sharp pain on the right side of his head that turns into a burning sensation. While this is happening he says he feels like he has a hole in his tongue. These symptoms last about 10 seconds and are gone.  He says this has been happening off and on since he was 6yrs old maybe even before, he can't remember when they first started happening. This happens maybe once a month or once every couple of months and the symptoms are always the same.  He has no other symptoms and is very active and very healthy. Do you have any idea what could be causing this? Does it seem serious being that it's been going on so long? My fear is that its a brain tumor or something but I looked up symptoms and he has none of the classic symptoms. He never even gets headaches.  He also thinks that it may be brought on by a certain way that he jerks or turns his head but does not happen all the time.  Any ideas? oh, and the hole in his tongue when this is happening he says feels like its toward the back right side of his tongue.\n\n",

They are occurring on different areas of the head now but symptoms are still the same. Would this be consistent with a childhood migraine or a type of seizure? I've also read about ice pick headaches, could these affect sensation of the tongue? How about if a nerve was getting tweaked in the neck somewhere, which is what his school nurse maybe suggested?

There is a lump similar on the left side, but it does not pop out half as much as the right side.  My neck has also been cracking alot latley and feels a little stiff at times.

The neck pain almost feels like a bad crick in my neck but I am experiencing it daily with my headaches.  Any idea? I have a Dr. appt in 2 days but was wanting to know what I am looking at.

    "content": "Hi, all! I hope somebody out there can help me out a bit. I've never had this particular type of head pain. It started when I bent over to pick something up and just never went away. The very back of my head near my neck started hurting; originally just a solid pain. This gradually (over a few minutes) turned into a throbbing pain, which spread down my neck and to the top of my head (scalp-ish) and some on the sides. The only place it did not spread to was the front. Additionally, I have been sensitive to lights and noises; I don't have a true ringing in my ears, but it's as if I can \"feel my heartbeat\" in my ears. Sorry, but I don't know how else to put it. I have looked a few places (webmd, etc) but I can't find symptoms that match this exactly. If I sit (as I'm doing now) it throbs mildly--and my neck is still sore (was not before this). If I get up, I feel a little out of it and it gets worse. I'm not even going to attempt bending down again! Oh, and I have just a little problem focusing, but I I can still read this tiny print, so guess I'm doing okay! I've only had these symptoms for maybe an hour, but I just worry since I've never experienced them before. Any help is appreciated! Thank you so much.   [/i]\n\n",

I have had this issue since I was in 6th grade ( I am 30 yrs old now) I used to get them 7-9 times a week when I was a kid, and I would pass out.... My pulse would sky rocket and my blood pressure would drop... I would have that warm sensation at the base of the back of my head and it sometimes felt as if it was moving up the side of my head... my tongue kinda sticks out and goes numb. and usually I would fall as I have gotten older they are a rare occurance, maybe 1-3 times a year, and they are not so severe.... as I no longer fall or pass out... the warm sensation lasts for about a half hour..... when I was a child, my parents took me to neurologists, and I had EEG's, CAT Scans, and even IQ tests.... they admitted me for a week at a hospital, then transfered me to Childrens Hospital for a week, they had thought maybe I had some type of brain cancer.... They NEVER figured it out... They eventually told my parents that I must be making them up.....But I wasn't! I call them my mini seisures, because of the whole tongue thing.... If you find out what you have PLEASE let me know, because it is so similar to my problem.!!!! Good Luck and hang in there!\n\n",

My son is having almost the same exact symptoms other than he doesn't black out or his vision doesn't go dim. He just gets a sudden pain on the right side of his head that he says heats up and while that is happening he says he feels like he has a hole in his tongue.  These symtoms only last about 10 seconds and are gone and they only happen once a month or every couple of months.  He says that he's been getting these since he was 6 years old (maybe before, he can't remember) and he is now 9 1/2.  Please get back to me on this.

    "content": "Dear Hartmann,   The sinusitis headache actually is one of the worst. It is not in the back of the head. It is usually located on the front and the pain sometimes is where the sinus is located, meaning on the forhead, or below the eyes (the cheeks), or behind the eyes as there is a sinus behind the eyes.  Somtimes, if you have severe sinusitis, tenderness (pain on touch) is one way to diagnose the presence of sinusitis. So, yes, it can hurt to touch.

They are very sever and sometimes my eyes also hurt.  About once a week the left side of my head  past my ears starts tingly like it had lost feeling and now regaining it.  Half of the time it is followed with a very hard pulsing pain.  Like something is trying to push out of my head.  I remeber that my head used to tingle a lot when I was younger, but it never hurt.   I have been experiencing quite a bit of dizziness also.  It is atleast once a day and it really doesnt matter what I am doing.  It seem like it is coming out of no where. Also when I was around 9 or 10 a swollen lymph node (I think thats spelled right) was found on the under side of my right arm just above my elbow.  Well, a couple months ago I felt a knot on the back of my neck close to my head where the headaches are.  It is about the size of a peanut.  I am really scared and don't know how serious this really is.  My insurance does not start till january.  I hope there is something that you can tell me.  thank you for listening\n\n",

    "content": "I have been experiencing very severe headaches 1-3  times per week in the last 2.5 months. Went to my 'general' Dr., to an Ear, Nose & Throat Dr., had a ct scan of head (primarily sinus areas - apparently one is missing on one side of my forehead) done, had a septoplasty performed for severely deviated septum, had  turbinates reduced to 1/3 original size (swelling due to deviated septum).  All this to get rid of headaches and 2-3 weeks later they're back!     They did not occur immediately post-op or for the week following.   My recovery from the septoplasty was much more difficult than for a majority of the surgeon's patients.  The prescribed Vicodin did nothing for the pain (for several days) despite my generous dosing.  Oxycodone finally helped.   I only used it for the remaining few days of severe pain.  These meds might be why the headaches weren't occuring in the first weeks after the operation?  I get migraines - but once every few months, not days!  Is something going on other than sinus problems / possible allergies?  My extremities get so cold  (to the point that ppl who shake my hand comment) that gloves and socks don't help, my heartrate is a bit low (~74 beats per minute).  I'm an otherwise healthy, 5'11\", 160lbs, 3 times a week gym visitor, caucasian male who seems to have been born with problems (see surgical history).  Flonase might have helped  prevent headaches for the 2 weeks I used it before surgery.  I have been told not take it for a few more weeks, however.  Tylenol Allergy and Sinus helps with most of the headaches once they've started.   What is causing these headaches?!  They are excruciating.  Are they linked to my cold extremities?  How do I get rid of either? both?  Please help.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

This clears the nasal passages and sinuses of bacteria, allergens etc. You may want to discuss this with him/her as an option. This could be a contributing factor for your headaches. Now as for your extremeties, this happens when there is constriction of the blood vessels. Is there any discoloration when this happens? Is there any numbness or tingling?When this symptom happens to your extremeties, do you have accompanying headaches during this time? Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

It seems to help with breathing  through my nose, but that's about it.  There doesn't seem to be any discoloration in my extremities when they get cold, no tingling or numbness either.  They're just really cold.  They get cold when I'm trying to fall asleep, and all the normal times hands and feet get cold (in the basement, outside in winter) - it just seems more extreme than other ppl experience and again gloves never help the way they seem to with others.   The headaches and cold extremities don 't necessarily come together.  I don't know is poor circulation can cause a headache?  Or if maybe both of these symptoms point to one problem?  Tonight is the third night in a row I am experiencing this horrible headache and the Tylenol has only taken the edge off this time.    Thannk you so much for your response and help - I am pretty desperate to get rid of these headaches!  =)\n\n",

In my opinion since they are recurring, a repeat CT scan should be done. Have you had any problems with blood pressure etc.? This would cause headaches as well. As for the cold extremeties, since you aren't having discoloration etc. during those periods my question is, have you had a cardiac workup done to evaluate for heart problems? If not, that is another suggestion.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I have been suffering from headaches for the last 5-6 years.  It is usually associated with fatigue and stress and occurs once or twice a month.  The pain usually spreads from the rear part of the skull and I often feel the presence of a fluid within.  Recently I consulted a neurologist who examined me and took a VEEG and blood test.   He found nothing wrong in the test results and told me that this is due to a chemical change in the brain and advised me to manage stress and tension.  To prevent this headache he prescribed the following medicines.    Divalproex Sodium Extended Release Tablets- 250 mg \u2013 1-0-1 Flupentixol and melitracen)Tablets- (Deanxit) \u2013 1-0-0 Flunarizine Hydrochloride Tablets  10 mg \u2013 0-0-1 Fluoxetine Capsules 20 mg 0-1-0  He asked me to continue this for a month and to observe the frequency of the occurrence of headaches and then depending on that he said he will modify the dosage.  He said I will have to continue this for another 3 months and stopping this in between may have reverse effects.   I am taking these drugs and now I feel very much sleepy.  I want to know whether there are any adverse effects for these drugs and whether this course is appropriate.  Can this headache be prevented if I take these drugs or is it better to ignore it?\n\n",

    "content": "Each of these medications taken alone can cause increased fatigue, so it is understandable to me that you are experiencing this while taking all of them.  Some notes -   1.  There is no proof or tests for chemical imbalances in the brain.   2.  Depakote/ Divalproex - Can cause/increase depression. 3.  Deanxit should not be taken while taking any other antidepressant, particularly an       MAOI.  4.  Flunarizine/Sibelium - Can cause/increase depression. 5.  Prozac/fluoxetine - is an antidepressant, but is NOT an MAOI.  Deanxit and Sibelium are not available here in the US, so someone in your area may have access to much more information about these medications than I.    Your symptoms do point to tension headaches, but the infrequency (in my opinion, pharmacologic, not MD) should not warrant this combination, nor amount of medications on a daily basis.  Stopping these medications could have reverse effects and the longer you remain on the Prozac in particular, the more intense the reverse/rebound effects could be.  If possible, sit down with your physician and both of you compare the adverse reactions and other sections of the prescribing information together.  This way you can ask your questions and he can give you full answers so you may understand, or even rethink his combination of medications.  Either way, your physician should give you the full explanation of your treatment.  I wish you the best!\n\n",

Each and every person who suffers from migraines has different 'auras', different tolerances for the pain, etc. Migraines in and of themselves are not what 'we' consider 'normal'.  I believe that you have the answer to your question though already. If your doctor is 'pressuring' you to see a Neurologist, than I think that is what you should do. If one test is normal than it is customary for doctors to conduct other testing and/ or refer you to a specialist to find an answer.

    "content": "I have the thalassemia trait (diagnosed about 20 years ago so I don't know exactly which type) and I was unfortunate enough to catch Fifth's Disease from the kids at my daughter's school a few weeks ago.  I still have some of the symptoms including the itching of my skin and tingling sensations in my hands and feet.  I don't know if this has any bearing on what I am about to describe.  Yesterday I noticed that I had a great deal of pain from the right side of my face all the way to the back of my head.  The pain includes my jaw, teeth, right side of my nose and sinus, right ear, forehead, back of my head, neck and at times even feels like a migraine.  I tried my migraine medication, and it didn't touch it.  Then I found a lump on the back of my head, above where I had a swollen lymph node at the base of my neck from mononucleosis as a teenager (which never went away), located near where the skull curves adjacent to the middle of the ear.  It is very tender to the touch, and causes an immediate intense headache when I touch it.  I also found that when I tried to sleep if I laid down on my left side, I felt intense pressure in my head like the pain was spreading to my left side and the pressure was building.  I had to sleep on the right side, which increased the pain on my right side but didn't make it spread, or else on my back.  I was not comfortable sleeping, and the pain continued off and on all day today.  The most intense pain is actually a few inches above where the lump is on the back of my head.  The pain is only on the right side of my head.  It is very strange.    Should I go see my regular internist about this?  What type of tests will he most likely order?  Could this be a complication from Fifth's Disease?  Would a swollen lymph node cause such pain on the whole right side of my face and head?  Please help.\n\n",

He said it throbbed and felt like his head was about to explode. He is thinking that perhaps something is \"out\" in his back or neck, but I am not convinced of this.  Any ideas or suggestions?

    "content": "Well, I am a nurse with a couple ideas, and I hope you get more answers.   Sometimes alcohol and caffeine have effects on whether you het a headache or not, and I have had a few headaches during sex.  If they don't persist they may not be something to worry about, but do these occur with alcohol?  Of course that is only one factor; at other times alcohol does not cause headaches. Alcohol is a vasodilator and caffeine (or nicotine) is a vasoconstrictor.  If you use both, by evening the caffeine has worn off and the alcohol; may be effective.   Of possible concern, see for example http://www.neuro.wustl.edu/headache/dis ... system.htm where it says \"There are, nevertheless several symptoms, which should raise the suspicion that the headache may be secondary to a serious medical problem.\u00a0 These include 1) the sudden onset of headache during vigorous physical activity, including sex, particularly if severe or associated with other symptoms, 2) alteration of consciousness, 3) stiff neck, 4) worsening of headache, 5) abnormal signs on neurological and/or general physical examination.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Well there are lots of possibilities, and the danger is that whatever I say, even if correct, may reassure you when you really need a complete history and physical by a good doctor.  Perhaps the back injury and headache were coincidental.  Perhaps straining caused a little bleeding in some blood vessel that first day that was related to the headache.  Although some article ares reassuring that sexual headaches are not uncommon, (see http://headaches.about.com/cs/triggers/a/ha_orgasm.htm ), even if you don't have medical insurance, if the headaches are not going away I would find someone to diagnose, perhaps at a community clinic with free or sliding scale fees.

I have a tingling sensation along with the pain and my \"hair hurts.\" I can press on it and it feels good like a hurts-so-good massage, but it's tender to the touch. The first few days I also had profuse itching on the top of my scalp, but that has subsided. The only other symptoms I've had recently have been some nasal congestion/sinus pressure -- but I have not been ill. Although the pain and tingling has been primarily centered on the top of my head, today the feeling is more right-sided, along with sinus pain and tenderness over my right eye. The headache is always there, but the intensity comes and goes. Any suggestions?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dedo, These are typical anxiety symptoms and common around the menopause. If you think about it, hormone replacement is very hit and miss, and does not, of itself, address the psychological symptoms that are so common at the menopause. If you ever suffered from irritability or weepiness premenstrually you will have no problem accepting that tiems of hormonal change disrupt the psyche! Around  the menopause one's eostrogen and progesterone levels swing wildly, another reason why HRT has been shown not to help with the psyche symptoms. The fact that you have had valium to no effect should not be a reason for you to doubt a diagnosis of anxiety (or possibly depression which is often a fellow traveller of ansiety). Both anxiety and depresion are now usually treated with the SSRI group of drugs, which are very effective and have been shown to be the best way of treating anxiety and depression during  menopause.Of course, I would also hope that some therapy would be available. Therapy AND medication are always used together for anxiety and depression symptoms. The trouble with anxiety is that it makes one doubt the diagnosis and the treatment. That's hard to address on line, and you need to see a doctor in person. Either a GP with an interest in psychiatry or a psychiatrist. This does not mean you are crazy! How does one know that light headedness and scalp tightness are due to anxiety? Its a presentation that we see very very frequently. I'm often asked that question, I usually reply that that is like asking \"how do you know that is an elephant?\".  Ask for referral to a good psychiatrist, or discuss with your doctor whether you suffer from an anxiety state or depression. These states are easy to diagnose, and treat.Its the very anxiety, however, that makes it difficult for you to accept the diagnosis. Good luck! Anxiety symptoms are awful things to suffer from.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Billy-Ray, I wrote you a long reply which may have got lost in cyber space! Essentially I was saying that grieving, when unfinished, can cause anxiety. I would guess this might be what is happening to you. Could you find a bereavement group that you could go to in order to work through your gief over your father's death? Ask your GP re this perhaps, or your pastor.  Your symptoms do not sound physical, but I would hope that your doctor has tapped out your reflexes and tested your muscle power and done some tests on your cranial nerves (looking at the back of the eye was part of this testing). These tests would tell us if there were, or were not,what we call a space occupying lesion. in your brain, and would be adequate to rule out any significant growth.  If I were your GP I would ask you questions to ascertain if your were suffering from an anxiety state, or possibly depression secondary to a prolonged grief reaction. If you were I would probably try a trial of SSRI medications which treat anxiety and depression, and are not addictive. If this relieved the pressure in your head, great! It  would take at least 3 weeks before we knew if the tablets were working since  this  is how long these medications take to start to be effective. If they made no difference I would consider referral to a neurologist. Worry is a terible thing, and telling a patient not to worry is not helpful, as you know! Ask  the doctor to treat the worry, then see if the pressure feeling go. I think you will find that they do. Good luck!\n\n",

The first one that you have to deal with is ANXIETY. Try to relax as much as possible and really talk to yourself that you are not going to die and this problem that you have will be solve. If that doesn't work then go to another Dr. and ask for some Lorazepam medicine to treat your anxiety. Take it only when your ANXIETY level is high. I know this for a fact because I have used Lorapam at the begining of my problem and it really does work. But you really must see another Dr. if your problem escalate.

    "content": "I'm new to this site, so please bare with me...About 2 months ago (Mid July 2005) I\u2019ve had a bicycle accident and hit the electricity post with my head. Everyone thinks it's funny but that how it all started. At the time I refused to see a doctor or go to the hospital because I thought it was nothing and endured the pain with left black eye for 2 weeks. I'm very actively fit so I still continue to exercise everyday (running, biking, walking, boxing, yoga and more). Then my family and I got invited to go to Six Flags.

Ive been having these wierd headaches for about a week now, the first few days it was just the sides of my head but now it can be above my eyes,  or above just my right eye, or down towards my neck on the left side sometimes i wake up with them in the morning and they go away for awhile then later in the day then come back closer in the night time. I allso get awful pains in my arms usally my left, and wierd pains in my stomach just under my breasts, and some times above and once in awhile pains in my left foot, these pains are sharp and not that painfull but they worry me alot(i get all of these wierd pains during the wierd headaches), i don't really no if its symptoms of anxiety because my anxiety has been getting worse the last month or so, im not on any medication but i will be going to a doctor tomorrow about my anxiety and these pains, i did go the other day but the doctor wouldnt let me finish so i was unable to tell him about the headaches and wierd pains, i was just explaining my anxiety to him. then he gave me a number to some mental health and adiction place and sent me off i tried to explain the pain in my arm to him but he said theyd deal with me at the place. Now im really frustrated, and all i really wanted to know was if i was healthy, just to re-ensure myself i wasnt dying or have some horrible disease.  i have recently quit smoking.  does anybody else get these wierd headaches or are these just symptoms of anxiety.? any thoughts/opinions/answers would help alot\n\n",

    "content": "Hello sososcared,  Are these headache attacks frequently occuring for the past week? if so, how frequent? Aside from the pain, do you also get photophobia (i.e. when exposed to bright lights, headache gets worse)? is this being triggered by your work load? any stressors both at home and at work? may I ask how old you are? do you have hypertension or any other underlying illness? Is there any numbness you feel aside the radiating pain?Based on the data you have just posted, it may just be a tension headache you are suffering from.. however, there are other factors we have to consider too which is why I have asked several other questions which will somehow help your physician when you go for your next visit. If your headaches persist, you can take any non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs in the mean time (i.e. ibuprofen, mefenamic acid, paracetamol, aspirin) provided that you take any of these on a full stomach.  MD\n\n",

For your peace of mind, you can have a CAT scan done. That way your doctor can visualize and detect anything that might cause your headache. If, however, your scans yielded a normal result, then it can be optional that you be referred to a psychiatrist to help you out with your anxiety as this (anxiety) may be the cause of your headache.

    "content": "About a month and a half ago I was in a dark room and went to stand up and all of a sudden I was off balance and nearly fell down. All that week I didnt feel quite right in my head. One week to the day I had my first panic attack (prolly due to the dizziness because I'm quite paranoid about these sorts of things) I had a stress test done by my doctor just in case and it was alright. I had a blood test done which turned out normal. But since then I've been getting this Intense pressure in back of my head and problems seeing in one eye which sometimes moves over to my left eye. Its not quite like blurred vision more like when your in a dark room and you can feel how your eyes strengths are different. Also when I get this Pressure I start to sweat and I feel alittle dizzy or off balance all of which is made worse if i put my head up into the normal position. Its almost as if my head is on a spring and is being pushed down. I'm just worried these are signs of something more serious. My upper arms feel weak when this happens almsot like ive been working out and it usually goes away after about an hour or two but comes back the next day or later in the day. I have trouble sleeping at night now, the dark seems to make me feel worse so I have to sleep with the Television on. It's all just so strange. Any help would be appreciated. Thanks so much for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "BigPaul, Have you ever been diagnosed with Anxiety Disorder? Your symptoms sound very indicative of this.The headache you have could very well be from tension, keeping your shoulder muscle tensed up without being aware you are doing this, staying in a hieghtened state of anxiety.  Anxiety can cause many symptoms such as dizzines, heart racing, sweating, problems with sleep, headaches, feelings of fear( usually described as impending doom), add those together and you will usually come up with a Panic attack.  I would suggest you make an appointment with your PCP and have Complete Metabolic Profile done, just to make sure there are no imbalances. If all is normal range, ask your doctor about an anti-anxiety medication. There are many excellent ones on the market.  Hope all goes well with you.\n\n",

It realy all just worries me cause im paranoid anyway and I get on the ocmputer and look up symptoms which is about the worste thing someone like myself can do and the first thing I think is I've got a berry aneurysm or im having TIAs. Problem is with my lack of knowledge on the situation and my access to the internet it makes for a troublesom combonation. All of which is made worse by the fact that I'm losing my insurance at the end of this month. I dunno I think al I am really looking for is some reassurance that I'm prolly not going to have an aneurysm or stroke. But I don't know how often you see symptoims over a month in advance of such an event. But enough of my rambling, I have an appointment with my family phycision tomorrow I will talk to her about my worries and see what she thinks.

    "content": "For a month, I have been struggling with a chronic headache.  It came on suddenly, felt like severe pressure in my head.  I've had migraines before, and this didn't feel like those at all, and none of my migraine meds touch it.  After several days, I happened to have my blood pressure checked, and it was 198/105, had never had high BP before.  They put me on BP drugs (I'm 52 yrs) which made my head feel less like it was going to explode, but the pain continues - sometimes sharp driving pain at the temples or center of my head, much stiffness in the neck area, and a foggy, full feeling in the head in general. Sometimes it ebbs a bit, but never leaves.  I've had some nausea with this, dizziness, breathlessness as well.  The only other thing I've noticed with it is fluid retention, not sure in the chicken-and-egg debate if that's coming first or not.    Even codeine/tylenol combos don't help, tried chiropractic, anti-anxiety, nothing.  They did an MRI, was normal; ran bloodwork; put me on antibiotics in case there was sinus involvement - nothing is working.  Have a neurologist appointment in a few weeks, also going for a 24-hr urine scan to explore kidney involvement.  With the BP meds, the BP is generally 130/100.  It's getting very tiring, really limiting what I can do - hard to concentrate, work.  Any help would be MUCH appreciated - thank you.\n\n",

I don't know if you have tried an antiflamitory medicine but this was the only kind that helped her take the edge of the pain, but didnt take the pain away completely Im sorry to say, she uses one called Indomethasin. The only other help we got for her headache was to attend a pain management course for three weeks in the city of Bath at the Rhumatology hospital. I think she has just had to learn to cope with the pain by using tecnieqes taught to her at the PMU.

    "content": "I would greatly appreciate a Doctor's insight on my headache problems.  I am a 22-yr. old female- I have been an athlete all my life and run quite a bit. For the past year, I have been getting severe sinus-like headaches. I have been to a general physician as well as an ENT----but neither Dr. had any explanation for what could be causing the headaches.  They come very sporadically- sometimes months apart.  When it happens, I will wake up with my head throbbing and the headache won't go away for 2-3 days. The pain is always behind my eyes, and sometimes in a band across my forehead.  I have no allergies and don't get sick very often. I sleep alot, eat healthily and exercise everyday.  I don't smoke, take meds, etc.  The only medicine that has worked even partially is Sudafed Sinus Headache- however I hate being dependent upon this medicine.  Can you please give me some advice as to what this might be caused by, or what type of specialist I might go see?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi:  This doesn't sound like the typical migraine headache, but it may be an unusual form.  In medicine there is a saying:  \"Unusual presentations of common diseases are more likely than classic presentations of uncommon diseases.\"  And, I think what this may be is an unusual migraine.  Migraines tend to present at around age 22 and they are 3x more common in females than males.  They are unique in that they may awaken you from sleep and they are characteristically described as \"throbbing\" headaches.  Most migraines are on one side of the head (the word migraine comes from \"hemi-crania\" (half the head), which was pronounced \"hemi-grania\" in middle english and was later shortened to migrania or migraine).  However, I have seen more migraines than I can count that affect the whole head or just the front, like yours.  It is *extremely* common for migraines to be confused with sinus headaches.  I've even seen Sudafed partially relieve migraine headaches (the main ingredient in Sudafed is pseudoephedrine, which can be vasoactive...That is, it can counter the vasodilatation that is thought to produce pain in migraines).  This is probably more detail than you need!  The bottom line is this:  See a neurologist!  If you've seen an ENT and a CT of your sinuses came back clean (or at least not suggestive of severe chronic sinusitis), then your next step would be to see a neurologist.     If you get a chance to post back on the forum, let me know if you have any other symptoms with your headaches...Do you have any nausea or upset stomach with your headaches, or even just loss of appetite?  Does noise or bright light bother you during your headache?  Does moving around a lot exacerbate the headache pain?   \"Auras\" are actually pretty rare with migraines, but some people will see \"moving spots before their eyes\" before the headache starts...Do you ever experience anything like that?  Do you notice that disrupting your sleep schedule or skipping a meal gives you a headache?    Hope this helps!  -Reid\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for giving me some of your thoughts, Doctor, I appreciate it.  To answer some of your questions- the ENT I visited just over a year ago did not even SUGGEST migraines. He seemed to rule out the possibility that they were sinus headaches, as well, though he did NOT order any CT scans.   The ENT attributed the problem to \"stress\",  since they started during my final semester in college. However, right away I knew this wasn't the right diagnosis- like I told you I had been competing as a collegiate distance runner for 3 1/2 years and was managing the same amount of schoolwork- so my life hadn't  become any more stressful.   I started to notice headaches after difficult or long workouts- or after a long day of classes and studying. Or, when I woke up. They are never accompanied by nausea or dizziness, or any type or \"warning\" signal like lights in front of my eyes. But, they can come at any time of day, in any place. I guess I would say being tired is a trigger for them.  Would you suggest CT scans, or an appointment with a neurologist? Who would I see to get a simple migraine medication?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi wle12160, A second blood patch would certainly be something that you should discuss with your physician. Sometimes the first blood patch is unsuccessful and a second one is required. This more often than, not solves the problem, and rarely is there a need for more than two. If you do indeed decide to have this procedure repeated, the recommendation is to lay flat for approximately four hours and no lifting or overexertion for at least 48 hours. Again discuss this with your physician. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Now im having different kinds of headaches and it has nothing to do with my neck- so im a little worried which is what brought me to these forums- but obviously this neck thing happens to more than one person if he knew right away what to do, if it is out of alignement its nothing seriously life threating but itt is really a pain and you should go see a doc or chiropractor\n\n",

If it gets to bad go to the Emergency room they have to treat you weather you have insurance oor not they will send you a bill and you can make payments. If you are passing out then I wouldnt want to take my chance maybe it is a migraine then they can give you some imitrex and send you on you way.

They last for about 10 minutes, but they're excruciatingly painful. They seem to come on the right side of my stomach, hardly ever the left.

If you press on the area it does not hurt - but if you brush lightly over his hair it is very painful (liike when he puts on his baseball cap). When we looked at his scalp, it was slightly indented in the painful area - don't know if it has always been this way. He has had the pain for about a week and about the same time he had a very bad toothache - could this be related? He is not on any medication, It is very weird - Thanks for your help - I hope I gave you enough info.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear future rn,  Your husband is suffering from something called Temporal (Giant cell) arteritis. It's a systemic vasculitic diease(inflammation in the arterial vessels) ...Usually starts as you've described your husband's symptoms and it gets elicited by combing the hair. It affects the jaw as well in the form of claudications,sometimes associated by headaches,mailaise,fatigue ,visual disturbances,etc.  Temporal artery biopsy is the criterion standard for diagnosing temporal arteritis. This procedure may be performed by ophthalmologists, general surgeons, head and neck surgeons, plastic or vascular surgeons, or dermatologic surgeons. With a positive predictive value of greater than 90%, temporal artery biopsy stands out as the definitive test for temporal arteritis.  He will be treated as an autoimmune disease...and should be treated for as soon as possible after obtaining the biopsy result, because it can lead to damage of his temporal artery and progression of the disease into other atreries,hence it's a systemic vasculitis disease. But once he's under treatment ,he will be more comfortable and controlled. All he'll be needing is follow up as with any other simple diseases,  Best regards,\n\n",

They last like seconds, a minute at most, and the intensity of the pain is quite simply unbearable.  I had two on monday, on the next day, and one on thursday.  I haven't had one like these since.  The first three were on the top of my head, a little to the right.  The last one, on thursday, happened behind my ear, but was just as quick and just as painful as the others.  I have had the sensation like I was going to get another one of those headaches on and off since saturday, but haven't had one like that.  I have had \"regular\" headaches, and flashes of dull pain on top of my head where I had the stabbing-like headaches earlier in the week.  This morning when I woke up I got out of my bed to turn off my alarm.  Well, I fell right over.  Had very, very poor balance, but I don't think I was awake enought to remember if I felt dizzy.  I just fell hard, crashing down onto my bed, with my head hitting the wall (on the top right side, no less).  This is all scaring me a lot.  I think I will try to see my family doctor this week.  What are your guys' thoughts?\n\n",

    "content": "Yes, you must see a specialist for the lingering symptoms.   In sinusitis, patients typically experience headache, purulent nasal drainage and pain over the frontal bone, at the bridge of the nose, and in the maxillary region. You clearly state that you have none of the symptoms.  In some cases of bacterial meningitis, the bacteria can spread directly to the meninges from a severe nearby infection, such as a serious middle ear  infection or a nasal sinus infection.(sinusitis). So, meningitis can be a complication of sinusitis.  As I stated in my first post,  it is better to be safe and exclude the sinister possibilities. Get to see a specialist, especially as the symptoms are persistent.

    "title": "Slight headaches... i need a good doctors slap in the head",
    "content": "OK. Any doctors out there. For the last 4 days or so I worried myself to death it seems. I was looking up on the internet at some stuff and came across symptoms for brain tumors. At the time I had a headache for a day or two and was just kinf of looking around at what I could be experiencing. I worried about it and kept thinking about it. As I think about it things felt like they were getting worse. i got hte sick feeling in my stomach like I for sure had a brain tumor. For the last three - four days I have toruble falling asleep because I am worried about it. I wake up and it is the first thing on my mind. And i worry and worry about it thinking aout it every second. I have been under a HUGE amount of stress lately. Woried about a lot of things. I think that might have been what caused my headache. But now, I can';t get rid of the headache. And te more it is there the more I worry. When I don't think about it as much it doesnt hurt. the more I think about it the worse it seems. It never feel really really unbearable painful. I can stand it. But can sitting and worrying about my headache actually cause the headache? The stress from worrying about it cause it to be worse? If I really had a brain tumor wouldnt I have more symptoms? It never gets worse. Please just soemone who is a doctor tell me that I'm a nut or something??\n\n",

    "content": "Hi vman1616, I am not one of the doctor's but I will try to give you an answer without a slap in the head lol. Symptoms of brain tumors (benign or malignant and depending on the area of the brain affected) may cause balance problems, nausea and vomiting, speech problems, visual disturbances, hearing problems, seizures, etc., etc., and the headaches may be rather severe. I would consider some of the more common causes of a headache first. Tension and stress cause significant headaches. Certain foods, caffiene intake, dehydration, sinus infection, allergies, visual problems (change in sight-prescription change for glasses, the need for glasses), elevations in blood pressure, etc. etc. Multiple disorders cause headaches, I would suggest a vision exam to rule out and visual changes as well as a general physical exam by your physician to rule out any anomalies and assure the headaches are related to tension and stress. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "title": "Mixed Tension Migraine; been diagnosed, but unsure.",
    "content": "Alright, this all started last thursday; I started having pain behind my eyes, regular pre-migraine symptoms really.  It lasted till sunday, where it turned into a unbearable pain on the left side of my head.  My father (a doctor who specializes in rehabilitation) suggested I take some Advil.  Well, we didn't have Advil in the house, so he just gave me some Ibuprofen instead.  The pain quickly disappeared, but what remained was this painless pressure around my head that would move around different sides of my head.  It seemed to stay really on the top though.  I was of course worried, mainly because I'm not accustom to feeling any sort of pressure or pain in my head; at most I get 2 to 3 headaches a year.  The pressure was soon accompanied by his more annoying friend dizziness.  Because of this, I expected the worse.  My father said he wasn't exactly sure what it was, but he expected a migraine.  So, he told me to go into work with him the next day and he'll take me to see a neurologist.  I got no sleep that night because I was so worried about this painless heaviness/pressure in my head.  Well, I may have gotten atleast 3 to 5 hours worth of sleep, who knows...I just remember being so damn worried.  Anyway, I went into see a neurologist; he said everything looked normal, but sent me to get an MRI and blood work.  Now, I didn't get the blood work done, because my father said I didn't need it since I had it done about a month ago by that time.  I didn't know what the big deal was with getting the blood work done over a months span, but I was too worried about my head to care, so I went with him.  By the time I got the MRI, it had been roughly 16 to 20 hours since this painless pressure showed up.  The very next day, my father read the results from the report the neurologist had sent to him.  He said everything looked fine, but you have a slight sinus infection.  Alright, so maybe this is a sinus infection I thought.  I waited until my father came home that night; time seems so slow when you are so worried and anxious about something for the record.  When he arrived, the first thing I asked was, \"So is this a sinus infection?\"  His response, \"Sinus infections don't occur on the top of your head, and you don't sound stuffed up.  I don't know what it is you have.\"  You can only imagine how worried I was after I heard these uncomforting and unassuring words.  So that night I had trouble sleeping, then again, I always have had trouble sleeping considering I have insomnia.  So, a day went by, the painless and sometimes slightly painful pressure was still there and even heavier; the eye pains had left though, but my vision was still a little blurred, and a new nasty symptom had hopped into the picture: nausea.  Oh, by this time it is wednesday already, for whoever is reading this.  At this point, I had noticed a consistant routine with this worrisome head pain/not pain: I would wake up, the pressure wouldn't be there up till 30 minutes to an hour, it would show signs of stopping during the day, but tease me by coming back, and when I would take my Clonodine for sleep time, it would turn faint.  This seemed to be the pattern with this undiagnosed thing.  I went to my father, complained about it, he gave me another one of his \"I don't know what it is\", so I asked him if I could see the neurologist the next day.  I went with him to work the next day (its Thursday again, oh boy!), saw a different neurologist (the other one was out of town, but they all work together in a cozy little office), fed him the details with my father there; he diagnosed it as a mixed tension migraine.  Now I will admit, I am a pretty unactive person, am overweight, and don't exactly eat healthy, which I understand does contribute to mixed tension migraines.  I don't know why though, but he then had me walk in place with my eyes closed, touch his fingers, but didn't do that light and magnifying glass thing in my eye like the last neurologist did though; for some reason that worried me, but I just kept my mouth shut and looked at his diplomas and awards on the wall.  Anyway, he then proceeded to tell me I was overweight (your a genius, doc), and went on and on, I think about 30 minutes, on how I needed to excersize more, eat right, be lessed stressed out and anxious, and this thing would go away.  Alright, done.  At the time, this mixed tension migraine had disappeared and remained faint for about 3 hours of the whole day.  But, by the next day (Friday) it had disappeared and remained faint for atleast 6 hours of the whole day. During the day at some point I decided to go outside for a 2 hour walk with my friend; the pressure was faint, and my vision was still a little spotty and blurry, but I went on like a trooper.  Before I went to sleep that night, the pressure had completely disappeared, but I still had trouble sleeping (I need to up my Clonodine; it seemed like I hadn't gotten any sleep at all that week.)  So, it's now Saturday,  I went to the pool for the first time in 3 years with some friends, went on an hour walk, and ate out for dinner.  I guess you could say I'm taking somewhat of the doctor's advice.  Oh, and the pressure is now pretty faint, but there's some flashes of pain here and there on different sides of my head.  Now, the reason I posted this: Is it normal for mixed tension migraines to be painless?  If they aren't supposed to be painless, is it possible that the MRI couldn't pick up on something that was undetectable at the time? And if it is a mixed tension migraine, will it be something that will remain with me for the rest of my life?  Sorry for the incredibly long post, but I'm still a little worried and uneasy about this, and would really appreciate a response as soon as its possible.  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "title": "Migraines",
    "content": "Hello Friend, Migraines definitely not fun. It does not sound like you have prolonged history of migraines, so I am thinking may be r/t your HTN (high blood pressure) and/ or stress related. If you had MRI, you can feel confident that you don't have a brain tumor( if you should ever have seizure, in additon to migraines, brain tumor must be ruled out) however, still strange with the recent onset and minimal history of migraines, also you are a male? Females are more likely to get chronic migraines.  Any recent  life changes or new medications?  Is you HTN under control?  Also, any chance you were drinking red wine which may have promoted the migraines? (Tannins <stems, grape skins, twigs, etc..> in the red wine are notorious for certain individuals in causing headaches) or consuming cheese, chocolates, dairy products? Any history of migraines in your family? Change of climate, new onset of stress or worries? You mentioned nausea, did you vomit, if so, did it cure the migraine? Since you are under the care of a physician, you should trust in his judgement. Wouldn't hurt to have blood drawn again for complete work-up if the problem persists. Otherwise, keep a diary of any preceeding factors, foods, drink, stress, anything you think may be relevant. Keep an eye on your BP, get one of the do it yourself automatic monitors available at any pharmacy and keep a log of you pressure when a migraine comes on. Any visual disturbances? May just need to adjust dose of your meds. Also, might ask you dr for rx for Imitrex or Relpax, many other non-narcotic great meds these days depending on if you have them on occasion (1-2x/mo) or frequent and need daily preventative meds. No need to live with migraines, also some have luck with herbs. If you feel one coming on, be sure to get to a quiet, dark, peaceful location and wait it out if tolerable. Hope this helps. Good luck.\n\n",

The neurologist said what caused this mixed tension migraine, was lack of activity and not eating correctly.  He told me to go to the pool, and move around more and it would either remain faint or fade away.  I have been going to the pool, and went on a few walks since.  It seems to be gone now, but I'm worried if it was a migraine or not.  I do not have a history of migraines, like I said in my post, I get atleast 2 to 3 headaches a year.  As for the family history, well, I'm adopted so I know nothing behind that, which also worries me.  All I'm wondering if its common for mixed tension migraines to be accompanied with painless pressure.\n\n",

    "title": "Migraines",
    "content": "Hi Robert,  Yes, these type of migraines can be accompanied by \"painless pressure\", although that in itself can be very distracting and annoying. As far as family history, migrraines have high occurance of familial origin, so if adopted, might just assume yes. If these only continue to affect you several times a yr, consider yourself very lucky indeed and just treat them as they occur. Take a day or two off work if possible, rest, rx prescribed by your dr. Really, if only occuring on rare occasion, I wouldnt even waste time trying to pinpoint what precipitates them since this can be uncertain. Good that your BP is ok, follow your dr's advice and eat healthy, mild exercise, etc. This is not just for your migraines, but all around well being and hopefully to minimize migraine occurance.  Most of all, if you have a sudden onset migraine accompanied by visual disturbances, make sure to stop what you are doing, esp if driving and get to a cool, dark, quiet location and rest for several hours. Have your prescription on stand by and administer as directed. Like I stated previously, much medical research and advances have been made in this field and immediate rx injections or p.o. (by mouth) should readily alleviate an unexpected attack. Some sufferers experience \"auras\" and are able to predict an oncoming attack, so, if your attacks increase or are incapacitating in nature, keep a diary and discuss with your physician. Most common aura is visual in nature or ringing in ears. Just make an attempt to be in touch with your s&s (signs & symptons) and you can actually get to the point of warding off a full migraine attack altogether. Much luck. Please let me know how you are doing and if you need any additional info.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I have been having very bad headaches for about four years now.  They started to happen four years ago, with very little frequency.  And over the last four years they have begun to happen more and more.  Now to the point where, over the last few months, they have been happening almost every day.   Also, today, while I was driving to work, a sudden spell of dizzyness came upon me.  It was very bad, to the point that I was not safe driving.  The dizzyness was not related to a headache of any kind this morning (that is why I am ruling out the migrane style of dizzyness). My headaches are pretty severe sometimes, and sometimes they are just annoying.  But they are now regular, almost every day.  When they first started, I began taking Exedrin Migrane.  That has seemed to help make them go away.  Now the Exedrin doesn't work anymore.   If anyone has any ideas as to what is causing all of this, or what I can do to make it stop, please tell me.  My wife is getting worried about me!  Thank you so much. Ryan\n\n",

    "content": "I made a doctors appointment for Monday.  But I made it before the dizziness started happening.   As an update, the dizziness went away by yesterday afternoon, but it was back this morning with another headache.  And it is still here unfortunatley, even after the headache has seemed to get smaller.   I have no problems with my vision.  Had an eye exam here in the last couple of years and they said I had perfect eye sight.  But to be honest, right now, my left eye is blurry somewhat.  Thats the side of my head that the headaches are on.   I am 25 years old.  So I haven't taken the initiative to get my blood pressure checked regularly.  Although I guess no would not be a bad time to start.   The reason I figured I would ask \"the doctors lounge\", is just so I could see what you thought.  I haven't thought much about the headaches, although it's a pain living my life with them everyday now.  I am pretty good about working through pain.  (had back surgery few years back!)  I only started to get worried after this dizzy spell.  And now that it's back today, I don't like it.  I just wanted to know if you thought something serious was going on.   Thank you for your time!\n\n",

Decreased strength to your arms or legs on either side?  Any weakness to your arms or legs?  Slurred speech?  Very sensitive to light when you have the headaches?  Difficulty walking straight?  4 years is a long time for someone as young as you to be dealing with headaches that have increased to the point of you getting them daily and now, the dizziness - and you say, some blurred vision to your left eye.    When you get the headaches, where in your head is the headache located?  (meaning: front of head, back of your head, etc...or does it vary?)  Do you have any significant medical history in your family?  Your Mom or Dad? (eg: stroke, heart problems, cancer, migraines, etc)....what about your, do you have any other health conditions?  Are you on any medications for anything else?\n\n",

I have had periods of time that I have a migraine everyday. I have had MRI's done but nothing has been found. But I too, found I had trouble keeping balance or walking straight the neurologist was quite concerned because it could be a sign of MS but after many MRI's of the brain it has been ruled out. I suggest to go and see a neurologist just to be on the safe side. I wish you the best of luck, I know how frustrating it can be to have daily headaches and to deal with doctors who act like there is nothing wrong with you even if the headaches are not symptomatic of something else they can be very disabling themselves. Best of luck to you.    Jamie\n\n",

    "content": "For the past few days I have woken up with a terrible headache that is basically located where my temple is and partially behind my eye. I have some sinusitis symptoms such as pressure, some dental pain in the upper right of my jaw, but I also have very large and swollen glands on the right side of neck right under my jaw line and fairly close to my ear.  I have been using a neti pot to irrigate my sinuses and there is a certain amount of yellow mucus that will come out but not a large amount and I am able to breathe through my nose at all times.  When I take Aleve headache/sinus the headache almost disappears but I can still feel the pressure in my temple...it is also much worse when I bend and also when I press on my glands the headache in my temple will hurt more.   I have no current medical insurance and was wondering if this does sound like sinusitis even though I can breathe ok and whether I can get rid of this without antibiotics. Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Elley, you really need to get treated for whatever infection is causing your swollen gland.  The headache sounds like a migraine.  They are usually at the temple and/or behind the eye, even in the neck.  If you don't have a history of ulcer, try taking excedrin - tylenol and advil won't work; excedrine has some caffiene, aspirin and tylenol all together.  The key ingredient is caffeine.   The earlier you treat the headache, the better success you will have.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey, I am a 25 year old female with no major medical problems but for the past four months i have been having all of these symptoms that the doctors can not find any reasons that could be causing them. I'll start from the beginning. Jan. 15 - I went to doctor with a headache. I have experienced migraines before but this was different woke one morning with a headache and it never went away for two weeks. I was diagnosed with tension migraine headaches given anti-inflammitories and muscle relaxers and told to see a physical therapist for the immobility of my neck. After three weeks of therapy and things getting worse I went back to doctor who suspected a pinced nerve in my neck and sent me to a neurologist.   By this time, my right hand had become completely numb. After an MRI of my neck and nerve conduction studies of my hand, there was no pinched nerve. After blood tests were done by neurologist and an MRI of my head, nothing was shown except an elevated blood platelet count. Right hand still numb and weak and beginning numbness in my right leg.   The neurologist referred me to a hematologist for more blood tests. My platelets are still elevated and now I am experiencing complete numbness in my leg and weakness (hard to walk sometimes) I also experience cold fingers on my right hand while my left hand will be completely warm. I have been told to take a low-dose asprin everyday to reduce my chance of blood clots since I already have high cholesterol. And just this week I have been experiencing severe itchiness all over my body. I am not currently on any medicine except asprin and have no known things that Ii am allergic to. Could someone offer me any explanation?   Doctors just keep saying we don't know lets run more tests. I'm beginning to feel like they think I'm making it all up. Which is not the case, I hate going to doctors and hate blood tests but I continue to go and do all the tests because something may it be minor is truly wrong with me. Please help!!!  Jamie\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old white male.  5'11''  320 lbs - Blood pressure slightly high.  Not taking any medications, no other medical conditions except infrequent migraines that are not unilateral.  I recently started experiencing constant neck pain and a unilateral headache both varying in intensity.  The pain ranges from mild discomfort to a throbbing/pounding/tense pain.  The best way to describe the pain would be a feeling of pressure and pain traveling from my carotid artery where i check my pulse on the left side of my neck, up behind my ear, to my temple, and when most severe extending to the entire left side of my brain.  Occasionally i have the sensation of muffled hearing or ringing in my left ear associated with this.  A couple times I had a feeling of foggy light headedness or what some call \"medicine head\".  It's now the 4th day and what I initially thought was caused by sleeping with my neck in a bad position has me a little more concerned.  Due to the fact that I do not have health insurance, I am trying to find out if this is a potentially serious problem that I should seek treatment for or if I should give it a few more days.  Any suggestions about what this may be would be very much appteciated.  Thanks! -Ryan\n\n",

For almost 2 years I have been to my doctor, other doctors, eye doctors, have been on various medications and have had numerous tests all unconclusive.  I have pressure that seems to be behind my eyes and in my forehead constantly. I feel light-headed, off balance, dizzy. Every day I have to fight with my eyes. My eyes get a \"pull\" to them. If you make yourself look cross-eyed...that's what my eyes do but by themselves whether I'm looking straight ahead or off to either side. Once my eyes just voluntarily crossed but when I looked in the mirror my eyes were facing straight. Just a couple of days ago I looked at something to the side of me and both my eyes pulled. Sometimes I get blurred vision and spots all the way around my pupil but I can see fine through the middle. This always last anywhere from 20 minutes to an hour and sometimes more than once a day. I always feel a headache and pressure but more so before and especially after my eyes do that. I also get headaches after I eat. I have had an MRI, cat scan, sinuses ex-rayed, have been on migraine medication (which only made me feel worse), ulcer, blood and allergy tests, my eyes were dialated as well as other tests and medications.   The only diagnosis that came over the last 2 years is my cholesterol and sugar is a little high.  I watch what I eat and exercise at least 4 times a week. When I was 14 or so I had an operation for scoliosis.  Could the harrington rods and wires in my back have anything to do with the way I feel now?  I've been fine for over 20 years physically except for back pain and muscle stiffness from the surgery I imagine. At this point I don't know what kind of physician or treatment to seek.\n\n",

I was going to ask about MRIs and CT scans...but you've already done those...any abnormalities around the eyes area... were the scans normal?   anyway,please seek an ophthalmologist and tell me how it goes, best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "In summary from last post, still having headaches behind eyes and front and top of head. I had a CT scan and came back normal. Had blood work done, came back normal. Blood pressure fine. No dizziness. Went to ENT specialist, said ears were fine. My family doctor put me on a medicin called Midrin for my headaches. I still wake w/headaches that continue throughout the day. This is going on for about 5 weeks. Never have I experieneced this before. I have a lot of post nasal drip, however, my nose is not \"running\". No couging. My doctor is calling these at this point \"tension headaches\". Anybody really know what that means or how long they last? It is getting frustrating getting up w/these headaches all of the time. My headaches are described as like a constant pain, not pulsating pain. Any advice or anyone have such symptoms?   Thank You\n\n",

I went to an opthamologist to check my eyes that said I had a little hemmoraging on my optical nerves.  I had a cat scan, and 2 mri's one for my head and one for my eyes (orbits).  they showed no masses, but I was still having headaches.  I then was sent to a neuro-opthamologist that told me I was having these headaches due to high spinal/brain fluid pressure.  They did a lumbar puncture (a form of spinal tap) to measure the opening pressure.  I was told that a 20 was normal and I had a 47.  So they drained fluid.  I am not sure if this helps or not, but you may want to ask your doc about it.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear kimberly629: You have listed several contributing factors to headaches.  First of all smoking decreases the amount of oxygen that gets to your brain by constricting the blood vessels, this in turn can cause you to develop headaches.  You did not say how much overweight you are.  A person who is obese can develop sleep apnea which is the stopping breathing for a short periods of time while  you are sleeping.  This causes a person to not get adequate rest.  It also causes mouth breathing during sleep which can contribute to both nasal congestion and headaches.  When you don't rest well, you can develp muscle tension and aches and pains.  Sleep apnea can also lead to heart failure so it is not something to ignore.  Of more immediate concern is the \"almost blacking out when standing up\". When a person stands the blood, that has pooled while they were sitting down, rushes into their lower extremities thereby lowering their overall blood pressure.  If their blood pressure drops too low, they black out or faint.  This is serious and needs to be checked out by a doctor.  Quitting smoking and losing weight will benefit you all around but that all takes time.  Right now you need to find out what is causing your blood pressure to drop suddenly when you stand up.  I urge you to see your doctor right away.  Please let me know how you are doing.  I care. Kind regards, Carolyn\n\n",

I was diagnosed with migraines 10 years ago. I have done extensive research on different types of headaches and medicines used for them. The doctor has tried everything under the sun to help me cope. What I have found to be MOST useful in curbing the pain is: Taking 2 generic aspirins and melting them in a tablespoon with hot or warm water. This allows the medicine to be quickly absorbed into the blood stream once swallowed. I usually have to lay down in a quite/dark room for 30 minutes after taking the aspirins before the headche goes away. My point is, the melted aspirins have worked better than all of the prescription medications I've tried, and trust me, I have tried a bunch! Good luck to you. And again, this is what works best for ME.....SWT\n\n",

I don't know if this is normal or not, but there are certain spots on my head that if you barely press down on, it causes EXTREME pain.  Is that normal?  If not, what is it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Sorry this is so long but i figured you'd need to know a little of the history behind my problem if i'm going to get any possible answers.  I've not posted on this site before but thought i'd see if anyone can help? I've suffered from Migraines since i was in my teens but until recently have only occured about once a month. I also started suffering chronic sinusitis a few years back which didn't help. I had that opperated on last year.  Anyhow, about 10mths ago i had a migraine which passed late afternoon. Later that evening i started feeling very sick and felt like i was going to pass out. This lasted maybe 10 minutes before i DID pass out and was told that while i was out had a seizure. I had a CT scan done and EEG and both come back clear. Since then i've had a few near faiting spells (feel sick and like i'm going to faint but passes after couple of minutes). The headaches started getting a little worse but not until the last few months had i really noticed a huge difference in them. I've been getting Weekly migraines and almost daily headaches. There's very few days in the last few months where i've had no head pain at all. When i have a migraine during the worst of it my neck usually starts to ache but the last few weeks i've noticed that even without migraine my neck aches. Some of the migraines have started with an ache in my neck the seems to spread through the base of my skull right through the entire right side of my head. It's usually when the migraine is on the right side that my neck is worst (the neck pain is on the right side). I've noticed that just below my hairline on the right side there's some slight swelling and is quite tender. I've had full blood work done and thyroids are fine.  If anyone has any ideas what could be causing this and if i should be concerned could you please let me know.   Thanks tons and again sorry it was so long.  Kazzy\n\n",

So, what happens here is, the patient with migraine may manifest with seizure even without epilepsy. Or another patient with migraine may manifest with paralysis even without a stroke. Since all your workup has so far resulted normal, I would consider these to be part of migraine.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

My doctor as a child said i was having petit mal seizures but i was never sent in for tests for this. I'm now wondering if it was the migraines even back then?  If it is MV's that i have will i always have to take the preventatives for them? and lastly, do you know of any good sites i can go to for more information on the MV's?

If you are so worried about meningitis, i suggest that you be vaccinated against it especially if you are a new college student and live in the dorms now where there is lots of crowds. If you think at any time that you have been exposed to anyone who has meningitis, there is prophylaxis by you getting a certain antibiotic for a certain period of time.  If you think that this headache has anything to with meningitis, you have to seek medical attention immediately.

I can deal with that, but in the past month, on 3 seperate occasions, I have had a different headache unlike the others.  It comes without warning and shoots to the right side of my upper skull.  It normally will last 2-3 hours, but not consistant.  It is unbearable pain that comes and goes in that time frame.  It reminds me of biting in to something cold and you have that same pain in your tooth(not headfreeze).  I had a neck fusion with plates back in Feb and am wondering if this could be related.  I am not sure how to deal with these headaches, because they make you double over in pain.  I have no nausea with them and the pain goes as quick as it came.  Any suggestions?\n\n",

I never had clusters before either and started getting after surgery.  Had 2 ruptures and 1 buldge.  Have neuropathy.  No one seems concerned about the headaches, so assume they may be muscle related.   Actually, no one was concerned about my neck pain for a year either until I requested an MRI after putting up with severe weakness and arm pain.  It was also assumed to be muscle related. Fooled them! I did get a trigger point injection that week of severe head pain.  I think this may have been the cause to.  Did research and it says trigger points usually do not have these symptoms I am experiencing.  I had a minor eidsode as well last evening. Much less severe.  Strong pain, but shot in one time and then left.  Not really sure where to go from here.  Thanks,  Kelly\n\n",

I believe the trigger point injections, (2 in 2 month) each side of neck were what caused the headaches, not made them better.  The major episode happened I believe the same day or day after the injection.  I am not under anymore stress than normal and feel stress is not an issue.  The only med I take now is skelaxin PRN.  I am to take Naproxing for lateral epichondilitis, but haven't taken yet.  Other than that, no meds.  I quess this is something I will never know the answer too.  I will let go at that, unless I start getting continues days in a months time.  Seems to be easing.  I started back at the gym too, so maybe vigerous exercize caused some of the headache concidering I haven't done any in some time.\n\n",

I noticed when I do get the headaches it is because my heart rate is high.  Whenever my heart rate goes up, I seem to get this pounding headach in the right side of my head.  It's like I can feel my heart beat in my head.  I have two guesses what this might be from but I'm not really sure.  I have been taking the pills called NO2, they are kinda like enhancer pills for muscles, but they are suppose to have no sideeffects.  The other is alcohol, I don't really drink at all durring the week, I drink twice a week, friday and saturday.  I didn't think I could ever have a problem with alcohol and I don't think I do, I mean I don't crave it at all.  But when I do drink it gets out of hand, I drink way to much.  I don't know if this is a problem at all but I am cerious because these headaches are killin me.\n\n",

    "content": "I don't know what is going on with me. For about nine months I have been experiencing extreem tension, pain, and inflamation in my neck and shoulders. It is constant and sometimes severe. No doctor I have seen has taken me seriously. It swiches from the right to the left or vice versa sometimes in one day! It can happen very fast and I usually wake up with it and go to bed with it. What on earth could this be!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Eiheiken,  Neck and shoulder pains are usually related to unhealthy ways of carrying things and/or sitting in front of your computer a lot and/or driving for prolonged periods of time (as your job implies that you might be doing).  Also, this pain can be secondary to tension headaches. Are you getting any headaches?  What are the treatments that you tried so far?  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
