    "content": "I want to know if it is truly standard procedure to do bilateral lumpectomies for x2 radial scarring on Right Breast @ 1:00 and Left breast papillomatosis?  If so, then I wont be as nervous that I'm doing the right thing.  In addition, is it normal to have lymphadenopathy form after the bilateral core biopsies, especially inches away from the insertion site?  I also noticed a localized cervical lymph node that just formed yesterday by the right SCM muscle that is tender to touch, but not red, no sinus problems, sore throat or fever.  I also noticed this morning a  non tender small palpable lymph node in the right supraclavicular area.  I was wondering if this could be a virus that has caused me to be extremely fatigued for over 1.5 months, weak, weight loss, joint/bone/muscle pain?  I do not want this new finding to interfere with my surgery next week on Wed. Aug 25th.  I did have mono about 10 months ago and I was wondering if it is possible to have a relapse?    Thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Standard Procedure for benign masses",
    "content": "Hi, Your query is rather ambiguous. You indicate in your profile that you had undergone VATS(bilateral), but no details about the indication or further treatment(if any) are mentioned. You say that you have lymphadenopathy close to the core biopsy needle insertion site. No details about that as well. The description of the mammary lesions also is unclear.  In this situation, i can only confine myself to a general discussion about some of the important histological features seen in fibrocystic changes in the breast (FCC) and their risks for malignant change.  Histologically, the fibrocystic changes may be classified as, - non-proliferative lesions and - proliferative lesions.  Nonproliferative lesions include papillary apocrine change, epithelial-related calcifications, cysts, nonsclerosing adenosis, mild epithelial hyperplasia, as well as ductal ectasia, and periductal fibrosis.  Proliferative lesions without atypia include, moderate or florid ductal hyperplasia of the usual type, radial scar, sclerosing adenosis, and papillomatosis or intraductal papilloma.  Proliferative lesions with atypia include atypical ductal and lobular hyperplasia.  Women with nonproliferative lesions on breast biopsy have no elevation in breast cancer risk, whereas women with proliferative disease without atypia and women with atypical ductal or lobular hyperplasia have a greater breast cancer risk, with relative risks ranging from 1.3\u20131.9 and 3.9\u201313.0, respectively, according to various studies.  Thus, in each of these lesions, the subsequent risk for breast cancer is associated with  - the histologic appearance of the lesion,  - the age at biopsy, and  - the degree of family history of breast cancer.  The risk for breast cancer in young women with a diagnosis of atypical epithelial proliferation is twice the risk observed among women > 55 years. Some studies have indicated that a strong family history may increase breast cancer risk even in patients with nonproliferative lesions.   Radial scars and \"radial scar-like\" lesions: \"radial scar-like\" lesions are sometimes identified in mammograms. These lesions have a \u201cblack star\u201d appearance with long, thin spicules radiating from a radiolucent central area.   Those measuring 1 to 9 mm are designated radial scars and that those which are 10 mm or more are termed complex sclerosing lesions. Some studies indicate that a carcinoma may be identified in nearly 50% of cases that demonstrated mammographic findings of radial scar.   Therefore, excisional rather than core needle biopsy is generally recommended. It is recommended that in cases of a mammographically suspected radial scar, all members of the management team as well as the patient should be made aware before the surgery, of the potential for a malignant pathologic diagnosis.  Various types of carcinoma have been seen in radial scars, but comedo-type ductal carcinoma in situ or grade 3 invasive ductal carcinoma are rarely encountered. Other investigators have hypothesized that radial scar is a form of early tubular carcinoma or that tubular carcinoma originates in this entity. Tubular carcinomas that consist of more than 75% tubular elements have a more favorable prognosis than invasive ductal carcinoma not otherwise specified.This has led to several authors to caution against extensive surgery for radial scars.  The significance of the lymph nodes that you mention can not be commented upon without more information regarding your past surgery. However, they must be investigated without delay. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 53 year old female, currently recovering from pelvic floor surgery, a result of which I'm now self catheterising,due to retention of urine. Approx 12 days ago, I had a stinging in the left breast, followed a day later by a rash made up of three small marks or spts, surrounded by a reddish area. My breasts are small, and this rash is about 1 inch from my nipple (above and to the right) and overs about an inch square. Around that time, I experienced a lot of pain when carrying my rucksack - in fact. I thought maybe I'd pulled a muscle. After taking cocodamol, this pain subsided, and I no longer carried the rucksack.  A week after the rash appeared, I checked with a GP. An infection was suggested and antibiotics given, with an appointment for review in 7 days. The rash is still there, 3 days after taking the drugs, and also using hydrocortisone cream. The breast is a litlle painful, and itches at times. Today, I noticed almost the same rash under the left shoulder blade. It may have been there all the time, but I only noticed it today, as it was uncomfortable.  Do you think this could be inflammatory breast cancer? I don't see the GP again for 4 days. Thank you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Rash: inflammatory breast cancer?",
    "content": "Hi,   A rash/redness over the breast can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, most of which will be benign.The fact that one type of aggressive breast cancer presents with features of \"inflammation\" of the skin overlying the breast mandates that in any \"inflammatory\"- like condition of the breast, a suspicion of inflammatory breast cancer(IBC) must be entertained and excluded.   Inflammatory breast cancer is usually seen in women at an average age of 59. Slightly more in black women compared to the white women. Also the affected women tend to be slightly younger than the average age at which other types of breast cancer usually present.   Inflammatory breast cancer rather unique in that there is no associated lump (as sometimes seen in other common forms of breast cancer)or suspicious parenchymal changes on routine screening mammograms- therefore prone to misdiagnosis and delayed presentations.  Some of the more common signs and symptoms are,   - fairly sudden increase in thickness, heaviness or visible enlargement of one breast,  - an 'inflammed' appearance of the skin overlying the breast,  - affected breast may feel unusually warm, - an orange peel (peau d'orange) appearance of the skin, - Itching(sometimes).  - mastalgia, tenderness,  - enlarged axillary, supraclavicular or infraclavicular lymph nodes(sometimes),  - inversion of nipple(sometimes).   An excisional biopsy that includes the skin is necessary for diagnosis (Tumor emboli in the lymphatic vessels of the skin are diagnostic).  Imaging tests - such as mammogram and breast ultrasonography  also may be yield helpful information (to exclude other conditions and to demonstrate areas of skin thickening dur to inflammatory breast cancer).  In your case, other than this possibility,the more common benign lesions will need to be considered.Some of them are  -  \"mammary duct ectasia\": Affects major breast ducts and is poorly understood.Duct ectasia mainly affects  middle-aged to elderly parous women. Presents with noncyclical mastalgia, discharge from nipple, nipple retraction, a subareolar breast mass with or without overlying breast inflammation, a periareolar abscess, or in later stages, a mammillary fistula.Smoking is a risk factor( X 3 times that of non-smokers). The risk appears to be proportional to the duration of smoking.(your profile indicates that you have been a smoker for the past 14 years). - \"periductal mastitis\" :very similar in most ways to mammary duct ectasia but affects younger women.Smoking once again is a risk factor. - as you are complaining of a similar lesion under the left shoulder blade, this lends support to the possibility of this being a purely dermatological condition.  Although your concerns are well founded, your description favors either a purely dermatological problem or possibly a mammary duct ectasia. Please do show to your GP soon and have yourself examined & tested. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your thoughtful and considered replies. Just to clarify five things:  I did smoke for approx 14 years, but have been a non-smoker for 25 years. I had a total hysterectomy five years ago, and have been using oestrogen since then. I started taking Plaquenil 3 plus weeks ago, however my GP didn't think it was a drugs rash. Having Sjogren's, I am susceptible to skin rashes, but have not had anything like this before, and I've had vey little exposure to the sun.  Most important'y, in my anxiety, I didn't mention that a routine mammogram 4 weeks ago came back clear.  I would not like to ask another question, would the fact that I am using steroid nasal spray(Nasonex) make me more susceptible to the herpes simplex?  I really appreciate your taking the time to consider these factors.  Pipsmum\n\n",

The medications work best in the first 48hrs and to prevent later complications of pain along nerve root.This is known as post herpetic neuralgia. Ultimately this may be turn out to be drug rash or insect bite reaction but then the unilateral location and history lend support to H.Zoster. With my best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 25 year old female who has never been pregnant and has a family history of breast cancer in my paternal grandmother and paternal great aunt (grandmother's sister).   I have been monitoring a spontaneous, yellowish to clear discharge coming from my left breast since April. I never try to 'encourage' it myself, rather it spontaneously appears/stains my bras and night shirts on a daily basis. I started seeking 'treatment' for it in beginning to mid June as follows: Initial appointment with primary care doctor who did breast exam and ran bloodwork for thyroid and prolactin plus CBC, all normal. he referred me to my ob/gyn for further exam; saw ob/gyn within 2 weeks of primary care doctor - he did a breast exam, took a sample of the discharge to send to the lab (no signs of cancerous cells) and then sent me for a mammogram a week later. had mammogram on july 12th, including an ultrasound due to dense breast tissue. I was told both imaging results came out normal .   It has been 2 weeks since the imaging and the discharge had seemed to lessen over the last couple days leading up to my period, which started yesterday. Ironically, the same day my period started, the discharge turned to a bloddy/rust color.   Should I call my doctor immediately or wait til my period is over and see if it continues? From research, I understand that this could be a sign of an intraductal papilloma and that cancer is unlikely considering my age. Given all the examinations within the past month I am not sure how to appraoch the changes/situation. I am moving to a new city (same state) this weekend so that complicates things more, as I will need to find new doctors. Any advice would be much appreciated!\n\n",

It could well be a lymph node(but if so, surely your doctor would have had it fully investigated). Rather than to speculate, it is better to show your doctor and get investigated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "HI my wife is a breast cancer survisor who completed her treatment 5 years ago. IN recent detail CT scan, found an enlarged internal Mamamary Node at the first intercostal space measuring 1.5 cm x 1.2 cm x 0.6 cm but her blood test result showing CEA = 0.2 and CA 15.3 = 4.2 both are in very good control range. What could be the problem on this enlarged IMN ? I am very worry and please advice. Doctor who had seen my wife for the past 5 years said he is 90% sure that this is nothing bad, but if to get 100% sure, we will have to do PET scan. Please advice.   Sincerely yours, Very worry husband\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Enlarged Internal Mammary Node at intercostal space",
    "content": "Hi, I very well understand your concern.Before tests are done, it is difficult to ascribe a cause for these lymph nodes. As your wife had been treated for breast cancer earlier, it will always be assumed to be a secondary deposit, unless proved otherwise.  You have not indicated what kind of a management she had received(breast conservation vs modified radical mastectomy/radiotherapy/ +/- adjuvant therapy)  The normal internal mammary lymph nodes are not routinely demonstrable on CT imaging, and it has been assumed that a lymph node with a diameter > 6 mm visualized on a CT scan probably represents malignant lymphadenopathy in patients with known recurrent breast cancer.  Now the crucial step will be to find out if that node contains malignant deposits. A PET scan is very good at identifying malignant tumors.  Unlike CT scans(anatomically based imaging), PET scans yield metabolic-based images.It is based on identifying the high metabolic activity in tumors.  The average sensitivity and specificity across all oncological applications for FDG PET are estimated at 84% and 88%, respectively. When combined with CT (PET-CT), one can get better anatomical infomation.  False-negative results can occur in lesions < 1 cm because a critical mass of metabolically active malignant cells is needed for PET diagnosis. False negatives can also occur in tumors with inherently low metabolic rates, such as bronchioloalveolar cell carcinomas and carcinoid tumors.  False-positive FDG uptake is seen in some inflammatory conditions such as pyogenic abscesses, bacterial pneumonias,  aspergillosis, and granulomatous diseases such as sarcoidosis,  tuberculosis, Wegener\u2019s granulomatosis etc.  The main disadvantage of PET is that it does not offer an  histological evidence of malignancy.  One other investigatory option is an \"image guided fine needle aspiration biopsy\". this is technically feasible for the internal mammary nodes.The complication rates are extremely low. pneumothorax is considered to be a theoretical but extremely remote risk in experienced hands.One other concern is seeding of tumour cells along the needle-track, but this is also considered quite rare. The distinct advantage is an histological proof of malignancy. False negatives are of course a concern.  In the case of your wife, it is indeed essential to know the nature of this lymph node because 5 years have elapsed since the original tumor and there are no other indicators of recurrent disease.   In such cases,the decision regarding further management has to be based on the results from a PET scan. Whether an histological proof is necessary or otherwise  before planning further therapy in a given case will be best left to the oncologist to decide.If deemed necessary, then an image guided fine needle aspiration biopsy will be an option. Good luck!\n\n",

She had been under close  monitoring all these while and her tumor marker reading is always good. She is not on any medication as the doc ( Onco ) not recommending any as he think is not required.   I am not sure how my wife and myself would storm thru this round of suspicious image again but we will be seeing the onco doc on next Tuesday for his advice.

    "title": "normal mammography, ultrasound not so normal",
    "content": "I am post menopausal.  Had early stage uterine cancer last year, Grade1A/!. Had total hysterectomy, no further treatment needed.  Had a mammography this week, the first in four years.  Mammography of both breasts  showed no suspicious areas of microcalcifications, dominant  masses or defined axillary adenopathjy in either breast.     Ultrasound was done because of dense breasts. Several cysts shown with no changes since  last u/sounds done in 2001.  However, the impression was as follows: \"new left breast area of shadowing.  Although this could represent effects of a new macrocalcification, because of the patient's personal history of uterine carcinoma, further evaluation  via a biopsy to confirm the above impression will be performed in a few days.  \"  A note was also written that this was not present in 2001.  I had the biopsy (fna) two days ago and radiologist seems quite positive that this is benign, but on the report gave me a Bi-rads 4 which freaked me out. Now I have to wait for the result which hopefully will come Monday or Tuesday.  Should I be concerned. Radiologist mentioned that if I had not had the Uterine cancer he would not have biopsied but would have had me return in three months for another ultrasound. He is pretty sure that this is benign.    But I am concerned and can't think of anything else. Would really appreciate some feedback.  Thanks. Shirley Waller\n\n",

    "title": "Re: normal mammography, ultrasound not so normal",
    "content": "Hi, Ever since their introduction, mammography and ultrasonography for applications in breast lesions, efforts have been continuing to improve their sensitivities,specificities and predictive values.  One such effort resulted in the American College of Radiology  \"Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System\" (BI-RADS-US) scoring system as a standard of comparison for rating mammograms.The score indicates the radiologist's opinion of the absence or likelihood of breast cancer(or Level of Suspicion (LOS)). An important component of the BI-RADS initiative is the lexicon, a dictionary of descriptors of specific imaging features.The BI-RADS-US lexicon is professed to be a living document, open to changes and periodic review.  The fourth edition of the BI-RADS for mammography was published (2003), along with the first BI-RADS for MRI and first BI-RADS for breast ultrasonography.    BI-RADS categories(fourth edition of the BI-RADS mammography -2003) are as follows:  Category 0:Need additional imaging evaluation  Category 1: Negative  Category 2: Benign finding  Category 3: Probably benign finding \u2013 Short Interval follow-up suggested  Category 4 (now subdivided): Suspicious abnormality \u2013 Biopsy should Be considered  Category 5: Highly suggestive of malignancy \u2013 Appropriate action should be taken. Category 6: Known biopsy-proven malignancy, treatment pending .  By subdividing category 4 into 4A, 4B and 4C(with a small , moderate , or substantial likelihood of malignancy respectively) into the mammography lexicon, it is hoped that the result better informs the physician and patient as to the level of concern regarding the lesion and mentally prepares both the clinician and the patient for the likely biopsy findings and allow them to make an informed decision on the ultimate course of action.  Approximately 10% of women will be called back to undergo repeat mammograms or ultrasound to clarify some finding observed on the first test. Chances of this happening is higher in younger women (particularly < 40 years of age),or women of any age with 'dense' breasts and those having their first mammogram(the lack of a previous film for comparison).  Apart from the BI-RADS,there have been other suggestions put forward to improve on the results obtained from imaging. Some suggested modalities are, - double reading of mammograms by radiologists (by two radiologists instead of the usual one), - computer assisted imaging diagnosis, - quadruple reading: by two radiologic technologists as second readers, in addition to two radiologists,  - systematic follow-up periods,and - BI-RADS training courses for physicians.    \"Using radiologic technicians  could be helpful in countries, like the US, where mammography radiologists are increasingly scarce\". J Natl Cancer Inst 2007;99:1162-1170  As mentioned earlier, BI-RADS 4 lesions have an enormously wide range of probability for malignancy (2 - 95%).Your radiologist was(from personal experience and judgment) leaning more towards 2 rather than 95% - in other words towards 4A than 4C! For your sake, i hope he/she turns out to be right. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, It would have been very helpful if you had given a bit more details about the breast lump such as the exact location of that swelling within the breast and what kind of biopsy had been performed(FNAB or core-needle biopsy).  It is very unlikely that any nerve had been injured.Theoratically, the potential risk of nerve injury during biopsy of a breast lump is perhaps highest for tumors in the 'axillary tail' of the breast. For tumors elsewhere in the breast, iatrogenic pneumothorax is the main concern.In any case, it would be better for you to consult your surgeon immediatly & get it sorted out. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your description suggests that you could have early lactational mastitis.Mastitis is usually classified as  - lactational or  - non-lactational. Generally, one considers mastitis as a possibility if atleast two of the following are present... - the lactating mother has fever, - lumpiness in the breast associated with pain & tenderness, - erythema of the overlying skin, or - a tense breast which continues to remain tense following breast feeding.  It may be a good idea to consult your GP for an initial assessment(examination of the breasts, body temperature etc). A total WBC count may show polymorphonuclear leucocytosis in cases of mastitis.  As you don't seem to have the other features of mastitis, antibiotic therapy may be withheld presently and you need to be observed to see how it evolves.Imaging studies may not be needed at this stage(i am aware of your family history). Your doctor will be able to guide you in this. Best wishes!\n\n",

Tamoxifen is a wonderful drug both for the treatment and prevention of breast cancer but it's important to learn as much as possible about tamoxifen and to follow up with your doctor as soon as you are worried about any new symptoms.

    "content": "Hi lizsheeba, Generally speaking, antibiotics are prescribed for bacterial related infections. The axillary lymph nodes are located in the axillae (arm pits). They drain the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma. Pain/Tenderness: When a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain is usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain may also result from hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of tenderness does not reliably differentiate benign from malignant nodes.[1] Stony-hard nodes are typically a sign of cancer, usually metastatic. Very firm, rubbery nodes suggest lymphoma. Softer nodes are the result of infections or inflammatory conditions. Suppurant nodes may be fluctuant. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. The term \"reactive in nature\" in the report essentially seems to be stating that this is a lymphatic response to an infective or inflammatory cause rather than a malignant nature. Did your physician explain why he/she is attempting a new course of antibiotics (if not inquire about an explanation). Is there a planned re-evaluation after the course is completed?

It occurs secondary to hormonal disturbances in this age. It usually lasts up to a year and a half to two years. It is inconsequential.  Since it has been persistent for more than two years, it was a good idea on your part to see your doctor. Usually, there is nothing to do except follow-up. Some doctors would check some hormone levels.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Chemotherapy for non-metastatic bc",
    "content": "The statistics I have found indicate that chemotherapy given as adjuvant therapy to women with non-metastatic breast cancer increases the 10 year survival rate by only 2 to 9 women per 100.  The other 91 to 98 women will live or die as they would have, without submitting to chemo.  Frankly, these numbers stun me.  Before I looked into this, if you had asked me I would have said that chemotherapy \"saved\" maybe 70 or 80 women per 100, which is why it is always given.    And considering that chemotherapy in not a benign treatment, but has horrible short term consequences, and life-threatening permanent side-effects, can someone please tell me why it is being given to virtually 100 per cent of women with non-metastatic breast cancer?  A woman has only a 2 to 9 per cent chance of being helped, (and 1 per cent of women on chemo will actually die of heart failure during the treatment, so that even cuts the benefits more)  - how is this a good deal?  I'm really confused here.  I can't think of any rationale for making women this sick, and putting them at such a high long term risk of heart damage, diminshment of cognitive ability and other cancers such as leukemia.  What am I missing in this picture?  Thanks for any help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello greensleeves, Thanks for using The Doctors Lounge. This is a very good question. Let me start off and I hope you agree with me that a single life saved from this fatal disease is a victory in and of itself. That said, I agree that you still have point if it were a single life. It turns out that there were 211,240 new cases of breast cancer in 2005 in the United States alone. Now if you do the arithmetic you will find that this means a significant number of women will become cured from this disease. Now take into account the rest of the world and you realize that there are many many people that would benefit.  Let me further explain that the numbers you provided reflect overall survival at 10 years, meaning that they take into account death from cardiomyopathy due to chemotherapy and virtually any cause of death to these patients.  Another point to make about the numbers you have provided is that they were able to stratify those that really benefited from those that didn't. The 2 percent increase in overall survival was found in women over the age of 50 years (postmenopausal), while the 9 percent benefit was found in those that are younger. Based on these results chemotherapy is considered essential for younger women with localized disease except in a few cases, while at the same time it is not always the prefered form of adjuvant therapy for older women. In this case many oncologists preferring to use anti-hormonal therapy as opposed to chemotherapy for older women whenever that is possible.  Many of my patients have made it through and that's what makes it all worth it in the end. They do not suffer from any disabilities but are in excellent physical and mental shape. Believe me no medical oncologist would tell you that he enjoys prescribing toxic chemotherapy regimens. Given the choice, we always opt for the less toxic option. I hope I have answered at least part of your question. Best regards,\n\n",

I am about a week away from my menstrual cycle, so I am unsure if it has anything to do with that. I told my mom, a registered nurse, about it, and she informed me that it is most likely a cyst that will dissappear after my period. I am not yet convinced because it is so painful. My chest seems to ache from within when i move a certain way, and sometimes when I inhale and exhale. I am only 22 years old, so I highly doubt it is cancer, especially as I have no family history. I am concerned that it could be something serious though...I have had breast pain and small lumps before, but nothing like this that has lasted so long. Please help give me some answers about this!

    "title": "Re: Large lump over right breast",
    "content": "Hi, Breast cysts develop through processes of lobular involution and,  are found mostly in perimenopausal women.  It is uncommon to find cysts in women younger than age 35.  Cysts may develop in postmenopausal women, but  this is distinctly uncommon unless the woman is taking HRT.  While examining breast lumps, we first try to determine whether the 'lump' is a 'discreet' (well demarcated on all sides from the breast tissue) lump or not.If it is a 'discreet' lump, it needs to be evaluated by \"Triple assessment\" - the components of which are as follows... - clinical breast examination - imaging of the breast and - a biopsy of the suspected lesion.  If it is not discreet, and if it is related to the menstrual cycles, then it may be 'lumpiness' caused by FCC(fibrocystic changes).  However, i am not able to explain the increase in pain due to positional changes that you mention.It is better to consult your GP for initial assessment. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am concerned about sudden axillary lymph node pain that has begun this past week. It is concentrated on the upper part of my right breast arching down towards the armpit. There does not appear to be any swelling on any of the lymph nodes although pressing on them does create a tenderness and pain (about a 6 on a scale of 10)  I do not have any swelling in any other lymph nodes nor do I currently have a virus, fever, or bacterial infection.  I do monthly breast exams and have found no evidence of a lump. The pain seems to increase with use of my arm (if I raise it up it tends to feel heavy in that area)  For a few days the pain seemed to radiate down my arm specifically below the elbow with tenderness between my pinky and ring finger. Ibuprofen seems to alleviate this pain. I also have tenderness in the shoulder (front area) that seems to be somewhat muscular in nature  I also have a strain to my trapezius muscle on that same size which is creating tension in my upper back. Massage has alleviated this pain to a degree but I have had a spastic Trapezius for years.  I have regular menstrual periods and am expecting my next period to begin in 2-3 days. I am 34 years old, do not have children  Any insight to what may be causing this sudden lymph node pain (if that's what it appears to be) would be greatly appreciated. I am currently uninsured so do not want to rush to a doctor and pay out of pocket for multiple tests unless it seems like a severe situation.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your description of the 'lymph node pain' first led me to think of a problem in the 'axillary tail' of the breast. But your subsequent post made it less likely.   If your pain is indeed due to the 'spastic trapezius', it is more likely to be over the outer aspect of the shoulder blade (scapula).  As the pain is now felt in the region 'from elbow to wrist', it appears more like a radicular pain referred from your cervical spine.  The trapezius area is supplied by the C4 segment.The skin over the axillary area is supplied by the C4 & 5 segments. C5 & 6 segments supply the outer aspect of the forearm.  The distribution of the pain in your case could be due to cervical spondylopathy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, If this is a dermatological condition such as a pimple, it will go away on its own in a while.  If not, it's always safest to have it checked out.  You could start with your family doctor.  If there is any cause for alarm, a referral to a specialist would be made.  Men do get breast cancer, though much more rarely than women, so true lumps should not be ignored.  Chances are that it is something temporary and harmless but it's best to be safe so after giving it time to resolve, check with your doctor.  Good luck\n\n",

    "content": "Hi  dansta92, The nodule that you are describing could be a sebaceous cyst or an enlarged Montgomery's tubercle(usually enlarges in women during pregnancy and lactation).You say that yor breasts are larger than usual-this raises the question whether you have gynecomastia(considering your age).This is due to an imbalance of the male/female sex hormones- which can theoratically at least cause an enlargement of the Montgomery's tubercle(whether these tubercles exist in males is disputed). The only case report of this entity occurring in a male patient was published by Farina et al. in 1996. (Farina MC, Soriano ML, Escalonilla P, Pique E, Martin L, Barat A, et al. Unilateral areolar sebaceous hyperplasia in a male. Am J Dermatopathol 1996; 18: 417 \u2013 419.)  These authors state that areolar sebaceous hyperplasia may represent hyperplasia of Montgomery tubercules. (Pl Note:I have only included this detailed info for the sake of completion).  I hope this information may be useful to you.\n\n",

I suppose I did the right thing, but it seems a bit bizzarr something so simpled needed to be chopped out, that there was no other way. But alas, I shouldn't rant I like my Doctor very much.

    "content": "Hello,  It is reassuring that you felt no abnormalities in the breasts, but still direct clinical examination is essential.  It is common to have lymph node enlargement following infection or inflammation in the area drained by this lymph node group, they regress in size but never to normal size following recovery from infection or inflammation. Axillary lymph nodes enlargement are commonly seen also in females who have fibroadenosis (benign condition) and are felt as non specific lymph nodes.  These nodes are felt as mobile, soft to firm, less than 1cm.Warning signs include increase in their number, size or when they become matted or fixed to the skin or to the underlying structures.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to inform him with any symptoms, at least to be reassured.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Lymph nodes in the axilla drain the following areas... a) chest wall (including the breasts)  b) abdominal wall above the level of the navel c) back of the chest upto level of the navel d) entire upper limb. Although we tend to think of breast being the source of the primary problem, we should keep in mind the above facts and look for pathologies in these areas as well. Small boils, moles or other skin lesions in some of these areas may not be too obvious (for ex:over the upper back). Ofcourse the breasts have to be critically examined to rule out any pathology.\n\n",

I found a lump a few weeks ago that was pea sized and moved from the breast surface and back inside tissue.  It was gone for a week or so and now 5 days ago, I found another mass in the exact area. It is just under the skin. It's a very small pebble size bump that has a tail attached (feels like a vein?) It was originally about 3/4 inch long and now today is about 1 1/4 inch long and the tail now curves like a fish hook.  If I press down on the skin, it appears white.  It is not movable. There is no pain, redness or swelling in the area. While being examined, the nurse did find the original lump as well. It had moved deep into the tissue.  They have requested medicaid benefits for diagnostic treatment, but it will take about 6 weeks to get it and see the doctor to schedule the sonogram. I am really scared, since my sister has been battling breast cancer for 5 years now and this thing seems to be growing rapidly.  Please help with any advise or comforting news...\n\n",

She felt it and was not concerned, said it felt very benign. After a 2nd visit to her, she referred me to a breast surgeon, to ease my worried mind (even though she didn't feel the visit to be necessary). The surgeon also was not worried upon feeling the lump...but did send me for an ultraound just to give me peace of mind. The ultrasound showed normal breast tissue even when the radiologist put the \"wand\" directly onto the lumpier area. After all of this, I still worry DAILY that I have breast cancer, and no one is detecting it. Am I being completely irrational?! I touch the spot daily....numerous times...is that why its not completely going away?

    "content": "Dear shopgirlstl; Your fear is neither irrational nor overstated. Breast cancer is a scary diagnosis that strikes women, often seemingly without any rhyme or reason. Don't worry, you're not doing anything to 'cause' this by touching the area. It's just a fact for many women, breasts are lumpy affairs. That makes it all the harder to pick out something abnormal from something that is a 'normal' lump.   The first step is to not feel guilty for advocating for your healthcare questions. The second step is to establish open and good communication with your primary care MD about your fears. Thirdly, understand your options for evaluation Mammogram, Ultrasound, digital Mammogram, MRI, and biopsy. While there are costs and risks associated with MRIs and invasive biopsy. You need to discuss with your physician where your comfort level lies. The reality is, we are at risk for many potential health problems every day, from the flu to car accidents to breast cancer. None of us can eliminate our risk for this disease, we can only understand our bodies, understand what the most effective screening tests are and appropriately minimize the risk.  This article provides a more in-depth overview of evaluation of an area of concern from risk stratification and a review of the spectrum of imaging modalities including biopsy.http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/263733-overview  Good Luck to you, this is only the beginning of a life-long vigilance for this disease and information is your greatest weapon to protect yourself.

It turned dark red, has a center, and does not heal. It has been a three weeks now. It seems to start to heal and even sheds a scab, but instead goes through a cycle of open wound/scab over and over. It does not hurt.   It's appearance: Dark red circular wound with a center that is sometimes an open hole. Sometimes in the open hole it has white \"goey\" skin that I try to take out, but it is firmly attached. Dry scaling skin around the \"wound\". No obvious lump under it.   What could it be? What should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 30 y.o. female with no family history of breast cancer.  I found a lump in my right breast a short while ago.  Over the next few weeks I had 2 sets of mammograms and an ultrasound done.  I called my gyn daily to get the results of the tests, and when they finally came in the FNP returned my call.  She stated that it was benign, and when I questioned her further she said it was an enlarged lymph node.  Not being a pushy person, and I didn't really have any questions prepared for this scenario I let it go and hung up.  Now I can't find any info online for why I would have an enlarged lymph node in my breast.  From what I'm finding it must not be a common place, because I have yet to find anything.    So, my question is...Is this something that should be further tested?  It is still the same size as when I found it about a month and a half ago.  The only other symptom I am having is that occasionally my breast will ache slightly.  It's usually only for a few seconds and it quits.  It occurs maybe 1-2 times a day.    Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear missy_79;  Sorry for the delay in posting a response to your query. I hope you have followed with your physician to discuss the continued enlargement of the lymph node.  Lymph nodes are the 'clearinghouses' for our body, transporting excess fluid or WBCs that may be battling some infection or irritation. thus it's normal for lymph nodes to be enlarged, as they do their work. Importantly though, it's not always normal for a lymph node to be enlarged over a protracted period of time. This should be monitored and re-examined at intervals by your care provider so that they can make a better decision whether this needs to be monitored for resolution or whether further testing should be considered.  Please let us know if any other questions have surfaced? Kind regards, Jan\n\n",

It does NOT hurt when I touch it. It is not soft but it is not hard either. It feels like only ONE. You can not see it on the outside of my body. There is no buldge and no swellingness. It does kind of move. It has been there for quite some time, i'd say months. Some people say it could be a cyst or just tissue inside the breast. I've never felt that before. I thought women should get their breast exams at the age of 40. Is it necessary for me to get one at my age?! I'm only 22. I don't even know what kind of doctor to go to.\n\n",

Also it may not be posssible to tell if it is solid or cystic clinically (many breast cysts feel solid clinically & ultrasonography is good at differentiating a cyst from solid lumps).If a breast lump is felt,it should be investigated irrespective of the age.Breast cancers do occur in younger individuals.Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 27 year old female who is average weight and generally healthy.  For the past 4 months I have been experiencing pain in my armpit, down the side of my chest, in my shoulder, in my shoulder blade and in my bicep.  It occurs only on the right side (and I am right handed) and has been pretty steady.  I have seen 3 doctors about this.  The first one did a breast exam to feel for lumps and checked my armpits to feel for lumps.  She said there was nothing.  I still can't feel any lumps.  The first doctor said that it was probably from muscle strain (I was a waitress at the time).  I saw another doctor about a month later and she said the same thing (however, I had quit my job 2 weeks prior to seeing the doctor), she also said that it could be some kind of trauma done to my arm because of the repitative motion and that it can radiate pain into the armpit.  I saw another doctor a week later who basically said the same thing.  It has been over a month since I quit my waitressing job, wouldn't the pain have gone away by now if it was caused by that?  None of the doctors ever did an ultrasound, an MRI, CT or CAT scan to check my lymph nodes.  I know that sometimes they can be swollen, but you can't feel them.  I am always paranoid about cancer, any kind, breast or lymphoma.  I can't help but be worried since they have not done any kind of test to look inside my body, just felt around outside.  Should I not be too concerned since I have seen 3 doctors of which none of them seemed to concern about this, or should I press for some kind of test that will look at my lymph nodes?  Is it a necessary test?  Any information that you can provide would be helpful, because I am constantly stressing about this and the pain gets worse when I am stressed out.  Thanks.\n\n",

The second possibility to explain all this is a muscular pain-due to strain in the shoulder girdle.How are you now? Hopefully you are better.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi typeL, Unfortunately,you have not mentioned your age as well as the duration of your problem. In men, the breasts are rudimentary and present as  small, rounded and flat discs  under the areolae.Unlike in women,there is very little fatty tissue around the breasts (except in the elderly, where one may develop gynecomastia) and they sit right on the pectoralis major muscles.Thus the discs and nipples are more prone to injuries. your injury was perhaps significant enough to result in a post traumatic inflammation in the breast disc and nipple.This should be expected to sponteneously get better in due course.NSAIDs may be useful in the initial few days.Cheers!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi..  I'm a 31-year old female with a family history of breast cancer.  I had have an enlarged lymph node in my left armpit for approx. 5 months.  It is hard and fixed to the underlying tissue and has been gradually increasing in size.  I have had an ultrasound that showed an abnormality (ratio of cortex to hilium?) within the node and it measured approx. 1.4cm.  Today I had and FNA as well as a mammogram.  The Dr. said that she believes it to be benign and I shouldn't worry, but obviousy I am because most everything I have read leads me to believe this could be malignant.  I also recently had an MRI due to a still un-diagnosed thyroid condition which showed I have another enlarged lymph node (approx 1.2cm) under my chin (right submandilar).  Could that be related in some way to the enlarged lymph node under my arm?  Or possibly to the thryoid condition?  I guess I'm just trying to look for answers because the Dr. today was pretty vague and unreassuring.  I appreciate any words of wisdom.   Thank You! ~DancingMama\n\n",

Do not hesitate to seek another opinion if you feel your current doctor has not fully addressed your concerns.

Lymphomas of the thyroid are known and can be associated with lymph nodal enlargement elsewhere.

    "title": "Re: Cysts that \"cluster\" in breast?",
    "content": "Hi, Breast cysts develop through processes of lobular involution and,  are found mostly in perimenopausal women.  It is uncommon to find cysts in women younger than age 35.  Cysts may develop in postmenopausal women, but  this is distinctly uncommon unless the woman is taking HRT. I am unaware of your age or if you are on HRT. Broadly one may classify cysts in the breast as 'simple' cysts and 'complex' (or 'atypical') cysts. Among the complex cysts, there is one variety known as 'sponge-like cluster of cysts'.Your lesion may belong to this variety.Complex cysts generally need to be more carefully assessed, followed up or treated. Solitary cysts can be aspirated and the aspirate subjected to cytological assessment.This may be impractical in a 'sponge-like cluster of cysts'. Therefore, i would be inclined to suggest an excision biopsy of this lesion. Please consult with your surgeon and discuss the pros and cons. Good luck to you!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 35 year old woman diagnosed by core needle biospsy with comedo DCIS.  My DCIS did not show on a mammogram and did not have calcifications it did however form a lump, apparently very rare.  I currently had an MRI.  It said that there was a 6cm contiguos area superiorly measuring 6cm.  The radiologist says it is worrisome for multifocal dcis or invasive carcinoma.  What I want to know is could this be something else more benign.  I had had the biopsy 3 weeks prior (5 weeks not) and still have a discoloration on my breast from the procedure which was not there before.  Could this MRI finding have been caused from the biopsy?  Could it be anything other than cancer.  If my DCIS is high grade, but has no calcifications could it really be that widespread?  I appreciate any info anyone can share.\n\n",

What I understood from your message is that we are dealing with DCIS that was removed by lumpectomy and is to be followed by radiation therapy. What were the pathology details for the latest lumpectomy in terms of grade, surgical margin etc.  Your concern regarding the inflammatory breast cancer cannot be resolved over the internet unfortunately. You must be examined. Whether you are at increased risk of inflammatory breast cancer because of your previous diagnoses is unlikely. Inflammatory breast cancer is a very aggressive form of breast cancer. It usually presents unilaterally and not bilaterally. Again, nothing can be excluded though.   Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  I thought that I had replied the other day, but clearly I did something wrong. My apologies!  In January I had a lumpectomy that removed both ILC, and LCIS, right next to each other. The ILC was .7 cm, T1N0, huge margins, ER/PR +, Her2 -. I wanted to do brachytherapy and there was quite a delay in getting started. When they did a mammogram as part of the workup they found DCIS. It was about .1 cm, but one of the margins was not OK, so they did a re/wide excision and the margins are now acceptable. Tis. This tumor was about 6 cm from the first and below the areola. I guess this makes these tumors multi-centric. I don't know what this does to my likelihood of recurrence, and what is the best treatment to keep that number low without opting for treatment that has significant complications.  At the same time I am having this other issue with a reddish splotchy area on my right breast, and a nipple that is flat to slightly inverted. On my left breast I have a small pink swollen area at the bottom of the areola and below. I have seen both my GP and an oncologist and have been on two antibiotics (I'm 5 days into the second antibiotic and there is no change). All I am certain of is that this is abnormal for me and I am very concerned.  In the meantime, I have started radiation and have had 4 whole breast treatments (180 centigrays/day) of 25, to be followed by 8 boosts (200 centigrays/day).  Anything you can suggest for me to follow up with would be helpful!  Thanks for your input,  Tekkie50\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Actually this has also been studied. A study conducted at the Royal Marsden Hospital examined the disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS) of the 368 patients starting chemotherapy within 21 days of surgery (group A) who were compared with 793 patients commencing chemotherapy >or= 21 days after surgery (group B). There was no difference in any of the outcome parameters (OS, DFS) between both groups.[1]  So while delaying chemotherapy beyond 12 weeks is bad for you, as mentioned above, receiving it earlier than 3 weeks after surgery is no different than receiving it later than 3 weeks (but within 12weeks).  It really depends on the treatment plan that will be individualized by coordination between your surgeon and your medical oncologist.  Good luck with your chemotherapy!  REFERENCES: =========== 1.

    "title": "Re: Precautionary chemo?",
    "content": "Hello,  To answer your question, the idea behind adjuvant chemotherapy is to kill any remaining microscopic malignant cells that are not removed by surgery. Another important thing to remember, is that breast cancer is considered a systemic disease due to its propensity to metastasize.   When taking an overall look at population statistics, there's been a decrease in the cause-specific mortality from breast cancer in every Western nation over the past decade, and this has been mainly attributed to the use of adjuvant chemotherapy.   As for trials, it has been proven beyond doubt that adjuvant chemotherapy improves cure rates after mastectomy, decreases recurrences and improves survival.[1]  Clinical trials are like controlled experiments so you would want to have two groups of patients: one group receiving chemotherapy after surgery and another group without chemotherapy and follow these patients up to see which group has a better outcome.  Trials like these were conducted in the 70s when it wasn't yet known whether adjuvant chemotherapy was better than mastectomy alone. I am adding a reference to the 20 year follow up of the trial by Bonadonna et al.[2]  Trials such as these would never be allowed nowadays, since it would be unethical to prevent patients from the benefit of chemotherapy for the sake of an experiment. However, in the 70's, when it still wasn't known, many other trials were conducted. A group of statisticians meets every 5 years in Oxford University to report on the follow up results of 60 trials involving some 28,764 women that were conducted in the 1990's.[3] The last report was published in 2005 on the 15 year survival and recurrence rates for these patients.[3]  Adjuvant chemotherapy is not for everyone with breast cancer however, and recently genetic analysis of the tumor sample has allowed a better prediction of who can be safely be excluded from adjuvant chemotherapy.

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better already. Inflammatory breast cancer is a rather rare but important entity. It accounts for less than 5% of all breast cancers. It's main importance is that it is a rather aggressive disease and it can easily be confused with breast infection.   The median age at diagnosis is approximately 60 years and it tends to be more common in African Americans.   Generally speaking you should seek medical attention as soon as you develop breast inflammation. Your doctor will prescribe the appropriate antibiotics/antiinflammatory drugs. If the condition does not improve by the first week / does not resolve completely by the 2nd week then your doctor may order a skin biopsy.   Another problem with this potentially lethal form of breast cancer is that it can present without a dominant mass (lump) in the breast.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  Good question. Flat epithelial atypia is a proliferation of epithelial cells in the breast that show low grade atypical features that don't meat the criteria of carcinoma in situ or atypical ductal hyperplasia. Both carcinoma in situ and atypical ductal hyperplasia are considered premalignant lesions. Hence you could think of flat epithelial atypia as 'pre-pre-malignant lesions'.   The important thing is that they do not represent a significant risk of recurrence or of progression to premalignant lesions. The probability of that happening is rather low. Treating these cases as if they were premalignant is considered overtreatment.  I hope that answers your question. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Apparently, your radiotherapist was always in favor of chemotherapy from the start. What does your oncologist think? The PET scan being negative is reassuring. It's a good negative test - ie, its a good test to exclude things such as cancer / inflammatory processes.   No I don't think you would be stupid at all to follow up on your issue. That you are concerned is completely understandable.  Obviously, I cannot exclude anything especially a CT scan that I have not even seen. All your other tests though, are more consistent with early localized disease as opposed to metastatic disease.  Most cases with metastasis at presentation will at least have some evidence of spread to the lymph nodes. I am assuming your sentinel lymph node was negative.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

I have finished the radiotherapy and am now on 20mg Tamoxifen once daily.  I had my CYP2D6 genotype done which shows I have one normal allele and one inactive allele making me a reduced metaboliser of tamoxifen. I am perimenopausal - last 2 blood tests showed raised LH and FSH and low oestradiol.  I haven't had a period for 2 months and have mild hot flushes at night. I also have only one ovary, although CT scan showed \"bilateral' ovarian cysts.  I also have a few small fibroids. Should I consider having an oopherectomy/hysterectomy and take an aromatase inhibitor?  Is intermediate metabolisation of tamoxifen sufficient? I'd appreciate any comments/information you can give.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It's good to hear from you. Another excellent question. Unfortunately, this is a very debatable issue. To the best of my knowledge it's currently not standard practice to test for CYP2D6 genotypes in premenopausal women. The finding creates a dilemma because while we are certain about the reduction in metabolism of tamoxifen to its active metabolite (endoxifen) we are not certain about the long term outcome of stopping tamoxifen and giving an alternative form of therapy. Currently, postmenopausal women have an equally efficacious (if not better) alternative with aromatase inhibitors. However, the use of AI in premenopasual women in combination with ovarian ablation is still undergoing prospective testing (SOFT, TEXT trials).  One option to discuss with your doctor is to undergo ovarian suppression and either continue or stop using tamoxifen. Ovarian suppression alone is a valid option in premenopausal women.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It all looks good so far. The size of the tumor is less than 1cm and the ER positivity along with negative lymph nodes are all very good prognostic signs. Her age and menopausal status are also very important. The likelihood of spread are very small given the size of the tumor and the clear lymph nodes and the absence of symptoms. The HER2 being higher than normal may need confirmation depending on what you mean by higher than normal. HER2 has to be +++ by immunohistochemistry if it isn't it would need to be confirmed by another test for HER2 called FISH.  That said, it is mandatory that she be staged for distant spread.  Please keep us updated!   Oh! ...and I hope you're getting those checkups!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: IDC with HER2",
    "content": "Hello again,  In trying to estimate prognosis and in making a treatment decision for breast cancer her doctor has to determine the stage of the disease as well as what we call prognostic factors.  Staging involves both the pathological findings as well as the radiology. If a patient is discovered to have metastasis (cancer spread) in a distant organ by radiology then that is considered stage IV. So your sister is still being staged. Once her scans are out her doctor will be able to determine her stage.  Regarding prognostic factors, these are findings that tell the doctor how serious a case is. By serious we mean the risk of recurrence as well as the overall prognosis. If a patient has poor prognostic factors then the doctor may take that as an indication for more aggressive management.  Old age, menopausal status, lymph node negativity, ER positivity, small tumor size (<2cm), pathological grade as well as lymphovascular invasion are among the many parameters that her doctor has to consider. Her2 is also an important prognostic factor when it is elevated.  There's nothing you can do now but wait until she completes her scans. All in all please note that barring any unwelcome surprises in her radiology, her cancer was caught at an extremely early stage which is reason for optimism.  Please let me know when the results of her scans come out.\n\n",

In addition some breast cancer patients who are not receiving either drug can still suffer from hot flashes because of chemotherapy induced menopause.  Rather than give you a whole list of methods for the treatment of hot flashes I will refer you to this excellent resource: click here!  Please note that one of the most effective drugs used in the treatment of hot flashes, antidepressants known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, can decrease the metabolism of tamoxifen and may (we don't know for sure) decrease the efficacy of tamoxifen as a result.

    "content": "I thought male practitioners were to have a chaperone during sensitive exams?  Should I be concerned that my male oncologist did a breast exam without anyone else in the room?    At first, I didn't think anything of it, he seemed quite professional, but the exam was very intense and much more involved and aggressive than I am used to.  Again, I dismissed it, thinking that he's just doing a very thorough job since there was actually a problem (I have some sort of fibroid cyst).  In fact, I would have walked away without any misgivings, just thinking that he was more thorough than my other doctors, and that's a good thing, yes?    But then, just before I left, I asked if he was sure this was not at all related to my lupus diagnosis, and he assured me that it wasn't, while reaching out and touching my cheek.  I thought that was creepy -- it's an intimate, romantic sort of a touch, and would have been disturbed by it had anyone else done it that wasn't a romantic interest.  If he had touched my shoulder, for instance, I would have been reassured rather than uncomfortable.  After that, I felt less comfortable about the rest of it and the more I think about it, the less comfortable I feel about going back in 6 weeks.  I don't want to be unfair to him by overreacting, and I feel perhaps I'm not a good judge of this sort of thing because I do have a history of childhood sexual abuse and therefore may be overly sensitive to they way people touch me.  My sister said it was just creepy, and advised me to bring along my own chaperone if I was in doubt at all, but there is no one who can go with me, since I have to drive quite far and the whole ordeal takes up half the day.  Should he have a chaperone/assistant in the room, and am I overreacting to the rest of it?  Thanks for your help! -Lela\n\n",

Generally speaking when physicians examine patients they do have an assistant especially when the opposite gender is examined to avoid any misgivings. I do understand how touching your cheek verses your shoulder would make you feel very uncomfortable and although it could have been innocent it is unusual. I would certainly suggest that you have someone accompany you on your visit. If this is not possible for that particular day then rearrange your schedule for when it is possible.

They scheduled me for an ultrasound which I did today at 2:00, and the radiologist took ALOT of pictures. She also told me that she recommends that I see a breast surgeon. She also says she found a fibrocystic cysts amoung the other masses viewed?????? Please let me know what to expect. I would like to thank you in advance for your help!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Abnormal Mammogram results leading to Ultrasound",
    "content": "Hello --  While I don't mean to minimize in any way the concern for potential problems, I have to tell you this is a fairly common scenario. First, the report states the breasts are asymetrical, which is a very common situation -- some would say it is completely normal -- but it has to be mentioned in the  report, as does anything which doesn't conform to the standard of absolute normal. As for the \"residual fibroglandular tissue\" being \"patchy in a nodular assymetrical pattern with axillary and intramammary lymph nodes bilaterally,\" this is merely an observation by the radiologist and is not specific for anything, although it suggests there may be some nodules which are not normal or desireable. These can be fatty, calcification,  or, sometimes, tumors (malignant or benign). The next, logical and standard, step is the ultrasound, and many shots are necessary because most breast tissue wont be  still the way other body parts tend to be, and there are many  angles to cover. I only mention all this because it is so common a followup to mammography, and while it is totally prudent and sensible, in itself it doesn't mean anything except that you didn't get to walk away with a perfectly \"clean\" mammogram, a very, very common occurence. Fibrocystic cysts are dense breast tissue and fibrocystic breast disease is a common, benign, but often painful problem which can often be corrected by very minor surgery. Since fibrous cysts also sometimes are considered a sign of an increased risk for future breast cancer (even though they themselves are benign), it's often considered worthwhile to remove them if found, mainly to remove the risk factor and  to create a \"clean\" background for future mammogram studies.   The radiologist is following standard (and very sensible) protocol by letting you know about the presence of a fibrous cyst,  and the \"other masses\", a comment which really deserved more explanation, but radiologists are notoriously cryptic, preferring to have a surgeon explain what may or may not be there, especially when the radiologist doesn't actually know. The \"other masses\" are most likely fatty tissue or calcified lymph nodes, but the fibrous cyst is worth knowing about and may be worth having removed. A breast surgeon, like any other sort of surgeon, is the best consult source because of a surgeon's exquisite knowlege of specialized anatomy (in this case, the female breast).  It doesn't necessarily mean the radiologist feels you need to have surgery, but that you should have the pictures evaluated by a breast surgeon, who knows this territory best and can make the best suggestion as to what needs or does not need to be done (if anything).  Your study, so far, is fairly uneventful. This doesn't mean you won't worry, because until  you've seen the breast surgeon you won't know exactly what's going on or what may be recommended be done about it (again, if anything). Still, this is a very common scenario, so I hope you won't read too much into it, other than what is fairly certain, which is that there is a fibrous cyst, which could become a problem in the future, although a benign one.   I hope this helps clarify the situation for you. I really wish doctors (especially radiologists) would either take the time to explain more clearly what their reports mean or just refer the patient without all the extra information. It isn't usually helpful to the patient,  who usually aren't able to interpret them.   Good luck to you and please do follow up with us  here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sore tender breasts",
    "content": "Hello --  Breast tenderness of acute onset is usually either due to impending menstrual period, use of birth control pills such as Microgynon, or some inflammatory process. You already qualify for at least two of these three, so I would suggest you wait for your period to begin and if the breast tenderness doesn't resolve before or during, to then see a doctor promptly. The granular texture you describe as feeling in several places (including your breasts) is more suggestive of an inflammatory process, but because of the pills and the impending period, this may all change rather abruptly. Again, if it does not, you'll need to get yourself in for an exam. While this hasn't happened before, many things don't happen until they do, and breast tenderness is one of the more frequently reported side effects of Microgynon as well as, of course, premenstrual syndrome. The achiness you've been experiencing could be a part of this (a new premenstrual syndrome for you, but possibly caused by two years of Microgynon). Again, if all this doesn't resolve around the time of your period (or if your period fails to arrive, which also can happen with Microgynon) then by all means have yourself seen. I don't think this sounds like a serious problem, but it's also something that, while probably par for the course where the contraceptive is concerned, would not be so once you're done taking it and have had your period.   I hope this is helfpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here. Update us also as to how things are going.\n\n",

Please note that even physical examination by a trained physician is not conclusive and many doctors request a mammogram in addition to the exam to be sure.  A painless lump discovered while a woman is showering is a classic presentation of breast cancer. That doesn't mean that you should be alarmed but you should understand the importance of getting checked.  Breast cancer is not the only cause of a breast lump but its surely the most dangerous and should be excluded right away.  My best to you,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for your question.   You should be evaluated by a physician in order for your condition to be assessed properly. Without an examination it would be impossible for any one to tell what is wrong.   This could be related to repeated physical trauma from clothes which would render the nipple area slightly inflamed and this could make them tender to touch. On the other hand, there may be a cyst which has become infected / causes discomfort.   Male breast cancer is a rare condition especially at your age. However, without an examination nothing can be excluded.  Since it has been going on for so long, I would strongly recommend that you pay a visit to the doctor's office ASAP.  Best regards and keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I am 28 year old and have been noticing changes in my left breast for 2 years. 2 years ago i wok up one morning and my breast had doubed in seize, so I saw a doc and had it scanned which showed nothing. Then a year ago I noticed a lump in the same breast and again had it scanned, this time it showed a fibroid which the doc said was normal and told me not to worry , but get it scanned every year. This year I have noticed another lump in my opposite armpit and still have the first lump. I have also lost 25 kilograms in 8 weeks (unintentionally), I have had an ultrasound and I  am alittle worried as I carn't make sense of the results, can you help me??? I do have a doc's appointment but cannot get in to see him for three weeks. ( he must be good then right?? ha ha)    Here are the results:-there are small lymph nodes with normal morphology in the axillae bilaterally. Between 9 and 10 o'clock in the right breast laterally, there is a 10 x 7 x 3mm well-defined hypoechoic lesion with a fatty hilum in keeping with a small intramammary node. There are small foci of calcification at 3 and 9 o'clock in the left breast. Do I need to worry or is this normal?  Thankyou so much for your time\n\n",

If this is bilateral and symmetrical it could very well be a normal component of your breast and require no further interference on your part. I am unable to assess the condition of course but has wearing a bra helped?  If it is unilateral then one possibility is a fibroadenoma (a benign tumor) which is very common and tends to move around in the breast. Depending on the doctor's assessment it may require surgery.   Either way, you need to be checked by a doctor.\n\n",

Given the information you have provided you may be at increased risk. However, one important factor would be whether you have are positive for the genetic test or not (BRCA1/2). Many factors are taken together when assessing risk. Please do not forget to discuss with your doctor whether other options for breast cancer prevention are appropriate for your case.  The results of your diagnostic test will also mandate the therapeutic options.   Please keep us updated.\n\n",

He performed a setinel biopsy at the time and told me he took out 4 lymp nodes.   I was shocked the other day when he then told me that I am the first ever out of hundreds of his patients that all 4 samples contained no lymp nodes at all but were fatty tissue that the dye marked as hot spots. He said this is good news and he could not feel or see enlarged nodes. He said not to worry but my concerns are If the dye never reached the nodes in my arm pit then  why not? also is there a chance that the lymp drainage would have diverted to another set of lymp nodes to my body elsewhere where a tumour may develope?  He has not explained all this to me. I am now on tamoxifen and will under go radiation therapy as the treatment.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Thanks for your post. I have to agree this is a very strange situation. Sentinel lymph node biopsies are very accurate when a lymph node is sampled. I do not really know what the prospects are when lymph nodes are not sampled but I think the outcome would be similar to not evaluating the axillary lymph nodes in the first place.  Many things are taken into consideration, but mainly your risk of metastasis. I think you should have a frank discussion with your doctors not about what the causes of failure for your test but about the implications it may have in the assessment of your outlook.  Please understand that I am not in a position to disagree with your doctor. In fact I do not, I am just saying he is the only one that can answer this question.  As for your second question: no I don't think the dye could have spread to another region. The breast drains to the axillary region of lymph nodes and we use the dye to help determine which lymph node within that region is the most likely to harbor metastasis.   The other option is axillary lymph node dissection which is associated with significant morbidity. Please keep me updated!\n\n",

    "content": "July 2 I noticed a swollen and slightly red left breast.  Doctor gave me antibiotics.  Didn't help so sent me for mammogram.  An ultrasound there and I was told that I most likely had Inflammatory Breast Cancer.  Surgeon did skin biopsy; negative.  Did another skin biopsy; negative.  One week of antibiotics and steroids; didn't help.  Surgeon did 4 skin and breast tissue biopsies; negative.  Breast became more rigid after surgery.  Ran 11 different blood tests for everything, but looking for any autoimmune problem (lupus, rheumatoid arthritis,...) and cancer markers (SED?); nothing alarming in results.  Sent to oncologist.  He ordered CAT scan.  Stomach, lungs and right breast okay; diagnosed with IBC with two tumors and lymph node involvement.  Followed up with ultrasound; \"tumor\" proved to be fluids from the surgery.  Performed 5 needle samples of the lymph node; negative.   Oncologist sent me to dermatologist.  She put me on Prednisone and steroid cream; after one week it appeared slightly less rigid but could be recovery from the surgery.  Last visit she increased my dosage of Prednisone and put me on an antibiotic.    Meantime, oncologist has scheduled me for a PET scan.  All the doctors seem to be baffled by my symptoms.  Oncologist said we may just have to wait and watch.  Dermatologist thinks she knows what is happening and is treating me, but her treatment hasn't worked yet.  This has gone on for over 2 months.  Is there anything more that should be being done by these doctors?\n\n",

You did not mention and I' curious whether the doctors you are seeing have checked for an elevation in tumor markers for breast CA ( CEA,         CA 15-3 , and CA 27-29.  Asuuming of course that they have the PET scan should be the last and definitive step in determining whether what you are dealing with sould be treated as IBC.  PET scanning determines the function of aberrant radiologic findings by measuring the degree of metabolic activity in any suscipious looking areas and gives a better indication of whether they may or may not be a malignancy.

    "content": "Hello,  It is true that tissues previously exposed to radiation tend to interfere with certain types of reconstruction based on implant induced tissue expansion.   However delayed (post-RT) reconstructive surgery can be done using normal skin flaps in place of the radiated skin. The possibility to do in your case would need a consultation of a plastic surgeon who is experienced in breast reconstruction for patients with irradiated tissues.  The plastic surgeon is more aware whether this is applicable or not in each specific case.  There are different types of breast prosthesis and bras that may be helpful and may be supplied by different nonprofit organizations. You better also ask for an advice about this issue from your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is very difficult to tell what this lump could be without direct clinical examination. According to the information you have provided it could be a breast lump due to changes in the level of sex hormones.  Physiological changes during puberty may result in breast enlargement and the feeling of lump like swelling (retroareolar) in one or both breasts (gynecomastia). This occurs as a result of physiological hormonal changes and is expected to resolve in few months in the majority of males.   To happen few years ago in one breast then in the other one now makes it more likely to be due to temporary changes in the hormonal levels that commonly occur at this period of life.  However, it may also occur due to non physiologic changes in the level of sex hormones, like endocrine diseases, or the intake of any kind of supplements or medications that may affect your hormone levels.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to seek direct medical consultation to exclude any serious causes.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I was shaving under my arms when I noticed on the side of my body, about one hand's length directly down from my arm pit, a raised portion of skin. When I felt it, it didn't hurt, but seemed to be bit larger than a quarter sized area of soft tissue mass. It is not hard, but soft and seems denseish. From certain angles in the mirror, I can't even find it. However, it is clearly raised skin at one angle.  I will make an appointment Monday, however, I want to be reassured it isn't anything.

    "content": "Hello, It is difficult to tell what this swelling could be without direct clinical examination. But according to your description at this site, this could be of lymph node, a breast tissue in the axially tail, or a fat tissue origin.  Some females have an extension of their breast tissue in the axillary tail that is felt more or less like a lump of a consistency similar to the breast and is usually painless. It is not a pathologic condition and needs no intervention.  Subcutaneous fat in this area could also give similar clinical picture and sometimes excess fat deposition in this area is not bilateral.  Lymph node enragement in the axilla commonly occurs following infection and inflammation in the area drained by them like the upper limb and skin of upper chest wall and they remain palpable after recovery although they regress in size.   Lymph node enlargement may occur also in females due to physiological changes in their breast (fibroadenosis). In both conditions lymph nodes are small <1cm, mobile, soft to firm and painless.  Direct clinical examination of the mass and the breast will allow the identification of possible causes and guide further investigations for exclusion of serious conditions like cancer.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

For example if you are in the premenstrual period this is considered physiological (cyclic pain) and is expected to improve few days after the onset of menstruation.  Non cyclic pain could be due to any of the following: If you are on any type of hormonal therapy, this may indicate an effect of these hormones on the breast and a follow up with your doctor is essential.  If there is a family history of breast cancer, you should be checked by your doctor too. Breast tumors may present with pain.  If a history of recent trauma is resent, this could explain the pain.  Pain in the breast could be radiating pain from the chest wall (muscle pain) or nerve affection (neuralgia).  In any case if the pain persists you better follow up with your doctor to exclude any serious cause.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Although a rare possibility but should be considered based on your history.  It is also not clear for me the information you provide about the left breast mass that was 2 cm (so it was left) 3 month ago. Did you mean it was just biopsied or left under follow up with no biopsy taken?  The picture you descriped may range from, an inflammation and infection in the breast (mastitis) to breast cancer.  Clinical examination is essential, so I would advise you to be checked soon. Your physician will recommend a new mammography and US. In addition a course of antibiotic will be helpful.

I can not be sure about the nature of these lumps unless more details are available.   Fibroadenoma of the breast is a benign tumour that results from proliferation of both glandular (of the galnds)and fibrous (stromal-connective tissue) elements. The same tumour may histopathologically show different amount of each element.  Typically the histopathology of neurofibromatosis is of nervous tissue origin and lack epithelial elements.   So the pathologist can differentiate between them by microscopic examination.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  When the nipple is pulled inward from time to time and not permanently, it is named a retracted nipple. Manipulations with the fingers can bring it out. This condition does not need medical attention as the breast functions normally. Inverted nipples that are permanently pulled inward is also a condition that do not affect breast function.  To the contrary if the nipple is noticed to be retracted to one side (pulled), proper examination and investigations are done to rule out an underlying lump and malignancy.  Direct clinical examination is essential and it is reassuring that your doctor found no abnormalities to be investigated. But follow up and reporting any changes in your breast to your physician are essential.  Before the onset of the menstruation, the breast is felt as filled with small lumps. This is more evident in females with fibroadenosis of the breast. The breast should be examined after menstruation.  Hope you find this information useful.

    "content": "Hello, I'm 61 yrs old and  my last mammogram was 2004 which was normal. I received my recent mammogram (10-2008) and it came back with these findings: \"Stable benign appearing densities at the superior aspect of the left breast and benign appearing calcifications. Another circumscribed benign appearing density is noted at the right breast externally, there is a single calcification at the superior and external aspect of the left breast.\" What does all this mean ? I'm freaking out . The bottom of the report says:\"Correlation with ultrasound is recommended for complete characterization\" Does this spell trouble ? I would appreciate any info that perhaps can ease my mind till I can get a US. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with John. Studies of the role of human and plant estrogens in breast cancer and other cancers are so contradictory. At the time of the menopause, aiming to restore estrogen levels and reduce menopauasal symptoms like hot flushes and night sweats, diet and standardised supplements are usually prescribed. Phyto Soya Capsules, are one of these standardized supplements that contains an extract of non-genetically modified soya proved to be effective in a French trial.   Animal studies have linked  active compound in soya with tumor development and growth. However, clinical studies linked soy consumption with either a lower risk of breast cancer, or no effect.   Recently published study in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, suggest that Japanese women, at least when consumed soy isoflavones (contain estrogen receptor activator) through diet have a reduced risk of breast cancer.   But whether these results can be applied to women in Western countries is not clear. However, all data and studies are based on regular long term intake of these compounds especially at young age. Sporadic exposure to carcinogen seldom cause cancer. The length of exposure is more determinant for cancer development.  So, you are not considered as being exposed to one of cancer risk factors or to a carcinogen since the duration of exposure is almost null and the active compound in your medication is not universally accepted to be a true risk for cancer development.  Hope you find this information useful and reassuring. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a total hysterectomy (LAVH/BSO) in 2002? due to endometriosis.  I began HRT with p.o. hormones and later switched to transdermal hormone replacement. Soon after beginning transdermal hormones I noticed a lump in my right breast.  I immediately stopped all forms of HRT and haven't taken any since then (approx. 4 years now).  The lump has persisted and the margins are not well defined, however it is palpable and is best felt using a pinching method with the finger tips.  It is thick and painful, especially if touched.  I have had a mammogram and ultrasound that were both inconclusive.  I am a R.N. in the operating room and one of the general surgeons I work with has suggested a needle biopsy while his partner suggests that I skip the needle biopsy, since the margins are so irregular, and have a lumpectomy.  I realize that \"most\" forms of breast cancer are not painful, which is probably the reason I haven't been more proactive in seeking treatment thus far (which I acknowledge is not a very wise choice).  Should I have the needle biopsy or go ahead with a lumpectomy?    Thanks in advance for your time\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 35 y.o. female lump in rt breast post LAVH & starting HRT",
    "content": "Hello,  Any woman presenting with a breast mass must be investigated properly considering breast cancer in the differential diagnosis.  There are 4 main factors when considering a history of risk factor. Those are age, prior history of breast cancer, history of benign breast disease, and family history of breast cancer.  Studies about hormone replacement therapy have been so conflicting. Studies have shown that cumulative (over years) absolute risk of breast cancer for women aged 40-79 falls with increasing age. Those who are on estrogen only hormone replacement or short term (less than five years) use of combined therapy aged 50 years or more, are not exposed to significant elevation in their cumulative absolute risk for breast cancer.   So, recent publications concluded that the cumulative absolute risk of developing breast cancer for women on hormone replacement therapy is not as high as previously assumed. The risk may also declines with discontinuation of therapy.  However, it is not correct to underestimate the additional cancer risk on those who continued to take hormone replacement therapy for long periods (more than 5 years and those received the combined form). So, the risk of any mass to be a cancer in these women can not be excluded unless all investigations are done. Investigations include, Mammography, US and FNA biopsy.   If a mammogram is abnormal, comparison with previous films is essential and ultrasound is recommended to further characterize the lesion. In premenopausal women, if the mass is not likely to be malignant follow up is an acceptable approach by many physicians. If the mass persists after 3 months surgical consultation is mandatory. In postmenopausal women follow up strategy is not generally accepted and biopsy (FNA) is essential.  Any suspicious criteria by Mammography, US, or FNA, an open biopsy is recommended.  Considering also your positive family history for cancer, it is mandatory to exclude that this mass represents breast cancer.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to do mammographic and US comparison with previous studies. Surgical consultation is essential to evaluate the mass and a surgeon is the physician who will recommend FNA or lumpectomy. In general FNA biopsy is done and if not conclusive lumpectomy is recommended.   Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

The radiologist that reviewed my results told me that while the lump isn't suspicious for cancer it has in fact changed somewhat.  First of all, it is larger and on one of the views \"there is actually a distinct lump\".  On the previous mammogram the area was simply defined as an area of dense tissue.  I'm not sure if the fact that the most recent mammogram was digital, and the first was not, has anything to do with these new changes; nonetheless I have decided to go ahead with a lumpectomy (scheduled for Oct. 24th) and I will keep you updated with the results.\n\n",

It occurs due to hormonal changes during puberty. The median age of onset is 14 years and it usually regress at the age of 20.  It is bilateral but may be asymmetrical and a disc like growth is felt under the nipple and is usually painful and/or tender.   Understanding the condition is usually reassuring and no intervention is needed. Those who have a more than moderate enlargement with skin redundancy causing psychological problems and embarrassment may need plastic surgery.  Hope you find this information useful.

    "content": "Hello,  A transient breast rash usually does not indicate an underlying malignancy or a serious condition. To the contrary a persistent breast rash should be properly evaluated.  Common causes include, infections (bacterial,fungal), dermatitis, dry skin and cancer.   Infection (bacterial) is commonly seen during lactation (mastitis) and causes a painful breast. The condition usually resolves with an antibiotics course but if persists, exclusion of malignancy should be done.  Sore throat may be unrelated or indirectly related if a medication you have received is the cause since some medications cause skin rash.   Dermatitis, an inflammation of the skin results from contact with an irritant or allergen. Dermatitis is treated with hydrocortisone cream and avoidance of the allergen.  Fungal infection (candidiasis) usually presents with itchy skin rash under the breast. The condition is treated with local antifugnal therapy.  Rarely, a breast rash is a symptom of inflammatory breast cancer. However, your family history makes exclusion of this cause mandatory.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  My mother was diagnosed with breast cancer about five years ago.  She had a lumpectomy and then radiation.  She has been fine ever since, going too all appointments and check-ups along with taking the Tamoxefin.  Her six month visit to the oncologist this time showed elevated liver enzymes in her blood test results.  They said everything else was normal, and she has no physical symptoms of anything.  She is going for a CAT Scan today.  I am so worried and wondering what could possibly be causing this and trying not to think the worst, but after going through the breast cancer with her it is so hard not to.  I have looked up elevated liver enzymes and see that so many things could cause this, but none of these things seem to be plausible in her case.  She is tiny, not over weight at all, she is not a drinker, although diabetes may be in her family she has never had high blood sugar.  She does take excedrin for headaches quite often and I saw that sometimes pain medication could play a roll in increased liver enzymes.  Please provide any insight, I would greatly appreciate it.  Thanks.\n\n",

It would be more useful if you can inform us about the exact figure of your mother\u0357 s liver enzymes.  Tamoxifen is known to cause elevated liver enzymes. Excedrin is also hepatotoxic especially when taken in large doses. Isolated mild elevation of liver enzymes is considered abnormality and significant if it continues for six months.  Since, there is a history of breast cancer; one of the causes that should be excluded is liver metastases.  Abdominal US as well as CT scan can help in the differential diagnosis. Please keep us updated with the results of the CT scan and I advise you to follow up with new liver function tests and to follow up with her doctor.  Best regards.\n\n",

She has been having blood tests every week since, and there were apparently 3 enzymes elevated.  Two have gone completely back to normal, and one keeps getting lower.  So, we are very happy.  It may have been something like the Excedrin or she was on this new herbal supplement for ringing in her ear that could have possibly played a part.  Either way, once we knew we weren't dealing with Cancer we were more than satisfied!  Again, thanks for listening and giving some good advice.\n\n",

    "title": "Itchy Painful Left Breast",
    "content": "I am 26 years old.  Over the last six months I have felt an itching sensation under the nipple on my left breast that radiates out toward the armpit.  If I try to scratch, it is an itch that feels as if it can never be satisfied.  The itching is not constant and usually only lasts for about a week and then will come and go every few weeks.  I was only experiencing the itching for the first couple of months, but I am now experiencing pain in the same area that I have been having the itching.  The first few months I thought that it was a new PMS sign, but started tracking it and it is not regulated with my periods at all - sometimes it's before, during, or after. It is also only ever occurring in my left breast in the same area every time.  I've done self exams and can feel no lumps, but I'm concerned about what this could be.  My grandmother and aunt have had tumors in their breasts, but were benign and have not had any of the problems that I am having.  Please let me know if you have any advice.  Thank you. : )\n\n",

Sometimes breast cancer presents with painful breast and eczema (inflammatory breast cancer) however the condition is usually progressive and resistant to conventional treatment like local ointment.   Your symptoms are more likely to be due to mild and benign condition and local clinical examination is mandatory to reach proper diagnosis and treatment.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I hope your visit to your doctor reassured you and everything is clear now.  Just in case no obvious explanation could be reached and you still have symptoms, these causes need to be excluded too: 1- Referred pain for example from the chest wall.  2- Sometimes some female hormone changes (for example during periods of stress) cause similar symptoms. Although pain caused by hormonal changes is bilaterally presented, it is sometimes felt in one side initially.  So when you follow with your doctor discus with him this possibility and gynecological consultation may be beneficial.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Morning,  I am a 45 yr female. Approx 30 days ago I went to my physician as I had aburning sensation in the nipple area of my left breast for over two weeks, developed redness to the breast area, and had developed swollen lymph node in the left underarm two days before my visit. His diagnosis was Mastitis and put me on a 10 day regimin of Keflex and Tylenon 3 w/Codine. The only difference it made was that the redness in my breast cleared up. My Dr. has sent me for a mammogram and ultrasound of both breasts. The ultrasound showed a cyst in my right breast and nothing in the left. The mammogram showed the lymph nodes under my left arm and down the left side of the breast and just above the breast area as swollen. Since then, the lymphs have swollen above the clavicle and at the base of my throat. The lymphs have also become hard. My Dr. has since ordered a full blood work up but has been hesitant to order a biopsy as he knows how tender that underarm area is.  I live on an island and am looking at possibly going to the mainland for treatment. Is it possible that I could be looking at IBC or Lymphoma? My Grandmother also had Lymphoma that loged in her spine.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Lymph Nodes Swelling and Hard",
    "content": "Hello,  The picture you have described is very concerning. Lymph node enlargement can be due to many causes like infections (mastitis as your doctor mentioned), benign and malignant conditions.  Many physicians first prescribe an antibiotic course to exclude infectious and inflammatory causes when the clinical picture is highly suggestive as in your case.  However, it is not normal for lymph nodes of infectious cause to grow in size, become harder, or others to appear while on proper antibiotics thus those regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   If you have finished your antibiotic course and the lymph nodes are still of same size, growing, become harder or increasing in number, I advise you to follow up with your doctor and discuss with him doing a biopsy.   Biopsy can be taken also from the supracalvicular region if it is of considerable size (>1 cm). After thorough examination of all the lymph node groups in the body, surgeon will choose the most relevant (most suspicious) lymph node for biopsy.  Please follow up with your doctor and keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   Skin infection in the form of pus containing blisters are commonly seen when there is a drop in the immune system like local skin damage, during periods of  stress or people with diabetes mellitus.  Since the skin is a very delicate part of the body it can be easily damaged and invaded with different forms of organisms. Skin parts that are more hairy or fatty are more predisposed.   The part of the skin that is attacked by bacteria forms pus containing blisters when these bacteria are destroyed by the immune system. These bacteria (like Staphylococcus aureus) forms part of the normal skin flora and attack the skin once it is damaged.  Furuncle or boils are forms of these blisters which have one or more openings onto the skin. Small forms resolve spontaneously and recover quickly, while larger ones need antibiotic treatment and sometimes drainage.  Recurrent skin infections are usually due to inadequate treatment of acute infection form or due to an underlying cause that makes their skin highly predisposed. Local causes include frequent skin damage in those who have sensitive skin or inappropriate hygienic measures. Systemic causes include diabetes mellitus.  Direct clinical examination is very essential for proper diagnosis and treatment.  So, I advise you to keep this part always clean and dry, do a blood sugar test and consult your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, According to your description, this is a benign looking swelling that could be a lymph node enlargement or just subcutaneous fat.  If we assumed they are lymph nodes, then the history you gave is reassuring since you have felt them for 10 years and there is no significant increase in their size, number or any other similar swellings in other areas of your body.  Lymph node enlargement usually occurs as a reactionary process following infection or inflammation in the area drained by this lymph node group.  If we assumed that this is just fat causing no problems I would not advise any surgical intervention unless they are causing a significant cosmetic problem which mandates consultation of a plastic surgeon.  Direct clinical examination is essential for proper management. Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: how long should you take femara",
    "content": "Hello,  Excellent question! Unfortunately, the short answer is no one knows what the benefit vs the risks of taking femara (letrozole) indefinitely are.   Now the long answer: I believe, but I may be wrong, that the trial you are referring to is the famous MA-17 trial in which women over 50 years were randomly assigned to either 5 years of placebo or 5 years of letrozole after finishing 5 years of tamoxifen.   That same trial is also trying to answer the risk/benefit question of extended femara: first, an extension of the MA 17 trial is currently on going where women who had completed 5 years of letrozole have been randomized to either receive another 5 years of letrozole versus placebo. Preliminary results indicate that there may be additional survival benefit from extended femara.[1]  That said, even though the results of the extended study is encouraging, that may or may not apply to your case. Since these women did not stop taking hormonal therapy but are receiving it for 15 years.  On the other hand, that same trial is also trying to assess the health hazards of femara, which is a relatively new drug when compared to tamoxifen. In particular a subset of the MA 17 patients were studied in a companion trial for the impact of femara on bone density. It was clear that even after 2 years of femara there was a significant decrease in bone density. This added to the normal fact, that women after 50 are more likely to develop osteoporosis makes this a significant issue. However, I am sure, however, that is being monitored by your physician.  Apparently, it looks like femara extension is relatively safe with a few precautions. However, like I said, its a relatively new drug and we have to wait before we can tell exactly what the hazards are.  In contrast, Tamoxifen has been around since the 1970's we know that extended tamoxifen beyond 5 years does not offer benefit and is associated with an increased incidence of uterine cancers (up to 4 times the risk in normal population). Even in this case, which seems rather obvious at first, there are studies examining whether there is a subset of women which high risk disease that may benefit from extended tamoxifen beyond 5 years. I believe there are two trials examining this issue (ATLAS, ATOM).  Your doctor would be the best person to make a decision in an area where there are no clear answers. He should weigh the benefits versus the risks and compare it to your risk for recurrence. If you are not at high risk for disease recurrence, I would say that the benefit, if any, is minimal at this stage.  I have included the reference for the MA 17 extension trial below for your reference.  Best regards,  References: ========== 1.

    "content": "Hello,  It must be a very difficult time for you I understand. You are basically required to make a decision about something that is very important and that you do not know enough about. The truth of the matter is, this is a very controversial issue.   Patients with node negative breast cancer have traditionally always received adjuvant chemotherapy if their tumor sizes are more than 1cm (NCCN guidelines in the US) or in Europe when more than 2cm in size. Your tumor was larger in size than both. Only recently was the question raised that a very good subcategory of patients (apparently) like yourself may not need chemotherapy. Especially post-menopausal women seem to benefit even less from chemotherapy.  Various methods of assessment have been used - from a web based tool - Adjuvant Online! to gene mapping using Oncotype Dx. All of which are primarily concerned with this particular subgroup.   Most doctors will not advise chemotherapy if they think absolute benefit from chemotherapy in 10 years is less than 3% in terms of survival.  At this stage let me try to help you by suggesting that you address your concern very directly to your doctor. Tell him that you do not feel qualified enough to make such an important decision and that you would like him to help you make it.   A few points that will help if you clarify them - you mentioned 4 lymph nodes were removed - was a sentinel lymph node biopsy performed, because generally level I and level II lymph nodes are removed which amount to about 10 lymph nodes. You can ask him about this.  Ask him about the type of chemotherapy regimen he would suggest and the toxicity both short term and long term. It may be that you are ready to suffer a few months for the sake of every extra percent of survival benefit. But by also knowing the long term effects and how frequently they occur you can weigh the risks vs the benefits. For example you may decide that extra percentage is not worth it if there is a 2% chance that you could live with heart disease for example. Fifty six is not old you have many more years to live and enjoy and you should be looking forward to that.  In order to be able to weigh the odds you should know the odds. Have a frank discussion with your doctor and ask him to help you through this.  Please keep us updated!\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for answering me so soon. To begin with my my estrogen  and progesterone recepters were positive and my Her2 was negitive (all 3 antibodies with a straining intensity =+1. The lymph nodes that were removed were sentinal nodes and as I said they were clear. The test you are speaking of is not available in Canada that I know of, should I check with my doctor to find out if I can have this test done. I am very confused as to what to do. I seem to get everything colds, flu and I worry about having chemo and having know  immune  system to fight it.  My doctor seems to think that my odds are good without it but if I want it the choise is mine. The chemo is recommended for a 12 week period every 3 weeks for four sessions the drug that he is suggesting is Docetaxel and Cyclophosphamide by intravenous. When he first suggested chemo he told me there was a 16% chance without chemo and a 12% chance  in 10 years He is now saying 10% chance without it and a 8.5 % with it in 10 years. I really don't know what to do. I know your not really supposed to recommend, but  is it possible for you to tell me what you would recommend, I know the final decision will have to be mine. Is it standard for that many lymph nodes to be removed if the senital nodes are clear? If you could answer as soon as possible I would appreciate it. Lynda\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Lynda,  Thanks for the update. Sentinel lymph node biopsy is great - that's an appropriate number of lymph nodes.   It's not that I don't want to make a recommendation, I really would love to help you and I understand your dilemma. However, it's technically impossible to make a recommendation without evaluating everything first hand. Many things are taken into consideration including your general health, the outcome of your physical examination etc.   After reviewing your information and the update, it seems quite clear to me that your doctor really cares for you. He has offered you the best treatment currently available. His assessment of your odds is quite precise and I would not view his change of opinion in a negative view. Rather, it is a delicate situation and one where treatment has to be individualized. I think your doctor is honest to review his opinion and to change it for what he thinks is better.  I would stick with his recommendations if I were you - but I still think that this really should not be your decision alone. You cannot take responsibility for a decision you are not equipped to make. I would convey this to your doctor quite frankly if I were you and just like you asked me to make a recommendation ask him to guide you.   Again, in an attempt to make things a little easier for you - after reviewing all available data I think you should go with what your doctor recommended. Docetaxel and cyclophosphamide is given to reduce the risk of heart toxicity that is associated with standard forms of adjuvant therapy. All the same this can be a tough regimen for some people and docetaxel can cause muscle aches, reduced immunity, body fluid retention, neuropathy (such as numbness in the finger tips). Cyclophosphamide can cause nausea, vomiting, skin and nail changes. Most of these are temporary and may not be an issue but their not worth it for a difference of benefit of 1.5% at 10 years.   That said, you should not feel like you have to make a decision until you feel absolutely confident you are doing what you want for yourself.  Good luck and keep me posted!\n\n",

I never got a CT scan to determine if there are any tumors in my organs,should I have gotten one or should I ask for one? Is it because all my tests so far were normal so they don't feel its necessary? I am considering asking him for a CT wether he will give me one I don't know. Also is  your blood  monitored during radiation? This will help with my decision. Thanks so much Lynda\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again Lynda,  I apologize for not seeing your post earlier. I hope your meeting with your doctor has made you feel better and that you were able to make an informed decision.  To answer your question, CT scans are not done routinely in the staging working for early breast cancer as long as your labs are fine and you don't have any symptoms or signs that may suggest anything abnormal. A chest x-ray and labs are enough. Other tests are not useful and the added exposure to irradiation from these scans is not justified.  Please keep me updated!\n\n",

He did say it was still a small margin but it was still my decision wether I wanted it or not but consider it was a rather large tumor.

    "content": "Hello Lynda,  I am sorry to hear about your meeting. All this confusion doesn't help at all.  In a situation like this I would advise you to be on the cautious side of things. Breast cancer is a treatable disease once it's caught early. The reason for adjuvant chemotherapy is to prevent distant metastasis to the bone, liver, lung or brain. If that should happen all bets are off you would need chemotherapy and the outcome would not be so rosy.   To put it this way - if I had to choose between side effects that may cause a temporary reduction in your quality of life compared to risk of metastatic disease, I would go for the chemotherapy.  Some people tolerate chemotherapy very well. Just put yourself in that state of mind to hang in there for next 5 months. After that things should return to normal. With appropriate supportive care, careful monitoring of your immunity (blood count) you shouldn't have to go through any serious infections.  Yes, I agree with the decision to take chemotherapy. We are only allowed to drop it if we are sure we know what the risks of doing so are. With all the confusion, we can't be sure enough. We definitely, don't want to find out the hard way.  Ask your doctor for some literature about your chemotherapy regimen, that should help make you feel more in control of what's to come.  Keep a positive attitude and go for it.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 20 year old female. I have no family history of cancer. I've had no surgeries before and have no past diagnoses.  Less than a week ago, I noticed a lump in my right armpit which hurts when I pressed my arm down against the side of my body. The following day I had fever and flu. It's been about 4 days since my fever started and I'm almost well, except for phlegm. I am on antibiotics only.   Today, I noticed that the lump is still there but it no longer hurts when I press my arm down against the side of my body. It does, however, feel a bit painful or sensitive when I press the lump with my fingers. The lump is roughly 1cm in diameter and 2cm in length. It does not move around and feels hard. The skin color of my armpit is normal.   While I had fever and flu, I visited my family doctor and asked him about the lump. He felt it and told me it was just skin growth and NOT a swollen lymph node. He advised me to monitor the lump for any changes or increase in pain. But somehow that did not make me feel any less worried.   Later on after the appointment, I remembered that when I was about 10 or so, I had a large bulging pimple under my arm. I can't remember which arm specifically, but it might have been the right arm. The pus came out soon and the pimple dissolved. The next time I noticed a lump in my armpit was when I was 14. Similarly, I am not 100% sure which arm it was but it might have been the right one too.   So now I wonder if the current lump I have is a serious problem, and whether it is possibly related to the pimple I had when I was 10, or the lump I noticed when I was 14. If it is the same one then and now, what does that mean? Do I need a second opinion from a dermatologist or some other specialist?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Jem1314,  I suspect that the lump you are feeling is a lymph node that has become enlarged due to your recent infection.  It is very unlikely that the lump you are now noticing is related to the lumps you noticed years ago.    Your description does not make me particularly concerned about a cancer type lump.  I would suggest you continue to follow this over the next several weeks.  If the lump does not shrink back down or if it is getting larger I would recommend you have your doctor evaluate this.  One note, if you check it every day you'll just stress yourself out so I would recommend you only check on the lump about once a week.  This way you'll have an easier time noticing changes as well since there will be more time for change.  Best wishes.\n\n",

It may be that your new oncologist is wanting to simply go over all the bases since you are a new patient.  I would recommend you talk with your oncologist to see if there was something concerning or if it is simply a screening test.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Kermane,  I agree with Dr. Chan. Sometimes your blood work includes a test called tumor markers (e.g. CA-15.3 and CA 19.9). Let me say that these tests are neither sensitive nor specific for breast cancer. Ideally we would do these tests and be able to diagnose whether a patient has cancer or not but that has never been the case since these tests are very imprecise. Currently their only indication seems to be the follow up patients that have already been diagnosed as having advanced disease and are receiving treatment for it.  Assuming that's what was done, it may be that one of these tests was elevated and like Dr. Chan mentioned your doctor thought it was a good idea to cover all the bases. In fact that's exactly what your doctor is doing because he seems to have ordered a CT scan of the abdomen, a chest x-ray and an ultrasound all of which are not currently indicated in the routine follow up of breast cancer survivors who are cured and have no symptoms.   Please keep this thread updated.\n\n",

    "content": "In the past month or so, I have noticed a growth under my right nipple. It is a hard object; feels like an infection. I tried to squeeze at it to see if anything would discharge but nothing happens. It's very sore and extremely painful when touched. There is no abnormal color changes to the area, but when I press down you can see it gets very white around the figure inside the nipple. I am scared and frustrated at the same time. I wanted to stick a syringe into it and suck out whatever it was, but my girlfriend advised me otherwise. I am on medication for my chronic intestinal problems (is still a mystery, not diagnosed) and am wondering if this could be a side effect.  MS-Contin 15MG IR, MS-Contin 100MG TR, Oxycontin 40MG TR, Oxycontin 20MG TR, Clonopin 5mg? I think, Docusate Sodium 100mg, Adovan 3mg, Prednizone (I don't take it because it hurts my stomach. And in the last month I was admitted to the ER where they were giving me another steroid and antibiotics regularly, not sure what they were. After I was released my medication wasn't filled on time so I took over 52 aspirin pills within a weekend. Sorry if I'm giving too much information, I just want to be thorough on the possibilities on what this could possibly be. Thank you in advance for your time and consideration.  - Andrew.\n\n",

I would recommend you see your doctor to have this evaluated.  You may need some antibiotics to help it clear up.  I would recommend against poking it with a needle.  Also, I should add that caution should be used with your medications.  You are taking a lot of narcotic medications so stopping them rapidly could cause withdrawal symptoms.  Also, taking that many aspirin in a short time period could be quite dangerous and lead to toxicity.  Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I have posted before, but I still have more questions.  I was around 12 or 13 (I got my period when I was 11 1/2) when I first noticed lumps in the upper part of both of my breasts. Now I'm starting to think that they are anchored to the side of my armpit, but for the longest time I thought they were movable, now I'm not so sure. How obvious is it, because I really can't tell?  Also is there a definite texture to breast lumps? I recently read that malignant tumors have a similar texture to that of golfballs, which are what mine feel like. Is this true for all cancerous tumors? They feel like the same tissue in my bicep, which is why I can't tell if it's attached to my armit or not becuase it could be the same tissue. But to have it in my breasts too, I don't understand. My nipples are also inverted, but also the area directly below my nipples is larger and \"plumper\" the the above my nipple. They always look this way, except when I'm cold. What could be the cause of this? I don't think I have ever experienced discharge. My breasts have never looked normal, and have been this way ever since I felt the lumps when I was 12. And have always looked identical to each other. I am now 21, and have not seen a doctor. Lately I have been experiencing sypmtoms of anemia (numbness, low blood pressure, dry skin, amenorrhea, dizziness, muscle/bone pain, chest pain) and I read that a common cause of anemia is cancer. Could it be possible that I have been living with breast cancer for 9 years, and now am developping anemia? Or what are the chances that these two conditions are unrelated? I am scheduling a doctor's appointment next week as I am getting increasingly scared. But I would greatly appreciate some insight before I go! I am extremely terrified as my symptoms seem to be leading to one thing...   I am really, really scared!\n\n",

Other symptoms I experience are sweating, nervousness, heart palpitations, oily skin, white heads (on my face that never go away), abdominal fat (I'm 5\"5', 117lbs and all the weight is on my stomach/thighs), dry hair (also before my period I had straight hair, now it's curly and frizzy), constant bloating, fatigue (I always have to take a nap in the afternoon). And my most recent symptoms have been absent period (it's been a year) and numbness (in pinky toe, and a bit in my upper leg)   Also, regarding my breasts, could it be that I have Fibrocystic Breast Disease? Like I mentioned in my previous post, I'm not sure if the lumps are anchored. But it doesn't feel like they're attached to my ribs. The lumps in my breasts developed at the same time and are similar in size, shape and texture. And I discovered that Fibrocystic Breast Disease is also a symptom of a hormone imbalance.   I'm sorry if i seem scattered and I'm asking so many questions, I'm just really worried and tired of dealing with all of these symptoms. I'm not asking for a diagnosis, but if you have any explanation as to what's wrong with me I would greatly appreciate it! I'm scheduling a doctor's appointment very soon, so I can hopefully find out what I've been dealing with these past 9 years. I know I've waited much too long to seek medical help, I've just always been so scared and embarrassed. I know that's no excuse. I'm so exhausted and tired of dealing with this on my own.

    "content": "Hello,  Many lumps in the breast are related to age. Around the age of puberty girls develop tender breast lumps beneath the nipples. These are growing breast buds and should not cause any alarm. Breast cancer is much more common in women above 40 years of age and rare in those below 40.   Around the time of each menstrual cycle the hormonal changes may cause the breast to become more lumpy and tender.   The vast majority of breast lumps (85%) are benign, especially in your age. Benign causes include fibrocystic breast changes, fibroadenoma, fat necrosis (trauma that leads to damage to the fat tissue within the breast), and sometimes breast abscess (in those that are breast feeding).  Please remember, that I am unable to assess your condition with any accuracy given the limitations of the internet. Please have your doctor examine your condition during your next visit.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I completely agree with Dr. Fouad.  Breast cancer at your age would be extremely rare.  It would be even rarer still to have breast cancer in both breasts.  Young girls have very fibrous breast tissue that often feels like lumps.  I suspect that you are finding completely normal tissue; however, you should get a formal exam to confirm this.  To further reassure you, most \"abnormal\" lumps in the breast do not turn out to be cancer.  They are fibroadenomas which are non-cancerous masses.  I'm confident everything will turn out fine for you, but you still need to get an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was around 12 when I first noticed lumps in the upper part of both of my breasts. My nipples are also inverted, but also the area directly below my nipples is larger and \"plumper\" the the above my nipple. They always look this way, except when I'm cold, as Jade mentioned. What could be the cause of this? My breasts have never looked normal, and have been this way ever since I felt the lumps when I was 12. I am now 21, and have not seen a doctor. Lately I have been experiencing sypmtoms of anemia (numbness, low blood pressure, dry skin, amenorrhea, dizziness, muscle/bone pain, chest pain) and I read that a common cause of anemia is cancer. Could it be possible that I have been living with breast cancer for 9 years, and now am developping anemia? Or what are the chances that these two conditions are unrelated? I am scheduling a doctor's appointment next week as I am getting increasingly scared. But I would greatly appreciate some insight before I go!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Heather333371,  Most likely you are feeling normal fibrous breast tissue.  Breast tissue is normally quite lumpy.  Some women have more lumps than others.  Characteristics of normal lumps are a rubbery feeling (as opposed to hard) and mobile.   Concerning lumps are hard, enlarging, or immobile (fixed in one place).  This is the reason that self breast exams are recommended.  This way you become familiar with your breast tissue and the lumps you have so you can recognize if one is getting bigger or if a new, more concerning lump develops.  When doing self breast exams, remember to also check the area that is above the breast going up to the top of the shoulder (referred to as the tail of the breast).  A fairly significant amount of time, breast cancer develops in this area.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Most commonly breast cancer lumps are hard and may be fixed in place.  Another possibility is a lipoma.  A lipoma is a fat cell tumor that is non-cancerous.  They are often asymptomatic but can become sore/painful.  If they are causing problems, they can often be removed fairly simply.  I would recommend you have this evaluated just to be sure everything is OK.  Most likely this is nothing serious but on the rare chance that it is a cancer picking it up early is important.

    "title": "Large Lump in Armpit (Axillary Lymph Node)",
    "content": "Hello, My story/symptoms are very similar to this poster (marleycat). I am a 46 y/o female. There is history of breast cancer in my family. My oldest sister was 48 when she passed away from breast cancer. Last year (3/6/06) I had a mamo and sono done in my right breast which came back abnormal. I went to them because while taking a shower I found/felt a hard nodule under my armpit which I found to be disturbing.  I was told to get a sono which came back indicating the following: Examination shows evidence of 20 x 8 mm (2.1 cm)? oval shaped solid nodule noted rt mid axilla. This appears to fall into probably benign category. When I came back to the breast doctor with the results he told me the nodule is very deep in my underarm. Surgery (lymph node biopsy) was an option, however, he told me that I could possibly have compications with my right arm and since I am right handed it may be more of a problem. When I came back to the breast doctor with the results he told me the nodule is very deep in my underarm. Surgery (lymph node biopsy) was an option, however, he told me that I could possibly have compications with my right arm and since I am right handed it may be more of a problem. Before contemplating on surgery, which I was ready for, he sent me to my primary doctor for blood works (TB and HIV). Those came back fine and I went back to see the breast doctor again. If the blood work came back fine, then we were going to talk AGAIN about surgery. That didn't happen. He (breast doctor) changed his mind and decided to wait a couple of more months to see if there were any changes. By now I am frustrated, tired but most of all worried to death. Okay, so I now wait a couple of months and to my surprise I am out of health insurance. (long story). A year has passed and the lymph node seems to have gotten bigger. Since then, I've been without insurance but I have managed to contact a clinic where they have given me some insurance to have a diagnostic mamo done. I should mention that the lump feels fixed, no pain and feels rather large. I've had 3 prior biopsies of the breast but they all have come back benign. I am waiting for the appointment but would like to have some suggestions as to what you THINK I may have.  I should also mention that I went to see my primary doctor  because for the past 3 weeks I noticed a large swollen/enlarged mass (almost the size of my palm) on my right side around my rib cage. I paid no mind thinking that maybe I slept wrong but it has not gone away. There is no pain in the immediate area; however, there is at times discomfort/pain on my back (shoulder blade/lung) and in front/right of my stomach. I've always had the pain in my stomach since I suffer from ulcers so didn't give it another thought. In any event,  the doctor immediately told me I needed to get a CT scan of chest and right sided lateral trunk with contrast. This is to rule out mass chest wall malignancy (cancer). As well as having several blood work done: ANA, CMP,CBC, RF, FBS, TSH, LFT.  Since my ANA came back positive (1:80)(320) last year he wants to run it again. I was seeing a doctor for Lupus but because the other blood work did not come back positive I was told that perhaps it may be rheumatoid arthritis.  Well, until I have the CT done and blood work I will not know what on earth is wrong. He also mentioned it could be fatty tissue but to tell you the truth he did not convince me of that. I still have no insurance and the program I was given for the mammogram does not cover anything else.   My question is, could this swelling of my rib cage can be related to the lymph node and/or lung cancer? I am a smoker and my father passed away of lung cancer several years ago.  Thanks so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi all,  I want to give an update of my recent complications.  I went to the ER (9/12) because I was having tremendous chest pain, shortness of breath and pain on the right mass and on my back. I explained to the ER doctor what my primary doctor wanted me to have done and he did just that. I had a CT done with contrast. Well, the CT came back fine (nothing wrong with my lungs). I asked the doctor about the mass and he said that \"whatever it is, it is not from the inside.\" He said I will have to wait for the blood work that I explained on my letter to you. That may give more information as to what is going on with me. The final report for the ER visit was bronchitis. He gave me antibiotics and was sent home. Can the bronchitis come because of the lymph node? (something I forgot to ask the doctor. He dismissed me too fast and with no time to ask any questions)  As you may probably imagine, I am still confused and worried because of that mass on my side (right sided lateral trunk). Could it possibly be \"fatty tissue\" as my doctor had suggested? It doesn't look like fatty tissue. It looks like my ribs are popping out with a mass. Can't really explain it. I feel that perhaps this \"mass\" has to do with my lymph nodes. Could this mass be cancerous even if the CT showed nothing wrong? I was told by the attending nurse that perhaps I should request to have an MRI done later on when I see my doctor.   On Thurday (9/13) I had my diagnostic mamo and ultrasound done. Both breasts were done and mamo was done twice on my left breast. I was told the radiologist wanted a second look since my breasts are so dense. Then, I had the ultrasound done on axillary lymph node and both breasts. I was told by the technician that the mass measures 1.7cm. The doctor or radiologist did not come in for a consultation. Odd, because everytime I had one done I was told the same day. Anyway, I called my clinic and they said within 1-2 weeks I should hear from them. That is the worst part....waiting!  Today (9/14) I went back to my primary doctor for a follow-up from my ER visit. According to the doctor everything came back fine. However, when I asked him for a copy of the report, these tests (bold) came back saying the following:  GRANULOCYTES PERCENT- 44 L                 (50-75)   *Granulocytopenia -  Some people use this term in place of Neutropenia. White blood cells fight infection.  The white blood count (WBC) is part of a complete blood count (CBC) that is used to check your blood counts.  There are several types of white blood cells.  LYMPHOCYTES PERCENT- 49 H     (25-45)  *Lymphocytes are formed in lymphatic tissue throughout the body. Lymphatic tissue are a network of fibers and cells that help protect the body against disease. Examples of places in the body where lymphocytes are made that are made of lymphatic tissue include the spleen, thymus, tonsils, and lymph nodes.   DIRECT BILIRUBIN - <0.1 A  (0.1-0.5)  *Direct (or conjugated) bilirubin. Direct bilirubin dissolves in water (it is soluble) and is made by the liver from indirect bilirubin. The direct bilirubin fraction is that portion of bilirubin that has undergone metabolism by the liver. If the direct bilirubin is low, while the total bilirubin is high, this reflects liver cell damage or bile duct damage within the liver itself.   GLUCOSE- 146 H         ( 74-118)  *The blood glucose test is ordered to measure the amount of glucose in the blood right at the time of sample collection. It is used to detect both hyperglycemia and hypoglycemia and to help diagnose diabetes.  RHEUMATOID FACTOR-  <20.0 A         (0.0-19.0)  *This test is most often used to diagnose rheumatoid arthritis. About 80% of patients with rheumatoid arthritis have positive RF tests. It may also be used to rule out or diagnose other inflammation-related conditions.It may be ordered along with other autoimmune-related tests, such as an ANA (antinuclear antibody) along with a CBC (Complete Blood Count) to evaluate the body\u2019s blood cells.  CT RESULTS  Heart is not enlarged. There is minimal atelactasis- fibrotic scarring present at both lung bases posteriorly and inferiorly. There are minimal degenerative change involving the dorsal spine.  Conclusion--minimal fibrotic changes are present in both lung bases posteriorly.   *Atelectasis is a collapse of lung tissue affecting part or all of one lung. This condition prevents normal oxygen absorption to healthy tissues.  Please note, the *remarks* made under the bloodwork results I made to myself and others in case they don't know what they mean. It was not in the report!  Can you possibly shed some light to the results. My doctor did not go over them with me. I only noticed this when I left the office. I am not sure of the following marks/letters and what they mean. I think I have an idea but I want to make sure. (<) and (A).  The rest of the tests came back within range or just at the exact range number (highest).  About the mass, I was told it can be inflamed/fatty tissue. I was told to take Tylenol or Motrin. On another note, do you get \"puffiness\" on your face if you have breast cancer/Lupus? On my left side of my face (top of cheekbone area) below my eye, I have a rounded puffy mass. I've had this for the past month or so. Now, about 2 days ago I noticed on my right side (around lacrimal area) coming down and under my eyes a puffy mass. Today, I looked as if someone had knocked me on my eye! I asked my doctor about it and he can't tell me what it is. He THINKS it can be from Lupus since I have the butterfly rash and well as those puffy masses. However, it cannot be conclusive until I have the bloodwork done. The ANA was not performed at the hospital.  Thanks so much for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.\n\n",

    "content": "Here is another update since my last mamo and ultrasound. ULTRASOUND STUDY OF THE BILATERAL BREASTS.  The patient had ultrasound with attention to the right axillary area because of clinical history. There is an oval 17x6.3x6 mm circumscribed structure which may have some mild distal acoustic enhancement. It has a relatively lucent center and some slight vascular signal in its center. It could represent a lymph node whcih is replaced with some fat in the center. I am uncertain as to its exact etiology. I suggest correlation for any palpable abnormalities in this area. A followup ultrasound with attention to this in approximately 8 weeks.    The left breast was evaluated by ultrasound because of mammographic density. All four quadrants of the retroareolar  area on the left were surveyed. There is no abnormal solid or cyst mass identified on the left.  IMPRESSION  Small circumscribed 17mm lession in the right axilla, possibly a small fatty replaced lymph node. this should represent a benign structure. No abnormal focal mass indentified on survey of the left breast as described above.  INDICATION  Follow up mammogran/RT axilla palpable, survey fo the left breast.  DIAGNOSTIC BILATERAL MOMMORGRAPHY  HISTORY: Right breast axillary node  The current film mammography was done with radiopaque marker placed at the righ axillary area and axillary tail view was performed. A compression spot film over the left breast and craniocaudal projection was also done.  The breasts are heterogenously dense. The left breast appears to be generally more dense than on the previous study.  Compresive spot film was done and shows increase in parenchymal glandular density, but no focal abnormality is appreciated. The apperances fo the distribution of parenchymal glandular tissue is otherwise similar to the previous examination. No focal isometric density is noted in the right axillary area in the region of the radiopaque marker. There may be a tiny lymph node, less than 10mm very deep within the right axilla, not entirely included on the film. There is a small benign calcification in the medial aspect of the left breast and inferior right breast.  The patient will have ultrasound directed toward the axillary area of the right breast and survey of the left breast because of the apparent increased density.  The ultrasound showed a small focal area in the right axilla whcih could represent a small lymph node with a relatively hypoechoic lucent center, perhaps due to some fatty replacement or atrophy. No sonographic abnormality was seen on the left.  END OF REPORT  Could you possibly explain what all of this means (highlighted)? If my first ultrasound founded a SOLID mass, as mentioned in my first post, why do I need to wait another 8 WEEKS! Shouldn't I be able to get a biopsy at this point? How can he detect benign findings if no biopsy was done? I don't understand the fatty tissue part and then becomes a lymph node. Could you explain?  I appreciate anything you have to suggest to me. I am more lost now than before!  Thanks MR\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Lilonething,  Lymph node involvement indicates that the cancer has spread out of the breast into the nearby lymph nodes.  The lymph nodes in the arm pit are commonly the first area that breast cancer spreads to.  Having this spread indicates that the cancer is a little more advanced and likely will need further treatment other than simple removal of the cancer lump.  Many other factors go into determining how agressive the cancer is and what treatments are appropriate so your friend will need to have close follow up with an oncologist.  Treatment of breast cancer is getting better and better as we learn more about the disease.  Many women now are able to beat the disease.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "In both cases I must say that there is no evidence to verify that they would cause cancer, but keep in mind that lasers are new technology.  While there has been no known association, there is no way to say for certain.  It takes many years for some cancers to develop.  Also, it is believed that genomics plays a part - some people are more susceptible to particular cancers than others.  One day they may be better able to predict who is predisposed so those people can avoid possible exposures that might increase their risk.  Some information about laser use is on the American Cancer Society website http://www.cancer.org You can search their site for particular types of cancer and substances such as laser and aluminum.  Just know that any new procedure, no matter how good it is, has limited history for evaluation of safety.  Most of the consents you sign will indicate there could be unknown factors and you must use at your own risk.  Almost all procedures, even those with good track records come with some possible adverse affects and we must gamble each time to some degree.  It comes down to personal choice.  The aluminum/cancer connection has never been proven, though the suspicion has been out there for quite a while.  The American Cancer Society has issued a statement dispelling rumors that antiperspirants cause cancer.\n\n",

He also placed me on antibiotics, minocycline, for 10 days.  I normally do not worry but the past few months has been a little rough with swollen lymphnodes in my neck and fluid behind my ear and build up of phlegm at the bottom of my throat, not a cough, but just something that has been lingering for about 6 weeks now.  Can all this be related?\n\n",

In this case, it is actually more than one infection but seems to be the same one since there is no time in between.    There are a few viruses like ebstein-barr virus tha can cause prolonged symptoms without getting more than one infection.  If your symptoms persist you should follow up with your doctor.

    "content": "Its me again. I've calmed down a little since my last post and have since had a chance to read through other posts. Let me restart...  I am a 20 year old female. When a was around 13 years old (maybe younger) I noticed lumps in my breats. They are still there today, not painful, same size, movable and hard. I have not had discharge and do not have a family history, but do have history of other forms of cancer (colon, prostate, liver). Although I am now become increasingly worried as I am experiencing other symptoms. I often get light headed, and headaches (although have always had this issue). I recently obtained numbness to my right upper leg, right big toe, and left pinky toe. I have always had bad circulation in my legs. Even as a young child I remember having extreme pain in my calves, but that could have been growing pains. Another symptom I have is amenorrhea. I have not had my period in around  7 months. Could this be related to my diet? I read a post on soy, saying that it may change a women's menstrual cycle. Is this true? I have been drinking soy milk every morning for the past few months. Could this be related? I also eats a lot of flax seed, green tea, oatmeal (LARGE portion of my diet). Could my diet be affecting my menstrual cycle, or could it perhaps infact be because of breast cancer? I also experience bloating.   If you can offer any advice, information or solutions I would greatly appreciate it! If you need any more information, let me know. I am deeply concerned and frightened!  Melanie\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Melanie,  It is very unlikely that the lumps you are feeling are cancerous.  Breast tissue is normally quite lumpy.  This is why it is important to do regular self breast exams-so you can be familiar with the lumps and notice if any are new or changing.  There are also many causes for amenorrhea.  I would recommend you see a gynecologist about this.  At that point, you can discuss the breast lumps also.  Your numbness is a little different.  This should be checked out as well.  Your primary care doctor is probably the best place to start.  You may need some imaging studies (like a CT or MRI of the brain/spine) to see if there are any problems going on.  A thorough physical exam will help determine what work up is needed.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The tumor is estimated at 6.1 cm, and although nothing seems to be in the chest wall tissue that was obtained, the tumor did spread that far. So, mastectomy in a few weeks.  Pathology report did say that squamous metaplasia was present, but from what I have read, that is a benign condition.  At least I will have no nodes dissections and will get reconstruction the same time.  AS of now, no chemo as again, this cancer does not respond to chemo. RAdiation is equally questionable but i predict if my doc suspects anything she will order it anyway after the mastectomy.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am sorry to hear about your sister's condition. Generally speaking, breast cancer tends to be more aggressive when it appears in younger patients than in older ones.  Without philosophising, it really depends what you mean by cure. If you mean returning back to normal and live a long life free of disease, then that is not attainable in most cases for stage 4 breast cancer. There are exceptions for sure, but the appropriate answer would be \"no\".  That leaves us with the option to treat the symptoms and pain. At this stage you may be in for a good surprise. Chemotherapy can do more than just treat symptoms or pain. The tumor itself responds to the treatment. In this way the tumor shrinks, dies out and in some cases completely disappears. That is the form of cure that chemotherapy can offer and it should not be brushed aside. Ask yourself this: would you rather see your sister with the tumor as you described or in a couple of months from now see her with a normal breast, liver scan showing a dying lesion etc. I think at this stage you will realize that chemotherapy does more than just treat the symptoms or the pain.  Your sister will feel better, you will feel better and the doctor would have attained his goal from giving chemotherapy.  That said, the trend is for advanced breast cancer to relapse after it has responded. When and how is a big question. I have seen women with metastatic breast cancer live for years even after they relapse. When a cancer relapses it does not mean the war is over. It just means that the whole story will start all over again. We will look for a chemotherapy regimen that aims at kill the relapsed tumor with the hope of rendering her disease free clinically. So the aim is to kill the tumor cells which invade organs and produce symptoms and cause disfigurement, etc.  When we do not have anything else in our inventory of drugs to give that we think has a good chance of producing a response as stated above, it becomes unwarranted to give chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is not given for symptom relief per se as it produces symptoms of toxicity on its own.  I hope that answers your question. I have given it my best shot; however, I recommend that you sit with her doctor and discuss this with him. I was only speaking in a general sense of course.  Please let us know if you have any further questions.\n\n",

I can feel an area that is different than my normal tissue but not really a round tumor or mass.  A diagnostic mammogram and ultrasound were negative.  Sent to surgeon anyway, who didn't feel much but a lot of fibrous nodularity. We decided to watch it for three months with me limiting caffiene.  No caffiene really helped the overall pain of my breast--but when I would touch the area it still hurt and I could still fill the \"mass\" although it really is hard to determine its size, shape etc.  We are doing a excisional biopsy now--surgeon says he wants to take the whole thing out as needle biopsies might miss the tissue he is looking for...Anyway, I am assuming it is cancer just to prepare myself but am wondering what else it COULD be and is my history of a non-malignant schwannoma of my carotid artery (at 39) area anything that could be related?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Many times the breast develops areas of increased fibrosis (fibroadenosis). There are certain mamographic criteria that help distinguish to some degree of accuracy whether the breast tissue is suspicious of malignancy or not. These include areas of microcalcification and architectural distortion as well as asymmetry among other things.  However, the sensitivity of mamograms are greatly reduced, when as in your case, there are no breast masses.  Other methods of detection would include MRI and PET scans.   Depending on the clinical and radiological findings your doctor would decide the best method to go forward. I would trust your doctors decision to go forward with a biopsy.  Breast cancer is essentially curable. However, there is no need to prepare yourself for anything, many times it turns out that you have nothing at all.  Please update us as soon as the results of the biopsy are out.  Best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Bad news--I'm sure.  Biopsy was done Monday.  I heard the doctor speaking throughout the biopsy and he was telling his resident that he thought it was benign--just fibrocystic changes. But then in recovery he said that he \"found what we felt\" and that at first he thought it was a fibroandenoma but it wasn't encapsulated--which I know isn't good news.  But he told me not to worry and he would call me thursday. Yesterday he called and said \"[b]they think it might be a cancer\"[/b] so they are doing more tests (a \"stain\") is what he said.  He said it (the cells I think) looked really unusual, which is why he didn't recognize the tumor. He said it was more worrisome than he orginally thought. Obviously, I am a mess.  Does the unusuallness of this make it a WORSE cancer to have?  I am praying it is something simple that that can be taken care of with a lumpectomy or something but since they don't seem to know what it is, i am terrified.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 29-year-old female, with brown nipple discharge.  I have discharge from one breast, and only seems to be coming from one duct.  I have no family history of breast CA, no pain or itching in the area, and have had a normal prolactin level.  The discharge is not spontaneous, and is only visible upon manipulation.  I have had these same symptoms for years now, but the discharge seems to have changed from clear/tan to a sticky brown with a slight increase in amount.  I had a mammogram that came back showing some densities, and was sent for a breast u/s.  The u/s confirmed that the findings where benign showing- multiple small cysts, and dilated nipple ducts all on the one side.   I work in a multi-specialty medical practice, and had one of the general surgeons look at the reports and mammogram films.  He was not concerned and felt that it did not need f/u.  Although, I would normally not question his opinion, I spoke with my PCP and he insisted that I be examined to make sure that no other testing was necessary.  I will be seeing a surgeon from another practice on Thursday of this week.   My questions are, are there any additional questions/concerns that I should be bringing to the surgeons attention.  Based on what I have listed above, do you think that this is something that should be looked into further?  and What do you think this all means (dilated nipple ducts, brown sticky discharge etc.) for a diagnosis?   Thank you in advance for any input you may have.\n\n",

Nipple discharge, other than lactation, is not normal, and the fact that it changed from tan to brownish and sticky is somewhat concerning to me.  Is the brownish component blood?

I would say, if you have any concerns about the lump in your breast it would be worth your peace of mind to have it checked out further. Have you had a mammogram?  This is a non-invasive (even though not fun) exam that would be the first smart step in finding out more about the lump.  And I would ask your primary to evaluate the findings of the mammogram and determine if a referral to a specialist is in your best interest.  Again,sometimes, to gain peace of mind, it is worth pursuing our concerns to the best level possible.\n\n",

I was dx'd in 1994 at the age of 47 with stage 1 breast cancer: 1.7 cent. tumor, tumor grade 2, ER/PR positive, diploid, low s-phase. Treatments included lumpectomy, radiation, CMF chemo, Tamoxifen. I am now taking Femara. While thankfully I have had no reoccurrence to date, like many others, I have anxiety every time I experience a new pain (the latest being chronic back pain between my shoulder blades). Any info you could share on distant recurence rates for my stage after 10 years from dx would be most appreciated. Thank you. (Family history: My mother died at 80 from bladder cancer, my father died at 80 from Lymphoma, and my brother died at 32 from cancer of the esophagus. I have a sister who is 53 and in good health and no history of cancer.)\n\n",

Also, did you have any work up for the chest pain-i.e. did anyone do any testing to see what was actually causing the pain?  It may be that the medicines are simply making an already present issue worse.  For example, it may be that you have reflux that is being worsened somehow by the medications causing worsening pain.  I think the best way for you to proceed would be to have a work up for chest pain as if you were not on thyroid medicine to find the cause.  It's likely that once the cause is found you'll be able to tolerate the thyroid hormone.  As you've discovered, thyroid hormone is the \"metabolism setter\" for the body.  If it is low the body's energy rate slows down and the symptoms you are experiencing begin to appear.  Best wishes.\n\n",

She look about 7 measurements 4 from 1 breast and 3 from another.   then she told me in Spanish she was finished and I could go.   When I asked was everything OK, she said that the results will be back within 2wk....I think they will send them to my doctor.   They never took any biopsies.

My question is, when do I need to be concerned about this lymph node? It is freely movable, not stony hard, and about the size of a kidney bean. I keep reading that they can remain enlarged but shouldn't be larger than 1cm. Is that measure across or length wise since mine is loner than wider?   Thank you,  Cantante\n\n",

The size of the breast swelling varies.  If it is significant it may not completely reduce in size.  There are a few medical treatments that can be tried that have varying degrees of success.  The most successful treatment is surgery.  I would suggest you talk with your doctor about possibly trying a medical treatment before surgery if you desire.

I have been taking Synthroid 50 mcg since then for hypothyroidism .I told my doctor that before getting my period every month my breasts feel heavier and tender and sore. They are not only sore to touch, I feel significantly uncomfortable working out in the gym etc. This sensation lasts till the last day of my period and goes away almost immediately my period is over. Again after 2-3 weeks this discomfiture comes back and persists until the next cycle of my period is over. My doc did some routine breast examination last year and said this is quite normal and could be because of some hormonal changes. I am little confused with the whole issue. Is it just a simple thing or could it be anything else.?(I am full figured and not very particular about regular work out stuff) Thanks  Biman olor=red][/color]\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Biman,  Sensation of breast discomfort, pain and fullness or heaviness could be related to salt and water retention that occur in the last days of the menstrual cycle just before menstruation.  Sometimes, this sensation can be relieved by taking a mild dose of a diuretic to help get rid of the excess salt and water in the body during this period of time.  You can discuss this with your doctor and see whether or not he/she thinks it would be a good idea to take a small dose of diuretics and see whether or not it will help with your symptoms.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.  Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A year ago I had some pain on near my right breastbone. I had a mammo. Nothing found, pain continued and slow went away. Over the last six months the pain has spread throughout the entire right breast and under my arm. I've never been one to get rashes or pimples, but I've noticed lately that I have a pimple rash above and below my center chest. A small pimple like area popped up sometime last night on my right underarm.  I get another mammo in a few weeks. Why I have to wait this long is beyond me. Anyway,I've been having a lot of under the arm problems. This morning when I put on my shirt, it hurt, and there is like a tiny-pimple, if that's what you can call it. But to even look at it, it hurts... that is how sensitive it is to the touch. My underarm had been hurting when I lay on my stomach with my arm above my head. Now, it's stiff and tight when I lay that way. In addition, up until last night my right breast only was having problems. Now my left one has little pea sized bumps inside. I found this because out of the blue it started to hurt a little bit. Now, since I keep reading that BC isn't painful, I'm wondering if I should just start out having my DR. check for IBC? And if so, how do i go about this without the Dr. Thinking I'm nuts? I mean this is my life I'm talking about. 15 years ago, I had cervical cancer, I suspected as much just before they FINALLY found it. But before hand, I had seen so many Dr. none of which found anything wrong with me. One Dr. even went as far as to ask me if had ever seen a shrink. Mind you, everyday at 4p.m. I began to run a fever. Anyway, I have a very bad feeling about this as well. I also know that if it's IBC it is a very aggressive cancer. I've been on HRT for 15 years as well. I don't want to waist time getting to the point with my Dr. Any advice, and or thoughts on my problem?\n\n",

There may be a few possible things going on.  First, you raise the possibility of IBC.  This is a possibility.  Your description of the progression of your symptoms make me concerned about a cancer of some type.  My knowledge in this area really is too limited to give you any more specifics about it.  I would recommend you see your doctor and consider having some testing soon.  You may wish to discuss your symptoms with an oncologist also.  My other thought is that you may have a mastitis-an infection in the breast.  This needs antibiotics to clear up.  Your doctor can examine you for this as well.  A good place to start is to see your gynecologist for a breast exam.  Best wishes.  I hope this helps a little.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 34 yrs old female and have 2 children. Went to see Dr. in early July, 2006 regarding a lump found in the left breast. It was situated on the 2 o'clock position and fairly deep. Dr. confirmed lump by physical exam and requested a mammogram to be taken. July 18th, 2006-Mammogram was taken of both breasts. July 26th, 2006-Mammogram results confirm a lump in the left breast. Inconclusive findings. Spot compression and ultrsound requested. August 8th, 2006-Spot compression of left Breast. ultrasound of left Breast. August 9th, 2006- Noticed nipple on left Breast to be very itchy. Tried to relieve it with creams and cold cloth. No relief. Discharge from left nipple is blackish in appearance and sticky. Very hot by times as well as a very \"full feeling\". at times seems somewhat swollen but not much. August 11th, 2006- App. with Dr.regarding itch and go over mammo and ultrasound results. Ultrasound confirmed a bi-lobe cyst deep by chest wall at the 2 o'clock position. One part approx. 1.4 cm in diameter and the other part .8 cm in diameter. Thoughts of radioligist- \"appears benign\" App. made with surgeon . Prescribed hydrocortisone cream for the itch. If no relief in a few days, to come back. August 14th, 2006- No relief from cream and nipple has a terrible burning sensation. Dr. prescribes antibiotic- (in case of infection). also orders a battery of blood tests: Iron, B12, CA 125, Cholesteral, CBC, Renal Profile. Family History of Breast Cancer and ovarian Fibrocystic Disease showing atypical cells. All sisters and mother had hysterectomies before age of 40, except me.   Update: August 24th. Went to surgeon and cyst was drained but sample was not sent for testing. Surgeon said cysts are not cancerous and that testing sample would be a 'waste of time'. Also that blisters around areola and nipple are most likely exzema and would go away. Said I was too young to be worried about ibc.  It is now December 30th and about 8 weeks ago I noticed that the cyst/s are back. The 'water-blisters' (some clear and some bloody-like) have never left and the itching is still there. So is the discharge. Also my lymph node directly over my right breast is quite swollen. Went to local Dr. Confirmed both cysts in left breast and 'feels like a cyst over right breast, about 2\" below collarbone. Went back to see surgeon. Said to come back in a month for re-evaluation. I have another app. January 16th. I  am concerned that this matter is not being concidered seriuosly enough. Should I tell him to send me to a breast specialist? I don't want to insult him, but I feel like not enough is being done. When I asked him to biopsy and test this time or maybe another mammo, he shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't think he needed to. Thank you for any suggestions you can give me.  The only medication I am on is thryoid mediaction- synthroid .175mg. I had a cyst about the size of a pear removed from my right ovary 12 yrs ago, several smaller cysts removed over a course of 3 yrs from same ovary(all benign),  a benign lump removed from my left breast (3 o'clock postition) 2 yrs ago.  Sorry this is so long. thank you.  rushelle\n\n",

    "content": "Hi rushelle, I would strongly encourage you to see a breast specialist. Symptoms that don't resolve in a short amount of time with treatment should be investigated further. The statement that one is \"too young\" to develop breast cancer is incorrect. There are average age ranges (guidelines) that the frequency of certain cancers are typically increased, however, that is not to say that cancer doesn't ever happen to age out of the guidelines. IBC can be difficult to detect due to the fact that there may or may not be a \"lump\" because the cancer spreads in \"sheets\". Diagnostics such as a mammogram or ultrasound may not detect IBC either. A skin punch biopsy is typically how IBC is detected. Paget's disease of the breast typically affects the nipple and areola. It may be mistaken for eczema due to the similarity of symptoms. Symptoms, ie., redness, itching, scaling/crusting/oozing, burning, and sometimes an inverted nipple and or nipple discharge, etc., not resolving in a short amount of time, ie., (approx 1 month) despite treatment needs EVALUATED by a breast specialist. Diagnostics, mammogram, ultrasound may be helpful but again diagnosis is typically verified with a tissue biopsy. I again, STRONGLY encourage an evaluation by a breast specialist and an update to your post would be very appreciated when your time permits. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Theresa Jones, RN  I thank you very much for getting back to me.  What is the best way for me to go about getting an appointment with a Breast specialist?  I live in Canada, and where I live right now, I do not have a regular family doctor. I'm afraid that this Surgeon that i DO have another appointment with Jan. 16th, will not forward me to one.  Would I be best to go into the local  ER and ask the Dr. on call there to forward me ?  I'm more concerned about the possibilities of this being Pagets disease because of the fact of it staying more so around my areola and nipple of my left breast. However,  the fact that I am now feeling a lump in the lymph node over my right breast has me quite concerned to say the least.  I have an appointmant on the 17th as well will the pap clinic. Would they be able to refer me to a breast specialist if the Surgeon does not?  Again, thanks for your answer back. Will definitely keep you posted.  rushelle\n\n",

I am rather small chested so it is rather normal for me to feel small lumps, but this one is rather big and hard. It moves around slightly and is not painful to the touch but when it has been irratated for a while it gets sore. I have no family history of breast cancer as far as I know, as well as no past surgeries or diagnosis. I am not on any current medications besides my inhaler. I was on birth control but have not been on that for quite some time. I know I should go to a doctor, but we just moved and I'm still in that 'no health insirance' period; so I was looking for some advice first. Thank you so much for your time.\n\n",

    "title": "Breast lump a rib bone?????",
    "content": "Im a 25 year old female. Past surgeries include 3 c-sections, gallblader removal, and cervical conization to remove pre-cancerous cells. I recently found a lump on my right breast, more toward the middle of my chest or on my sternum area.  I didn't think anything of it and I just thought it was a bone. I lost 70lbs about a year ago and just thought maybe it was a bone I just couldnt feel because of the weight.  Well over the past two months the lump seem to get bigger so i went and had it checked out.  While at my gyno's office he decided he wanted to poke me with a needle to see if he could asparate fluid from this lump....well he couldn't.  So yesterday I had an ultra sound done.  The ultrasound tech. said that she isn't an official person to give a diagnoses but she didn't see a mass over this area.  She said that the area is right over my rib but the tissue over it is clear.  She asked if I had any trauma to the area, and I explained that a year and a half ago....i jumped off of a cliff and landed in the water wrong and bruised my whole left side of my body.  She said that it was probably due to that. My question is how come it is getting bigger.  This lump is hard, painless and can only be felt on the right side.  It doesnt move at all and if I stand facing you it is quite noticable.\n\n",

I cannot comment on why it has grown in size because this has to be a documented increase first.  What you should do is bring the size issue to your doctor's attention so that he can take accurate measurements of it and follow up with him. If it does increase in size then further investigations maybe warranted.  Good luck!\n\n",

I went to my gyn and she said it is probably just a swollen gland, and if it kept reoccuring to come back. It returned on and off. About 6 months ago, it returned and has remained. I returned to the same doctor, and she ordered an ultrasound. The results from the ultrasound were inconclusive. She said she does not think it is breast cancer because it has gone on so long, and a mamogram isn't neccesary. There is clearly a lump there, and it is very tender and painful. What could this be, and what is my best course of action? I have no family history of breast cancer, do not currently take any medicines, and am overall healthy except for HPV - which has not caused any problems since I was diagnosed and treated for cervical dysplacia three years ago.

    "content": "Hi Onelildarlin2u, As I am sure you are already aware, there are both benign and malignant breast lumps, both with differentiating signs or symptoms. Lumps that are characteristic of a cystic or fibrous  nature may be firm, movable, tender, change during different phases of a menstrual cycle, etc. Lumps that are hard, fixed, etc. would of course be more disconcerting. Any lump, regardless of age, should be brought to the attention of your physician for an evaluation. Changes for example, in the skin of the breasts appearance, ie., (redness), texture, size, itching, pain, etc., would absolutely warrant an evaluation. Diagnostic studies, would most likely begin with a mammogram, and would be followed by an ultrasound. Don't be surprised if this is the combination because in younger women, breast tissue is much more dense and areas of suspicion may not be detected by mammogram. Again, notify your physician for an evaluation, and if your time permits an update would be appreciated. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Congratulations to your friend. It would be next to impossible to state whether or not you friend will develop any type of illnesses. Breast cancer risks increase with age. Appoximately 1 in 8 women will develop breast cancer at some point in her life. Risk factors may include, family history, early onset of menstruation, late menopause, 1st pregnancy after age 30, hormone replacement, certain proliferattive breast diseases,  ie., radiation exposure, high fat diet, obesity, alcohol, etc. Don't borrow trouble, so to speak, and worry that something will present itself before it actually does. Your friend may be fortunate and go through life without any complications etc. and all the worrying will essentially be for nothing. Look at it this way, worry about things you can change, do something about it, the rest of all the problems will take care of themselves. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I have been sleeping for the past 3 days in a very uncomfortable bed on my right side, which I never do - not sure if this makes any difference. I went to see my doctor the next day and was told that may be breast abscess and I was given erythromycin which I started taking the same day. The same day in the evening I also developed low grade fever, chills, cold/flu like symptoms which passed the next day. The pain in my breast also disappeared but the swelling is still there - slighly reduced but not so much. I don't have any swollen lymph nodes in my armit or anywhere near. I'm feeling absolutely exhausted. I have been on antiobiotics for 2 days now. I was told that if it doesn't get better, I will need the abscess drained. I am not breastfeeding. My breasts are both very lumpy and have always been. My grandmother on my father's side died of breast cancer when she was in her 70s. I'm terrified that this is inflammatory breast cancer and that the doctor who didn't really take a lot of time to examine me has misdiagnosed it.  Please help!!\n\n",

Now I have been told I have calcifications where the tumor was and at present waiting to see a surgeon in the new year.

My questions to you are, is  it possible that the turmor has returned and is it possible that it is in the left lung as well.  As I have been told I have a  small mass in my left lung, they are watching, so far it has not grown. I,  at the same time in 2003 I  had nsclc in my right lung and 48%  removed.  Someone recently,  told me that it is best to leave some breast  tisssue and only had a partial mastectomy or a  lumpectomy  for if it comes back again then I will,  still have some tissue to remove. Please tell me how true this is.  Not many doctors know much about phylloides as I have been told it is rare.  Could you help me please.   I appreciate any info you might have. Thanks for your time.

    "content": "Hi shabbychic, Phyllodes tumor can be classified as benign, borderline, and malignant. You are correct in stating that this is a rare form of malignancy as it affects a very small percentage. Treatment of this particular tumor, generally speaking, is by wide local excision, breast conserving in nature, providing clear margins are attained. The risk of recurrence or metastisis would be related to margin infiltration, etc. Calcifications may be due to a number of reasons and concern is raised depending on their size, shape, clusters, etc. or may be in a linear pattern related to, ie, previous surgery. Regardless, the radiologist and surgeon would be able to determine if these are alarming in nature. It sounds like you have been afflicted with two entirely different forms of cancer. Non-small Cell Lung Carcinoma originates in the lung itself. Taking into consideration your past history of cancer, even though the left lung mass has not changed in size, I certainly hope some additional diagnostics and intervention is planned for this area as well.

    "content": "Hello,  \"Peau d'orange\" as you probably already know is a French term that means \"orange skin\". Its very discriptive since the skin of the breast in these cases actually looks very similar to the outer layer of an orange that is pealed off. The pores are accentuated forming deep pits in the skin that are like orange skin.  Inflammatory breast cancer is diagnosed on pathological grounds, however, clinically the breast is inflammed. clinically what causes a physician to suspect that this could be inflammatory breast cancer is that the condition doesn't resolve or subside on administration of proper antibiotics.

    "content": "I am a 32 y/o lactating woman, no history of family breast cancer. Nine months ago, my baby started sleeping through the night and I woke up laying flat on my right breast and it was red and engorged. I was treated for mastitis and the redness went away, but one month later I was still swollen. I was monitored by a surgeon and finally on 10/12 they performed an FNA (not guided by u/s). It was sent to 2 different pathologists and came back \"suggestive of papillary lesion\". FNA also classified as \"difficult to read due to the presence of air-drying artifact\". Core biopsy performed on 11/22 at a well-known breast center took 6 samples of the lump and came back with no abnormalities found and a diagnosis of stromal fibrosis. Ultrasound was consistent with stromal fibrosis and clinical exam was unalarming (thickened tissue and dilated milk ducts).  Surgeon recommends excisional biopsy. Here is the problem: I want to have more children and breastfeed them. I am currently breastfeeding my first child. The lump is subareolar and excision will interfere with future breastfeeding.  Do you know of any alternative to complete surgical excision? Is it possible to overrule the FNA with the core biopsy results since the core biopsy examined so many more cells? I am hesitant to consent to full biopsy unless I have some more evidence that I really need it.\n\n",

I was due to start my period so I thought that was the reason why.  well, i completely skipped my period that month and it started hurting more.  I looked at it and massaged it and when I did this I noticed a discharge coming out.  It was a cloudy white.  Well, it went away and I started my period the next month.  Now...I have been having pain in my underarm.  I could feel pea like size lumps in my arm.  It isnt extremetly painful but is uncomfortable.  I havent had pain in my breast until one of my children was leaning on me while i was lying down.  The pressure on my left breast was very painful.  The kids are always laying on me and it never felt like that before.  My left breast has been feeling somewhat heavy.  I have continuely been massaging it looking for a lump or something but I have found nothing.  Now the last couple of days, my left arm feels as if it has poor circulation.  It feels cold and weak.  I have been extremely tired this past month and have gained 15lbs because of not wanting to do anything.  I am one that doesnt like to see doctors and avoid it as long as I can, but I feel that there is something wrong.  Can you tell me what this could be?  I am making an appointment today.  It is really frightening me considering my arm is making it difficult for me to sleep.  If anyone has any ideas i would greatly appreciate it. Thanks, Holly\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are many possible causes for breast pain. These can be broken down into causes related to menstruation (cyclical) or noncyclical pain. Although many women with pain in one or both breasts understandably fear breast cancer, breast pain is NOT a common symptom of cancer.  Common causes of cyclical breast pain include:  Some degree of breast tenderness is normal, caused by hormonal fluctuations. They can be a manifestation of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Fibrocystic breast tissue is a common condition. It involves breast lumps and bumps throughout the breast tissue that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period.  Noncyclical breast pain can be due to hormonal changes other than those of the menstrual cycle. This includes pregnancy (tends to be more common during the first trimester and pregnancy at a young age); puberty (in both girls and boys); breast feeding; approach of menopause (once your menstrual periods have stopped completely, breast tenderness often goes away unless you are taking hormone replacement therapy) and also soon after childbirth, the breasts may become engorged with milk.  Mastitis from a blocked and infected milk duct, usually associated with breastfeeding; alcoholism with liver damage and injury/ trauma to the breast. Certain medications may also cause breast pain, including digitalis preparations, aldomet, aldactone and other potassium-sparing diuretics, anadrol, and chlorpromazine. Shingles can lead to pain felt in the breast if the painful blistering rash appears on the skin over one of your breasts.  If you are still concerned then you should get it checked out.

    "title": "Persistant breast pain under arm while nursing",
    "content": "Hi.  I am currently breastfeeding my third baby.  She is now a year old. I have had pain on the left side of my left breast for several months (it started shortly after my baby was born).  I can't find a distinct lump, and the pain isn't constant -- it flares up once in a while, but when pressed or bumped it hurts.  I've had breast infections before (even in that same spot, it seems), and the pain is similar to that of a breast infection, only milder, and it hasn't gone away.        There is also a small, red mole-looking thing under my arm near the same spot.  It is round and bright red like a cluster of capillaries or something (pretty small -- about 1/16-1/8 of an inch in diameter), but I don't know if that is relevant or not.  It has been there for several years.      Should I wait until I stop nursing in about 3-6 months, and see if the pain disappears?  Or, does it sound suspicious enough to be evaluated immediately?  It doesn't seem to really be getting worse, or anything.  I'm wondering if there could be a breastfeeding-related cause.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope you are feeling better.  There are many possible causes for breast pain. These can be broken down into causes related to menstruation (cyclical) or noncyclical pain. Although many women with pain in one or both breasts understandably fear breast cancer, breast pain is NOT a common symptom of cancer.  Common causes of cyclical breast pain include:  Some degree of breast tenderness is normal, caused by hormonal fluctuations. They can be a manifestation of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Fibrocystic breast tissue is a common condition. It involves breast lumps and bumps throughout the breast tissue that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period.  Noncyclical breast pain can be due to hormonal changes other than those of the menstrual cycle. This includes pregnancy (tends to be more common during the first trimester and pregnancy at a young age); and yes in breast feeding. Breast tenderness often goes away unless you are taking hormone replacement therapy) and also soon after childbirth, the breasts may become engorged with milk.  Mastitis from a blocked and infected milk duct, and this is also associated with breastfeeding.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Lump in breast",
    "content": "Hello, I am a 31yr old female with no family history of breast cancer.  A few days ago I noticed a lump in my left breast just under the nipple area.  I noticed it beacause my husband gave me a hug and it hurt a little bit so I checked it out.  It only hurts when I press on it.  Is there any typical infectections that women get in this area of the breast.  Other than the lump which is about a half inch to and inch in diameter, there are no other changes in my breasts at all.  Any thoughts or comments would be appreciated.  Another thing which I  may note is that I have had swollen lymph nodes in my neck on both sides for about 3 months.  Perhaps I should check my breast for any lymph nodes there??  Thanks in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 35 years old my 31 year old sister was diagnosed with breast cancer this summer. She had a masectomy, chemo and radiation. She also had genetic testing that came up negative for the mutated BRAC 1 - BRAC 2 Gene. I was told to get a mammogram ASAP. I did, a small suspicious mass was found in my right breast, after an Ultra Sound and a needle biopsy were the suspicious 9mm mass was removed it turned out to be benine and diagnosed as Stromal Fibrosis. I actually go tomorrow morning for my 6 months diagnositc mammogram check up, I'm sure I will be monited closely. My question is regarding birh control, I have been on and off the pill for 6 years. I have 2 children and don't plan on having any more, I've even tossed around getting my tubes tighed. I spoke to the gynocologist and was told d that if I wanted to continue to use a low estroggyn based pill as my birth controll that I could stay on it till menapuse. Even the oncologist told me there isnt any hard core evidence that the pill has anything to do with breast cancer, and that some people are put on the pill to avoid cervical cancer. So I guess my question would be is it OK for me to remain on the birth control pill with my history and my sisters history? Thank you for your help. :-)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Your doctors are both correct.  According to the National Cancer Institute, studies examining the use of BCPs as a risk factor for breast cancer have produced inconsistent results. Most studies have not found an overall increased risk for breast cancer associated with oral contraceptive use. For example, in 2002, results from the Women's Contraceptive and Reproductive Experience (Women's CARE) study indicated that present or past use among both Caucasian and African-American women ages 36 to 64 did not significantly increase the risk of breast cancer.  The contraversy surrounds the earlier use of high dose pills in the past.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I am a 25 year old female with no breast cancer history in family. I do have family history of skin and colon cancer. My mother had cancer cells present but they were never able to link them to anything. My hometown in the South harbors many cancer patients.   I have a lump the size of a marble in my right armpit. I had an ultrasound, and 2nd opinion- both pronounced it to be a benign (please excuse my spelling). However, the second doctor (my gyno) said if I was worried he suggested I have it removed. Ive also been having dull headaches at night- but this could be due to dietary changes. NO MORNING PAIN- I know thats a sign to look for.  Recently Ive started having random pains in my right breast, which feels like its behind my nipple. I am having an endoscopy this week because I suffer from a somewhat severe state of GERD. I was recently started on Protonix, and I feel like I'm having more headaches than usual.  Can my pain be linked to the GERD, or for that matter, my swollen lymph node? I was also diagnosed with intercystular cystitus (Im SURE I murdered that) recently.  I do not smoke, drink, and Ive had one sexual partner my entire life.   I would appreciate any suggestions.\n\n",

It is thin like water. Don't feel any lump or see anything wrong. Was wondering though about 4 months ago, I had what my doctor called a small sebacious cyst on the same breast, it went away with medications and warm soaks, but at the same time as it was going away, it kept feeling like a toothache in it, just aching. No sharp pains or anything, just a dull ache. Never lasted very long though. Seemed if I took a Motrin, it would go away for several days. Then finally that ache went away all together. Once in a while, I would notice a yellowish color stain on my nightgown when I would wake up in the morning, right where the nipple was. Then that seemed to stop for even a few weeks. Now it has started with the discharge again, and of course squeezing it can make it come out more, and sleeping on it, but once in a while it is doing it just when I am doing basic housework or something and I have noticed some blood in 3 times in the last 4 days. Never a lot, but it is noticable. Can I see my regular family doctor for this? What should I tell them, when I call for an appointment, do you think it could be an infection still from where the cyst was? Please help?\n\n",

There is pain (non-cyclical), especially in the left one, 'travelling' to the left armpit and sometimes to the back.  My armpits are not swollen and have no lumps. Please help me understand what might cause pain in the left breast and armit. Is it fibroadenoma or something else is being developed?...

    "content": "Hello,  There are many possible causes for breast pain. These can be broken down into causes related to menstruation (cyclical) or noncyclical pain.  Although many women with pain in one or both breasts understandably fear breast cancer, breast pain is NOT a common symptom of cancer.  Boys and men have breast tissue. If a male has breast tissue that is visible, this is called gynecomastia. This can cause pain and tenderness. As a normal part of development, adolescent boys can have some breast swelling and tenderness. Like breast tenderness in women, this is due to hormonal changes.  Common causes of cyclical breast pain include:  Some degree of breast tenderness is normal, caused by hormonal fluctuations. They can be a manifestation of premenstrual syndrome (PMS). Fibrocystic breast tissue is a common condition. It involves breast lumps and bumps throughout the breast tissue that tend to be more tender just before your menstrual period.  Noncyclical breast pain can be due to hormonal fluctuations other than those of the menstrual cycle. This includes pregnancy (tends to be more common during the first trimester and pregnancy at a young age); puberty (in both girls and boys); breast feeding; approach of menopause (once your menstrual periods have stopped completely, breast tenderness often goes away unless you are taking hormone replacement therapy) and also soon after childbirth, the breasts may become engorged with milk.  Mastitis from a blocked and infected milk duct, usually associated with breastfeeding; alcoholism with liver damage and injury/ trauma to the breast. Certain medications may also cause breast pain, including digitalis preparations, aldomet, aldactone and other potassium-sparing diuretics, anadrol, and chlorpromazine. Shingles can lead to pain felt in the breast if the painful blistering rash appears on the skin over one of your breasts.  Best regards.\n\n",

Periodic - typically once per day but yesterday twice per day. Lasts about 30 sec-1min. Stops me from whatever I'm doing - I have to pause and mentally work through the pain. Then I resume my business. This has been going on about 2-3 weeks.  Also I noticed last week that my right breast has a harder area on it than the left one. And that area is VERY tender and painful to the touch.   Should I be concerned?   Normally I would just go tot the doctor, but lately I have been frustrated by my doctor's office administratively. I love my doctor but I can't deal with her office anymore.\n\n",

I went for a mammogram and an ultrasound and the radiologist said that it was just an enlarged lymph node and not to worry about it.

Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  Ultrasound is a useful imaging modality in assessment of lymph nodes.  Best regards.\n\n",

I only worry that there is a more serious problem (infection or fluid buildup) that the medicine is only \"covering\" up right now.

The relative risk of patients with an affected first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister) is 1.7 times higher when compared to controls without affected family members.  Depending on the risk you may need to start breast examinations and mammographies at an earlier stage. Prevention strategies for those at very high risk may include tamoxifen, clinical trials or even prophylactic mastectomies in some cases.  Concerning pancreatic cancer it has a very a high mortality rate. Pancreatic cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer-related death for both men and women (following lung, colon, breast, and prostate cancers) and is responsible for 5% of all cancer-related deaths. Estimated new cases and deaths from pancreatic cancer in the United States in 2005: New cases: 32,180.  Deaths: 31,800.

    "content": "Hi natalielfc, Aside from certain types of breast cancer, other conditions that may cause breast swelling and pain are infection, blocked mammary ducts, fibrocystic changes, etc. However, when swelling occurs (especially unilaterally) and persists, doesn't decrease or change with menstrual cycles, it warrants an investigation by a physician. Pain is an abnormal symptom and indicates that something is malfunctioning regardless of whether its a benign condition or something more serious. Physicians are professionals that treat people in healthy and illness states. Let me ask you, if your children were ill or had complaints of pain would you take them in for an evaluation? Why would you not do the same for yourself? They depend on you to do all in your power to keep yourself healthy to take care of them ;) So, do this for yourself and for them! I strongly suggest that you make an appointment for an evaluation by your physician. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi winnieelayne, Have you had a recent examination by your physician which  included a breast exam? Please confirm the nature of your finding by direct clinical examination by your physician. It is probably a lymph node it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The axillary lymph nodes are located in the axillae (arm pits). They drain the arm, thoracic wall, breast. Common causes of enlargement include infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma.Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that epitrochlear nodes larger than 0.5 cm or inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal [1,2]. So to answer your question, could this be directly related to your surgery, yes it is not an impossibility. Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'. An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. If there have been no changes over several months and constitutional symptoms, for example, unintentional weight loss, fatigue, night sweats, etc. are not present it would be less concerning. However, if a recent physical exam (including a breast exam) has not been completed, I would suggest an evaluation to rule out any concerning factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN  References: =========== 1. Libman H. Generalized lymphadenopathy. J Gen Intern Med 1987;2:48-58.  2. Morland B. Lymphadenopathy. Arch Dis Child 1995; 73:476-9.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi! I had a skin biopsy on my breast a month ago. I had been advised to use an antibiotic ointment on the wound. That was done for about a month (I used bacitracin, then was told to use bactroban). The wound did not heal properly, so I'm sort of starting over. I've now been told to just use vaseline on the wound. That'll be for another month 'til it heals over.  My question is with these topical ointments being used on my breast, I'm sure they are being absorbed through the skin, so is there any risk for breast cancer? I was thinking no since I think some ointments are used when breast biopsies are done for those wounds. But I have/will be using the ointments for about two months.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wafaa.   Well, I used the antibiotic for the one month and have now been told to use just the vaseline. Do you know if vaseline (white petroleum) is bad?? And as far as antibiotic resistance, is that only harmful in that pretty much the antibiotic becomes useless?  Also, I am not sure why the wound did not heal correctly. I was a bit mentally stressed that month. I'm not sure if that affects wound healing. Another factor could be that the shave biopsy that was done was deeper than my dermatologist thought. Also, like I said, the skin biopsy was on the breast, so I'm not sure if the tissue there heals slower?  The original dermatologist who recauterized the wound when it bled didn't seem concerned and didn't mention anything. Another one I went to suggested there might be a small infection making the wound heal slower. BUT there are no physical signs of infection. He suggested an oral antibiotic.  What do you suggest I do? He's only basing the theory of a TINY infection on the fact that the wound is slow healing. But would it be worth taking the oral antibiotic if it's not 100% that an infection is present?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Fearful,   Yes when i talked about antibiotic resistance i meant that it becomes useless.  One of the possibilities why the wound isn't healing ... 1-Infection in the form of redness, hottness,tenderness,swelling of the wound...does it ooze any form of discharge and what is its colour?...may be you can make a wound swab and see which bacteria is causing the infection and give the appropriate antibiotic according to culture and senstivityof that discharge. 2- a deep wound (is it deep and wide also? and by \"wide\" i mean that the edges of your skin are not approximating that it might need stitches?) how big is it?  3- low imminuity....Stress decreases the immune system for sure...but not to that extent! ...if you are doing your regular blood tests ,please do a random blood sugar test to make sure you do not have diabetes...which can make you eat a lot,drink alot, pass water a lot,numbness of the fingers....i don't think you have it,but it's just a precaution to be on the safe side,ok?  .  As for what to do...here is my opinion...if there is no infection,the wound is not deep or wide and it's NOT oozing,then just leave it as it is...keep it dry. u don't even have to put a dressing on it....unless ofcourse it's in the way of your bra...u can add a dressing to prevent friction.  I don't think Vaseline is harmful...although i dunno why he's prescribed it...Please describe your wound for me next time.  I will post an article very soon about harmful substances that has been proven to be found in breast tumor cells by molecular biology techniques...so all of us can watch out while buying our skin care products,ok? keep me updated, Best regards\n\n",

Sometimes, I get a 'tingling or prickly' sensation but not really \"pain\". I'm not sure if that's actually from the bandaids tugging at my skin or maybe it's the wound healing itself?  2. It's about a 8 x 4 mm wound. So maybe around a centimeter. That wouldn't constitute stitches. I THINK that's considered a small wound. Not sure how deep it is! When one derm looked at it, he said it looked pretty deep, BUT the one who did the shave biopsy in the first place and recauterized it didn't think she did it that deep, so she didn't understand why it bled. So it could have been deep, maybe maybe not.  3. I had a blood test a few months ago. Does that count?  I was told to keep the wound moist, not dry. That's probably what the vaseline is for. A lot of places have different methods. Some say dry, some say moist! I will have to continue with my derm's directions, but what do you usually think is best?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, thanks for continuing to reply to me, doctor!  Also, like I mentioned, the original dermatologist who did the biopsy recauterized my wound and told me to return in a month and hopefully it'll be healed at that point. BUT that other derm I went to suggested there might be an infection because it's so slow to heal. I passed on the antibiotics because that was his only reason for suggesting them and it didn't seem like a strong enough reaosn.  I was back there yesterday and again, he suggested antibiotics because of the slow healing and also he said there's some redness around the wound. But isn't some redness around the wound normal - means it's healing? I heard one of the stages of healing is that the wound will become increasingly red and it's easy to confuse with infection. At what point does the redness no longer signify healing, but means infection??  I don't know what to do because I figured if it was infected, my original derm would have said something, but she didn't. She didn't even tell me to use antibiotic ointment anymore - use vaseline. Should I go back to the original derm and ask what she thinks or go ahead and listen to the second derm and take the 'biotics?  (Don't worry I'm aware you can't replace person to person medical advice, but I'd love your opinions.)\n\n",

About the redness, i really can't judge what i cannot see, but like last time ...signs of inflammation includes redness,hotness(compare it to the other breast temperature for an example), tenderness (painfulwhen you press on it), and if there's bacterial infection it almost always oozes a discharge...where its colour depends on the type of bacteria it's harvesting....you can ask for a culture and senstivity test. they take a swab from the wound and determine which bacteria is growing and causing the infection. and to know if that bacteria is a commensal(a bacteria that lives normally on the skin) or a pathogen (causing a bad infection)  i hope i helped...Good luck and don't worry...the most important thing is that the biopsy result is ok    Best regards,\n\n",

If there's no scab, does that mean it's not fully healed? Like I said, it has pretty much filled in.  Also, since it is healing/healed, does that mean there was no infection? What would happen if there was an infection and it never got taken care of? By now, wouldn't I have known it if one was there?  And thanks, keep me posted!\n\n",

Doc, there actually is still redness around the wound. But there was redness there starting in the first week and has always remained. The derm saw this and said \"it's healing\".   So, does redness around a wound always mean infection? Since the redness was there from way in the begninning, I figured I'd have known about an infection by now (gotten a fever, saw pus, had pain, hotness).\n\n",

I've recently being researching the exact topic and believe there is plenty of evidence to suggest that in fact, there is a link. I've posted an article below and hope that it helps in the future when providing suggestions, guidance and on line feedback: Petroleum by-product that coats the skin like plastic, clogging the pores. Interferes with skin's ability to eliminate toxins, promoting acne and other disorders. Slows down skin function and cell development, resulting in premature aging. Used in many products (baby oil is 100% mineral oil!) Any mineral oil derivative can be contaminated with cancer causing PAH's (Polycyclic Aromatic Hydrocarbons). Manufacturers use petrolatum because it is unbelievably cheap.  Mineral oil    Liquidum paraffinum (also known as posh mineral oil!)    Paraffin oil    Paraffin wax    Petrolatum   Among the studies linking the petrolatum impurity PAHs to breast cancer is a Columbia University study in which researchers found that the breast tissue of women with breast cancer was 2.6 times more likely to contain elevated levels of PAHs bound to DNA (called DNA adducts) than the breast tissue of women without breast cancer (Rundle et al. 2000). The National Toxicology Programs finds that some PAHs are reasonable anticipated to be human carcinogens, and the State of California lists a number of PAHs as carcinogens in its Proposition 65 program (NTP 2002, OEHHA 2004).  Petrolatum is listed as a probable human carcinogen in the European Union's Dangerous Substances Directive (UNECE 2004), and its use in cosmetics will be banned by September 2004 with the following caveat:\n\n",

    "content": "Hello ljen, Fibrocystic changes occur in women most often of reproductive age. However, a physical examination would identify if the areas are of a fibrocystic nature and if there is a question regarding the etiology other diagnostics (depending on your age) may include an ultrasound, mammogram, etc. Any breast abnormalities including an areolar rash that persists for a two week period warrants an investigation by a physician. I strongly encourage you to make an appointment and have this evaluated. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Diagnosed in Spain",
    "content": "I was dx March 2004 with a 9 x 7cm tumor in my right breast. Lobular infiltrante carcinoma. My first report also said T4 Nx Mx, the oncologist told me I was stage 111b. I had 3 cycles of epirrubicina & ciclofosfamida followed by 6 cycles of taxol & gencitabina. I was on a clinical trial and had treatment every 2 weeks. Four weeks after chemo I had a mastectomy, the report said that the tumor was 7.5cm diameter, grade one with 3 out of 12 nodes cancerous. RE(+) RP(+) and HER2 (-) Next I had 25 rounds of radiotherapy about 6 weeks after the surgey. I was put on tamoxifen which I have been taking since September 2004. I return every 6 months for blood tests, chest xrays, mamogram and \u00b4manual\u00b4checkup with the oncologist. I am 50 next month, March, female with no breast cancer history in my family. Even though I am almost 2 years from diagnosis I am still not understanding the jargon, like what regime the chemo was, I often see abbreviated stuff but don\u00b4t know what mine is. My main problem or question is: How bad/good is this prognosis. When I first started out on this journey I had an excellent english speaking onc who was brilliant but only explained bare facts and told me that the above \u00b4package\u00b4was what I was having, I wasn\u00b4t given a choice, I also read that people are given a choice. Now when I go back for check ups I get any available onc, they say I am cured? From what I read a reoccurance is more than likely. I really need to know what I have been through and maybe what I am likely to go through, can you give me an idea please.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be difficult to assess the absolute risk of recurrence in your case. Please note however, that one of the most favorable factors in your case is the fact that two years have passed without recurrence. Most recurrences are known to develop in the first two years after initial treatment.  Let me try my best to discuss a few independent aspects of your prognosis.   According to your stage, stage IIIB disease is associated with a 44% 5- year survival rate when given multimodality therapy such as the one you received. Meaning, in clinical studies a little less than half the patients that took treatment were still alive 5 years after the start of their treatment plan.  As regards your pathology invasive lobular carcinoma is associated with both synchronous and metachronous contralateral primary tumors in 30% of the cases.  Lymph node positivity is associated with a less favorable prognosis. However, the highest risk of disease progression was found in patients who initially had more than 4 lymph nodes harboring the disease. So in your case, you are not doing too bad there.  When it comes to the tumor size, large tumors such as yours are also a risk factor for recurrence.  On the other hand a negative Her-2/neu is associated with much better prognosis than those who are HER-2 positive.  The strong positivity of your ER and PR receptors confers excellent prognosis and allows you to benefit from adjuvant therapy in the form of tamoxifen.  As you can see it would be difficult to give you an absolute assessment, however please bear in mind that oncologists tend to breathe easier once two years have passed with no breast cancer related events.  If you have any further questions please do not hesitate to ask.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "tennis ball sized lump under arm!",
    "content": "Hello my name is Lacey. I am 22 years old with a 9 month old daughter. I have been having breast pain for 3 months. My right breast is also swollen slightly. I thought I felt a lump in my right breast so i made an appointment with my obgyn. The morning of the appointment I woke up with a large tennisball sized hard lump under my right armpit that doesnot move. I went to the ob and she set me up for a ultrasound of my breasts and to see a breast surgeon on March 3rd. I went to the ultrasound and they told me they didnt find a lump and said nothing about the lump under my armpit. i have since developed one under the other armpit and am concerned. I went to a regular doctor at a clinic and explained my situation. He said he didnt think it was an infection because I have no fever and do not feel bad. he gave me antibiotics anyway. my question is should i see someone else. What could this be?? Should I wait til the 3rd to see the breast surgeon. Please help!!\n\n",

    "content": "I am 51 years old and have just been diagnosed with breast cancer for the third time.  My history is DCIS in 1994-lumpectomy w/radiation.  Recurrence in 1999-DCIS and invasive, mastectomy w/tram flap reconstruction and chemo (adriamycin and cytoxan).  Completed only 2 of the 4 scheduled chemo sessions due to malfunction of port which resulted in severe DVT-scarring and damage to subclavian vein, complete obstruction of (L) jugular vein and partial obstruction of sagittal sinus vein.  I have been on Coumadin since this damage, with no clots and no signs of TIA or stroke.  Now, six years later, the cancer has reappeared in the tram flap and it is 90 % invasive, HER2+, ER+ and PR+, lympho-vascular invasive.  My doctors are recommending a regimen of Taxotere and Carboplatin with Herceptin, before surgery, then Herceptin for 1 year.  If a port can be put in safely, will this regimen increase my risk for more vascular damage?  I can't find any information that states that these chemo drugs will have that potential.   Do you have suggestions for alternate therapies that I might ask my doctors about?  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I hope your chemotherapy is going well.   The regimen you are refering to TCH (Taxotere, Carboplatin, and Herceptin).  Although both Herceptin and Taxotere have been associated with an increased incidence of thrombovascular disorders in post-marketing reports, the incidence of this side effect is not known.  The best way to evaluate the toxicity of a given regimen would be to look at the reported toxicities in the clinical study conducted for the regimen as a whole. In this case this was In a multicenter phase II trial of docetaxel, carboplatin / cisplatin, and trastuzumab (TCH) given to HER2-positive advanced breast cancer.[1]  The overall responses were observed in 60% of those receiving carboplatin. Median time to progression was 13 months for those receiving the carboplatin regimen.[1]  Toxicities were mainly hematologic in the carboplatin regimen in the form of grade III and IV thrombocytopenia, neutropenia (with or without fever).[1]  You would need close monitoring and may need to be changed from warfarin to low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) such as Enoxaparin 1.5 mg/kg per day.  Warfarin is associated with a high bleeding rate in patients with venous thromboembolism and cancer.[2] LMWH is as effective and safer than warfarin for secondary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism in patients with cancer. In one study it was observed that six deaths owing to hemorrhage were noted in the warfarin group with none in the enoxaparin group. [2]  References: ========== 1.

    "content": "You may simply have a \"deep bruise\". When one is hit hard, a bruise can go deep into the tissues. You may not \"see\" a bruise but feel a lump in the area where the bruise was. It can take months for one of these to heal.  Male breast cancer is rare and I would think that with the history of being injured that a bruise would be more likely. If concerned, give it a month or so and then check with your physician if the lump has changed, other than having shown signs of healing.  Take care and let us hear back from you.\n\n",

Today it really hurts and there is a walnut size lump... a softer fluid swelling that is covering  the source of the  pain that comes from the deepest part of the \"pit\" and then is tender around to the side edge of my breast.  Not only is it tender to touch, but it hurts just to have my arm down in the normal postion and I can feel the swollen lump pushing against the inside on my arm.  Within the last few hours my right under arm has become \"pitless\".  This is not an ingrown hair or anything like that... its deep inside.  Maybe an infection?  Today I was exhausted like I would be if I had the flu.... especially in the afternoon.  Should I be concerned?  I just moved to a new city/state and haven't been to a doctor in years.  I'm not even sure where to start or what kind of doctor I should contact or see.  Please help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello alvorada, Thank you for using The Doctor's Lounge. Assuming that this is an axillary lymph node swelling, the lymph nodes of the axilla are known to drain the arm, thoracic wall and breast. Therefore, inflammation, infections as well as cancer will drain to this lymph group. Examples of conditions that could cause this are: Infections, cat-scratch disease, lymphoma, breast cancer, silicone implants, brucellosis, melanoma. In your case the presence of pain and tenderness as well as another swelling related to the breast favour the diagnosis of inflammatory or infectious diseases as opposed to malignancy.  I recommend that you get evaluated as soon as possible by a physician (a family doctor, GP or a surgeon would all do). Your doctor will examine your lymph node and would probably investigate the swelling in your breast possibly requesting a mammogram. You are likely to require a course of antibiotics and if a breast abscess is found it may require drainage. Best regards,\n\n",

The enlarged Lymph Node is on the same side I had breast cancer.  What scares me is that if you research information on the internet it says an enlarged lymph node is either from an infection which would cause pain or soreness ,and if it is painless and doesn't go away right away then it has to be cancer.  There doesn't seem to be any other choices. I don't know if it means anything but I have had rheumatoid arthritis for the past 40 years.   I had a biopsy on Tues and was suppose to get the results on Friday which they didn't have.  The nurse said that usually if they find something serious they let the Surgeon know right away and that it is a good sign if the results from the biopsy take longer to get back.  Does that matter?\n\n",

    "content": "jaykay515, Thank you for your kind words. I think it is a good sign and that the nurse's argument is credible. Regarding pain/tenderness in an enlarged lymph node let me refer you to the only reliable population-based trial that was conducted to evaluate the clinical presentation and character and causes of unexplained lymph node enlargement.  In this Dutch trial it was found that pain in a lymph node can result when a lymph node rapidly increases in size, its capsule stretches and causes pain. Pain was usually the result of an inflammatory process or suppuration, but pain was also the result of hemorrhage into the necrotic center of a malignant node. The presence or absence of pain/tenderness was not found to be a reliable way to differentiate benign from malignant nodes.[1] Please let me know when the results of your biopsy are out.

    "content": "jaykay515, We are really jumping ahead of things here. The presence of a lymph node enlargement on the same side as the breast cancer as opposed to its presence on the opposite side will not help us determine its likelyhood of being cancer vs. infection.  If however, it turns out that it is a cancerous lymph node and that this is the only location where the disease is present then this is a good sign because it means that the recurrence is localized and has not spread outside the initial location to a distant location (opposite side). Such cases where the cancer has spread distantly are considered metastatic (stage IV) disease. Let's take it one step at a time. I understand your anxiety, but the only thing that can make you feel better now is hopefully the result of the biopsy. Any other information won't help at this stage.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi youngone, Fibrocystic breast changes (benign) may affect women of any age but commonly affect women during childbearing years. Typical symptoms may be areas of tenderness, lumpiness or cysts that become more tender just prior to the menstrual cycle. The texture of a cyst is somewhat different from other breast anomalies. There is research that may prove an association between fibrocystic breast changes and breast cancer not because of the cyst's themselves but the possibility of these changes obscuring identification of a suspicious lesion. Risk factors are also taken into consideration during an evaluation. This most likely is the reason that your physician was not concerned at that point but you may want to inform your physician that the \"cyst\" is still present and at that time, she may elect to order an ultrasound to evaluate the area. Women in their 20's-30's have breasts that are significantly more dense  than older women, so a mammogram would be of limited value. Again, contact your physiican and alert her that the area is still present and causing concern. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

However, cysts (fluid filled or solid) are not an uncommon finding in younger women and although of course, warrants an investigation, they often turn out to be of a benign nature. The ultrasound is not a painful procedure and is a diagnostic tool used especially in younger women to detect breast changes. Mammograms are typically not definitive in diagnosis because the density of the breast obscures specific findings. Good Luck with your diagnostics and I hope if your time permits you will consider posting an update. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Lymph glands tend to be firm to hard and not moveable. Swollen lymph glands with active infection tend to be painful.  Sometimes they remain pronounced after an infection has resolved and are usually very solid to the touch.    Just to be on the cautious side, you should take doctor #3's advice and see a surgeon just to rule out anything more serious.  Of course, these are suggestions, no one can accurately diagnose this without a thorough examination.  Your shoulder pain is probably not related.  Shoulder pain is very common with any type of neck pain/strain which can happen with stress and/or degenerative joint disease and of course a tendon strain of some sort.\n\n",

The left side also began to have to same type of lump a few weeks later.  We went to the local phsycian and we only were able to see the PA, who advised warm compresses, NSAIDs and deep tissue massage. An X-ray was done and there did not appear to be any masses in the area (they didnt want to do a mammogram as it would be very painful for a man).  We did trywhat they prescribed for a while and the lumps seem to soften but it was extremily painful for my husband to do the massage and he quickly refused to allow me to continue.    The lumps have continue to increase in size and my husband will not allow me to even touch them very much.  If i brush the nipples, he flinches.    I can not find any signs of enlarged lymph nodes and he appears in relatively good health with the exception of gaining some weight in the past year due to a knee injury from cricket...he doesnt move as much (general activety reduced). He also smokes about a 1/2 pack a day.  I went to nursing school and have a general idea of major disorders, but this has me stumped.  Do i need to push for a biopsy?  Is there anything else at home i can try?  Will loosing some weight make any difference?  I don't like to see him in pain at all.  Thanks for the input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello David!  A lump in the male breast need not always invite fear. Malignancy or cancer in the male breast is relatively rare compared to gynecomastia (the diffuse enlargement of the breast). How long have you been having this lump? Has it always been painful? Has it grown slow/fast since notice? Is there any discharge?  In approximately 30% of males with breast cancer, family history is positive for the disease. A history of testicular trauma could also increase the risk for breast cancer. A male breast cancer typically presents as a painless mass behind the areola ('that darken area'). This is yet another pointer towards a benign diagnosis like an abscess caused by infection or fat necrosis due to lack of blood supply to the fat tissue in the breast, or gynecomastia due to other causes like drugs or hormonal imbalance or tumors.  The key to the diagnosis is an FNAC (Fine Needle Aspiration Cytology) where the cells from the lump are taken out using a needle and examined under the microscope to verify the exact kind of cells making up the lump. If such examination does not clarify the cause, one would require a biopsy, which takes a little tissue from the lump to be examined.  The presence of lumps (lymph nodes) in the right arm pit could pronounce a graver predicament. In any case, a visit to the surgeon should be the next step. And I assure you nobody with a lump in his/her breasts would take it as a joke, and as for males to worry about it would be a waste.  I hope this helps.  Bill\n\n",

To answer you questions, the lump has been there for a few weeks since I noticed anyway.  It was not sore to begin with and as of late, last week and a half, it has been getting more sore each day.  There is no discharge.  It seems to be growing quicker in the last week as well.  Under my right armpit, there is a small lump where I beleve a gland to be that is more towards the fron of my armpit.  (Closer to the breast area but stil well under the armpit.)   The odd thing here is the testicular trauma you mentioned.  Last week I posted a question about a very hardened, what I would call a vien, is going from the shaft of my penis all the way to the head.  It is much more pronounced when I have an erection.  I have also told my doctor about it and he is wanting to make sure we look at his when I go for my next visit.  This hardness is not sore but is defintley a bothersome thing for I have never had this before.  Since I am 46, you would think I have experienced most of these types of events.   Thanks again for your repsonse and I will make sure I speak with my docotr about both of these problems when I see him on the 3rd of December. Regards, David\n\n",

My girlfriend gave me some Orajel Oral solution for the pain but Im not sure how that works in terms of \"healing\" the sores. I've had sores in my mouth numerous times in my life but I don't recall ever one lasting and hurting for as long as these 2 have.   It is very uncomfortable to eat or drink... or even talk for that matter. When I use the Orajel, I can do all of the above with ease but there is some degree of numbness.   Now I've noticed that over the last few days, my right nipple has been very sore. I shrugged it off as just some anonymous body pain maybe it happened when I was sleeping. This morning I was fiddling around with my nipple to see if the pain had lessened, and I noticed that there is a small hard lump directly under my nipple.   With all these things happening at once, I am so afraid.   I am 26yrs old...  5'6 about 191lbs. I don't have any history of breast cancer in my family. I am so afreaid of Doctors and Hospitals and I havent had a routine physical in a couple years now. I feel pretty normal and I know that I have to see a doctor soon... I'm just sop afraid.\n\n",

    "title": "breast cancer",
    "content": "Hello,   The nickel-like hard disks are a normal finding for guys and are referred to as adolescent gynecomastia. It usually develops around puberty; it is sore to touch, can happen in one or both sides and can get fat deposits around them. The breast tissues are very sensitive to estrogen and testosterone in the blood and at puberty a boys testosterone levels will rise and fall drastically causing the breast tissue to be stimulated to grow and respond to estrogen in the blood, all men have a little bit of estrogen. At the end of the teen years, if the breasts are still swollen it is usually because the tissues have remained hypersensitive to the tiny amounts of estrogen in the blood. Hormone therapy, body building drugs, steroids can also cause this to happen. Your Physician can do blood work and check your hormone levels and I would agree that you should have it checked out. There aren\u2019t any real side-effects to the removal of the lumps that I can find; your Surgeon would be more knowledgeable by far.   According to the American Cancer Society, less than 1% of all breast carcinomas occur in men. There are familial tendencies for developing breast cancer in men who have a number of female relatives with breast cancer or who have had the gene BRCA2 (Breast Cancer 2) gene mutation identified in the family.\n\n",

My question is, is there still a chance they might go away since im only 17 or are they going to stay forever since they have been there so long.

    "title": "Itchy nipple",
    "content": "I am 37 years old and when I was pregnant with my now 6 year old son, I developed an itchy area on the aureola of my left breast.  The itching was so bad that I would scratch it until my entire breast turned red.  I ignored it at the time, because it did not itch all the time.  About a year ago, I had scratched it so bad that it scabbed up.  It did not bleed, but it looked like a very dry patch of skin.  I had my regular OB/GYN visit and my Doctor looked at it and suggested I visit my dermatologist, which I did.  She told me it was excema and recommended some over the counter lotion.  It helps on occasion, but it still itches at times.  The \"dry\" patch is gone.   I was also unable to breast feed because my son could not latch on to that same nipple.  In the same breast, I had a tender area that seemed to linger.  When I had my annual OB/GYN appointment this year, she recommended a diagnostic mammogram.  The radiologist did not see anything that suggested cancer and that all was clear, though my breasts are very dense.  I have heard about a disease called Padget's Disease of the nipple, which is a form of cancer.  I am under the impression that it is very rare.    It hasn't gotten worse over the years and I don't see any major changes in my breast, nipple or areola. Could this itching be an early form of that disease or just like my dermatologist stated, excema?  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there, Paget's disease accounts for about 3% of breast cancer cases so it is as you say a rare entity. It presents with a clinical picture very similar to eczema but unlike eczema it does not respond to eczema treatment. From your description I understand that you do not have any manifestations of eczema but are only complaining of itching and tenderness in the area of the nipple. In my opinion that does not represent an early manifestion of breast cancer. Please since this is a clinical question refer to your physician who can obviously assess your condition whereas I cannot.  If you are over 40 years old then you should do a mammogram and get a breast examination every 1-2 years according to current recommendations. If you have a family history or other risk factors for developing breast cancer then you should start your annual examinations at an earlier age. Have a look at our breast cancer pathology page which contains a section on Paget's disease.\n\n",

IDC is aggressive and i am surprised they haven't removedthe whole breast. BUt it's small...and since there are no positive lymph nodes and they have removed it all then a lumpectomy is certainly better phsycologically than removing the whole breast.  It's a good plan...,new one , so you won't find a lot of papers about it. And it's as efficient if you tolerated the taxol.  Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Yes I agree with Dr. Wafaa.  The study you are referring to is the PACS 01 trial the results of which were published in December 2004. FAC and FEC regimens were considered standard treatment long before AC --> Taxol and they are both valid regimens till today. More and more results are coming in favour of using taxanes in the adjuvant setting. So it seems wiser to compare a new line of treatment to the more established regimen (FEC, FAC).  You should also not PinkRibbonJen, that FAC is exactly the same as AC with the addition of 5-Floururacil (the 'F'). FEC replaces the A (Adriamycin) with E (Epirubicin) an analogue of adriamycin produced by the same company which they claim is safer to the heart and thus larger doses are given.  Another point which Dr. Wafaa brought up: since you have opted for a breast conservation surgery, which is a perfectly valid option, have you taken radiotherapy to the breast? Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello FaithAnn, I think you should get an examination. There are many benign conditions that can cause bleeding from the nipple so it may be nothing to worry about. In that case it could be hormonal, a benign growth (duct papilloma). Generally, the time to worry about nipple discharge is when it\u2019s spontaneous (comes out by itself without squeezing), keeps on happening,is only on one side, and/or if it is clear and sticky, like an egg white, or bloody. If these symptoms are present a doctor should check you.\n\n",

    "content": "I found a lump in my upper right breast  3 weeks ago and it was small at first  and as of last week  it grew  to about  1/2 in wide to 2 inches long and keeps growing. My doctor referred me to have done a ultrasound. They didnt find anything. So they had me do a mammogram (lateral)  and still didnt come up with anything.They told me that it was normal tissue.Not to worry about it. Just keep an eye on it to make sure it doesnt grow. ButI went to the doctor Wed. and it grew. Then I go to Medical Imaging Today and it grew 1/2 inch in two days. But, the only time it hurts is when someone messes with it. Should I still worry about it or forget about it?  Plus I am only 23 yrs old  is this wierd  for my age?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Tiffany, Fibrocystic changes, Fibroadenomas, may sometimes arise from connective or glandular tissue of the breast and are usually benign. However, a lateral mammogram (single view) in my opinion is not sufficient and two views should have been completed. A negative mammogram result is not sufficient in evaluating a breast lump. Generally a diagnosis requires a biopsy. I would suggest you talk to your physician, inquire why only a lateral mammogram view was done for an evaluation, and ask about a biopsy. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

The first round of Cehmo was FEC, and the second was Gemzar and Taxol. I experienced severe thigh and knee pain with the Gemzar and Taxol and was taken off after my third treatment, jan. 2004 because it was too strong. I now have sever thigh weakness, and have difficulty getting in and out of chairs as well as climbing stairs. The severe pain I experienced with the Chemo went away after two weeks once the Chemo ended, but the weakness returned three weeks ago. My Oncologist is perplexed and my Neurologist is trying to find out what the cause is. Are you familiar with this, and what could be the cause?\n\n",

I think you should ask for a bone scan...when was the last work up done for you...including a bone scan,chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasound or CT scan?!  have you had your menopause already?! because these might be as simple as post-menopausal or perimenopausal symptoms.

From what I understand, a normal CPK is 0-140.  I had a CT scan on my spine, abdomen and brain, along with a muscle biopsy which all came back negative. It is now 2 months later and my CPK's have dropped to about 450, minor weakness in my thighs, and still no answer to what led up to the problem.  Also, my cancer was hormone receptive, and I have not had any re-occurance of the cancer in either breast. I had a partial Hysterectomy done this past week, my pap as well as overies were normal. They also performed an ablation (sp) to remove the lining from my uterus, which they said was fine as well.  My Nuerologist is still waiting on biopsy they sent out of state to rule out any diseases that we hardly ever hear about.  Thanks for writing back.  Deborah\n\n",

I was pre-menoposal before diagnosis. His treatment plan was as follows:  Radical Masectomy 4 weeks-FEC 4 weeks-Taxol and Gemzar (only finished three, dehydrated and hospitaliized 6 weeks-radiation partial hysterectomy-remove ovaries follow-up with PET scan and begin hormonal therapy drug  Again, the Tomoxafen was never mentioned, and I have completed all but the PET scan and hormonal drug which I have an appt. on June 6th.  My CPK levels have dropped significantly, from 5000 to 450, and I seem to have regained most of my leg strength, still no answer to the muscle biopsy yet.  Now I am just tired from the 5 surgeries in one year, plus the what all these drugs put my body through. Hair is growing back, and besides the being just \"tired\", I seem to be improving.

    "title": "Pain in left breast & lump behind left ear!!",
    "content": "I have pain in the left breast but no noticable lumps, my breasts are very small so I can easily confuse glands with lumps so I am not 100% sure.  Sometimes I feel a lump directly where the pain is and sometimes I have trouble finding it.  I have had this symptom for about a week.  The pain is localized and on the underside of my breast half way between the middle of my breast and the outer edge.  I have a lump behind my left ear surrounded by an unusual onset of painful pimples (I have never broken out in this area).  I noticed the pimples first around 2 weeks ago - The pimples brought the lump to my attention so I don't know how long it has been there.  The lump is hard & not painful.  It does not move easily.  It's about pea sized and visible.  There is nothing similar behind my right ear.  I am also a dj and hearing in my left ear has become worse over the years.  I don't know how that would correlate with my breast pain though.  Cancer? Going Deaf?   PLEASE HELP!!!!\n\n",

If you are overweight then start by losing weight that may help. Usually its a constitutional thing (meaning its normal for some people) and nothing can be done about it. If your nipples are tender or you feel something hard beneath your nipples then you should seek medical attention. Best regards,\n\n",

Listen, best way to make sure that it's benign and not to worry about it, is to get a biopsy from it.

I have been doing some research on my own and I didn't even mention some of the stuff that doctors would like to know.  I just casted it off as no big deal.   I have been having this redness under my breast for about a yaar.  You can only see it I lift my breast.   I thought all this time was that my right breast was getting alot bigger than my left and I getting alot of skin to skin contact and that is why it is red and I sweat alot there and it smells awful.  I have red dots all over my trunk and my arms.  I have a lump under my left arm.  well it is really under it, but i would say about 3 inches down my arm and it is tender.  I have blue veins that you can see through my skin that go around my breast up my chest and over in my arms.  I have what looks like stretch marks on my breast and my arms.  My arms look like I have gained weight.  I also have bumps and lumps on my lower abdomen and it looks like a rash like under my breast.  I had the ultrasound today and they couldn't tell me anything of course but I didn't ask what the black areas where and the white.  Could you please help me?  I feel kind of scared.

    "content": "Hi, my mother had a cyst on both sides of her breast, but they have been removed a few years to almost a decade ago. Now under her armpit, she feels tender and pain around that area. She just received a mammogram and sonogram (sorry if the spelling is incorrect) and the report mentioned something about her lymp nodes underneath her armpit. We know this because she asked for a copy of her test report from the clinic where the examination was performed.The specialist that refered her to get these examinations done is NOT explaining what her condition is because the doctor is NOT returning my mother's phone calls and messages. I am extremely worried about my mothers condition, and I was wondering if someone here would know what the correct term for a specialist who mainly deals with this kind of lymph node problem because we do not know what specialist to see for this condition. This pain under her armpit has been going on for about 3 months and now the doctor my mother is seeing is not returning her phone calls. I do not wish for my mother to drag this on any further because if it is cancerous, she would need to remove it ASAP or find some sort of resolution to this problem. Thank you for your help in advance.\n\n",

Thank you Wafaa Abdel-Hadi for all the help in advance. Can you please explain what does \"bilateral diagnostic mammography\" mean?  (My mother is going through menopause)  What does \"examination reviewed with CAD\" mean?  What does \"large amount of residual fibroglandular tissues with diffuse nodular pattern\" mean?  What does \"there are lymph nodes in both axillae\" mean?  What does \"no evidence of malignancy in the dense breast\" mean?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Henry710,, Thank you for writing us her clinical data  So your mother hasn't seen an oncologist yet!? ...It's really a matter of an oncologist to see her and examine her by him/herself.  The report you have sent us  is very concised, and it doesn't state how big and how many are the Lymph nodes?!  I am afraid that I cannot jugde or even give you advice on such small data. But what I can tell you is that her breast is free...as they've said in the reports.  She needs to see an oncologist to have a look and feel her lymph nodes and to read the Ultrasound report properly.  If the lymph nodes are big enough that concerns him,then he will request a simple procedure called a biopsy to see the cells under the microscope...and determine its nature (benign or malignant.....it might even be inflammatory...let's hope so):-)   about the explanations you want:- 1-\"bliateral diagnostic mammography\" = that's the name of teh procedure...it's like an ultrasound on the breats(mammo) and bilateral means on both breasts. 2-\"examination review by CAD\"...= they have explained it already!=computer aid detection...using computer skills as well in diagnosis. 3-\"large amounts of residual fibroglandular tissue......etc\" that's the normal tissue of the breast...just scientific names,don't worry   4-\"lymph nodes in both axilae\"....i understand that you don't know what a lymph node is... it's some sort of glands in the  body....responsible for clearing the body from its waste products and has a role in immunity as well....they can be enlarged in alot of cases...all peoplle think of cancer these days... but  for an example if u get a flu.. lymph nodes in your neck can get bigger....they are distributed everywhere in your body.  (As i told you ... we have to know how big they are?!how did they look like by ultrasound?!...a doctor should  really examine her  to see if she needs a biopsy or not)  5-\"no evidence of malignancy in the dense breast\"= no evidence of cancer in the breast (good)!  So, relax, it might be nothing...just comfort her and arrange for a meeting with an oncologist...that's all for now... tell me how it goes?  Best wishes,\n\n",

Some studies seem to suggest that Soy is beneficial to women with estrogen-dependant breast cancer, while others say that soy products might promote cancer cell growth.  What is the latest consensus on the subject?  All the women in my Cancer Support Group are utterly confused and frustrated, especially since many of us were told to switch to a more vegetarian (or a \"fish-eterian\") diet, of which tofu is often a major ingredient. Also, does Soy interfere with Tamoxifen?  Thanks in advance!\n\n",

Flaxseed and Soy isoflavones  contains phytoestrogens which is plant estrogen and 100gm of any soy product has the estrogenic content of a contraceptive pill. Research has been done on phytoestrogen in the diet, two glasses of soy milk a day contains enough chemical to change the timing of a woman\u2019s menstrual cycle and increase the experience of volatile emotions of PMS due to the hormonal upset.   Another finding about soy is that it can cause HYPOTHYROIDISM . Two isoflavones found in soy, genistein and daidzen are being found to cause toxicity in estrogen sensitive tissues and in the thyroid and there is also rising concern of the effects on fetuses and young infants.\n\n",

There IS an argument whether soy produces Estrogen or just mimics it, and there absolutely IS an argument whether soy products lead to cancer cell growth, or just purified derivatives do.  The question also had nothing to do with drinking Soy milk, but rather with eating soy products, like tofu and tempe and such,  that are so prevalent in vegetarian cuisine.  I'd like to ask for someone else's opinion if I may, an oncologist, if possible.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain-Lump concern",
    "content": "I have been experiencing pain in my left breast for about a month.  While I wasn't overly concerned at first my concern has increased as I have found a lump.  I do have fibrocysitic breasts and last year had an incident where after my mammogram I was referred to a surgeon for follow up.  He aspirated a rather large cyst then referred me to a breast specialist because I had what they called a 'cluster'.  The specialist had to make an incision as they were unable to do a needle biopsy due to the clusters tissue being so hard.  The biopsy results all came back ok. Note: the cyst I had was not at all painful, I found it doing a self-exam at which time my regular mammogram appointment was moved up so I could get in sooner.  This lump with associated pain I have now feels different and is located much deeper within the breast tissue if that makes sense even though I do not have large breasts.  The pain is pretty sharp, sometimes throbbing and I have a sensation of heaviness in the breast area where the lump is located.  The lump is fairly hard and elongated, painful if I apply any pressure to the end of it.  I am scheduled for my annual mammogram the 21st of April even though I was due for it in November of 2004 this was the first available opening.  As you will see by the requested information I filled out I have a family history of breast cancer and because of that I have been having annual mammograms since I was 25.  I was referred for genetic testing to see if I carry BRCA1 or BRCA2 however Medicare does not cover it so I couldn't have it done.  Due to all the non-covered expenses I incurred from the surgery I had in July 2004 I am already drowning in medical bills that I am desperately trying to get paid off so I am hesitant to call and schedule an appointment with my Dr. as it is now 2005 I will get hit with my yearly deductible right away.  Does this sound like cause for concern where I should contact my Dr. before my mammogram or am I just being paranoid because of my family history?  While the thought on incurring yet more bills that will literally take me years to pay off is horrifying, I don't want to jeopardize my life either.  My apologies if my post is to long winded, I just thought the more information I could provide the better.  Thank you for your time:) Natasha\n\n",

There may indeed be a small risk of developing breast cancer is a woman is taking HRT. However, women who are not or who have not taken HRT or birth control pills can still develop a hormon receptor-positive breast cancer. If a breast cancer is identifies and if it is found to be hormone receptor-positive, then a standard recommendation is for a woman to stop taking the HRT (unless she is enrolled onto a study evaluating if it needs to be stopped or continued even when tamoxifen is used). Part of the treatment for such a breast cancer would be to consider the use of tamoxifen (which blocks the action of estrogen at the level of the breast cancer cell) or arimidex (which blocks the production of estrogen in the body). In such cases, independent or any surgery or chemotherapy, hormone therapy with tamoxifen can provide significant benefit.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi 3flutedpoints, Breast tissue does feel somewhat irregular and \"lumpy\". By doing monthly self breast exams this will enable you to familiarize yourself with the different textures of tissue. Both breast usually have similar tissue textures. An extra area of tissue that you can feel in one breast and not the other would be suspicious of a lump. Sometimes they can be uncomfortable, or painful especially near menstrual cycles, which may  indicate fibrocystic tendencies and are usually benign (not cancerous) in nature. Again, it's encouraged to do monthly self breast exams, the same time each month, about a week after your cycle, so when you recognize breast tissue the feels out of the ordinary you can call your physician for an evaluation. I hope this was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Removing this can draw blood and its extremely painful. after a while it scabes over. The eventually heals.Then the process starts again. Its painful. I have been to the docors several times, each time they have told me to get a hydrocortisone cream. Which i buy and use, it sooths initially, but doesnt stop the problem. Im only allowed 2 use this cream for 7 days. Well, im asking for advice really on this, and what I can do to stop it. Im 19, and not pregnant, so it rules those variations out. I would appreciate any help, Ive tried so many places and just want it to stop, thanks for your time. T\n\n",

    "content": "Hi angelseeingred, Have you had any sort of blow (injury) to the chest that you can think of? The reason I asked this is sometimes an injury can cause areas of fatty tissue to not perform their function and die off. This may generate this particular color of drainage. Generally speaking birth control pills may cause a nipple discharge but it is usually a different color than what you described. Have you noticed any lumps etc.? Any discharge from the nipple should be evaluated, in your case re-evaluated and if it isn't caused by an anomoly in the breast itself, in my opinion, lab work should be done to rule out any hormonal, or endocrine dysfunction. I encourage you to talk with your physician about this again. I hope this was helpful. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

Among others, one of the signs of Inflammatory breast cancer is a pink, red, or dark colored area that may have  the texture of an orange. Since the area in question has not changed over several months and you have no other signs and symptoms that would immediately flag a concern for breast cancer I would be more inclined to consider first a dermatological problem. By all means keep your dermatology appointment and I also encourage you to make an appointment with your gynecologist. I assure you that you will not be laughed at. Concerns such as these warrant evaluation and it's extremely important to identify any possible problems early so they can be treated. Keep calm until your appointment and good luck to you.

If indeed it is a firm swelling that is not inflammatory in nature and if it continues to bother you then you may want to have a surgeon look at it. According to examination he may decide to take a sample from it or to excise it altogether.  You were not very specific about the results of the CT scan.  The itching does suggest an element of inflammation or infection (fungal or otherwise) may be involved. In such a case a dermatologist would also help.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for your helpful comments.  Unfortunately, the CT scan showed nothing - report said no apparent abnormality or involvement of lymph nodes (not even noting a fatty tumor or the like).  However as even the technologist noted that one could see the lump - it's a visible bulge under the arm - the follow up ultrasound was done.  But even the ultrasound detected nothing, which is bizarre since it is so visible.  It is approx. 1 inch, longer than it is wide, and hard, somewhat rubbery in feel.  It does not move; though may be attached to a tendon as it feels that to me.  There is no surface irritation so I don't think it could be an ingrown hair or cyst.  At this point, given that our oncologist locally has said that it's not a lymph node.  I've just opted to watch and wait but its visible nature and the itching worries me.  The only other oddity that I have noticed is that I do have an unusual mole (3 together, one irregular) about 3-4 inches from the site of the lump.  I have thought perhaps that mole should be examined as I am very fair skinned (red hair) and had frequent sun burns in youth (before I knew better than to get in the sun much).\n\n",

I am now presenting with a return of the stromal fibrosis in my right breast, a larger mass that it was in 2002, and a new area of thickening in my L breast.  I have had a bilateral mammogram and an ultrasound, which did show enlarged ducts in my L breast, but other than that, my breasts are so dense, not much could be seen.  I saw my surgeon today and he just wants to follow up in 2 months (he did my other two surgeries).  I am concerned that something might get missed.  Is there any other tests that can better show these areas in my breasts and am I at greater risk of developing a breast cancer or other type of cancer?  Thank you,  Sue\n\n",

    "content": "Sue,  Women with benign hyperplasia of the breast or fibrocystic breast disorders have a slightly higher (20 vs 8 percent) risk for breast cancer depending on other variables particularly a family history of breast cancer .   A women with family history of breast cancer with or without stromal fibrosis or other benign disorders of the breast has an increased risk of developing breast cancer.  You might also consider asking your Dr to refer you for genetics testing and counseling. This entails gathering /evaluating with you a family health history and in particular a history of breast cancer and other malignancies in addition to some blood or tissue testing.  The most commonly monitored genetic markers indicating increased risk of breast cancer are BRCA-1 and BRCA-2.  This is an interesting website related to your concerns  Click here!

    "content": "Hi!  Your doctor was right in stating that risk assessment for breast cancer in women aged less than 35 is not possible by the present tools, and it is of no consequence too, since breast cancer is very rare before this age. The best assessment with your personal data would place you at a 5-year risk of less than 0.7%, which would mean that chances are more than 99.3% that you will NOT be diagnosed with breast cancer in the coming 5 years. A better assessment is possible if your race is known, since some races like caucasians have been known to be at more risk for breast cancer than others.  Hope this helps.  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Rachel Z,  It may be that the best person to answer the question is your surgeon or oncologist.  It is difficult to be very specific to individual cases, but I can try and help, as I understand you are probably going through a very anxious time at present.  Please remember I am being very general here..  1) Breast tumours in the elderly tend to be less aggressive than in the young in general, but carcinomas do progress, unless treated.  Hopefully you will have been monitored frequently since your last tumour diagnosis and therefore your tumour has been caught early enough for treatment.    2) Whether you have had your maximum allowable dose or not can only be determined by your raditherapist, but I would assume that there is still room for further treatment to your Right breast.  3) The treatment options for your latest tumour is not confined just to radiotherapy, and again this ought to be discussed with your specialist.

    "content": "Hello Rhoda, Your daughter's lump would be best assessed by her doctor. An important point to make however, is that your daughter needs to undergo genetic counsuling. As you indeed should have done so as well. You have a very high incidence of breast cancer in your family which could point to a genetic abnormality such as BRCA gene mutations. If such a case were true then your daughters would be at high risk of developing breast cancer later on in their life and various prophylactic measures ranging from close follow up to therapy will then be discussed.   Please discuss this issue with your oncologist.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I was diagnosed with bi-lateral breast cancer in 2001.  Even though my tumors were small; 1.8 and .4 they found another small tumor in my lower spine.  I have completed radiation to the spine and the breasts as well as chemo.  My latest PET scan showed no signs and my blood work is  good.  The tumors never showed up in the mammogram or ultra sounds.  I was also negative nodes and no vascular invasion at either tumor site.  I had discovered the lumps on my own and insisted on a needle aspiration even though the doctors thought they were fine.  I also complained about my back hurting and luckily my radialogist ordered more tests to find the tumor in the spine.    Since the chemo treatments I have been experiencing muscle twitches and severe headaches.  Again, the doctors are baffled.  I was reading a thread posted by a young girl that described her symptoms exactly like the ones I have been having.  The doctors reply was maybe it could be hypocalcemia.  Could I be experiencing hypocalcemia due to all the radiation and chemo treatments?  Thanks for any advise.  Rhoda\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your post to The Doctor's Lounge.  I am limited in responding fully to your question since I do not have the opportunity to see the mammograms.  It would be helpful to have the mammograms compared to prior ones to see if the changes noted represent a new or an old finding.  If the mammogram finding was not identified on the ultrasound, then it may not be a cancerous fidning.  However, this does not remove the possibility of a cancer.  Calcifications can be seen with various malignant and non-malignant breast findings, but some cancers and non-cancerous findings can be present withour calcifications present.  There are two approaches:  obtaining a biopsy now of the reported mammogram area or repeating the mammogram in 6 months and if the findings persist or change, then doing a biopsy then.  Such a decision needs to be done after talking with your Mother's family doctor.  In many cases, it is not unreasonable to wait for a follow-up mammogram.  However, again, such a decision needs to be reached after talking about it fully with the family doctor and understanding the pluses and minuses of either approach.\n\n",

This lump isn't painful, and is located just below the incision.  My question is what could this lump be, and should I be concerned about it.

    "content": "Thanks for your question here at The Doctor's Lounge.  Your question is not specific to a cancer issue, but here are some thoughts.  It is possible that the two issues are related.  There may be some fluid collecting at the surgery site in the armpit and that may be why it appears that the cyst returned.  Many times such fluid resolves without the need to do anything about it.  If the situation worsens, then I would see your doctor for a re-evaluation.    Problems with a breast can affect the armpit, where lymph nodes sit and drain fluid from the breast areas.  If the breast has had a problem for several months, then I would have it evaluated by your doctor.  This problem with the breast could cause an armpit lymph node to swell.  Did your doctor tell you what the finding was regarding what was removed from the armpit?\n\n",

    "content": "I am a male age 18.  About 2 days ago a lump developed on the lower portion of my right nipple.  It is sore, and I think has grown slightly larger in size.  I have tiny little bumps all around both my nipples.  If i squeeze the sore one with the lump a small amount of white fluid is secreted.  The day I noticed the lump was also the day after a hockey game, in which I play goalie.  I may have been hit there with a puck or fallen on my side.  I thought the lump may be gynecomastia but I haven't seen that associated with fluid.  The lump is on the bottom half of my right nipple, it is tender and hurts to be touched, about half an inch long, and secretes a small amount of fluid when squeezed hard enough.  Is it likely to be cancerous?  If not what is it?  Should I see a doctor about it?\n\n",

    "content": "Lumps or cysts in a breast are more likely to be benign as opposed to malignant.  However, any lump in a breast (including in men) should be evaluated.  Men develop breast cancer at a much lower incidence than women, approximately 1 case of male breast cancer for every 100 cases of remale breast cancer.  Again, most findings in a breast are benign.  It is better to have a breast finding evaluated and find out that it is not a cancer than to assume otherwise and miss a cancer if such were to be present.\n\n",

    "content": "Chemotherapy is known to be very toxic. In determining the dose of a particular drug the side effects of the drug are the limiting factor. In most drugs the relationship between the dose of the drug and the side effects is linear. In the case of carboplatin the effect is also dose dependent, but as shown by Egorin and Calvert, the effect is most closely related to the drug exposure in an individual as measured by the area under the curve that plots the carboplatin plasma concentration against time (Area under the curve).   Both groups derived formulas to predict toxicity. In the Calvert formula it takes into account effects of renal toxicity. The glomerular filtration rate is measured directly with labeled EDTA. Chatelut's formula uses creatinine clearance (easier to calculate) which is not as accurate as the Calvert formula but still superior to conventional dosing.   The forumula has been widely individualized. Patients who are elderly or have a poor performance status have a higer risk of toxicity hence some formulas take into account age as well.  To examine the actual formula for the area under the curve see this page.  Click here!  The recommended dosage of carboplatin in previously untreated patients with a normal renal function is 400 mg/m\u00b2. Usually the carboplatin dosage is calculated using the target area under the free carboplatin plasma concentration versus time curve (AUC) and the pre-treatment glomerular filtration rate (GFR):  dose (mg) = target AUC x (GFR + 25)  A target AUC of 5 approximates 400 mg/m\u00b2\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for your question to The Doctor's Lounge.  First: unfortunately, common medical problems can occur in the same person just due to the problems being common and not necessarily related to each other.  Many things found on mammograms turn out not to be cancerous.  I hope that is the case for you!  Second: CLL can sometimes cause lymph node masses to appear.  Although there are lymph nodes in the breast that can be seen on mammogram, I am not aware of any significant relationship between an early stage CLL that is being watched and lymph node problems in the breast.  I am also not aware of any specific increased risk of patients with CLL developing breast cancer.  Breast cancer is more common than CLL.  There may be a relationship between the two of which I am not aware.  Third: breast cancer cells, if present, are not the same cells as the abnormal lymphocytes that make up CLL.  Jeffrey A.

About a week ago I noticed something that seemed to pop up literally during my day, maybe I just never noticed it before.  At the end of my day I was getting changed and I took off my bra.  When I did, I saw a noticeable deformation of my left breast.  I touched it and it was (is) like a long hard line, almost like a hardened blood vessel or something.  One small portion of my nipple is hardened and if I squeeze the breast, the tissue collapses and you can actually see the line of the hard tissue, It literally looks like a river on a map, except the hardened, whatever it is, doesn't pop up on to the top of the skin, it collapses, like a sunken line going across my left breast.  I'm terrified, I don't have insurance and I don't know what to do....I'm really freaking out.  What does this sound like to you? Because it came up so suddenly, I'm thinking it's not cancer, but who the hell knows.....help?  Anyone?\n\n",

I would recommend you contact yourlocal hospital about such a program.  In addition, you should see aphysician for a formal breast examination.  Again, there may be a program in your area to have such an evaluation done for free.  Independent of the insurance issue, I would recommend that you sekk such an evaluation.  It is always best to have a medical evaluation done sooner rather than later in case something of concern is found.  My best to you.  Jeff Gordon, M.D.\n\n",

    "title": "Pain after breast cancer diagnosis",
    "content": "Hello.  I am hoping for some insight as to whether I do or do not have symptoms that related to my past history of breast cancer.  I had a lumpectomy in 8/02 and a resection on 9/02 with 6 weeks of radiation, 5 days per week (3 lymph nodes removed, all negative for cancer - sentinle node biopsy).  I came out of all of that very healthy and very well.  My HER2 results and my receptor results prevented me from being a candidate for any hormone drugs.  So I am not taking anything.  My diagnosis was an agressive form of ductal carcinoma along with dcis in the right breast (.9 mm in size found as microcalcifications on a routine mamogram).  I'm 47 and no one in my family has ever had breast cancer.  However, my grandmother is a 30 year colon cancer survivor and my grandfather died from cancer of the lymph nodes (both my mom's parents).  I am examined every 3 months and have a mamo every 6 months.  During the past 6 weeks I have been having some other problems which I attributed to normal things but because the problems are getting persistently worse, I find myself writing for information and advice here.  At times I feel like my insides are on fire.  Sometimes the pain/burning sensation is directly underneath of my right shoulder blade and penetrates straight thru to the front at the top of my right rib cage.  It does not hurt on my side at all just striaght thru the middle.  The other night after dinner, I had such severe pains in my abdomen and my back that I can only compare it to labor pains.  That, several hours later, went away and left a sore kind of feelin inside my abdomen.  This morning I woke up and my entire back and abdomen felt like it was on fire until I got up and moved around a bit and relieved myself.  Any information as to what this may be would be deeply appreciated.  I do have an appointment scheduled with my primary care physician but am beginning to wonder if it could be related to a metasasis of the breast cancer?  Thank you\n\n",

Even when your surgeon didn't remove all the lymph nodes the approach to axilla sometimes induces this kind of result. In that case you need only an antineuritic, which will be since something so simple as vitamin B12. The abdominal symptoms sound me like spastic colitis. I will suggest you to look your doctor for a prokinetic drug to give you a better movement on your bowel. If is necessary, stool tests will be useful. None of the symptoms are related commonly to metastatic disease. Don't worry about it. Sometimes the start of a symptom induces a stress response like colitis. Regards,  Adolfo Fuentes, MD\n\n",

    "content": "I've had my nipples pierced for almost 2 years.  About 4 months ago my Dr.  noticed a lump I had an ultrasound and was told it was a benign tumor and I could wait 4 months and have it checked again.   I went back to the Dr a couple weeks ago(I think it's gotten bigger) and she told me that the lump could be caused by my nipple ring(blocking off a gland I think).  She said if I took out the nipple ring there was a 50/50 chance that the lump would go away.  The next day I had an appointment with a surgeon and she told me that if I'd had a reaction to the nipple ring it would have happened sooner and I could put the nipple ring back in.  I'm looking for a 3rd opinion.  Can nipple rings cause this kind of lump? The lump is fairly large but not painful and I want to know if I should have surgery or try taking the ring out and wait. Cysts and lumps are pretty common in my family. Also if it could be the nipple ring how long will it take before I'll notice it getting smaller?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  Lumps in the breasts need evaluation, if or not they arose after piercing the nipple. There has been incidences where partial removal of breast has had to be done for what began as an infection which went on to become breast abscess. This mandates a thorough investigation to be on the safer side, where most people who have had their body parts pierced live a normal life. I suggest you find the definitive diagnosis of the lump by means of cytology or biopsy, which your surgeon would probably explain in detail.  The risks in nipple piercing are obviously under-documented and may be as high as 10-20% in the months after the procedure. Healing of the wound channel can take 6-12 months.  Nipple piercing has grown in popularity within the last years and is in general not a stigma of a subculture or lower social classes any more. However, the risk for breast infection is on the one hand underestimated by the women and on the other hand played down by piercing studios. Breast infection after nipple piercing is rarely documented in scientific literature and data bases. Only seven case reports are scientifically published so far.   Insufficient understanding as well as inconsequent performance of hygienic preparation of the wound beneath other risk factors like nicotine abuse, wrong size of jewelry, post breast enlargement with prosthesis etc. increase the risk of breast infection after nipple piercing. Last year, doctors in Germany published regarding the obvious underestimated health problems of this fashion phenomenon. Their study constituted the largest series of breast infection after nipple piercing in the world.  An observer of today's fashion for facial piercings might think that only the young and extrovert or those interested in extreme sexual behaviour get pierced.   A survey of 134 pierced readers of Body Art magazine revealed that 79% were aged 29 or over and 58% were married or in a long-term relationship. Less than 20% saw themselves as masochistic, sadistic, fetishist, exhibitionists, or narcissistic, and little more than half thought themselves adventurous.  Even its most enthusiastic devotees find piercing's appeal difficult to explain, but that's just as true of pot holing, golf, crosswords, and train spotting. I know I have gone laterally over the topic at hand, but I hope it helps to confront some of the assumptions we might have.  Hope this helps  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi!  I thought I might as well rob some of the praises for dr Tamer Fouad !  Nipple discharge is most commonly associated with hormonal (endocrine) alterations and/or medications, when changes are often bilateral.  The most common cause of clinically significant discharge is growth within the tubes coming out of the milk glands (intraductal growth), due to benign overgrowth of cells within the milk glands (hyperplasia), proliferation of projections from the cells lining the tubes (micropapillary proliferation), benign growths (solitary papillomas), and/or cancer (ductal carcinoma).  Most patients have surgically reversible, nonsignificant nipple discharge.  Non\u2013clinically significant nipple discharge more commonly occurs in women using contraceptives. Non\u2013clinically significant nipple discharge also occurs in women who are taking medications that have estrogen-like effects on the breast epithelium.  The most common types of nipple discharge are bilateral, emanate from several ducts in the same nipple, and vary in color from white to brown. To be clinically significant, nipple discharge must be true, spontaneous, persistent, and nonlactational. Surgically significant discharge is clear (ie, watery), serous (ie, clear yellow), serosanguineous, or sanguineous (ie, bloody).   The likelihood of malignancy increases when the discharge is unilateral and arises from a single duct, when it is accompanied by a palpable mass, when it is associated with a positive mammographic or galactographic finding and a positive cytologic result (examination of cells under the microscope), or when the patient is older than 50 years.   Mammography is the evaluation of the breast by means of X-rays. Galactography or ductography is mammography after a dye is injected into the breasts.  Clinically significant nipple discharge is most commonly secondary to intraductal growths, ranging from hyperplasias (benign cell overgrowths) to malignancies. Researchers have reported that when clinical, cytologic, and breast imaging findings show no evidence of malignancy, nipple discharge spontaneously resolves in as many as 73% of patients within 5 years.   Mammography, although typically unrevealing, is the first examination that should be performed in a patient with clinically significant nipple discharge.  Subsequent to negative mammographic findings, galactography or ductography is the procedure of choice. Galactography involves the retrograde injection of water-soluble radiopaque contrast material into a discharging duct with subsequent mammographic imaging.  Galactography is not indicated unless the nipple discharge is spontaneous, unilateral, and expressed from a single pore.  I suggest it best for your wife to visit the surgeon. And there is no substitute for direct clinical examination.  I hope this helps.  Warm regards,  - Bill\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I am a 24 year old, healthy woman.  I have a 5 year old daughter, she was breastfed.  I started my period when I was 11 years old.  I took birth control pills for about three years, the depo shot for 6 months.  I have had 3 tumors removed from my breasts, 2L, 1R.  I have another one in the L breast.  I have seen my surgeon and I will have a mammogram, u/s, and fna later this week.  I will also see an oncologist in June for a 2nd opinion.  I have been diagnosed with stromal fibrosis.  Is it a great risk to leave it there?  Can this turn into cancer?  If I decide not to have surgery, what are my other options?  My great grandmother on my dad's side is my family history.  I don't drink a lot of caffeine and I eat healthy.  What can cause this?  Hormones?  Is this common?  Why do I get so many..they do not go away on their own, the one I have now has been there over 2 months.  They've been 3-5 cm each when removed...is that big?  I hate surgery...I miss work and I have to watch my husband cook, clean, and take care of our daughter....he's not bad at it, I just like to do everything on my own.  Please help.  Thank you for your quick response. :)\n\n",

    "content": "KC and Tony,  Could you provide me with more information about your prior breast surgeries?  Were formal breast cancers found in the breats or were non-malignant breast cancer changes identified?  Having such information would be very helpful in better understanding the overall picture of your current breast findings.  Stromal fibrosis or other terminology to describe various characterisitics of non-malignant breast findings is not in and of itself a precancerous lesion and does not in and of itself turn into a cancer.  There are several breast tissue changes that are not formal breast cancers, but do increase the risk of a woman developing a breast cancer compared to a woman without such findings in the breast.  These changes include atypical ductal hyperplasia, ductal carcinoma in situ, and lobular carcinoma in situ.  Did any of your prior breast surgeries identify these features?  I do understand your concern about undergoing another breast surgery.  It can be difficult on breast examination or standard mammogram to identify what is a cancer and what is not.  That is why biopsies or surgeries are done, even though sometimes no cancer is found.  However, if any of the above mentioned non-malignant breast abnormalities are found, then there may be the potential for using Tamoxifen to decrease the risk of a true breast cancer developing.  I would recommend undergoing an ultrasound and a fine needle aspiration or needle biopsy.  Based upon those results, then further Medical Oncology evaluation would be in order.  If no cancer is identified, then one may consider a digital mammogram for better resolution or an MRI of the breast.\n\n",

It sounds like, based upon what you post, that the prior breast findings were not malignant.  Fibrocystic disease does not in and of itself become cancer.  It is a common finding and can make the reading of a mammogram difficult because it can look like a cancer.  Thus why biopsies and surgeries are done, but I understand yoru concern about undergoing another surgery.  One may consider a different way to image the breast, such as MRI.\n\n",

    "content": "In November of 2002, I was diagnosed with a grade 2 stage 3 (advanced carcinoma) in my left breast.  In December, I underwent a radical mastectomy and had my left breast completely lobbed off.  In January of this year, I started a CT-11 course of aggressive chemotherapy and localized radiation to kill the matastice to my lymph.  My tumor is HR neg. which in simple terms means it is not hormone produced, but cell produced.   I have a 75% chance of reoccurance and matasticise to other organs.  My doctor are also not sure if they were able to get all the cancer.  Also as a result fo the fact I have been diagnosed so young in life, my doctors have asked me to make sure I notify all family members, as cancer is a genetic thing.[/i]\"   :arrow: You just read portions of an email I recently received  from my sister. :cry:   I don't understand all her wording, as I have been unable to locate very little of this anywhere on the web..  What I have come up with,  :idea: is that if I am not mistaken, the \"grade 2 stage 3\" would also be known as Stage IIIB Breast Cancer.  Is this correct?  And what does the fact that \"it is not hormone produced, it is cell produced\" mean?  Does that mean it can hit any living cell in the body? Although cancer run very strong on both sides of our family, there is no other breast cancer, does this matter if it is cell produced?  My sister is only 31, and if I am not mistaken, had a hysterectomy due to cervical cancer at the age of 24.  I am 28 and scared senseless.  Mostly because I don't know what all this means and what, if anything, I should be expecting. :roll:   Please help.  Feel free to post a response or email me directly.  I would appreciate ANY help you can give?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dolphindancer, When a normal cell turns malignant it loses many of the characteristics of its normal coutnerpart. Grade 2 to 3 refers to the degree by which the cell has lost any resemblance to a normal breast cell. Grade 3 being the worst. So your sister would be in the middle range there. Staging of breast cancer is another thing altogether that describes the extent to which a cancer has spread in the body. Stage I: it hasnt spread. Stage IV: It has spread to distant organs.  I truely cannot tell the stage of your sisters disease from the information you have given but she has lymph node involvement which means she would be either stage II/III. Breast cancer cells were found to be two types those that responde to anti-hormonal treatment (which is a convenient and effective type of treatment) and those that do not repsond to this type of treatment (i.e. are left with only chemotherapy as their only alternative). One major setback is the age of your sister, with younger age being a bad sign. Its also an indication of a possible genetic basis for the disease. Can you confirm that she actually had a cervical cancer or was it an ovarian cancer? Was she put on proper follow up since her first cancer? Your sister has certainly painted a very dismal picture. I wouldnt say that I am excited either about her results, but what i want to say is that every patient is a different story and that in real life many people are actually better off than what the statistical numbers tell us. Did she actually confirm the genetic basis of her disease?  You can have her consult with us if she needs any questions. Best regards, Dr. Tamer Fouad, M.D.\n\n",

Then she started having stiff neck and jaw and noticed little rock hard lumps in her jaw just below her ears. she was admitted to the hospital and was given a spinal tap which was neg. a ct of the head abdomen,chest and jaw, all neg. so much bloodwork that she now may need a transfusion. her fever has been up to 105 with ice packs all over her body. chills so bad that every muscle in her body hurts.They have also done some kind of a scope test to look at her heart because she has congenital heart disease and that was neg.they took a total of 7 biopsies from her jaw which were all neg, tested for west nile, mono,dengue fever and who knows what else. all neg. Now they are saying possibly mumps. test has not yet come back. This woman is so ill she thinks her fever is going to kill her.iF HER CANCER HAD SPREAD, WOULD IT BE CAUSING A VERY HIGH FEVER. Can mumps make a person this sick for so long, she has now been sick for about 6 weeks. the fever will just not go away. Are there any other tests that anyone can think of that may have been overlooked. Could this be cancer that has spread would it cause this very high fever. ANY HELP WOULD BE GREATLY APPRECIATED.

Unfortunately, the epidemiology of cancer is very complicated and it is difficult to make an exact cause and effect statement about foods and dietary supplements and the development of cancer.  Regading the prevention or modification of cancer risks by using certain dietary supplements, there are active clinical research trials ongoing trying to answer this question in various cancers.
