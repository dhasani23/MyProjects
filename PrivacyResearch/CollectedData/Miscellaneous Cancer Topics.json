    "title": "How could HPV & Herpes affect a cancer patient?",
    "content": "I was diagnosed with HPV in 1996.  The type of HPV that i have is the kind that manifests on the cervix.  I developed cervical cancer.  I had a Leep proceedure, and many follow up paps, and was declared in remission.  I married 9 years ago, and my husband & I decided to share everything, including my HPV.  Now, 9 years later, I caught him cheating with the wife of another man.  The other man is dying of cancer (I'm not sure which kind).  Since discovering my husband with her, I went to the doctor and found out that I now have herpes.  I'm told that HPV is essentially herpes, but have been given no clear info on the relationship between the two.  I had developed sores in my mouth after my last coupling with my husband.  Now, as a result of his actions, myself, my husband, his harlot, and her poor dying husband all have the same two STD's.  I am VERY VERY concerned about how these two STD's will affect a cancer patient.  To make matters worse, I KNOW that this man does not even know about his wife's cheating, or his new diseases.  Is there any way you can give me any info on this without knowing the type of cancer the guy has??  I have no way to find out his medical info. to give you any more info than I already have.  This man has a right to know what has been done to him.  And I desperatley want to know how this will affect his health.  Any info that you can give me on this subject I will be forwarding to the poor guy so that he can take it to his doctor to do whatever he needs to do.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,First HPV and HSV are different.And both have sexual as well as non sexual transmissions.Herpes simplex type1 which has an oral predilection occurs mostly non sexual and by 15 years of age most population acquires it.Type 2 affecting genitalia is spread sexually but all would not manifest the disease. HPV or the wart virus has many subtypes and the nonsexual forms may range from plane warts to some skin conditions like epidermoplasia verruciformis.The sexual forms cause genital warts,and  cervix  types leading to malignancy in some. As to whether one has already harbored the infection or newly acquired it would be difficult to establish. Immunity to different conditions are based on general and specific factors.A person may have malignancy but if he has immunity against a specific organism or multiple organisms he would resist it. Best wishes.\n\n",

The chances of contracting lung cancer maybe possible through passive smoking and has been described. Maybe this is the only way you can spread Lung cancer letting others smoke your cigarettes, by inhaling the smoke.Of course you can not spread it like tuberculosis from person to person.

    "content": "Hi TDM and others,  The answer to your question is a simple \"NO\". There is no known, widely available, 100% reliable, test to detect cancer anywhere in the body.  In the human body(even in health), microscopic areas (at the level of one or a few cells)of mutation and malignant change is believed to take place. Not all of them get 'established' to go on to become clinical malignancies.The cells which thus mutate, may get destroyed by a number of ways including, - death due to apoptosis (programmed cell death), - destruction by body defenses (cellular,antibody mediated), - by out-growing their blood supply, - unfavourable cell/matrix environment,or - by being simply shed off (in areas such as the intestinal mucosa for example where the mucosal cell turnover is very rapid, or in the lungs, where they may get coughed out) etc.  Moreover, no test (including the much discussed PET), is 100% reliable in detecting as well as excluding a malignancy.  Specifically, the sensitivity of PET ranged from 84 - 87%, the specificity ranged from 88% - 93%, and the accuracy ranged from 87 - 90% in some studies. ( http://www.ncpic.info/zportal/portals/p ... /spec_sens).  Sensitivity and specificity values depend upon the 'false positives' and 'false negatives'.  The aforesaid values are for known or suspected 'lesions'.  Imagine someone who has no known or suspected lesions, undergoing a very expensive test (especially coupled with the knowledge that small microscopic 'tumors' may be 'normally' exist and with inherent false positive and negative rates), may in all probability end up with a permanent 'cancer phobia' - a psychological wreck.  The answer to your question once again is a simple \"NO\". Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello leedeenich,  It's reasonable to fear cancer when there are abnormal symptoms, but often our fears are our worst enemy, and it turns out to be something else entirely.  It is extremely important that you see your doctor as soon as possible, if you haven't seen him/her already.  Your doctor can assess the problem and refer you to the appropriate specialist, or for the appropriate tests to determine exactly what is going on.  It's not impossible that someone might retain endometrial tissue after a hysterectomy, if there had been profuse growth prior to the hysterectomy, which may cause similar problems.  The best resolution of any diagnosis will come with prompt evaluation and treatment, and I urge you to see your doctor right away.  Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Looking for some advice on this. I recently went to the doctor for a physical (2 weeks ago), and since I had not had one in years, the physician gave me a tetanus shot. Since that made my left shoulder sore for a few days, I found myself rubbing my shoulder a few days later while I was driving. When I was rubbing near my left collarbone, I felt a strangle lump, seems hard like a marble, and it seems to move quite a bit, on to either side of my collarbone. I called the doctor back, to make sure this was not some side effect of the shot, and she had me come in today. She said after briefly looking that it may just be a cyst, and to keep an eye on it. She did ask me if I had experianced fever, fatigue, or night sweats. I have had night sweats for quite some time, but have always passed that off as hormonal changes throuought the month, since it's not constant, but they are drenching night sweats when I get them. As far as fatigue, I kinda feel tired most all of the time, but I blame that on my days being hectic and stressful. I am wondering if I should have more concern about this, or just ignore it, like my doctor suggested, unless something changes.  I am not one to worry, but I would hate to think I let something pass that could be a bigger issue later if not caught early.   Any feedback is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The tetanus injection you received - was it a routine booster or was it for some injury?  The swelling which you have described sounds very peculiar to me. If it is indeed a lymph node,it neither fits in with the description of a supra-clavicular lymph node (located above the clavicle) nor an infra-clavicular lymph node (located below the clavicle).Also, it is not a common site for a sebaceous cyst. It is very unlikely to be related to the tetanus injection as well.  In situations like this, one line of management would be to try a course of antibiotics and see the response. Failure to respond usually leads to some form of biopsy. Your doctor is the best person to decide on the way forward.  Best wishes!\n\n",

Anyhow, do all doctors know about these cures? Do they only prescribe chemo and surgery to their patients to make money from big pharma,  but they use the already proven cancer cure methods for themselves and their family?

Also different cancers have different causes ranging from viruses,chemicals,genes and occupation based tumours. To identify a single solution to a multifactorial disease would be indeed very difficult. If you read the obituaries in medical journals you would find many doctors have died of different cancers. If they knew there was any easy solution,I guess they would have taken it. While fresh air,good food and a stress free life do help in normal as well as the sick they would offer better quality of living rather than of cure. Till better understanding dawns on the pathogenisis of cancers we have to depend on existing modalities of treatment. Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Risk of cancer with occasional cigars",
    "content": "Hi, - Cigarette smoking is related to many types of cancer.  - Ill effects are related to how much a person smokes(called as 'pack years).One way of calculating pack years is as follows. Number of pack years = (number of cigarettes smoked per day x number of years smoked)/20 (1 pack has 20 cigarettes).  - Cigarette smoking + alcohol further increases the risk- esp, for cancers of the aero-digestive tract.  Cigarette smoke contains many (may be as many as 250) chemicals of which roughly 20% are considered carcinogenic. Some of these are from the tobacco ad others from the paper.   A cigar has been defined, as \"any roll of tobacco wrapped in leaf tobacco or in any substance containing tobacco,\" while a cigarette is \"any roll of tobacco wrapped in paper or any substance not containing tobacco\". Unlike most cigarettes, larger cigars do not usually have a filter. Smaller ones may have a filter.   Large cigars(cigarillos) may contain more than a half an ounce of tobacco. This is as much tobacco as a whole pack of cigarettes. It can take from 1 to 2 hours to smoke a large cigar.  Most cigarettes contain an average of approximately (8 mg) of nicotine, but only deliver about 1 - 2 mg of nicotine to the smoker. Many popular cigar brands  contain 100 - 200 mg, or even nearly as much as 450 mg of nicotine.   The amount of nicotine a cigar delivers to a smoker can vary a lot based on.... - the brand, - the size, - number of puffs, - inhaled or otherwise & - how deeply?  All these variables complicate the calculation of 'Pack years' in relation to cigar smoking.  Thus, cigars deliver the same nicotine as the cigarettes and therefore, are harmful.  Ofcourse one is exposed to certain amount of 'background' radiation and other carcinogens (some of which are for practical reasons unavoidable).Smoking is knowingly/voluntarily exposing oneself to carcinogens.

    "content": "This is an interesting question that I am always presented with. First and foremost, it is understood that cigars are not inhaled like a traditional cigarette, but that doesn\u2019t make a cigar a healthier alternative.   Cigars, no matter which brand or filter type or lack there of contain very toxic carcinogenictic chemicals that are very harmful to the person smoking the cigar, or to the non smoker who happens to be in the same facility.  I want to add to this list the smoking of \u201chooka, or water bongs\u201d that have started to become more popular especially within the college crowd. There are tons of misconceptions about this new past time. Many people decide to quit smoking and take up the smoking of hooka as an alternative. This is a very bad practice and does not differ in severity. Hooka or water pipes cause a whole series of other sicknesses plus the traditional sicknesses and side effects of your traditional cigarette or cigar.  All tobacco products infact expose the lips along with every component of your mouth, larynx and esophagus to toxic chemicals which increases your chances of developing cancer. The more you smoke, the more your chances of developing a cancer related complication will elevate.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Incidence of venous thrombosis developing in pregnant females in general is 0.5-3/1000 pregnancies.Incidence 5 -10 fold higher after Cesarean section compared to vaginal delivery.The incidence of DVT is about 5 times higher in pregnancy than in age matched non-pregnant females  Incidence of thrombosis developing in pregnant females with Protein S deficiency is approximately - 0-6% antepartum & 7-22% postpartum. 'Progesterone-only' oral contraceptives are at times advocated for women with thrombophilias as they tend to carry a lower risk than estrogen containing compounds.What are the relative levels of estrogen and progesterone in your body during this delayed cycle is hard to predict.  As pregnancy has been ruled out in your case, the risk may be expected to be about the same as for individuals with Protein S deficiency who are not pregnant & not on oral contraceptives.  But, you ought to consult your doctor to find the cause for the delayed menses. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Before answering, please read till the end, as it is long :)  I am looking for a rather specific information about \"RESAN\" vaccine. Now, I know that it is not certified, and I know that it is questionable, according to experts. This is NOT what I am looking for. See, according to claims by people offering it (and I have reasons to believe this part of their claims), around 3,000 people have already been vaccinated. Being an expert in online technologies - this is my profession - I thought, well, all I need to do is to find some of these 3,000 and ask. This way I will get the first hand info, avoiding both replies from people who sell it, and people who criticize it based on it being sort of an \"alternative\". I failed, to my surprise. I was not able to find anyone, who would say \"I was treated with it, here are results and here are side effects\". None, which is very strange in the age of Internet blogs. Now, I don't believe they are all dead, neither I believe they signed a non-nondisclosure agreement.  My question, therefore, is: could you please tell, if you met these people? As doctors, you probably should... I am not looking for personal contacts, of course - just for info on vaccine effect, both on cancer (does it work) and on patient (side effects).  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "My daughter is 16 years old.  She weighed around 155 about 6+ months ago and now weighs 116.  There is no explanation of it- her thyroid functions came back normal, no diabetes, nothing with her liver panels or any other blood work ran on her.  She has had a lump in her lower back, that can't be seen, but can be felt.  That one is around 3cm I think and has grown little over that past 2 months.  Now her pediatrician found another on the other side of her lower back (not on spine).  She is scheduled with a pediatric surgeon to remove them and explore next week.  I am startled with all of this, because my oldest daughter died 3 years ago at the age of 17 with juvenile ovarian cancer (juvenile granulosa cell tumor cancer).  I am worried sick!!! (I had cervical/uterine cancer 9 years ago also) My daughter does not have the same symptoms of my daughter that died at all.  But the lumps and the weight loss has me terrified!  The surgeon would not even guess what the lumps are- he said we have to wait for pathology to come back after the surgery.  My question is this-- is there a pediatric cancer that would not show on blood work (her rbc,wbc's,platelets were normal, the only elevated one was her MPV at 10.5.)  The weight loss is steady and ongoing- losing 1-3 lbs. a week.  I have spent countless hours trying to research, but not getting too far.  Any \"heads up\" or possible things I can research may help ease my mind for the time being until we find out after surgery.\n\n",

You have not mentioned some of the characteristics of the lumps(consistency,plane of the lumps and the like).  Your doctor perhaps is proceeding with a working diagnosis of a 'soft tissue tumor' (as most of us perhaps would).  These are a wide variety of tumors whose pathogenesis (cell of origin) is not fully understood.They could behave in a relatively benign or malignant fashion(sarcomas).They are generally named according to their histological appearance.  If a soft tissue tumor is suspected, it is better biopsied. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Normally one's diet should include all the major nutrients (carbohydrates, proteins,fats and water). One can't live a healthy life on protein and fats alone(without carbohydrates) - although gluconeogenesis can occur via fat, accelerated body protein breakdown does happen(as fats do not have a marked protein-sparing effect that  carbohydrates possess). Only the Inuits(known in the past as Eskimos) perhaps had adapted to a  carbohydrate- free diet over many centuries of evolution.  Therefore, living on only peanut butter,in all likelihood, may be detrimental to health. Possibility of muscle wasting is real. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I feel silly posting this in the cancer section, but I don't really know which system category my symptoms fall under!  I will try to keep it brief.  2 months ago I noticed the above described lump, in my left breast crease...it feels like it's attached to a rib.  It's about 2 inches away from the rib/sternum junction.  I decided to just keep an eye on it until my annual physical which was last week....it had grown a little in the meantime.  The skin is not discolored, it's completely painless, I do have a little discharge from my left nipple (clear and milky) and it doesn't seem sinister.  My breasts have always been lumpy and painful, so it really takes something for me to notice any kind of change....I admit that I do not perform BSE's, because of all of the lumps, so I don't know how long this nodule has been there.  My PCP has no idea what it could be, so she sent me for a rib series right away.  Had the xrays, placed the little sticker where the lump is, and the results said that there was nothing of bony origin going on and to procede with an ultrasound if desired.  So my doctor set me up for an ultrasound of the lump.  Had it today, the radiologist came in and looked at the screen for awhile, and said that it looked like a bone spur.  Weird, because I've never had any trauma to this area or any pain surrounding it, but you never know.  Something just doesn't fit....wouldn't it have showed up on the xray then?  She said she would just advise my doctor to keep an eye on it.  I looked at the screen when the tech went to get the radiologist, I just saw a small dark circle.  I'm an RN, but not knowledgabse about imaging studies, or lumps and bumps.  I guess my question is....have you seen this before?  I'm thinking I would just like to have it excised and biopsied so I don't have to worry about it anymore...however, I'm such a wuss when it comes to being assertive with my own health.  If you were the M.D. in this case, how would you procede?  Sorry this is so long.  Thanks so much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I was intially diagnosed with metastatic papillary thyroid carcinoma in 1985.  I was treated and considered free of disease until 2008 where more disease was discovered in and removed from my neck.  Unfortunately, though I have also had a third dose of radioactive iodine, my thyroglobulin levels are still elevated.  I have recently had a CT scan where a small mass showed up on my right kidney.  Two radiologists have read the CT scan.  One called it an \"indeterminate mass\" and the other said it was angiomyolipoma.  I know that angiomyolipoma is a benign tumor, but with my history, I don't know if I'll be completely convinced that this is what it actually is until a biopsy is done.  My questions are as follows:  1.  Is there any correlation between thyroid cancer and kidney cancer?  I've found some sources on the internet that say that there is, but I don't know how reliable these are.   2.  Is it possible that RCC can be mistaken for an angiomyolipoma on a CT scan?  3.  I know that thyroid cancer metastasizing to the kidney is extremely rare, but is it also possible that a thyroid cancer met could be mistaken for an angiomyolipoma?  Thank you so much for your time.  Any information you could give me would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

This lesion occurs primarily in middle-aged and elderly men, and is thought to be a result of solar damage to the skin. 3) pre auricular cysts - which sometimes get infected.  The swelling on your lower jaw could be an enlarged facial lymph node which may be a result of infection in one of the swellings i have sited or due to some infection in the oral cavity.  However, discuss with your GP or an ENT specialist and take the right decision.Cheers!\n\n",

It is where submental nodes are. It is pea-sized, very hard and does not move. It doesn't hurt at all. I was wondering what it may be. I have had viral infection and it is close to my period.

    "title": "Re: swollen submental node",
    "content": "Hi there -  The location of the submental nodes make the area a problem in terms of this  sort of complaint, which is usually either a pimple coming up from underneath, or often just a blocked or inflamed lymph node. Since it's hard to the touch, and small, it could be either. The submental nodes frequently wind up doing a lot of work fighting infections both in the layers of the local skin and the lower front teeth also. This can sometimes (if a pimple) be related to the menstrual cycle, but it's very unlikely indicative of cancer. For one thing, this is an extremely unusual location for an isolated lymph node cancer. It's also a very common area for both deep pimple formation and inflamed, sometimes blocked glands.   Watch this spot for a while. It may blossom into a pimple or become more swollen and a little red, then subside. Use of the two creams you have currently can't hurt and may help. If the bump remains as it is, it might be due to something going on with a tooth or some other oral irritation or infection, so if it doesn't resolve within a week or so, you might want to bring it to the attention of a doctor, but I wouldn't rush. Cancer is pretty far down on the list of possibilities, and in the case of the lymph system you'd liklely be noticing larger abnormal nodes under the jaw  and especially in one or both armpits.   Again, keep an eye on this, but try to avoid touching the area too much, except to apply the creams. I suspect it will slowly disappear in a week or so.  Good luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks a lot for the reply. Actually I went to see a doctor two weeks ago. He told me it was my lymph node and said it could be because i had a cold. He asked me to wait for couple of weeks. If it is not better he will send me to do blood test and ultrasound. I have been waiting for two weeks, no change... It is completely painless, the same size as two weeks ago. I am really worried...\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, The oral cavity is full of microorganisms and prone to minor infections and tauma.Therefore, elargement of the submental and submandibular lymph nodes is fairly common.These nodes at times tend to persist for pronged periods of time(after initially reducing in size with treatment). Therefore, isolated enlargement of these nodes is not always an ominous sign- but,if they continue to enlarge or if there is a change in consistency(nodes becoming harder), one should certainly investigate.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 26 year old male and in good health.  About two months ago I noticed a small lump under my ear and slightly behind my jaw.  It had grown over the month to become somewhat large.  I saw a Dr. on the matter and he said it was probably a lymph node and a round of antibiotics would help.  I took them but nothing really went down.  He said to give it about 6 weeks, which has come and gone now (this being week 7).  It is probably the same size or at least slightly smaller.  It isn't fixed in place and I can move it back and forth slightly.  There is a good deal of pain after touching it, but otherwise it gives me no trouble except for a random pain here and there.  Any help is appreciated!  Should I get a second opinion??\n\n",

    "content": "Just an update on what I posted about awhile back.  The lymph node in question never went back down in size, and is still seemingly fluctuating slightly from larger to smaller  on occasion.  I have also developed a stiffness of sorts in my jaw, my vision is slightly blurred even after corrective eyewear, and I find myself having trouble focusing.  My ears also have the feeling you experience when they need to pop, yet I am unable to get them to do so for two months now.  I saw a doctor last summer and bloodwork was done that came back completely normal.  A scan was done that showed I have multiple enlarged nodes, none of which are apparently even close to a size that would call for concern or the need to biopsy.  Still experiencing the random pains, though they are not that often.  I do seem to experience very random and brief pains all over my neck on occasion.    Should I worry that it still hasn't gone down, or is the fact that after 2 years it is still relatively the same size something that is in my favor.  I am a worrier, so I tend to of course worry.  Any help is appreciated.\n\n",

I have also been losing weight despite eating more than enough and been having IBS symptoms.

    "content": "I have had a lump under my left arm for about 2.5 months. I have been to the doctor, and went for ultrasound and chest x-ray. The doc says I have 4 swollen nodes under my left arm. I have just completed blood tests, and am waiting on results, after which the doc plans a CT scan.   I am mostly curious what the most common causes for this might be, given my specific symptoms (swollen group of nodes in 1 spot underarm, firm and quite large, mildly painful, and persisting for >2 months now) . I live in Canada and use a clinic doc, which is fine, however they are always rushed and while I feel that he is taking all the appropriate steps, the communication and level of interaction is very low. He has been very tight lipped about potential/likely causes etc.   The swollen nodes have not decreased in size, they are more or less constantly painful (dull, aching/itching kind of sensation), which has caused me some difficulty sleeping. I have no other swollen nodes that I can detect.   I had a really crummy winter with at least 3 colds, 1 flu type bug, and another cold this summer. I am not aware of any injury or infection that could have caused this.  Any insight in to this problem would be appreciated.\n\n",

Given your smoking history as well as the pathology result, lung cancer would definitely be on top of the list. If nothing else is found then the condition can be treated as lung cancer.   Unfortunately, if this were the case then the presence of malignant effusion in the setting of a lung cancer can only be treated with chemotherapy and precludes local treatment.   There are many options for the treatment of lung cancer, with milder forms of therapy (eg, monochemotherapy with a weekly single agent) for patients unable or unwilling to go ahead with more intensive treatment.   The advantages of treatment in this setting is disease control as well as a median survival benefit when compared to best supportive care.  Please let us know if you have further questions.\n\n",

I want everyone to forget the negative claims the government has made regarding Marijuana.   There have been scientific and medical studies that show Medicinal Cannabis treats a wide variety of diseases and sicknesses. What's everyone's serious medical opinion regarding Medicinal Cannabis? Is the natural herb a reliable source of medicine to treat diseases? Or is it the menace to society the government claims? Is it worse than alcohol, tobacco, cocoaine, crack, heroin or esctasy such as the government claims?  I am a pro-Marijuana activist that is associated with the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, or NORML. i believe it is time for the American Government and DEA and stop with this sharade that has been going on since the 1930's and for the first time legalize Marijuana for Medical use, as well as recreational use. It is time to stop making criminals out of peaceful, law abiding people that pay their taxes. It is time to stop making criminals out of people that are seriously ill and their only means of medicine is Cannabis.   The use of the criminal law does more harm to an individual than the drug itself.  Stop arresting responsible Marijuana smokers.

    "content": "Here is something that you can do while I pondered over that intelligent statement you made at the end your letter (Ha,come on) if you don't like to smoke it  then eat it. b8251213  BED BUTTER  Melt a pound of butter in a pan. Mix 60-70 (or more grams of thoroughly sifted pot in it. Let it boil carefully a couple of minutes until the butter has gotten a green color from the grass. Then squeeze the butter through a fine strainer. While you use the strain, keep the leaves away in a corner of the pan by using a spoon. Squeeze hard to get out as much of the butter as possible   [The cooking time has varied from \"a couple of minutes,\" as above, to 10-15 minutes from other baked epicurean masters. 10 minutes works fine for my \"friends.\"]   To warm up the pan a little will make the butter flow easier. Also strain the butter that is gathered in the deeper parts of the pan. If you don't want any remaining leaves in the butter, you can strain it through some muslin. A problem concerning this is that you will loose some butter in the muslin. Don't throw the leaves, they still may* contain viable THC. The leaves can be cooked in milk or vodka and become a tasty and effective drink. Hot milk or vodka might also be poured through the muslin, thereby saving some of the hashish butter. You can fry more leaves in the same butter in you want to increase its strength.   [General \"word on the street\" is that the bud left over after the extraction is worthless and should be thrown away... I left the comment in the recipe because boiling the used pot in milk really* does taste good. I have not experienced consuming the beverage at what might be called a \"baseline,\" so I do not know if it has psychoactive qualities. Film at 11.]   A simpler and stronger version of the cannabis butter (or ghee)... by mixing melted butter with hashish or hashish oil instead of pot. It is not necessary to fry this as long as in the case with the pot. Just warm it up and mix it until the hashish or hashish oil is dissolved in the butter. You can put as much hashish (or hashish oil) into it as you want. Another plus is that there are no remaining leaves with THC to worry about.   [Ahh... to have pounds and pounds of hash lying around just waiting to be used to cook a nice breakfast. Not.]\n\n",

    "content": "I have had some negative experience with marijuana. I smoked it every day for several years and eventually i started getting bad chest pains and palpurtations(sp).  I researched it on Google and i found that not only does it cause heart problems but it can cause chronic pneumonia and bronchitis. Since i quit the pains have gone, even altho i still smoke cigarettes.  So its obviously cannabis that caused the problems.  I also had one other side effect which was strange facial muscle twinges and my smile went crooked. In other words, a mental illness. I also took anti-depressents so it was possibly a reaction of both drugs. But it has also died down since i quit using cannabis. And lastly i suffered from serious depression which i think the cannabis contributed to.  So all in all i would say its bad stuff and should be avoided. Long term use can cause problems. Short term occasional use is probably ok but i found it hard to only use it occasionally and wanted it more and more and eventually had some every day. A few years later i started getting problems.\n\n",

Then I re-found it and got scared. It is very hard. Just above my neck muscle where my neck meets the bottom of my head. It covers have of the top right side of my neck and moved into the middle of my neck over the spinal cord. There is no pain or anything.   I also want to point out that I have 3 or 4 lymph nodes sticking out on the right side of my neck as well. This has been like that for about a year. In this area all around my neck there is pain. Sometime shooting pain, sometime pressure. The pain also rides around to the front of my neck and around to my throught. I have had a swollen gland for about a year there as well. Nest I have alot of shooting and pressure pains arount my ear on that side as well. Most pain start just behind my earlobe where my jawbone meets it. The it moves up from there and on occation throughout my head. The pain also comes down into my collarbone. There are some lymph nodes there as well sticking out.   On the left side in front of my ear, right next to my cheekbone I have a pea sized bumb that has a slight pain. I have a little pain arount this ear as well, but not as much as the right ear.   And last I just feel like places all around me ears and temples are swelling, or just changing. Are that lymph nodes in all of these place that could be dong that.   I know this is a lot. I don't have insurance right now and can't afford to go to the doctor. Any imput would be greatly appreciated. Thanks\n\n",

The presence of lymph nodes in all these areas is something that warrants examination. Some of these lymph nodes have obviously been around for some time which may be reassuring. The bump on the back of your neck could be anything from an occipital protuberance to a sebaceous cyst to an occipital lymph gland.  Please have this condition checked. Some university hospitals may offer free services. Please check the internet for options in your area.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I think you should be checked right away. There's no way to tell without an examination. Most of the time if the presentation is not clear a physician can only make a good guess at best and try a certain medicine out.   Does it look like a bruise? Does it show color changes (blue, green, red, black)? Were you hit there? From your history you are receiving plavix and aspirin which are known to cause bleeding. This is the most possible cause. This may mean the doctor needs to adjust your doses. A bruise could become infected and turn really nasty if left unattended.  I am not scaring you, it could turn out to be nothing at all. There's a reason why we worry sometimes.   Please keep us updated!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Diagnosis of any lump is easier when associated symptoms or signs exist and with direct clinical examination possible causes can be suggested.  Swelling in this part can be of soft tissue or bone origin. Bone swellings are hard and fixed (not mobile). It might result from a healed fracture or de novo. An X-ray on the chest wall would show the mass.  Soft tissue mass is soft to firm usually mobile. Examples of soft tissue mass in this area is lipoma, a benign tumor from fat cells that is mobile, sliding like, soft to firm and is usually painless.  They like any swelling may cause compression symptoms. Based on the underlying structures compression symptoms would occur, e.g. nerve compression would result in numbness and tingling sensation.   Investigations include CT scan of the chest and upper abdomen. Biopsy may be needed to define the nature of the swelling.  Exclusion of viral infection like herpes zoster is essential, it may initially present with numbness and tingling before vesicles appear.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. If there is a mass causing compression, early intervention is essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  This is a post-traumatic problem, and could be a cyst or could be an inflamed and swollen bursa (bursitis) which can on occasion actually become a cyst or cyst-like. It may well respond positively to non-steroidal  anti-inflammatories such as Advil or Aleve. If not, you'll need to have it examined by an orthopedist, who may be able to drain it or, if necessary, surgically repair it.   In any case, the main problem with this sort of thing is the discomfort and limited range of motion it can cause. Hopefully it will resolve on its own or with use of NSAIDs. If not, by all means make an appointment with an ortho specialist.   Best of luck to you. Please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is very difficult to tell what this lump could be without direct clinical examination.  Possibilities are many and include: - Dermatitis that can be due to infections, allergies, and irritants (such as soaps, certain creams).  Dermatitis can occur due to contact with an allergen or irritant (is more likely according to your description) like soap, creams, synthetic cloth, or after vigorous sexual intercourse or masturbation.  Other causes of dermatitis like infection with Herpes simplex or friction and fungus that occurs mainly Obese and active people are less likely.   - Another cause could be folliculitis which is due to infection and inflammation at the hair follicles. - Sebaceous cyst (fat glands) when blocked form a lump that can be easily felt too.  - Cancer of the penis is not common and typically the lesion does not grow and decline in size as you described but is usually of a progressive course but direct clinical examination is needed for exclusion.   As you can see direct clinical examination is essential, so I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper management and exclusion of serious causes. Please keep us updated.

    "title": "Re: hard lumps in groin",
    "content": "Hello,  These are probably lymph nodes (inguinal) as they occur in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician. The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease).  They drain the vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, and lower anal canal.   Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection), any other type of infections and inflammarion in the pelvic organs, lymphoma, and pelvic malignancy.  Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter; however, some authors suggest that inguinal nodes larger than 1.5 cm should be considered abnormal. These nodes are usually soft to firm, mobile, and not painful. You noticed these nodes after a cesarean section, so the probability that these nodes are enlarged due to inflammation and infection in the pelvis or lower abdominal wall is high.   Hard nodes (felt like the bone) are suspecious and should be studied properly to exclude serious causes like malignancy.  I would also advise you to contact your doctor for direct clinical examination and investigations.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

When infection or inflammation subsides nodes become smaller but never disappear and are usually felt  as Mobile, painless, less than 1 cm, soft to firm, and known as nonspecific.  In general nodes that are not progressively enlarging and have the characters I mentioned before Nodes that continue to grow or increase in number should be investigated properly.   The fact that you have noticed them recently makes it essential to be examined by your Doctor at least for exclusion of any serious causes and to treat an underlying infection.

    "content": "Hi,  I am a 37 year old female, and I have had joint pain and stiffness in my wrists, fingers, ankles, toes and knees for just over a year.  It is symetrical, but where the pain is worst varies from day to day.  I have seen a rheumatologist and have had every test under the sun, and still don't have a diagnosis.  I had a bone scan that showed very mild synovitis in my hands.  My feet were 'indistinct' and there were no abnormalities in the rest of my body.  The blood tests I've had have all been negative/normal - RF, CRP, ANA, ESR, HLA B27, CCP... Liver function and kidney function tests are normal, and all the other general tests are normal, with the exception of slightly elevated cholesterol and mild eosinophilia.  I tried several anti inflamatory drugs, but none had any effect.  Then my rheumatologist put me on 25mg prednisolone, which I was gradually tapered off, and then started sulfasalizine and Hydroxychloroquine.  I thought maybe the prednisolone was helping, but in hindsight I don't think it helped at all, because the severity of the pain just varies from day to day or week to week.  And having talked to others about prednisolone, they tell me it should have had a 'magic' effect i.e. if it was going to work, it would work brilliantly.  I still had some pretty terrible days on the prednisolone.  Same with the sulfa and hydroxychloroquine.  I took these for almost four months with not even a little improvement, then stopped.  I stopped because I was having eye problems, and becoming very depressed.  Since stopping those meds my eyes are back to normal, and I'm not depressed anymore.  At the moment I am  not taking any medications at all.  And when I look back over the last year, nothing has changed at all in that time.  The pattern tends to be about one week in four i am completely debilitated by pain and fatigue.  For about two weeks I can function well enough to take my kids to and from school, and do a little light housework, but not much else.  By 5 or 6pm the pain is bad, and I need to just rest on the couch for the rest of the evening (and go to bed early).  And then I have about a week where I'm pretty ok - the pain is mild during the day, and it gets worse in the evenings, but only moderate.    So basically nothing has helped at all, and things are getting gradually worse, if anything.  Every morning I have stiffness and some degree of pain.  During the day is mostly better, but by afternoon I get very fatigued and the pain returns.  I no longer work, and most of the time can't even manage gentle walking.  The pain in my feet, especially towards the end of the day makes it too painful, along with the fatigue.  Prior to the onset of whatever this is, i was very fit and active.  I used to run 5km every other day and get out a lot.  Now I just tend to stay at home.  My rheumatologist is at a loss.  He doesn't think it's RA or lupus, infact he no longer thinks its an auto immune disease.  He refered me to an endocrinologist as he suspected it could be a thyroid issue as i already have Hashimotos, but the endocrinologist said all my blood work was fine (TSH and T4) and basically told me to go away, not his problem.  I also have Raynauds and am anemic, feel the cold terribly and struggle to lose weight, so i thought the undertreated thyroid theory was plausible, but the labs say no.  (Even when I was running 25km per week I was still about 20kg overweight). I eat a healthy low fat, low carb, no processed food diet.  Anyway, now after having done much reading and research the only other possibility seems to be an occult tumour.  My doctor said she would expect I would be losing weight if there was a cancer process going on, and I would be sicker.  My rheumatlogist said the bone scan would have shown any metastases to the bone, but I'm worried there's a tumour somewhere else causing these symptoms, and by the time they find it, it'll be too late.  So after this long winded (sorry) post, what are the chances?  I'm only 37, and I don't know (and can't find out) my extended family's medical history.  I'm terrified I'm not going to be around to see my kids grow up, and I feel like all the doctors I've seen are at a loss, and would be happier if I'd just stop bothering them.  All they have to offer me now are anti depressants, which don't take away the pain and disability, therefore don't have much hope of taking away my occasional low moods and fears.  So, are there any further tests i should be asking for?  Are there any blood tests that could be helpful?  Can I be sent off for a full body scan to look for a tumour, like they do on House :).  If anyone has any ideas or suggestions, I would be very grateful for the help.  I know I should probably just 'sit back and wait and see what presents itself' as my rheumatologist suggests, but as I am so physically limited in what I can do, i have lots of time to sit around worrying :).  And all my research seems to come back to the cancer theory...  Thanks for reading through all this stuff.  Cheers Lily\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Your symptoms are more likely to be due to polyarthritis and indirectly related to your thyroid problem.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis is an autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antimicrosomal antibodies against thyroid cells. Its association with polyarthritis and rheumatic diseases is reported in different studies.  Hashimoto's thyroiditis results in hypothyroidism and has been associated with rheumatic syndromes that include fibrositis, myositis, myalgias, carpal tunnel syndrome, Sjogren's syndrome, joint stiffness, joint effusion and an arthropathy resembling RA in which involved joints were lacking most of signs of inflammation. Most of these conditions are expected to resolve with adequate thyroid replacement therapy.  Minority of patients with Hashimoto's thyroiditis present with inflammatory polyarthritis (IP) like RA and SLE. However, these patients are usually seronegative (no antibodies detected in their bloods, and are normothyroid (subsequently may become hypothyroid).  The condition seems to be related to the antithyroid autoantibodies that are thought to attack the synovial tissue. Most of these patients are HLA-DR2 positive. Unfortunately, these patients do not commonly improve with normalization of the thyroid function. However, different lines of therpaies are available.  Cancer is not likely to be the cause of your symptoms and unfortunately there is no such test that can be done blindly to look for a malignancy any where in your body. Unless a site (organ) specific cancer is suspected based on risks, symptoms or signs and is looked for, cancer is not diagnosed (which is not the case).  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to recheck your thyroid function tests.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Thankyou so much for your reply.  I am feeling much calmer these days.  I've also gotten a marked improvement on my symptoms by following a vegan, gluten free diet.  It's very restrictive, but I've had so much pain relief from eating this way that it's worth it.  I now have about two bad days a week, and 3 or 4 bad nights.  Still got a long way to go, but it's better.  I've been talking to my doctors about the Hashimotos, but still my thyroid tests come back normal.  I feel better when my thyroid tests read a little bit over normal, and its a constant battle to get my doctor to agree to keep me on this dose.  I do believe now that I'm one of those minority Hashimotos patients, and my rheumatologist is now saying the diagnosis 'seronegative RA' .  It feels better to have a diagnosis, but i've heard that T3 therapy can help in some cases.  My doctor won't agree to this, however.  My rheumy wants to try me on methotrexate.  Would this be one of the possible therapies that you refer to?  I'm a bit unsure of methotrexate...it sounds a bit scarey.  On the whole though, I'm in a much better place.  I believe hashimotos is the cause, and I'm trying to accept that there might not be a solution, and just make the best of things.  Thankyou again for your reply, much apreciated.  If you have any advice regarding possible treatments, I will be most grateful.  best regards Lily\n\n",

    "title": "Gradually increasing knee pain - Osteosarcoma/bone cancer?",
    "content": "First of all, I'm just 15 years old. Female.  I've been experiencing pain and discomfort only in my RIGHT knee and leg for nearly a year now. I can't sleep well recently. The pain is gradual. First it wasn't that bad, but now its really affecting me.  Well, the pain/discomfort worsens at night or when my legs are at rest. It also hurts when i just stand for quite some time and when i do physical activities that involves my legs. Also when i just walk. the pain/discomfort just attacks suddenly. I really am confused.  I've tried anti-inflammatory drugs but they do not work.  Could anyone help me? Has anyone experienced the same symptoms? I did some research and my symptoms keep saying BONE CANCER. i just wanna be sure. I'm pretty scared. But i don't feel a lump. Does that already cross out bone cancer?  it started while i was sleeping, now it also hurts when i do activities. I sometimes limp. i just don't put my weight on my right leg so it won't hurt. I think its not swollen. i don't feel any lumps. but it hurts that i cannot sleep at night because as i have said it worsens at night.  I just got my blood results, here it is, I don't know if its connected or something. I'll just post it.  MY RESULTS: Hemoglobin = 109 Hematocrit = 0.34 WBC Count = 4.50 RBC Count = 3.50 Platelet Count = 200 Lymphocites = 0.48 Neutrophiles = 0.53  REFERENCE VALUE: Hemoglobin = 120-140(FEMALE) Hematocrit = 0.37 - 0.47(FEMALE) WBC Count = 5 - 10 x 10^9 / L RBC Count = 4.5 - 5.5 x 10^12 / L Platelet Count = 150 - 350 x 10^9 / L Lymphocites = 0.20 - 0.40 Neutrophiles = 0.40 - 0.60   these symptoms have been around for almost a year now. does the blood count results have something to do w/ osteosarcoma? and would be osteosarcoma be diagnosed right away w/ an x-ray? if a tumor was not found on the x-ray, its not osteosarcoma right?   thanks so much! and sorry for the long post. i'm just nervous. i can't say this to my parents cause they'll just gonna laugh at me and say that i'm over-reacting.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  Your blood work doesn't suggest anything, really, certainly nothing that would point toward osteosarcoma. The pain could be caused by a lot of things, and of course a tumor is one possibility. It also could be a baker's cyst, arthritis, or a chronic injury that's never healed properly. On x-ray an osteosarcoma has a very distinctive appearance, so having the knee x-rayed could rule this out (or, of course, as unlikely as it would be statistically, ruled in), and perhaps any more innocent causes of the pain could be visualized as well.   Almost a year is a long time to deal with a chronic pain, and it should be examined and treated so you can get a decent night's sleep and not have to worry that you may have something seriously wrong (even if you do, because then it could be treated, which is preferable to just letting it go and wondering). Oh, and by now, yes, chances are you would be able to feel the tumor manually. If you don't, that makes it a lot less likely. Also the fact that the knee hasn't failed or spontaneously fractured suggests things aren't likely cancerous, but whatever's going on you deserve to know what it is and have it treated effectively.   I hope you'll see to it that you are seen my a doctor and have the knee x-rayed for sure, as this is the first step in ruling out osteoscarcoma and ruling in any one of a dozen or so more likely causes of the pain. And don't underestimate your parents' ability to empathize. :)  I sure hope this helps ease your mind. I think the ultimate mind-easer would be to know what's happening with the knee, and  the sooner the better. Best of luck to you and please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Blood tests last summer revealed high titre ANAs (1:2560, 1:5120, 1:640,1:3240, 1:1280 speckled, nucleolar).  Two separate follow up labs showed no specificities. I do not meet the criteria for SLE or other autoimmune diseases and thus have not been diagnosed with an autoimmune disorder. I am mildly neutropenic <3.4 (since 2001). I have been diagnosed with Acalculous Cholecystitis unknown etiology--this is being investigated as a separate occurrence. Liver function okay. eGFR-stage 2. Two blood tests in 2006--low anion gap, normal twice since. One lab showed significantly low complements C3 and C4--has not been measured since. Celiac has been eliminated (I've been gluten free since 2002).  I had severe fatigue, shingles, low grade fever, and other disturbing symptoms during this time (last summer and many symptoms of which continue).  The fatigue was so severe, that I did not go outside for 45 days and basically stayed in bed.  The fatigue is slightly better but I am not at 1/10th what I was at this time last year. I have many bruises on my legs and arms from very slight pressure--but no bleeding issues. I have been having mid back pain (this has never been an issue before).    Studies state that high titre ANAs are the result of an autoimmune disorder, an infection, or malignancy (occasionally they may be seen in the healthy, however obviously this is not my case). There are studies that suggest further tests are in order to rule out malignancy. (Zuber et al, Imran et al, Burnha et al, Tolosa-Vilella et al, Grandics, Tschernatsch for specifics please request).   I have a greater than average risk for lung and breast cancer--however a routine chest x-ray and mammogram last summer were unremarkable.  Primary abdicated authority to Rheumatology and Rheumatology refuses diagnosis, further tests, or referrals.  What further tests should be ordered? And is an oncology referral in order?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: High titre ANAs and malignancy",
    "content": "Hello,  A high ANA titre is commonly seen in autoimmune connective tissue disorders like  - Rheumatoid arthritis.  - Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE).  - Scleroderma.  - Sj\u00f6gren's syndrome.  - Polymyositis.   -Raynaud's syndrome.  Raynaud's phenomenon is of no known cause in the majority of cases. However, others may be associated with other diseases like SLE, scleroderma, or rheumatoid arthritis.  Autoantibodies against red blood cells and platelets may also be present resulting in low counts that may symptomatize with weakness, easy fatigue and easy bruise. Bruise could be also due to vasculities and weak capillary walls.  You have mentioned that you have been diagnosed with Raynaud's phenomenon since 2007. So, this could be a cause of this high titre however, other diseases should be looked for.  Reports about the association of high ANA titre and malignancy are not as strong as its association with autoimmune disorders; moreover the pattern of ANA can be correlated with a clinical autoimmune disorder. Paraneoplastic syndromes like polymyositis are associated with high ANA titre and may precede malignancy. But an isolated high ANA titre in association with cancer is not certain.  You may have many factors that increase the likelihood of breast cancer development (family history, hormone replacement HRT) but your screening mammography was negative. I advise you however, to discuss with your doctor the safety of hormone replacement therapy with your positive family history. You better be on annual screening in addition to regular breast self examination.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concerns.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "First a short history. I am a 35 year old female. I found a mass on my right breast and had a mammogram done. nothing was found, including the mass. I went to a breast specialist who did a MRI/CT/ and Ultrasound. Nothing but a 5mm duct was seen. Eventually 2 lymph nodes were seen, and after several talks both the surgeon and I decided they should be removed and biopsied. What we reported by the pathologist, was very good news, there is no cancer. So the only reason I am asking my question is not because I am scared or doubt what I was told, but due to the fact that no one seems to be able to explain Benign lymphoid hyperplasia to me. I would like to know what it is, and how I got it, and do I need to be concerned that it may come back?  so the exact words from the report says.... 5 lymph nodes WITH benign lymphiod hyperplasia. no tumor identified.  thanks in advance, Tanna\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Lymphoid hyperplasia is a condition in which the number of cells increases due to the rapid growth (proliferation) of cells in the lymphoid tissue.  Hyperplasia may result in the formation of a benign tumor, that can be visible.  Benign hyperplasia occurs as a response to a specific stimulus (physiological) thus cells grow under the normal regulatory control mechanisms.  In general, hyperplasia may occur following chronic inflammatory process, hormonal changes (like in breast tissue), or as a compensation following loss of certain tissues.  Lymph nodes in the body are parts where foreign organisms are trapped and attacked by the immune system, thus are commonly enlarged. Pathologically if examined there will be benign hyperplasia, a reactionary process to different inflammatory and infectious process.  The report is very reassuring and I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "i am a 63 year old man and started feeling very week 6 months ago and my hands and under-feet became numb, my gum became white and would bleed when brushing my teeth. each time i take a walk i would feel a tight squeeze in my chest esp. on the right breast and instantly i would feel faint and at times woul just fall down since all my joints would suddenly loose power and would be dizzy. I sometimes suffer from blurred vision when i stat feeling faint.  I went to a doctor in May who sent me to a physician in a neighbouring town and fom the blood tests he took, he indicatedto me that i had anemia and my hb was 4.5. I was admitted into a hospital in August and i was transfused with 4 units of blood and was discharged. After the transfusion i was well again and had no problems at all. However after 3 weeks the same symptoms started again and i returned to the physician who then conducted a series of tests i.e bone marrow tepline, protein electropheresis, bence jones. when the results came back he told me my hb was low again and that no definitive diagnosis was done and i had to go for another transfusion. The physician then referred me to a specialist physician with the following note:   this 63yr-old man had suffered from pancytopenia fo more than 6months. In July 2008, he had Hb 5.0g/dl, WBC 5.3 and platelets 104. Last week, the same picture holds, showing preservation of white cells. Bone marrow was hypocellular, suggesting myclofitrosis, but the FBC does not entirely fit. One of the blood flms showed cold agglutinins and polychromasia. This would suggest peripheral consumption (but the hypocellular marrow does not fit). I suggest high dose corticosteroids and lets discuss.   I took the note to the pecialist physician and was transfused 4 more units of blood. After the transfusion he told me my Hb had risen to 5.6, WCC 5.3, p/t 89, MCV 92.3. He then gave me a 30day supply of Prenisolone to be 60mg once daily and asked me to come for a review after the 30 days.   I went back home and tarted the dose 3 days ago. I still feel weak and am very worried since all the tests never proved the cause of this blood loss. I don't bleed from my gums anymore but the squeeze in my chest i getting worse in the morning before i take the medication and i lose my voice whenever the pain in my chest starts. I end up trying to clear my throat but to no avail. I have also started drinking lots of water at least 4litres a day.  please assist, what could be wrong with me?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: what type of anemia?",
    "content": "Hello,  It is quite obvious that you have severe degree of anemia which explain your symptoms like generalized weakness and the chest pain. Bleeding gum is explained by the low platelet count and or defective platelet function.  However, the result of the bone marrow examination as a hypocellular marrow is not coinciding with the peripheral count. The peripheral blood count shows a normal total leucocyte count and a platelet count fluctuating between low normal to a true thrombocytopenia.    It would be more helpful if you can provide us with the detailed results of at least the last blood picture, reticulocyte count (if it was done) and the bone marrow exmination. It would be also helpful if you can inform us about any history of recent (before the onset of these symptoms) drug exposure, infections especially viral, and any family history of blood diseases.  Aplastic anemia is diagnosed by pancytopenia (decline in erythrocyte, platelet, and leukocyte count in the peripheral blood) and a hypocelllular bone marrow (decline in all blood precursors in the bone marrow).   Bone myelofibrosis (which seems more likely to be the cause) is diagnosed by anemia and normal or increased total leukocyte and platelet count although the platelets count may become low with disease progression. Confirmation of the diagnosis can be done with the finding of bone marrow fibrosis on bone marrow biopsy and a dry tap on bone marrow aspirate. The presence of neutophil and megakaryocytic hyperplasia is also a very common finding.  In bone marrow myelofibrosisis, anemia is usually not that severe and when the Hb level is that low an associated autoimmune hemolytic anemia or thrombocytopenia should be looked for (e.g.Cold agglutinin as in your case). High LDH is a common finding too. Myelofibrosis is classified as a myeloproliferative disease in which there is an abnormal bone marrow stem cell growth, and subsequent replacement of the bone marrow with fibrous connective tissue.  - The condition should be differentiated from other causes of secondary bone marrow fibrosis like lymphoma,myeloma, autoimmune disorders (eg, systemic lupus erythematosus) and hyperparathyroidism associated with vitamin D deficiency.   - MDS hypoplastic variant can give a picture similar to yours and should be excluded and cytogenetic study of the bone marrow is helpful.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor. Hope this information is useful. Please keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

I've also been steadily losing weight (7+ pounds) but I'm not dieting (wasn't overweight to start with). I've been having weird aches & pains lately too. My bones & joints (e.g. knees and ankles) ache quite a lot, especially first thing in the morning. I've also been getting discomfort in my back on the left side (above my waist but below the rib cage).   I had some blood tests done recently (including full blood count). Tests came back negative for diabetes and thyroid problems, but abnormal for neutrophils, red blood count and lymphocytes. I don't have the actual numbers so I don't know whether they were lower or higher than expected. I've just had a follow up FBC (4 weeks after the first test) and the results will come back next week. I'm worried that some form of cancer could be the cause.   What could cause my symptoms and abnormal blood test results, and what questions should I ask my doctor next week?  Many thanks in advance.

    "content": "Hello,  The symptoms you have described are non specific and can occur in many conditions that can be benign or malignant.  These symptoms however, seem to be more related to myoskeletal disorders or connective tissue disorders.  A list of inflammatory conditions involving the joints and the muscle could be the reason of your symptoms and the only way to narrow these possibilities is through proper history taking and physical examination.  These conditions include: - Systemic rheumatic illnesses involving the joints like systemic lupus erythematosus SLE,  - Rheumatoid arthritis RA, ankylosing spondylitis, gout etc. - Infectious arthritis bacterial, viral etc   These conditions usually result in vague symptoms like fatigue, weight loss, fever, in addition to inflammatory affection of the joints making them painful, stiff and may be swollen during the disease activities.   Some people with depression may also present with joint pain, weight loss, and fatigue.  Other causes like blood diseases whether benign or malignant can give similar clinical picture.  Complete blood picture, ESR, LDH, Serologic tests and imaging recommended by your physician after thorough clinical examination are helpful to define the underlying cause.  It would be more helpful if you can provide us with the results of your blood tests.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is very difficult to tell what this lump could be without direct clinical examination. According to the information you have provided I can think of two possibilities for the origin of this lump either the breast or the bone.  Physiological changes during puberty may result in breast enlargement and the feeling of lump like swelling (retroareolar) in one or both breasts (gynecomastia). This occurs as a result of physiological hormonal changes and is expected to resolve in few months in the majority of males.   The second possibility is a healed fractured rib related after the trauma you previously experienced to or any other trauma.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to seek direct medical consultation.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 50 year old male who has no history of any type of cancer on either side of my family.  I have been smoking at least 3 cigars per day for the past 10 years.  I get a checkup of my mouth by an oral surgeon once every year or so to look for signs of mouth cancer (last checkup about 6 months ago was clear).  I guess that my general question is, what are the chances of developing mouth or throat cancer from smoking so many cigars?  I work out regularly, eat a good diet with a lot of broccoli and other greens, take a lot of Omega 3, garlic, lecithin and broccoli supplements.  I love smoking cigars, so stopping  or cutting down is not an option.  Thank you for your help.\n\n",

Other cancers are also increased such as esophageal, pancreatic, and heart/lung if you inhale particularly.  Any amount of healthy living otherwise at least helps because you can decrease your risk of colon cancer with eating broccoli, and improved cardiovascular health can protect you from other diseases even aside from cancer but it isn't like you can keep score and the good you do will cancel out the bad.  It helps but can't undo the damage of the smoking.  Quitting is your best defense.  You say that is not an option so you are choosing your current comfort level over any future risk this brings.  These are decisions we all must make every day.    Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Question About Cigars Regarding Mouth and Throat Cancer",
    "content": "Hello, I agree with Debbie, and I would like to add some facts that may help others understand the risk of smoking in general and smoking cigar in particular.  Risks from both cigars and cigarettes smoking are related to the degree of exposure (daily exposure and the amount or the level enhaled) .   Both scigars and cigarettes contain similar forms of toxins and carcinogens (cancer causing). However, one cigar may contain as much tobacco as an entire pack of cigarettes. The differences in risks is linked to the differences in their smoking habits. Most cigarette smokers smoke every day while the majority of cigar smokers smoke only occasionally and do not inhale. However, all cigar and cigarette smokers are at higher risk to develop cancer than non smokers.  They increase the risk of lips, mouth, tongue, throat, and larynx cancer and those who inhale  are at higher risk of esophageal cancer. Holding even an unlit cigar between the lips exposes this part to carcinogens.  In addition, those who inhale have higher risk of kidney, pancreatic, cervical, stomach cancers, bladder, as well as acute myeloid leukemia.  Lung cancer risk although less than those smoke cigarettes is still higher (double) than non smoker. However, the risk for those smoke five cigars a day is comparable to those smoke one pack of cigarettes a day.  Cancer is one of the major health risk from smoking and it causes many other health risks on other body systems.  Studies showed that higher risk of death is expected for those smoke 3 or more cigars than those smoke 2 or fewer cigars a day.   I advise you to reconsider smoking quitting programs. Best regards.\n\n",

Recently somebody cooked a pizza for me, but left the styrene base disc on it by accident. I wasn't informed before eating the pizza, only after eating it. It didn't taste any different, but after reading up on it...I learnt that it can actually be extremely dangerous. It concerns me even more that my younger brother with down syndrome shared the pizza with me. The styrene disc was fairly well melted.  So recently I am having a few health problems. General aches and pains all over the place. My head (nausea), neck and lower back mainly. I talked to my GP after eating it and he said it's nothing to worry about because he thinks styrene is fairly inert. But thanks to the internet, I know this isn't the case. I know it transfers benzene into the food, which is a known carcinogen and mutagen.  Also recently I have been suffering from major acidity problems in my stomach, or so the doctors think. They put my other aches and pains down to the stomach problems. I am currently taking lanzoprazole for the stomach problems, but I just need some reassurance that by just cooking a pizza, I haven't condemned my brother and I to a short, cancerous life.  My brother is 6, he has down syndrome and I would feel utterly terrible if anything happened to him over this. He has also been complaining of pains in his neck.  Do carcinogen's cause immediate problems? Or do they cause problems over time? Also, is cell damage repairable? Or is it a case of...once you get it...it's curtains?  Please help meeeeeeee!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Dr. Chan and I would like to add some information about benzene exposure and its hazards. Benzene exposure can cause immediate or long term effects.  Direct exposure can be through inhalation, ingestion with food, skin contact or eye contact. The major immediate effects are dose dependent and usually occur with high doses. These effects may be in the form breath difficulties, confusions, and loss of consciousness if benzene was inhaled. While following ingestion vomiting and stomach pain may occur. Skin and eye irritation results from direct benzene exposure. Exposure to very high levels may cause death.  All studies have proved that exposure to a carcinogen for long duration is a major risk for cancer development. Exposure to benzene as well at high levels and for long duration results in cancer in blood forming organs like leukemia.  Keeping in mind that sporadic exposure to carcinogen seldom causes cancer makes you and your brother reassured especially the amount you may have been exposed to is of no significance.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Background Info: In 1990, after seeing my family doctor for a regular annual exam, my WBC came back on the higher side (13.5), specifically neutrophils. After undergoing several different blood tests and ruling out other diseases, my family doctor referred me to a oncologist/hematologist.  My WBC count was at 18.8.  The oncologist/hematologist thought that I had a MPD(CML), after several months of testing and undergoing bone marrow and chromosomal analysis testing that was ruled out at that time. The oncologist/hematologist stated that the elevated WBC could be normal for me but my family doctor should \"watch\" my blood counts. My WBC count dropped to be within the 12-15 range for several years however recently went above 19.2 so my doctor referred me back to the same oncologist/hematologist at which time I was informed that there was a newer test called a JAK test which would be able to find things that previously were more challenging to find. I didn't hear back from the oncologist/hematologist with the results of the test so I assumed things were fine. However, 2 months later (last week) I was asked to come in for \"immunophenotyping to further check on my lymphocytes\".I attempted to contact the oncologist/hematologist to find out why this test is being requested and have not received a response. I have done some research on the internet and from the information I have found, immunophenotyping is used more to stage various types of leukemias rather than a diagnostic tool.  Is that correct? How long does it typically take to receive results from immunophenotyping? What could the JAK test shown that would have resulted in the request for the immunophenotyping test? Do some people have higher than normal WBC? Could a person be Philedelphia Chromosome negative and then years later be positive?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you can provide us more information about your history of (Psoriasis) from the initial diagnosis to the last follow up and your current status, what kind of treatments you have received and any associated complications.  Normal values for while blood cell and its elements are: 4,500-10,000 white blood cells/mcl. Neutrophils: 40% to 60%  Lymphocytes: 20% to 40%  Monocytes: 2% to 8%  Eosinophils: 1% to 4%  Basophils: 0.5% to 1%  Band: 0% to 3%   Elevated Total Leukocytic count can be due to many causes including: - Infections,  -systemic disease like Rh. Arthritis, Psoriasis, inflammtory bowel diseases and vasculitis as well as physical stress. - Cancer.  Specific increase in one blood element is more indicative of certain medical conditions, e.g esiophilia in allergic people, and parasitic infection, monocytosis is commonly seen in bacterial infections, neutrophilia in most infections and tissue damage like inflammatory diseases.  Although a higher than 11,000 white cells/mcl of blood is considered high, in leukemias the white blood cell counts can reach 100,000.  Other tests known to be elevated in tissue damage and inflammatory conditions are ESR, LDH  and CRP. .  When leukemia is suspected, Bone marrow Aspirate and Biopsy should be evaluated. Other symptoms like weak generalized condition, fever, headache and bony pains, which are very common in conditions like active inflammatory (tissue damage) and malignant diseases.  It is reassuring that your blood counts for more that 15 years are almost within the same range, thus the cause is more likely to be either benign or very indolent.  Regarding immunophenotyping, it is a technique to study specific proteins expressed by cells and mark them (cell markers). Thus it can define the type of leukemic cells accurately in a matter of a few hours using a technique named flow cytometry. Flow cytometry has become the preferred method for the lineage assignment (cell of origin) and maturation analysis (degree of differentiation) of malignant cells in acute leukemias and lymphomas.  According to the identified markers it can differentiate normal from abnormal cells, and classify these abnormal cells into specific subcategories.  Philadelphia chromosome is a specific abnormal chromosome that is associated with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) that develops from a translocation, or switching, of material between two previously normal chromosomes.  In CML, this abnormal chromosome results in the production of an abnormal protein that drives the bone marrow to produce more white blood cells. This overproduction of white blood cells made CML also considered a type of myeloproliferative disorder.  Cytoplasmic Janus protein tyrosine kinases (JAKs) are crucial components in the regulation of cellular survival, proliferation, differentiation and apoptosis.  Jak Kinases abnormalities to the contrary although have been found to be involved in the pathogenic pathway of many hematologic malignancies (it regulates hematopoietic cell differentiation), it is not diagnostic.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him all your concerns.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Many of us have done this, especially prior to the knowledge of the potential harm.  In fact, in nursing school we were exposed to it in the anatomy lab regularly.  After the fact there's nothing that can be done except hope that we aren't among the unlucky ones here.  No, it does not guarantee cancer; but exposure could possibly raise your risk a bit but it is believed the greatest risk comes with repeat and heavy exposures as opposed to one-time events.  We really would be in trouble if cancer-causing factors automatically gave each person the disease on single exposures.  Even people with repeat exposures to carcinogens sometimes never get the disease (like with some smokers who never develop lung disease or cancer).  There seems to be some genetic predisposition which, when linked to exposure sets the stage for the abnormal cell growth that occurs with cancer.   The risks would likely involve the respiratory system, nasal passages, brain and leukemia.  It is wise to avoid exposure to formaldehyde and if your occupation brings you in regular contact you should investigate measures to decrease your risk.   Here is a fact sheet from the National Cancer Institute about formaldehyde. http://www.nci.nih.gov/PDF/FactSheet/fs3_8.pdf  Best wishes.\n\n",

Please help me..I need to know if these symptoms point to something serious or not. I'm too scared to go to the doctor unless I really must.  I get headaches every morning on the right side of my head, in various places, that go away after a couple hours. they're not very painful but are getting worse.  My right eye is getting progressively blurred, I used to have perfect vision but i seem to hardly use this eye now. theres a strange lump above this eye..between the eye socket and eyeball, kind of like some tissue is being pushed out..?! I'm so tired all the time, not just mentally but physically aswel. No matter how much I've slept my eyes are tired and puffy, my head feels foggy and I can't think straight.  My appetite has disappeared, I only eat about one meal a day now but mostly because I sleep most of the day. I try to eat at set meal times despite not being hungry. I weigh just over 7stone and am 5ft 4 so I'm not too skinny yet, but my face has been getting puffy which Ithink is concealing how thin I am.  I've started to get this strange ache in the middle of my back when I straighten up. I was hit by a car last year which broke my pelvis so I get lower back pain most of the time so I don't know if this could have travelled.  I occasionally get sharp pain in the right side of my ribcage, a couple inches under my armpit. This hasn't been too bad up til now but a few days ago I was lying in bed and it got VERY painful. It was coming in waves every few seconds and really hurt, lasting for about 5 minutes.      There are some other things aswel but these are my main worries. I know it must sound stupid that I haven't already gone but I'm basically agoraphobic and get very anxious around people. I'm scared if I do go I won't be able to talk properly to my doc and I'll forget  some of the stuff worrying me. I tried posting before with no response so tried to forget things, but I can't do this anymore. Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Before I got to the last paragraph I'd already suspected you of being a very anxious person. This, of course, really complicates all your medical concerns, because the anxious patient tends to focus intesely on somatic symptoms, which tend to become magnified and perspective is lost. This often causes important symptoms to be overlooked or lost in the shuffle.   The main thing you describe which sounds somewhat out of the ordinary and concerns me is the eye problem. Both the fact that you can describe a physical lump in your right eye socket as well as distinct loss of focus in that eye. This is something  which, while there may be a simple  explanation,  is at least concrete and  can be verified by physical exam. The other pains, etc., sound superficial and within the normal range of what people experience daily but don't notice because there are other, more compelling things going on that distract them. When a pain or other symptom rises above the threshold of ambient \"noise\" present in life, then they serve a purpose. When you're agoraphobic or otherwise find yourself isolated for long periods, it is far more difficult to discriminate between the \"normal\" aches and pains, etc., and those that truly demand your attention. This is not a judgement, just an observation and a fact you have to deal with when trying to evaluate the condition of your body at any given moment.   The eye problem, however, as I said earlier, is more concrete. While it may (and hopefully is) nothing serious, it definitely warrants an exam, first by an MD and then possibly a referral to an opthamologist. I know this may present certain challenges for you because of agoraphobia, but if  you can find someone to go with you it may help a lot. Also, if there are any other symptoms you feel are important, regardless of what I may have said here, I suggest you write them down, make notes, and take these notes with you to your doctor's appointment. It would be  ideal if you could explain to the doctor in advance or at least at the outset of the first visit, that you suffer from agoraphobia. This would help the doctor to work with you more effectively and also perhaps lead to you finding a way to begin to manage this crippling disorder, because you do not have to live with  this for the rest of your life. It can be managed or even resolved with medication and/or cognative therapy.   Good luck to you and I really hope this has been helpful. Please do follow up here with us and best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Apx 4 months ago, i developed bilteral axilla swelling which disspiated in 1 week. Following this decrease in swelling, i found an enlarged lymph node in my right axilla which was tender to the touch.  I had a bilateral axilla ultrasound done which  was negative.  The nodule remained & I developed a \"chafing\" sensation in my right axilla as well.  My PCP has placed me on Levaquin for two weeks & plans to refer me to a general surgeon if the nodule has not decreased in size.  When found, it was the size of a peanut & has remained unchanged.  I've had no fever, sweating, weight loss or fatigue.  I am concerned b/c sister was diagnosed with DCIS at age 44.  What are the chances that this could be malignant?  My last mamogram was negative & i have found no other lumps/nodules.  thanks\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Enlarged lymph node in axilla",
    "content": "Hi swtpotatoqueen, Our lymph nodes function as a filtering system against bacterial/viral infections. They commonly enlarge as a result of these infections and may not return to their preinfectious state. However, when lymph nodes continue to enlarge or there is no reduction in size despite treatment with a course of antibiotic therapy they become a little more concerning. Mammograms aren't 100% accurate for a variety of reasons, for example, because of dense breast tissue. Breast self exams sometimes find areas of concern that aren't identified by mammogram and are evaluated by ultrasound. It would be impossible to state whether or not your particular area of concern is related to or unrelated to malignancy but considering that you have a strong family history it would raise suspicion or concern and further evaluation would be recommended. An update would be greatly appreciated when your time permits. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there..I am a 21/f and 13 wks pregnant with my second child. Ive had on/off left side chest pain for about 6 months now and had a normal chest xray in september and multiple blood tests that have mostly been pretty normal. a few weeks ago, i noticed the chest pain under my left rib that goes around to my back and when i move a certain way or bend up/down, i feel something \"popping\" in and out at the bottom. It isnt painful and I can actually feel it if i put my finger there and pop it back in. It doesnt feel like a mass necessarily but a bone or something horizontal? i went to the ER for this last week and they said it was probably a floating rib but wouldnt do a scan/xray on me because i am pregnant. I just noticed today that the same thing happens occasionally, but not as prounounced, on the right side.   My father died of lung cancer in Oct 07 at 54 years old, and I am just so concerned now that this could be a tumor or that I could have cancer??  Could you please advise on what you think of this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Mass popping out under left rib..sometimes right?",
    "content": "Hi Sweetheart5015,  While it is impossible to be absolutely sure without a physical examination, it seems very improbable a diagnosis of cancer with your symptoms. Rib discomfort is common in pregnancy. There are several reasons for this; I will explain some of them.  During pregnancy, the diaphragm rises by 4 cm and the chest circumference increases by 5\u20137 cm. These chest wall changes are attributed to the enlarging uterus that pushes up and tightens the diaphragm, this force is transmitted to the lower rib cage. In addition, hormonal changes cause relaxation of ribs ligaments. As a result the rib cage widens to accommodate the growing baby. These changes take place usually in the third trimester. Common complains are rib pain, caused from direct pressure to the chest wall with intercostal nerve irritation, less frequently due to rib subluxations. Also, some shortness of breath is common because of a reduced capacity of lung volumes.  Less known is the fact that changes in the chest occur before uterine enlargement, early during the first trimester. The subcostal angle can increase from 68 to as much as 103 degrees, which makes the ribs more flat. This could explain why you do not feel a mass but a bone or \u201csomething horizontal\u201d.  The doctor at the ER may be correct about the floating rib. If you still have concerns about your symptoms seek advice from your doctor, he can order a high-resolution sonography, a useful way to characterize rib lesions.\n\n",

Well I visited my primary care doctor today and he felt it...i have the popping out on the left side under the ribcage when i move and then the pain/tenderness follows all the way around to my back. It's very annoying : / He wasnt very concerned (as i find he usually isnt) and is suggesting that this is most likely a slipped rib/floating rib or costochondritis? So he is sending me to the Chiropractor on Monday. Should I have requested a sonogram of the area? I am so worried that this isnt a rib and that something inside could be causing it (tumor..some other type of mass?)  Can you advise? Thanks so much.\n\n",

I am certainly not an expert in interpetation of these scans; however, my understanding is that diffuse uptake means that the entire thymus area has taken up the tracer evenly which would be indicative that there are no \"hot spots\" that may be indicative of cancer spots in the thymus.  I would recommend you follow up with your oncologist about this but I believe this is a good finding.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, In a person your age, cancer is not the most likely concern.  It is possible you have hemorrhoids.  These can also be internal where you don't know they exist.  Straining with bowel movements, loose movements can both aggravate the condition and result in bleeding from the rectum.    You should see a gastroenterologist, internist, family doctor or proctologist to rule out anything serious and to determine what you might do from a dietary standpoint to help the condition.  In the meantime, increase your dietary fiber with vegetables, fruits, beans and whole grains as well as taking in more water each day.  You can supplement this with fiber such as Konsyl, Citracel or Metamucil-type products containing psyllium.  Plan to spend at least thirty minutes in a relaxed attempt at a daily bowel movement around the same time each day.  Read something and sit, even if you don't feel the urge.  Your body will get the message that you are not too rushed to do the job.  This helps you to avoid withholding due to time constraints.    Feces do change in color and appearance based on diet, medication, etc. so don't expect it to always look the same.    Best wishes to you in this new year.\n\n",

Heart problems, Diabetes, and cancer in maternal great grandparents.  currently taking quvar and albuterol inhalers.   seems serious or seems like fatty tumors?   first of all i understand that you can not diagnose...but i would like a opinion. i am a mother of 2 and i am depressing myself everyday about this.  I noticed a small pea size lump on right side of my mid back about 4 years ago. I paid no mind. even after getting a couple more within the next yr or so I paid no mind. I was aware of fatty tumors from the internet and obgyn (of course no expertise I am aware of said it was fatty lumps at that time). since I have had my daughter 2 yrs ago I have had more on my back. I have counted at least 9 on my back, 1 on inside of left wrist, and 1 on outside of left wrist. Tonite I have noticed when I went to Itch my front side of torso, I have a small pea size lump on my rib cage and 1 on the other rib cage. I also now have a small lump as well on the inside of my upper left thigh. most of these lumps are tender especially on back and rib cage if I keep touching them. my wrist and thigh does not bother me. I have noticed though lately that my back is more achy that normal. but I don't know if fatty tumors can cause achyness or I am just overweight. (5'6 225lbs). I don't know how to explain these lumps other than the one on my wrist I can pick up and move, the one on my thigh I cant tell because I am too beefy there, the ones on my back are tender at times and some are not perfect pea shape, some have slightly grown over past couple yrs as well...but none bigger than a dime. the ones on my back actually seem misshaped. I don't think they are hard like bones, but they are firm. I have NO lumps on breasts or arms. I am not all that active and have a poor diet.   now...I have OCD. I have the obsessional part, which means I will get thoughts in my head for no reason, which also means I fret on death continuoulsy untill reassured. with all these bumps coming...I am so scared of cancer, but I have been told because I am over weight that may be reason for lumps. I know I am overweight, but many people in my family are but have no lumps. I have made a doctor appt for 2 weeks from now, but I would love some input now if possible. good or bad. thank you!!!!\n\n",

What causes black gums?? I have noticed that my gums are turning black. I take good care of my teeth but I don't understand what could be wrong now. I do not have a dentist at present as mine just retired. Could this be gum cancer??? I have been swishing with a weak solution of H. peroxide but this has not helped.Any advice would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "title": "Lt Supra Node Enlarged + Icterus of chest",
    "content": "Hi,   25yo male.  Smoker & drinker.  In good physical shape otherwise (athletic), and:  HIV Negative No Tuber. No Mono No HEP's No travel No Rx or OTC Rx CBC unremarkable 6 months ago. Family history clear of cancer's except for mother's father who passed away from pancreatic cancer in his 70's.  I had posted probably a year ago on this board about a cervical lymph node enlargement.  That went away fairly quickly, however immediately following it I noticed a left supraclavicular lymph node starting to protrude.  6+ months ago it was approx. 3.5cm (visible and protruding.)  I went to my doctor who seemed alarmed and had ordered a biopsy to occur a couple of weeks later (we had scheduling issues.)  Due to special circumstances, my insurance provider changed before that occurred, all was cancelled, and basically forgotten about.  Now the node is about 5cm long (it is wider than two fingers together.)  It is visible to the naked eye from as far as four feet away.  Its not rock hard.  But its very firm (feels like a equivalent sized piece of solid rubber would.) It is not attached to the skin over it, however it will not move within the surrounding tissue.  I hadn't realized it had gotten so big, I was overlooking it.  About a month, maybe two ago I noticed the skin on my right pec was turning a brownish-golden-yellow color (I'm of irish-czech decent, so its extremely noticeable against my normally bright white skin.)  Since that happened, the discoloriing has grown to the cener of my chest and is now moving downwards in patches, in a thin 1-2\" wide line towards my belly button.  I would say it looks like jaundice, but my face is normal color, and my eyes are white.  The only other symptom I have during this time has been occasional night sweats.  I do, now, understand the severity of the symptoms presented.  My specific questions would be:  1. What could the yellowing of the chest be, can jaundice begin on the chest? 2. With regards to the Supraclavicular lymph node, I understand that I'm already looking at (based upon size and location) an apporoximate 50-67% risk of a cancer...  But besides a typical blanket response of lymph nodes can stay enlarged due to infection, etc - I would love to hear a response that could point to other diagnoses more specific to the left supraclavicular lymph node.  Thank you,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi ZoomJag3,  This is very important to follow up on with your doctor.  Your doctor is correct to be worried since the node is a) getting larger and b) located in the supraclavicular region.    There are a few infections that can set up in the lymph nodes in this region such as tuberculosis or other mycobacterium infections.  Unfortunately, this is also a presentation of cancers.  A biopsy will help definitively answer this question.  This lymph node chain is one of the places that abdominal tumors can spread to.  Regarding the jaundice I am stumped by this.  It would be difficult for jaundice to present this way.  Checking your bilirubin level is a good idea although I really don't think this is from elevated bilirubin.  I suspect that this probably is related to what ever is causing your lymph node enlargement.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I haven\u2019t had anymore of these, and at the time I had never had sex, only oral.  What could this have been?  Could this have been penile cancer?  If it was penile cancer, would I have developed more symptoms than I did, and would it have spread?  Since it was 2 years ago and since it hasn\u2019t come back, I am not too concerned about it anymore, but I just wanted to ask.  I never went to the doctor for it cause I was out of town for a month and since it didn\u2019t last long.    One other question that I have is that I have small, tiny little bumps on the shaft and at the base of my penis.  They kinda look like bumps where the hair follicles are located.  From all the pictures that I have seen, they don't seem to be warts.  Is it normal to have little bumps?  They don't itch, bleed, or nothing.  Again, I have only had oral sex.    Thanks.\n\n",

It is much more likely that you had a clogged pore or slight skin infection that subsequently resolved.  The bumps you describe are likely normal.  It is common for hair follicles to have a bumpy appearance.  If you develop new symptoms or are still concerned I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.   I am a healthy 32 yo female.  I am a stay home mother to 3 young children.  For the past few months, I was suffering from bad flushing spells.  They were in my face, neck and chest, and most days lasted for hours.  I was seen by my GP a few times for this, and she checked my hormones and finally did a CT scan of my chest/abdomen area.    Fortunately nothing was found in regards to carcinoid (checking for that because of the flushing), but I was found to have an inhomogeneous thymus gland.  A spot the size of 1.6 cm.    I was then sent to a pulmonologist, who told me that a biopsy wasn't really possible, but a surgery to remove it was.  However, he did not seem concerned, and advised that we wait another 2 months to have a follow up CT scan to see what was happening then.  We agreed to this.    Before this time, I had no symptoms or worries except for the flushing.  But for the past two weeks, I've had a bad sore throat.  Could this be something related to the thymus problem, or just something coincidental?  Is this something to talk to my pulmonologist about?   Also, are there any other suggestions, or information I can get in regards to the inhomogeneous thymus gland?  Is waiting two months for a follow-up CT scan the right thing to do?  Are there any other options that I'm not aware of?    Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello there,  The thymus is responsible for the development of the immune system early in life. Normally it later atrophies and loses function between birth and puberty.  Thymus enlargement may result from thymic hyperplasia or due to accumulation of deposits in certain metabolic and endocrine diseases. Lymphoma and thymoma are two cancers that are known to develop in the thymus.  Certain radiological characteristics would enable your doctor to tell if your condition is less likely to be due to something serious. If still in doubt you can always get a second opinion.  Good luck.\n\n",

Knowing these compounds are now injected into the dermis and will slowly leach into the lymph nodes over time, is the likelyhood that cancer will develope better if the tattoo is left alone or if laser removal breaks down the ink particles for lymphocytes to remove?  I am considering age as a factor (mid 20's) and my logic tells me that the sooner the particles are removed the better but I also understand that degredation of the particles can also release even more toxins.

As such, I really don't have any data to be able to answer your question with any validity.  We don't have long term outcomes from tattoos for the most part so there still may be an increased risk many years after the tattoo was done but I don't anticipate it to be very significant.  So, probably the best way to answer your question is to say that from what we know now it should be safe to have it lasered if you choose (or just leave it if you choose).  Best wishes.

    "content": "Hello,  A swelling can be easier diagnosed if any associated symptoms exist.  It could be a lipoma that tends to occur in some people in certain body areas. Lipomas are usually soft swelling, painless unless infected; and freely mobile. Lipomas are painful when they get infected or when they are big enough to cause compression on underneath neurovascular structures.  I am not sure from the exact anatomical location of this swelling but according to your description, it could be also a lymph node enlargement due to a previous infection or inflammation in the area drained by this group of lymph node.  The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, i.e., laterally).   The inguinal lymph nodes drain the vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, and lower anal canal.   Tenderness and pain means an associated inflammation and infection or possibly a compression over a neurovascular structure passing below this swelling.   The size of your swelling is considerable and warrants direct clinical examination.  In any case clinical examination is very essential for differential diagnosis. Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

They might be enlarged as a reactionary process to infection in the area drained by this lymph node group.   Of significance, an increase in nodal size on serial examinations. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size after infection control tend to be more reassuring. Regarding the breast mass, it could be a form of benign swelling like in cases of fibroadenosis which is also associated with axillary lymph node enlargement.  I advise you to follow with your doctor and to repeat mammography examination and sonography for confirmation of the nature of this swelling if necessary.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I noticed a large hard painless lump in right groin 8 days ago. 2 days ago it started to get larger. I tried to shave over it because I was trying to get an appointment with my doctor. Now a small area in the center of the lump is reddened, soft, and painful but the larger area is still hard and painless. I have had 2 ingrown hairs in the past. This bump doesn't have a center entry for a hair. I'm not sure if it is just getting irritated because it has gotten so large that it rubs against my leg and clothing, or if it is something I need to worry about. The whole lump is approximately 3 centimeters wide and 7centimeters long. The irritated portion is on top of the lump and soft and I can still feel the hard area underneath it. My doctors appointment is not until May 24 and I'm not sure if there is any urgency to try and get in sooner. Any advice is appreciated.\n\n",

Typically if it were associated with the muscle it would also move with the muscle.    A lipoma is also possible.  These are fat cell tumors that are generally harmless.  They don't usually feel very hard.  They are usually more rubbery feeling.  A third possibility is that you have a large lymph node that has become fibrous and scarred preventing it from shrinking.  The next time you're in for a well check up have your doctor take a look at it.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm not familiar with the instant noodles containing wax.  They may contain a substance to help them not stick to each other.  It is very difficult to determine if foods such as this increase the risk of cancer.  This reminds me of a study done some time ago that showed that hot dogs cause leukemia.  The study was done by asking 100 families that have children without cancer and 100 families with children that do have cancer how often their children ate hot dogs.  Subsequently the statistics showed that the children with leukemia ate hot dogs more often.  The study was actually designed to show that there is a recall bias in these studies.  The cancer families mistakenly begin to think the hot dogs may cause cancer so they remember all the times the children ate hot dogs.  The non-cancer families did not make this connection and were less thorough in their remembering of how often the children had hot dogs.  To summarize a long answer, I am generally not convinced by statements like this until there is solid evidence to support such a claim.    None-the-less, eating healthy is important to helping prevent cancer.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I am happy to announce that so far, with the exception of the ultra sound of his spleen the rest of his tests were all normal.  His ultra sound showed 6 solid nodules on the spleen.  The next step is to see if an interventional radiologist can biopsy a lymph node behind his pancreas which is at 1 1/2 centimeters.  If not or maybe anyway they will take his spleen to get to the bottom of this.  Needless to say, we keep praying for good results.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 23 year old female with no serious medical history or surgeries to speak of. For the past 6-7 weeks I have had a swollen lymph node on the left side of my neck about an inch under my chin. It is not visibly noticable but feels smooth and rubbery when touched, is bean shaped and about 2cm in size. It moves around when I touch it. It is not painful but I'm very 'aware' of it and the left side of my neck aches. I went to see my doctor when I first noticed it, he said I had a viral infection and it would go away on its own, even though I had no other real signs of infection eg. sore throat, aches etc. 7 weeks later and it is still there, although it hasn't got any bigger it is still causing discomfort and I have also noticed the appearance of a small hard flat mass right under my left ear (the same side as the swollen node). I have been to see another doctor to get a second opinion who told me she couldn't feel anything abnormal and that glands sometimes stay swollen for a long time after infection. I have had a blood test and this came back normal. I am frustrated as I still have no answer or diagnosis and neither doctor I have seen seems to be concerned about my this. Please could you suggest what this may be caused by and if I should push for further tests to set my mind at rest. Thanks!\n\n",

Your description is quite consistent with reactive lymph nodes.  Typically, these lymph nodes are mobile and rubbery feeling.  If the node continues to enlarge and becomes painful it may have a bacterial infection within the node.  This condition may require antibiotics to improve.  A little pain may be associated with the original infection but the pain should not persist.  If you have seen your doctor who does not feel there is an infection there it is likely that your lymph node should begin to improve soon.

Because of WAGR she has risk for renal failure, so they decided to start chemo, shrink the tumor and save as much of her kidney as possible. Luckily we knew to watch for the tumor and it was found small (12 cm) They did not want to biopsy because of risk of it spreading or upstaging the tumor. They told me they were 99.9% sure it was Cancer. She had 5 treatments of Vincristine and Dactinomycin. The first week of February she had the tumor and a third of her kidney removed. They told me the tumor needed to be sent to Europe for pathology because they were familiar with working with tumors that had already been treated by chemo. They told me it would not take longer then 2 weeks to get the pathology reports. To find out the stage, risk level, and if the chemo had any effect on on it. My daughter started chemo the following week and has had 8 more treatments over the past two months.  A week after surgery they called me into the office and explained that they needed my consent for pathology and that they forgot to get it pre-op.  Two weeks later I had heard nothing and started calling concerned. Four weeks after surgery I went in to their office concerned and was told not to worry and was treated as if I was stupid for coming into clinic concerned.  I started calling weekly and was treated so horribly like I was an ignorant person who shouldn't question them. At 7 1/2 weeks after surgery the nurse called and asked me to come in the following week. I told her that I was worried and had been joking with friends that they had \"lost\" the tumor. She told me that \"that's what we are concerned about\" and hung up with me. Last Monday I went in as they had asked and the doctor came in first. He explained to  me that after looking for it the previous week the realized that it had never left the hospital after surgery and that they had just then sent it to Europe for pathology. I was furious and asked who I should direct my complaints and anger to and he said that it was now a finger pointing game between his nurse and pathology who claims they have been trying to reach her for 8 weeks looking for paperwork.  He told me to wait 6 weeks to come back and see them.  I also want to add that at the first appointment with her doctor I asked for a second opinion from a doctor named Dr. Doem who has worked on many WAGR/WILM's cases. He told me I did not need one and he would not get one. I wanted to change doctors, simply because of how mean and rude he and his staff are, but they told me she needed treatment by that week, so I didn't have time to get a new doctor.  I have been treated as if I am ignorant whenever I ask question and most questions are simply ignored. I put my ill feelings about their bed-side manner aside and figured as long as they were on top of her health and educated that the way I was treated didn't matter. At this point I don't want them working with my daughter. I don't trust a word they have told me.  I have gone on and on and yet still left so much out. Basically,  I am hoping someone out their knows 1. where I can complain. ( I contacted the hospital and was treated like crap once again) 2. what my rights are. 3. how common this is. 4. if the tumor is still able to be looked at after 9 weeks. 5. and any other advise  Thanks so much, eb\n\n",

    "content": "Dear eb, I feel for your distress, frustration and fear for your daughter, and for the perceptions you have that the hospital is willfully either withholding information from you or is deliberately unhelpful to addressing your concerns.  I assume from comments in your post that you may be referring to a hospital on the continental US, and if so it is highly probable that this hospital is JCAHO accredited.      jointcommission.org/GeneralPublic/Complaint/     is the professional site for the Joint Commission for the accreditation of hospital organizations, and openly solicits complaints about the standards of care in any of their accredited hospitals. I encourage you to explore their site and see about contacting them about your concerns.  I can also appreciate your fear of trying to establish new relationships with a different doctor regarding your child, but check with your insurance company about a second opinion they may authorize that may open doors for you with a different professional provider.  I choose to believe that with these options, you may find the level of care you wish and expect for your child.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a reasonably healthy 33 year old female.  I am overweight, but recently (January) had a basic physical and everything checked out well.   I have been experiencing for the past month or so, facial flushing.  It happens several times a week, and usually once daily.  In the afternoon, not exercising, my face will begin to feel very hot and somewhat tingly and itchy.  It is all over my face and forehead.  My skin is warm to the touch, and turns pink.  I wouldn't say bright red.  This feeling can last for hours, and usually does.  I have no other symptoms, but have researched on the internet, and keep coming up with serious diseases with facial flushing as a symptom.  (Carcinoid, mastocytosis, neuroblastoma, etc - with Carcinoid being my first concern)  Like I said, I have no other symptoms.    Can someone give me some insight?  I have called my dr office, but cannot be seen for this for several weeks... in the meantime, I'm a little nervous.    Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Please specify your age, sex and medical history as indicated in the forum rules.  The first step is to establish that your complaint is indeed hemoptysis. This is defined as coughing blood or spitting blood that originates in the lung or bronchial tubes. This can usually be established both clinically and by way of a sputum analysis. In some cases it may be less obvious and may require endoscopy to rule out GIT origin.  Once true hemoptysis is suspected investigations will tend to focus on the respiratory tract. The presence of cough favors lower respiratory tract disease whereas its absence favors upper respiratory tract disease. Spitting clear blood favors an upper respiratory source but does not exclude lower respiratory tract sources especially if the bleeding is brisk.  Are you a smoker? Are you taking any blood thinners? These are some of the risk factors that should be excluded. It is common for smokers to have mild hemoptysis recurring over a prolonged period of time. Environmental exposures to certain chemicals puts you at risk of other types of lung disease including cancer. A history of recent travel to an area in which TB or parasitic diseases are endemic is another point to be considered.  Examination should also include examination of lymph nodes in the neck. After a careful examination a chest x-ray is ordered. If the x-ray findings are not clear or fails to help reach a diagnosis then a CT scan and a bronchoscopy is in order. This is especially true in cases that are at high risk of malignancy. This includes patients that are over 40 years of age, male, heavy smokers (over 40 pack years) and those with a frequency of more than one attack of hemoptysis a week.  A proper evaluation will also include lab tests and a blood coagulation profile.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This is really a very special situation that needs alot of information to reach a close answer.  The technetium 99 given in thyroid scan is used in a very low dose that should not harm the body when distributed by the blood during the scan.   It takes few days till the body get rid off the substances and the most important precaution is too clean the toilets well after micturition as it is excreted in urine.  If subcutaneous injection would harm her or not, I do not have a clear answer. As It is not reported however, this may depend on the amount injected.   It is for sure will result in slow absorption of the technetium which means longer period of exposure and excretion from the body.  I would advise you to discuss that also with her doctor who recommended the test.  She will have a focus of over activity at the site of injection in her scan results, which will give your Doctor a better idea about how much injected and how much is retained.  Best regards.\n\n",

Sometimes, following infection, Lymph nodes remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection (hard, fixed, increasing progressively in size). These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.    Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are significant and those that regress in size and become stable, tend to be more reassuring.   It would be more helpful if you can inform us about the blood tests that are done and their results including the thyroid function tests.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.   Keep us updated.

In such cases follow up with your Doctor and serial examination is advisable.  If there is any increase in the size , change in the consistency of the lymph nodes, generalized fatigue, fever, loss of weight etc, you should inform your Doctor immediately and repeat all the blood tests and include LDH in the next exam.  I advise you to follow up with your Doctor. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 y/o female. I have had my appendix removed. My first cousin has lukemia, my grandfather diabetes, otherwise family medical history is ok.   I have been having pain in my side for about two weeks, about two inches down from my left breast on top of my ribs. I thought it might be a bruise or something but there was no sign of bruising.  It has continued to ache of and on.  Two days ago i noticed there are some small broken blood vessels around the area that hurts there is also now a lump that is about 3inches long and as wide as an earth worm on top of my rib cage. I went to the er last night because it is impossible to get a drs. apt(military health care) and was diagnosed as muscular skelatol strain or something, basically a pulled muscle.  Although I have not been doing anything to pull a muscle and the pain just started out of nowhere one night.  Also pulled muscles are most common in legs arms and back and this is on top of my rib cage.  It hurts all the time not terribly bad but a constant pain.  and tylenol and ib profen don't seem to make the pain go away.  i have been really tired lately, more then nomral.  It seems rather odd to have such a weird shape lump, feels like a big vein or a worm like lump, even the doctor was like, i have never felt anything quite like that before.  Just wondering if I should worry about it, or how long should I wait before i demand further investigation. thanks. Rhiannon\n\n",

Also now there is some swelling not just in the area with the lump but also towards the front top of my left rib cage just before the ribs connect to the chest bone.  Just swollen on that side.  Also I have been having sharp pains, shooting pains in the area with the lump but they go through my left brest.  Also the lump is kind of lumpy? And extremely painful to the touch or pressure, like if i lay on my left side it is uncomfortable. But when i am walking or sitting it is less uncofortable like a gass feeling. Except when the sharp pains happen. I work for a couple of nurses and they said the lump feels really strange and the doctor I saw said he had never felt anything quite like it.\n\n",

    "title": "Please help.  Symptoms making me scared.",
    "content": "I am a 37 year old male.  I am a lifetime non-drinker & smoker.  Up to the age of 34, I was considered very athletic, weightlifing  & cardio 6 to 7 times per week as well as playing hockey.  The last 3 years I have let it all slide from one excuse to the next.  I went from being 6'1 203lbs & 10% BF. to currently sitting at 250lbs and god knows what my fat percentage is now, but I would guess 25 - 30%.  Around 4 months ago, I noticed discomfort in both of my armpits, but more in my right.  At first, I thought nothing of it as I had changed armpit deodorant brands.  I switched back and I thought things had got better but over the last month, I have really noticed them.  They are not painful to the touch, but if I rub them, they definitely feel tender.  However, if I press firmly on the area, I can get them to create a mild pain.  As well, around 1 month ago, I experienced a tightness in my chest.  After reading sites on the web, I was panicking that I might be having a heart problem.  Went in to the doctor where they took blood and did an EKG exam on me.  Results were good.  Doctor was convinced that I had Chest Wall Pain and no cardiac issues.  Still to this day, I notice tightness in the middle of my chest, but definitely not to the extent of the first night.  The last week, I have felt a litlle lightheaded at times.  My blood pressure was a little high at the time of diagnosis, but I thought low blood pressure could cause this.  And now because I am terrified that something is wrong, I find myself checking myself every spare moment.  With this I have noticed certain parts on both sides of my chest near the nipple area to be slightly painful if I apply pressure.  I also have this sensation on a  certain position on both sides of my ribs.  On top of that I noticed my right arm seems to feel numb at times, sometimes in the shoulder and then sometimes in the forearm area.  Am I going nuts?  I have never had any ailment of any serious nature before in my life.  I am terrified that my last 3 years of laziness has created potential issues with my health.  I don't believe I have any lumps (although I thought I might have felt something in my right chest).  As well, when I lift up my arms, I cannot tell if my lymph nodes are swollen, as they look normal to me and I don't know if this would be obvious or not.  But they are very tender.  I don't know if I am becoming a hypochondriac or if something is going on here.  As well, when I search the internet, it seems the only thing that I can find that causes armpit pain is due to some sort of infection or the \"C\" word.  I am truly petrified at this moment.  Do you have any advice or something that could help ease my mind until my doctor's appointment.  As you are probablty aware, when one searches the internet for answers, symptoms can be the same for 20 different ailments.  And to make matters worse, I can't find any stories that sound similar to mine.  Any help would be extremely grateful.  Regards,  Trevor\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Trevor,  Your symptoms do not sound to alarming, especially if your Doctor confirmed a good EKG, And a normal Blood Panel screen. If your Blood panel screen showed no elevation or abnormal levels  of your white/red cell count, you should not be too concerned that your symptoms are Cancer related.  The tightness in your chest and numbness you are experiencing could be symptoms created by anxiety attacks, if the EKG ruled out any Heart Problems.   Perhaps talking to your Primary physcian about medication to releive your anxiety associated to your health concerns, could improve your condition.  I am concerned that you relatively did a 360 on your exercise regime, you have to understand that you conditioned your body over a period of time to function at a higher cardiovascular level, and that your body learned to adapt to perform your physcial and mental performance on a continues regime, you cannot expect your body to just \"Quit\" what it has been conditioned to provide to you. With such a change in excercise your body can be subject to withdrawls causing physcial discomfort.  For as long as it took your body to achieve your desired physcial/cardiovascular conditon, it takes just as long to condition (wean) your body from requiring such demands.  Dr. Anderson\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 52 year old cauc. male.  Diagnosed as diabetic type 2 several months ago, I began a very strict diet, daily vigorous exercise, and weight loss going from 250 pounds to 175 pounds. Recent A1c and glucose tolerance tests now in normal range.  Having lost significant weight, I became aware of a hard mass over xiphoid area and in costal margin - I am not mistaking this for a \"normal\" protrusion - it is hard, fixed, lump about 1 inch in diameter.  There is no pain, no pain on palpitation of it, no skin irritation or redness or other swelling, nor history of injury/trauma to this area.  I had a routine chest xray in June 2006 and this was not mentioned in the report.  I had lumbar surgery in Sept 2006 (my second) and an anterior cervical disectomy in 2002.  Current daily medications are 50 mg Cozaar, 145 mg Tricor, 40 mg Zocor, 37.5 Effexor, 1000 IU Vitamin D, Multi-vitamin, 4800 mg Omega-3.   BP, Cholesterol all under excellent control.  Overall health very good since weight loss and daily vigorous exercise. Recent colonoscopy normal, family history of breast cancer in mother and maternal grandmother.  This lump is not in soft breast tissue however but is in costal angle near or covering xiphoid.  Do I need biopsy?  Will see my internist in 2 weeks and was wondering before then what it might be.  I am not excessively worried about it, but?\n\n",

The next step is for your internist to examine it and if it is hard and fixed as you say, he'll see if it is lying on a rib or not (that's to say if it is bony in origin or not) will either do a CT scan of the chest followed by a simple needle biopsy or the other way around. Your internist will determine which to start with,according to clinical examination.  And by the way LDH is not HDL....and has got nothing to do with your lipid profile...It is an enzyme in the body gives us an idea about certain inflammations that are going on especially with the lymph nodes.  Best of luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   It would be more helpful if you can inform us more about the characters of this swelling like size, if painful, tender, etc.  Is there any  history of scalp infected lesions, Ear, Throat, skin infection in the area drained by these nodes? Or did you notice this swelling following any attack of viral infection. Did you notice any other swellings in other parts of the body? Is there any fever.  The swelling you have described that is felt on the upper side of the neck is probably enlarged Lymph nodes as it occurs in a Lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.   Abnormal Lymph node enlargement commonly results from infection / immune response, cancer.   Following infection Lymph nodes become enlarged, painful and tender. When infections resolve, the lymph nodes become smaller in size but remain palpable and never go to normal size.  Direct clinical examination is essential to exclude other causes like abscess, lymphoma etc.   Keep us updated.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  A person's increased risk of contracting disease is directly proportional to the length of time that a person continues to smoke as well as the amount smoked.   For example, the risk for lung cancer that results from smoking cigarettes is quantified in \u201cpack-years.\u201d One in seven people who smoke more than two packs per day die from lung cancer. The incidence of death from lung cancer starts increasing above the incidence from the nonsmoking population at 10 pack-years.   However, if someone stops smoking, then these chances gradually decrease as the damage to their body is repaired. This approaches, but does not quite reach, that of nonsmokers after 15 years of abstinence for those who smoked for less than 20 years.  Another thing is that cancer is made up of individual cancer cells. For cancer to develop into a clinically apparant cancer it has to have been present for months if not years in some conditions.  So the simple answer is no that's not possible.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, My name is Dr. Tamer Fouad. I am a medical oncologist and I have treated gastric cancer patients but not specifically those with linitis plastica.  Let me try to explain a bit about this diagnosis:  Adenocarcinoma of the stomach is the most common type of cancer of the stomach. It is classified according to microscopic criteria. Classification is based on the most unfavorable microscopic element present, which are, in order of increasing danger, tubular, papillary, mucinous, or signet-ring cells, and undifferentiated lesions.   Pathology specimens also are classified by gross appearance (non-microscopic outer appearance). In general, researchers consider gastric cancers ulcerative, polypoid, scirrhous (ie, diffuse linitis plastica), superficial spreading, multicentric, or Barrett ectopic adenocarcinoma.  Scirrhous carcinoma (linitis plastica) is a poorly differentiated mixture of mucin-producing carcinoma cells that infiltrates the muscle wall and turns it into rigid, leatherlike scar tissue that cannot stretch or move during the normal digestive process (peristalsis).  Researchers also employ a variety of other classification schemes.   The Borrmann system has 5 categories: type I tumors are polypoid or fungating; type II are ulcerating lesions surrounded by elevated borders; type III have ulceration with invasion of the gastric wall; type IV are diffusely infiltrating (ie, linitis plastica); and type V cannot be classified.   Another classification system, the Lauren system, classifies gastric cancer pathology as either an epidemic form or an endemic form. An appealing feature of classifying patients according to the Lauren system is that the descriptive pathologic entities have clinically relevant differences. The intestinal, expansive, epidemic-type gastric cancer is associated with chronic atrophic gastritis, retained glandular structure, little invasiveness, and a sharp margin. This type also is classified as Borrmann I or II.   The pathologic presentation classified as epidemic by the Lauren system or Borrmann I or II is associated with most environmental risk factors, carries a better prognosis, and shows no familial history.   From the pathological classifications it becomes apparent that linitis plastica carries a worse prognosis than some of the more common subtypes. That said however the most important prognostic factor would resectability, if the cancer is still at the stage when it can be removed surgically this carries the best prognosis. If however, it can't be removed then the options for chemotherapy are rather limited. Depending on his performance and the details of his case chemotherapy may be of use.  I would like to refer you to this forum for posts related to linitis plastica. Click here!.  Best of luck!\n\n",

I'm sorryto hear that How old is he?  I was diagnosed with Linits Plastica in April at age 54. I went for help when I was experienceing troubke swollowing.  I am being treated at Memorial Slaon Kettering in New York. Both my surgeon, Dr Jacqus and Oncologist, Dr Ilson have seen and treated Linits Plastica before. Mine is in the top of the stomac and extends into the esophigas. I am getting Chemo now, possable gastrectomy to follow. I think the fact that it goes slighly above the EG joint makes it tuffer to opperate  While gastric cancer is the no 2 killer world wide there were only about 22K-24K cases of it in the US last year, some number like that, Linits Plastica is the rarest form of the cancer  I've had endoscopy, endoscoy with ultra sound, CAT san, PET scan and a laporoscopy hasn't perforated my stomach and my liver seems OK.. I hav another endoscopy next week.  Try and find a surgeon that has operated on this and knows how to deal with it. You can try contacting MSKCC and maybe they can give you a referal to someone in your area\n\n",

    "content": "Hi kdsjager, PET Scans, or PET Imaging is a valuable diagnostic study used to identify certain disease processes prior to actual anatomical changes in body undetectable by other imaging studies. Generally speaking, this study may be used in combination with other diagnostics, ie., CT scan, MRI, etc. Although some of the symptoms in which you are exhibiting may be caused by a variety of disorders, I would be in agreement with your PCP in questioning a malignant process. For anyone to state, he told me \"I had symptoms of cancer, but was too young to get it\" is absolutely incorrect as certain types of malignancies have more of a prevalence in particular age groups. For example, Hodgkin's Lymphoma may be encountered more often in a younger age group while Non-Hodgkin's Lymphoma may be encountered more often in an older age group. Taking into consideration, your symptoms, PET Scan results, etc., I would strongly encourage you to take your reports for a second opinion by another physician or a specialist such as an Oncologist for further evaluation. Best wishes and I hope that if your time permits you will consider posting an update. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear slicknik1983,   It is probably a lymph node as it occurs in a lymph node region, however this must be confirmed by your physician.  Palpation is the first step to confirm the presence of a lymph node enlargement. Nodes are generally considered to be normal if they are up to 1 cm in diameter.  The postauricular lymph nodes are located behind the ears. They drain the external auditory meatus, pinna, scalp. Common causes of enlargement include local infection.  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).  Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.  Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  If the swelling is related to the hair line it is possible to be due to infected hair follicle (Folliculitis). Folliculitis lesions are pierced by a hair.  Hope you find this information useful. Do not forget that, here is no replacement to a direct clinical examination.  Only by complete history and physical examination, the correct diagnosis can be reached.   Best regards.\n\n",

In addition to blood tests, complete work up including CT Scans of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to search for any other lesions. If all is negative, then a biopsy from this bone lesion should be taken to define the nature of this lesion. Biopsy can be done at surgery (open biopsy) or percutaneously (closed biopsy) under imaging. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi nursie0423, A monoclonal  means that one single type of cells or its progeny is the responsible of the expanding clones. To the contrary poly clonal means that the expanding clones are derived from heterogeneous types of cells or progeny. When you treat for example tumors arising from single type of cells , monoclonal, the drugs are working on the biological level on a certain set of genetic information that are homogeneous in the whole tumor. In a simple meaning, approaches to treat should be modified according to that fact, since different types of cells respond differently to the same medication. Good luck,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear alanachyanne, The disease is believed to have heredity bases since 20 percent of people suffering from Crohn's disease have a family history (parent, sibling or child) of the same disease. A gene named NOD2/CARD15 was found to be mutated in a good number of people with Crohn's disease and seems to correlate with the course of the disease. People with a brother or sister who has Crohn's disease are at risk 30 times higher than the general population. Genetic counseling might help to screen for the mutated gene, however it will not be of great help to prevent any possible attack of the disease. I advise you to be very careful, meaning that, once, you experience any persistent changes in your Bowel habits or GI disturbances, consult your physician, as the disease is highly treatable with long term remission. Best regards,\n\n",

It would be of great help if you mentioned exactly the pathological data of these removed cysts. Again the fact that the lump you have is painful indicates  that it is inflamed. Being hard is not enough to tell if it is malignant although it is one of the criteria of malignant nodule. It is not possible for even a physician to confirm if a  lump is cancer or not until imaging exams (such as mammography if the mass is in the breast and ultrasound) and FNAC or biopsy are performed.

My GP confirmed that he had generalized lymphadenopathy and referred him back to the oncologist. However, by the time we saw him in September, the swelling had decreased, although still there, but my son was other wise well. The oncologist was reassured by my observation that the swelling had decreased and when he saw him again in December it had decreased again.  Now my son has developed abdominal pain - intermittant but clearly very uncomfortable. I checked under his arms again this evening after not having examined them for a while, and again, the swelling under is right arm is quite a size. It appears bigger now than it has previously (around 3 - 3 1/2cm) and is firm and almost dome shaped. He is otherwise reasonably well. He is due to have his scan and check up again at the end of March. Do I need to be concerned about this enough to get it checked out before then?\n\n",

    "content": "Morning, My boyfriends Grandmother whom I consider my grandma also has just been diagnosed with Lung, Liver, Spleen, and Bone Cancer is in the care of an exceptional team of oncology doctors at Milwaukee Froedert Hospital. Now what the family is planning is just not setteling right woth me. They are planning to move Grandma to Arizona.  But first let me state that she is on Oxygen, she is in alot of pain and, is somewhat confused sometimes.  She is very angry which is expected. She can barely move around because it hurts so bad. Most of her family is here in WI only one son is in Arizona. He is a nurse and would be able to care for her better than anyone else in the family because of the medical background he has but I still think the thought of moving grandma is a bad decision. Chemo is not an option because she i so frail and it would only prolong her life (an educated guess) (said by the doctor) maybe 3 months at the mst. I personally think that she will not make it long seeing as the cancer is so advanced. I believe that the family is deciding from the heart but I also believe that the family is in denial also.   I do not think that the move is a smart thing to do. I think that it would make everything worse not to mention that she will have to go through [u][b]all[/b][/u] the tests that she has already went through with a new team of doctors. Not to mention the doctors would have to assemble a new team of doctors. Please get back to me as soon as possible with your thoughts and I will be sure to share them with the family.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi labreu, I am sure that this must be a difficult ordeal for all of you. Is the family all in agreement with your grandma going to Arizona? If they are, and hospice or palliative care is what is being considered, then essentially there would not be a team of doctors intervening to identify treatment plans, but comfort measures instead. Sometimes at the end of life it is quite difficult for family members to cope with, becomes extremely stressful to say the least. If the other family memebers are in agreement with her going to Arizona, maybe they feel that her son, is in the best position to not only care for her and keep her at the optimal comfort level, but also be the best one to deal with end of life issues. My suggestion to you is sit down and talk with the rest of the family, not only to see how they feel and what their reasons are for allowing this to transpire but to also express your sadness and your reasons why you feel this may not be the best thing for her. Regardless of what the final decision is, to keep her there or allow her son to care for her, you will have had the opportunity to express your opinion (in a respectful way) and they will know that you love her and want what's best for her as well. This may not be the response that you were hoping for, but when a life is succumbed by a  terminal condition it is very difficult indeed. There are no easy, right or wrong answers for everyone as a standard but decisions are tailored on an individual basis and whats best for that particular person. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "where exactly is this at? does it hurt, itch, seep any fluids? the picture isn't very good, it is right in a shadow, but it looks like Tinea Cruris, a fungal infection of the skin in the groin.  The rash of jock itch starts in the groin fold usually on both sides. If the rash advances, it usually advances down the inner thigh. The advancing edge is redder and more raised than areas that have been infected longer. The advancing edge is usually scaly and very easily distinguished or well demarcated. The skin within the border turns a reddish-brown and loses much of its scale. Jock itch caused by T. rubrum does not involve the scrotum or penis. If those areas are involved, the most likely agent is Candida albicans, the same type of yeast that causes vaginal yeast infections.   Jock itch is best treated with topical creams or ointments since the fungus only affects the top layer of skin. Many of the antifungal medications require a prescription, but there are three that can be bought over-the-counter (OTC). The OTC antifungals are tolnaftate (Tinactin), clotrimazole (Lotrimin), and miconazole (Micatin). Creams used to treat jock itch should be applied twice a day for at least two weeks. Application can be stopped after the rash has been gone for one week. Creams should be applied to the rash and also at least two finger widths beyond the rash.\n\n",

    "content": "I am going into see my primary care doctor thursday, but I figured I would see what people on here thought:  I have had swollen lymph nodes in my groin and two very small ones in my neck for the past 2-3 years.  I tried to get the lymph node near my clavicle biopsied but it was too small for the surgeon to get at.   I have had two blood tests over the past couple years that were both very comprehensive...everything came back perfect.  Well I recently had surgery (not related to lymphnodes) and have noticed that the lymph nodes in my groin are quite a bit larger -rubbery and semi-mobile.  I can also feel lymph nodes down the back of my legs, and some small ones near my feet.  The largest is about the size of two peas.  Thats about it - so I continue to have the two small lymph nodes near my clavicle, plus larger ones in the groin and back of the legs.  I feel great, and sleepwell, and have a great appetitte...any ideas here?  If it isnt something serious (ie cancer) what else could it be?   thanks.\n\n",

If this is a question you think another doctor or nurse might be able to answer just let me know.   So, does  the act of smoking marijuana and not cigarettes have links to causing caner?  I smoke out of a water pipe and blunts (a blunt is using a cigar leaf instead of a joint paper).  Does the cigar leaf increase my chances of getting caner?  And does smoking marijuana cause your skin to age quicker in the same respect that smoking cigarettes do?  Thank you for your time.  Sincerely, The Functional Pot Head\n\n",

The term \"small well-differentiated lymphocytes\" just means well developed normal small lymphocytes. Yes if you look up small well differentiated lymphocytes on the internet you will get some malignant diseases such as small lymphocytic lymphoma which could have the same basic cells (ie, normal looking cells) but in such a case they are far from rare. They are so many that they are the reason behind the enlargement of the lymph node and may start even spilling into the blood.  The second phrase just means there are elements from the skin in the specimen.  Please discuss your results with your doctor. He is more aware of your overall case. I do not see any reason to worry.\n\n",

    "content": "Good Morning, I need to be precise here. I am a 37 year old female and almost 3 years ago I had a hysterectomy and they found Cancer in the Uterus. I got over that and have been cancer free since.  However about 7 months ago I found a swolen lymphnode in the back of my neck on the right side. Several blood tests were done and even a needle aspiration was done of the node and nothing. No images ever.  and all I was ever told is that I have a swolen Lymph node.  Heck I could have saved all that money because I already knew that.  I needed to know \"WHY?\" was it swolen. I have almost given up on this but it does bother me sometimes. and recently a couple weeks ago, I got this cough that will not go away kinda productive but not much, more present after laying down, sounds like I have chest congestion but I do not, also feels like there is something in my throat but there is not. This morning when I went to swallow I held on to my throat on the front of my neck and then felt down the esophagus(spelling??) and felt this lump on both sides about half way down the front of the neck. Is this the thyroid gland? I have never felt this before and it is just recently that I happened to find it. You see cancer runs in my family like mad. it is on both sides and almost every kind you can think of.  Please let me know what to ask for so I know what to do when I change hospitals as this one I fought with doctors for 5 years before they did anything about my periods and when I finally found one that would listen I had Cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Abnormal lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Infected Lymph nodes tend to be firm, tender, enlarged and warm. Inflammation can spread to the overlying skin, causing it to appear reddened.   Lymph nodes harboring malignant disease tend to be firm, non-tender, matted (ie, stuck to each other), fixed (ie, not freely mobile but rather stuck down to underlying tissue), and increase in size over time.   Sometimes, following infection lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection. These are also known as 'Shotty Lymph nodes'.  As you can see not every enlarged lymph node is cancer. On the contrary, its more often not.  If you are unsatisfied with your doctors, you could take a second opinion. The neck swelling should be examined by a physician.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,   first of all thank you for taking the time to read my post; I have a medical question regarding potentially harmful effects of strong (electro-) magnetic fields.  I'm thinking of buying, as a present to my brother, a device used for doing magic tricks, called \"The Bat\" (there's also a very similar one called \"M5\"), which relies on the diamagnetic phenomenon to lift (levitate) certain objects, using very strong magnets, -- from what I understand, similar to the magnets sold here: http://www.wondermagnet.com/newmaglev.html -- magnets that are worn on the inside of one's sleeves.  I know strong electro-magnetic fields can increase the risk of cancer (like with prolonged use of cell phones for example), and also I imagine intuitively that such fields (induced by natural magnets or by other technical means) can be harmful in other ways too; on the other hand, I know that certain magnets are used in cancer treatment, and so, since obviously I'm concerned not to do any harm with my present, I would like to ask if there is really any danger involved in using such a strong magnet, close to one's body.  Anticipated thanks for your advice!   Tudor :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi vandelay,  Before talking about Electro Magnetic Fields (EMF) and cancer risk I will like to define some terms. Electric fields are created by differences in voltage: the higher the voltage, the stronger will be the resultant field. Magnetic fields are created when electric current flows: the greater the current, the stronger the magnetic field. An electric field will exist even when there is no current flowing. If current does flow, the strength of the magnetic field will vary with power consumption but the electric field strength will be constant. The term \u201cElectro Magnetic Field\u201d (EMF) usually refers to electric and magnetic fields at extremely low frequencies such as those associated with the use of electric power.   All known cancer-inducing agents, including radiation, certain chemicals and a few viruses, act by breaking chemical bonds, mutating DNA. The nature of the interaction of biological material with an electromagnetic source depends on the frequency of the source. Both electric and magnetic fields are present around appliances and power lines. However, electric fields are easily shielded or weakened by walls and other objects, whereas magnetic fields can pass through buildings, humans, and most other materials. Since magnetic fields are most likely to penetrate the body, they are the component of EMFs that are usually studied in relation to cancer.  Many people fear that EMFs cause cancer; however, a causal connection between EMFs and cancer has not been established. The National Research Council (NRC) spent more than three years reviewing more than 500 scientific studies that had been conducted over a 20-year period and found \"no conclusive and consistent evidence\" that electromagnetic fields harm humans. The research has not shown in any convincing way that electromagnetic fields common in homes can cause health problems, and extensive laboratory tests have not shown that EMFs can damage the cell in a way that is harmful to human health.  Some epidemiology studies have shown an increased risk for childhood leukemia in association with EMF. This association is difficult to interpret in the absence of reproducible laboratory evidence or a scientific explanation that links magnetic fields with childhood leukemia. Overall, there is limited evidence that magnetic fields cause childhood leukemia, and there is inadequate evidence that these magnetic fields cause other cancers in children. Studies of magnetic field exposure from power lines and electric blankets in adults show little evidence of an association with leukemia, brain tumors, or breast cancer. Past studies of occupational magnetic field exposure in adults showed very small increases in leukemia and brain tumors. However, more recent, well-conducted studies have shown inconsistent associations with leukemia, brain tumors, and breast cancer.  The World Health Organization scientists reported that the epidemiological studies \"do not provide sufficient evidence to support an association between extremely-low-frequency magnetic-field exposure and adult cancers, pregnancy outcome, or neurobehavioural disorders.\"  All the above is true for extremely-low-frequency magnetic-field exposure (to which we are habitually exposed).  The magnet you want to buy is a Neodymium permanent magnet. Permanent magnets are made of ferromagnetic materials which have the ability to \"remember\" the magnetic fields they have been subjected to. Neodymium magnets are actually made up of a compound called NIB, for Neodymium Iron Boron (Nd2Fe14B). This compound is one of the strongest known ferromagnetic materials. I have not found any study linking exposure to magnetic-field energy of permanent magnets to cancer. Eventhough, I strongly suggest you to read the Magnet Safety Warnings in the disclaimer\u2019s page of the link you provided (wondermagnets.com). You can see there are serious issues when handling these products (from losing and eye to death).  Hope you find the information useful.  Sincerely, Dr Torax.\n\n",

The test came back high, I repeated it two days later, it was high again.  This particular doctor went to Africa in the middle of this on a mission.  A few months later I went to the emergency because I was very weak, dizzy, just exhausted, and was having a hard time breathing.  I mentioned the d-dimer.  They did a leg scan-nothing found, and a vq scan-nothing found.  The ER doc said I should be fine since I am generally healthy.  Well, last week I went to my doctor because I had not been feeling well.  I've had odd chest pains, and pains in my bones.  He ordered a d-dimer and other blood tests.  The dimer was high, went to emergency, all vq and dvt tests negative, but d-dimer was still high (442)--the range is 0-228.  I am concerned about my blood counts.  They all seem to be borderline.  WBC 4.1, RBC 4.1, HGB 12.5 HCT 36.5 MCV 88 and RDW 15.  PMN @.o, lymph 1.6, MONO .2 EOS .1 and BASO .0.   Platelets are 250k.  I'm just curious about what might be going on.  My mother has acute promyelocytic leukemia, and I am concerned that leukemia is a possibility for me.  I have an appt. to see a Hematologist on 2/1.  If you have any suggestions or comments, I would certainly appreciate your help.  Thank you kindly.  Oh, one more thing I forgot to mention.  I had a baby in September.  She was born 9wks early.  In the evening before she was born I had those terrible chest pains.  I told them at the hospital but they said it was probably nothing, and that they would never know why she went into fetal distress.  Sorry about the lengthy letter.\n\n",

However, unfortunately they may become elevated for many reasons such as recent trauma, infections, fever, blood clots, malignancy etc. and may remain elevated for approximately three months. Since you have been ruled out for a DVT or PE, have you had any of the other above conditions? Any of these conditions may result in an elevated D-dimer. So many things can cause fetal distress that it would be difficult to say specifically at this point. I hope all ended up well with the delivery and your baby is doing well  Taking into consideration your family history I'm glad to hear that you are going to be evaluated by a hematologist which in my opinion is certainly warranted. I hope you keep us posted.  I also hope this information was somewhat useful. Thank you for using http://www.doctorslounge.com Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I think you are justified to be worried and should continue being investigated until either the D-dimer stops increasing or the investigations sufficiently rule out any detectable disease. At this stage if your D-dimer remains high a 'watch and wait' policy may be justified.   The results of your blood test are nonspecific and do not point in a particular direction. Anisocytosis (red blood cells of different size), poikilocytosis (red blood cells of different shape) and ovalocytosis (oval shaped) can be normally present or present with many disease processes.  Causes of reactive lymphocytosis may be: \u00df-Streptococcus, cytomegalovirus, drugs, Epstein-Barr virus (infectious mononucleosis), syphilis, toxoplasmosis, vaccination, and viral hepatitis.   You are doing the right thing by taking it seriously but you must have patience. Like our experienced RN tells us above, since you have been ruled out for a DVT or PE, any of the other conditions which states could be the cause.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I received a call today from the Breast Care Clinic where I had my mammogram last week.  They said that I have an area of concern in my breast, and the mammogram suggests asymmestric density.  When I was 23, (12 years ago), I had a breast biopsy which was bengin.  Each year after that I had a routine mammogram, all of which were normal.  There was never any mention of \"dense breasts\".  I have not, however, been in for a mammogram since 2001.  At my last Hematology appt. the Dr. said that he was perplexed, and didn't know which direction to head in.  I have read in various journals that a high d dimer can be an indication of cancer.  Now I'm super concerned with these latest findings on the mammogram.  I am scheduled next week to have a breast ultrasound.  Do asymmetric density findings usually turn out to be benign?  I know you are busy, but if you have a chance, any reply would be appreciated.  I am very thankful for this service that you provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Mrs2U, Normally breast tissue is symmetric (like mirror images) of each other. You mentioned that you had a previous breast biopsy. This wouldn't happen to be the breast that showed an abnormality would it? Mammograms indicate whether a mass may be benign or malignant depending on the shape, margins etc. For instance, if a mass is identified on a mammogram and is oval or round that's usually an indication that they it is benign. Irregularity in shape would be suspicious of malignancy. When the person reading the mammogram is unable to determine the shape or borders of a suspicious area, or because women do sometimes have dense breast tissue due to their age (symmetrically so) an ultrasound is used to establish if the tissue is normal or if a suspected mass is solid or cystic (fluid filled) in nature. If it is cystic a sort of watch and wait approach is taken. If it is solid then the shape and borders are closely evaluated. Taking into consideration that you have had mammograms for many years and this \"new\" present finding is likely the reason for concern. Asymmetry is always a reason for further evaluation.  I am relieved to hear that further evaluative studies are being done due to your elevations in the D-dimer. I hope you will update with the progress and results. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

There are a number of benign breast changes which can show up as densities on mammo.  Have you had a mammogram before?  The wording that it is a \"developing\" density seems to indicate that it was not present there before.  Is this the case?  Either way, this is definitely something that you should be concerned about.  The best way to approach this would be to get an excisional biopsy of the density which will absolutely rule in or rule out cancer.  I hope this turns out to be nothing.\n\n",

    "content": "I had compression films and ultrasound to further evaluate the possible nodular density seen on the initial mammogram.  The radiology report reads as follows:  \"Aiidional films today suggest that the asymmetric density is likely glandular.  Nothing is localized on the lateral or oblique view today.  High resolution ultrasound scanning centrally from 6-12'o'clock in the left breast demonstrates multiple small scattered cysts at 6 0'clock, the largest measuring 7mm.  No solid mass or abnormal area of acoustical shadowing.  The patchy fibrocystic change could contribute to the apearance on the cradiocaudal view.  Short-term follow up in four month with sonogram is recommended to ensure stability\"  The Hematologist that I was referred to said that he didn't know what to do with my case.  (I'm referring to the elevated d-dimer levels from my prior posts).  He said that he was not aware of isolated dimer cases as mine.  He told me that the mild neutropenia would probably go away, and that I should be, in his words, \"ok\".  Do you think it would be acceptable to ask my primary doctor to a)monitor my blood to check on the neutropenia and other abnormal levels indicated, b)get a second opinion about the mammo c)seek-out a hematologist at the University near my home that could pursue the source of this dimer issue?  I am feeling increasingly tired.  I'm just exhausted, and this is very atypical for me!  The swelling in my left hip area is also increasing.  I showed it to my doctor and he agreed it was swollen and was concerned about a dislocation or something of that sort.  I had an xray, which proved to be fine.  My groin in the area below the hip is swollen.  Ironically, this is all on the same side as my breast, which worries. me.  Sorry about the novel-length explanation. I can't thank you enough for your help!\n\n",

Nonetheless, I can tell you most skin or subcutaneous (fatty tissue under the skin) lumps are benign. Most common subcutaneous tumors are lipomas and epidermoid or sebaceous cyst.  Lipomas are benign fatty tumors, probably the most common ones in the entire body, and are more frequent in women.  A sebaseous cyst is a closed sac found just under the skin containing grayish-white, pasty or cheesy-looking skin secretions; most often arise from swollen hair follicles, but also skin trauma can induce a cyst to form.  Benign tumors are usually slow growing, painless, and freely movable lumps beneath the skin.  You have to see your doctor if the lump gets hard, is fixed, grows fast or hurts.  Sincerely, Dr Torax.\n\n",

My advice to you is that you go back to your physician and ask for further referral to either the same orthopaedic surgeon or for a second opinion.  The fact that you are having symptoms necessitates the need for further investigation. Good luck\n\n",

    "title": "Can chest pain be related to lymphoma?",
    "content": "Hi All, (sorry for the long post but I am trying to give as much information as possible).  I am a 38 year old mail having intermittent chest pain for almost 3 months now.  Let me give you my recent history.  This started 3 months ago with episodes of near syncope and heart palpitations (no pain) for no apparent reason.  It would happen at any time of the day and follow no pattern.  I had several trips to the ER because i thought I was having a heart attack.  They couldn't find anything in the ER and said it was probably stress.  The episodes lasted on average for about 30 seconds to 10-20 minutes.  After about two weeks of these I started having very mild chest pain just to the left of my sternum.  Since then the syncope episodes have all but vanished, but I am having singificantly more chest pain and it seems to be broadening in area to the left side of my chest, and have developed this chronic non productive cough.  It is hard for me to inhale or exhale completely withough coughing and feeling like something is tickling the back of my throat.  I also get fatigued very easily now.  I used to be much more active with sports and such but just don't have the energy.   I have had numerous EKG's, and and Echocardiogram, the only thing they found was slight left atrial dilation.  The valves all worked normally.  My blood pressure is normal, cholesterol and blood sugar tests also came back normal. I was tested for H-Pylori and blood in my stool but both were negative.  I had a CT of the head which was normal.  X-rays of the chest were normal.   I have been in and out of the doctors office at least a dozen times since this started.  They have tried putting me on Prilosec which hasn't helped.  The last visit in the doctors office about a week ago I asked him about the possibility of lung cancer or lymphoma.  He seems to be stuck on thinking it's GI stuff.  I asked isn't there some kind of blood tests they can do to screen for it?  He said a lot of cancers don't have markers they can look for...  I am wondering if he is giving me a brush off or is this true?  I get the feeling they are not taking me seriously.  I am a physical therapist and am somewhat trained to look for red flags in my patients.  Right now I feel I have a few, but because I am fairly athletic and don't smoke or drink,  I don't think the doctors I have seen think anything serious can be wrong with me.  What do you guys feel about this?  What other tests should be done?  I know x-ray is not a gold standard for cance screening..does this sound like GI stuff.   Oh another thing my cough and chest pain used to be better in the AM after sleeping but now it doesn't seem to make much of a difference.  I swear if one more doctor tells me it's anxiety...I'm just kidding, but this has been going on way too long and I am a very relaxed person.  I don't stress too easily. Please educate me Thanks in Advance PPT\n\n",

    "content": "Dear PaulPT,  Ironically,you'd think why a chest pain,fatigue,palpitaion and all your other syptoms should be related to the GIT!? but sometimes it does it you have inflammation ifn the oesophagus for an example(esophagitis) and several other causes.  They can exclude that if they put you on antacids which they did but it hasn't helped. If they are certain about GIT causes they can do an upper endoscopy.  So your Chest X-ray is Absolutely normal? I advice you to have a CT-scan for your chest. Have you visited a Chest Physician? It can be minor asthmatic attacks as well. So he can order some respiratory tests for you,since they've nearly excluded cardia problems.  Keep me updated, Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "I just wanted to give an update.  At this point I have had a lot of tests done, including Cardiac Stress test, a chest CT with contrast, and echocardiogram and I just had an upper endoscopy yesterday.  The stress test was normal, the chest CT was normal, the echo showed a slightly dialated left atrium but otherwise normal heart and valves,  and I am not sure about the endoscopy.  I vaguely remember after the procedure the doctor telling me there were some kind of rings in my esophagus, something like Schwart's rings???  Anyway I was fairly sedated and I can't remember too well, but I know he said they weren't cancer related and I think he said something about they dialated them and stretched them out..maybe???  What I do remember is him saying something about biopsy and he will make an appointment for me in three weeks.  The pulmoonologist suggested a bronchoscopy if endoscopy doesn't show anything.  Interestingly enough my syncope symptoms had pretty much disappeared, chest pain has reduced, and the cough has remained about the same.  However I have had a little bit more chest pain today and for the first time in several months I had a near syncope episode with a racing heart and breaking out in a sweat.  Not sure if it was related to the endoscopy but I would think it's a little more than near coincidence that it's been a long long time since I had an episode and the day after the scope I get one..I dunno  Anyway, I just wanted to keep all informed as a lot of people don't follow up with their posts and we end up without a conclusion.  So I will keep posting until we figure out exactly what is causing these symptoms.\n\n",

    "content": "Update #2  Well I have gotten the results of the endoscopy.  The doctor found I have esphogeal webs and rings, one of them was quite constricted which he enlarged during the endoscopy.  He explained these are something I have had all my life and nobody really understands why people get them.  He is not entirely convinced that my symptoms are from my esophagus however.  He stated there may be some kind of a vasovagal response from the esophagus, but can't reason why these would just start for no apparent reason, and the fact that the reflux meds have not had any effect on my symptoms makes him think there is something other than GI stuff.  He suggested I should get a referral to a cardiologist to further examine my heart.  I am going to contact the pulmonologist and see if he thinks we should go ahead with the bronchoscopy just to be safe.  I figure if nothing else it will be one more test to rule out whatever it can.  So at least it's not looking like any detecable cancer, but still no explination.  I will still keep all informed as I learn more... -PaulPT\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shortcake, it is hard to tell without more information, we need some important details:  -Your age and gender. -Onset of symptoms: like, when did it start bothering you? (or when did you noticed it), and what happened before you stared feeling it? (e.g. piercing your ear, a sore throat, a wound on head or neck). -Lump characteristics: size, mobility (movable, fixed), consistency (soft,  fleshy, firm, rubbery, or matted), and location (which side of the ear?).  As well, when you refer to the \u201clumps that are behind our head on the side near our ears\u201d, you mean the boney part behind the ear where the skull ends and the muscle begins? I think you are talking about the mastoid process of the temporal bone, which forms a larger, superficial bump directly behind the ear lobe.  To rule out the possible causes of your lump it will be very helpful if you send those details.  In advance I can tell you that most lumps in that site are due to infections or benign tumors of soft tissue origin. Behind the ear there is skin, fat, cartilage, bone, nerves, blood vessels, lymph nodes, and salivary gland tissue (a portion of the parotid salivary gland extends behind the ear). A bump can develop from any of those structures, and could be due to a tumor (benign or not), an infection (lymph node or skin), a swollen muscle or salivary gland, etc.  I will be waiting for further information.\n\n",

    "title": "Palpable supraclavicular lymph nodes",
    "content": "39 y/o male. Non-smoker. Discovered 2 palpable, non-tender, moveable lymph nodes above right collarbone July 19.  App. 1cm and <1cm size.  No subsequent change in size.   Other recent symptoms include periodic low back pain and sciatica-like pain, occasional muscle pain in hip and thigh area, chest muscle pain (feels like strain taking time to heal), and some mild fatigue.    Earlier in year (Jan-May) I had experienced wide range of strange symptoms including: leg and arm paresthesias; muscle fasciculations; lower and bilateral side abdominal pains accompanied by gas, bloating, and diarrhea;various myalgias and arthralgias; general fatigue; significant post-exertional fatigue; reduced appetite; and ~ 9% weight loss (probably due to less eating and muscle deconditioning since I was unable to continue weight training for 3 months).  With the exception of the abdominal pains, all these symptoms came on suddenly following an URI.  During that period, my doctors (GP, Neuro, and Gastro) conducted endoscopy, colonoscopy, urine studies, stool studies, 2 CBC with differentials and met panels (4 months apart), chest x-ray, cervical MRI, brain MRI, brain CT, and abdominal ultrsound.  All results normal.  No clear diagnosis.  Doctors speculated post-viral and/or anxiety related complications. From late May until about the time I discovered the nodes, most of these symptoms resolved or dramatically reduced.  I began feeling normal, weight returned, and I re-engaged in most physical and social activities.     MY GP examined me in early August.  He was not alarmed by nodes, did not consider them to be beyond normal size range or indicative of any pathology.  He ordered chest x-ray mostly to reassure me. Films indicated nothing wrong.  No other signs of lymphadenopathy in other body areas.  OveralI, he seemed quite confident that despite location and size of nodes, and other current and previous symptoms, malignancy was unlikely.  Suggested course of action: monitor for couple of months and if any increase in node size...come in to see him immediately.    However, since that time and despite my usual trust in my doctor, I've become increasingly anxious about the nodes and possible malignancy.  I've read that any palpable nodes in collarbone area have a relatively high likelihood of being cancer-related.  ls this a reasonable concern and should I be pursuing additional assessment right now?  If so, any suggestions....biopsy? chest/abdominal CTs? additional blood work?    Thanks for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "About 3 weeks ago I noticed a small, hard, moveable lump on my left forearm about 2 inches below my elbow.  In case you need to know, I am right handed.  One week after discovering the lump I was picking up some sample medication from my OB's PA and asked her to take a look at the lump.  She said that it was probably a group of nerves that were bunched up and told me to massage it often.  She asked if it hut and I told her no because at that time, there was no pain.  Now, a week later, I do have pain.  The pain is kind of like a dull ache that travels down my arm to the base of my hand on the pinky finger side and it is also achy inside my forearm; if that makes any sense.  The lump is the same size still.  There is no redness or anything.  It is under the skin but is visible (raised).  It is not a pimple or anything like that.....it is definitely like a knot under the skin.  I am currently on NuvaRing and Effexor XR and have been taking these for a little over a year, and for 2 months, respectively....incase this makes a difference.  I do not have health insurance at this time and would appreciate any help that you can offer as to what you think this may be.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi tj, lateral neck lumps are usually due to lymph node enlargement. Lymph nodes can become swollen from infection, inflammatory conditions, abscess, or cancer. Other causes of enlarged lymph nodes are rare. By far, the most common cause of swollen lymph nodes is infection. When swelling appears suddenly and is painful, it is usually caused by injury or an infection. Enlargement that comes on gradually and painlessly may result from cancer or a tumor;  soreness in lymph glands usually disappears in a couple of days without treatment, but the nodes may not return to normal size for several weeks after the infection has cleared. You have to call a doctor if the lump don\u2019t get smaller after several weeks or continue to get larger, or if it feels hard, irregular, or fixed in place. I suggest you to get a doctor to perform a physical examination and maybe a biopsy and culture.\n\n",

    "content": "I am 39 year old male who has smoked 2 packs per day for 20 years. I have been very healthy until the last 12 months. During this time I have had a kidney infection. After that cleared up I began having stomach problems and after an endoscopy was diagnosed with an ulcer and hiatal hernia. A second endoscopy showed the ulcer to be healed but gastritis and esophagitis were still present. Recently have had diarrhea,bloating,  and cramping in lower abdomen and am being treated for Irritable bowel syndrome. Also recently had enlarged lymph nodes in armpits and chest which doctor said was due to a fungal infection of skin on chest and armpits. My throat is sore alot and joints feel achy. I am afraid that I may have cancer. I am unisured and do not know if all the right tests are being done. I can't understand why all these things are suddenly happening to me and worry that I am not getting proper treatment. Can someone answer some questions.\n\n",

    "content": "About two and a half years ago I found a lump right below my elbow. If you lay your arm down, palm down, it would be right there on top, right below the crease of the elbow. Wasn't huge, not very noticeable. Just noticeable enough for the doc I went to to also notice it had a different feel, and sent me for more tests. X-rays, big tunnel machine (can never remember the name of that) the whole nine yards, and found nothing. Chalked it up to bursitis, and said I would be fine. It just might bother me now and then. Recently I have noticed that the lump has about tripled in size since then. Very noticeable now, and there is another lump covering the bottom of my arm starts about an inch above my wrist, and goes up about three inches. Also very noticeable.  Now it still doesn't give me much trouble. Aches now and then, and once in a great while, my fingers will tingle a bit, or a sharp pain will shoot down my lower arm, but other then that, nothing. More achey than anything. No big deal, but it has me worried since I know having your arm grow like this can't be normal.  It is my right arm and I am right handed...Is there anyway that I am just blowing this out of proportion, and it is just muscle from using this hand all the time?\n\n",

It's a little firm but is not hard, almost feels  like you could flatten it out by pushing on it hard enough.  But of course, that doesn't make it go away.  It reminds me a bit of a ganglion cyst my daughter had.  What could this be?  Thanks!!\n\n",

    "content": "About eight years ago when i was at the doctor, i pointed out a small pea sized lump in my left forearm, the doctor told me it was probably just fatty tissue and not to be concerned.  Lately, i have been having some aching in that arm, my fingertips go numb and the lump has tripled in size.  I have also located 3 other lumps close to the original lump.  There are no lumps in my right arm.  Yesterday, my left forearm began itching insanely.  I have literally itched my arm raw.  I know that there are no lymph nodes in your forearm so the likelihood of these being malignant is not very high.  But i am still very concerned and quite frankly uncomfortable with them.  I hate going to the doctor, but i guess i will have to buckle down and just do it.  Just wanted to know if anyone had any ideas about this?  Thanks.\n\n",

I had no other symptoms. I went to the doctor, who did remove it surgicially and performed a biopsy . Turns out, I had cat scratch fever.  I do have cats, so i guess it made sence. I was suposed to take antibiotics for 3 months but I did not have insurance, and since I didnt feel bad, I never filled the perscription. I never had any more lumps after they removed that one.  The doctor told me that generally speaking, unmovable lumps are usually not dangerous, but he removed it to biopsy to be safe.\n\n",

Had a mammogram and u/s that showed nothing but a area that is probably a cyst and did not show the lump that I found. Since then I have been remembering every lumpy area I've ever had that have been there for years and worrying and obsessing about them. I had some of them checked out and the Dr said they were nothing but now I remembered a lumpy swollen area in my arm near my elbow that I have had for awhile and Friday I palpated and pushed on the area till it swelled up and was much more visible but even though its back to where it was , its still larger and my whole arm aches. I am so scared that this lump is related to the lump in my armpit since its the same arm and that the pain is cancer related. I can't get this out of my head. I am going to dr wednesday to have her look at it but i have a feeling im getting a label of someone who goes to dr for every little lump bump ache and pain and i don't want that. any idea what all this could be about and how do i calm myself from this horrible anxiety. i have an appt with a counselor as well   thank you\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,      About 4-5 months ago I noticed a lump about midway between my anus and the top of my butt crack (excuse the detail I give), but didn't think anything of it due to I mentioned it to one of my friends and he said that he had the same thing one time and just stabbed it with a thumbtack (why he chose a thumbtack I don't know...) and it just went away.  It felt like it was about a half inch in diameter and kind of hard.  I thought maybe it was a cyst or something and assumed it would just go away...unfortunately that wasn't the case.  It hasn't really progressed as far as getting huge, but it did increase in size; aboout a half inch.  It feels like it's about a half inch under the skin so I didn't mess with it for fear I would pop it inside of the skin.  Well, about a month ago I was lying in bed when I noticed it had become inflamed and grown to about an inch and a half.  Well again one night I was lying in bed and started to squeeze it a little (which I now regret) and I'm almost 100% sure it popped because for one it felt like it, two because it had shrank dramatically.  The next day I noticed it had went back down to the size before it had become inflamed and was about an inch, but I also noticed the there seemed to be what felt like a vein or something semi around it that hurt when pressure was applied, which scared me, but I just left it alone for fear I would make it worst.  After about a month (which is present day) there doesn't seem to be so much as a lump anymore, but what feels like maybe a remnant of what was there, but about a day or two ago I noticed a scab at the end of what seemed to be earlier a \"Vein\".  There doesn't seem to be any puss or anything come from it, but I don't know why a scab would just appear where a wound has not been created.  It doesn't hurt anymore, but it's making me nervous.  If there's anyone who's had the same or similar problem and have gotten advice or a cure or something it would be greatly appreciated if you would inform me.  Sorry for the length of this, but it's been going on for so long I just had to try and find out what the problem was.\n\n",

    "content": "I had a CT scan today for stomach issues.  When the Dr called with the results he said that aside from the hernia they found, the radiologist found a 4mm lump on my lymphnode on or behind my esophagus near the diaphragm.  I don't know the first thing about lymph nodes or what they do.  He has recommended that I get an MRI to \"check it out further\" although he assured me that it may just be a cyst, it may be nothing or it might be something.  Thats what I am curious about.  I don't know what lymphnodes do and what types of \"things\" that can grow on them IE-could this be cancerous or is it most likely just a cyst or is this a common normal occurance?\n\n",

I've been given Nexium tho, and take that twice a day for about two weeks now.  I'm supposed to have an endoiscopy Monday.  Which should be interesting because until recently the pain was under the sternum but down and to the right about 4\" - I started taking advil daily and it nearly went away, but is now back - but lower and more towards the side of my ribs.  I wonder about my ascending colon, because it's right there and is one of the few things that hasn't been looked at.  But I asked about gastrinoma because the symptoms seem similar, and my liver is so nearby the pain... but I also just started taking Bactrim, (UTI) and wonder if that's doing something.   It's all very frustating, scary,, annoying, and exausting all at the same time.\n\n",

If the clinical examination suggests that a lymph node enlargement is a benign condition then follow up for 2 weeks to 1 month is warranted. During this period any change in size or new symptoms should be reported immediately. The next step would be a CT scan of the head and neck. A biopsy of the node is only done as a very last resort as it has serious drawbacks on therapy if it does turn out to be a cancer.\n\n",

At the time the tests were done, it was a very stressful time for her, the both of us a just recently married, she had a school competing in World championships, and had just returned from the UK on business.

    "content": "Hello Steven, An elevated white cell count could mean almost anything from a benign transient reaction to an infection or the more alarming conditions which you have read about (leukemias). Your doctor is correct to order a differential count as this will usually differentiate between the range of conditions mentioned above. 13,000 is not alarmingly high though. So I would not worry too much until the results of the differential come out. Leukemias as well as many other myeloproliferative disorders the total leukocytic counts are above 20,000 (commonly above 30,000) at the time of diagnosis. Let me know how everything turns out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi MNB1202, Transvaginal Ultrasounds or sonograms enable the radiologist to have a closer look at the pelvic structures (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, and cervix). It may identify uterine fibroids, ovarian cysts, fertility concerns, etc. etc. It would be difficult to say why in particular your physician ordered this test without knowing if there were any concerns voiced at your appointment. If nothing abnormal was indicated during your appointment it may be to evaluate for fertility concerns. You may want to give the physician a telephone call and ask why in particular this test was ordered for an explaination. Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "I have been sick for a while now. Very fatigued with nausea more often than not with incredible back pain. I have been scoped in every possible place & have had a Ct scan which showed lesions on the liver. Ultra-sound confirmed they were cysts. Then I had a low grade fever for a long time and sometimes all the glands in the left side of my body in my neck, under my jaw bone and now in my armpit are sore. I often get weakness in the legs and have lost a lot of weight in the past 14 months. I haven't lost anymore but had dropped so much so soon in the beginning. Doctors say there is nothing wrong. I was beginning to believe that. Went to a chiropractor and he took an x-ray and said everything looked good but that my back was in rough condition (out in some places). Great I thought! This is why I have been feeling like I have been. I went to him 5 times and he was very good, however - after each adjustment my glands would swell and hurt again, and I would also get stomach problems again of which I haven't had since the colonoscopy. Weird how every adjustment did this. Now I have a nagging pain in the left breast (3 months) and to add to the list of glands my left armpit is really tender plus I'm getting really bad hot flashes worse at night though.  I know this is a lot but please shed some light or give me some kind of understanding as to why my glands hurt but I am not sick with a flu or cold or nothing. what could cause this to happen??????  Just went to a doctor and she has scheduled an appointment with internal medicane doc. Hope I find some answers\n\n",

That was 3 weeks ago. Have very bad pain in neck and back of head with periods of headaches. Went to the Internal Specialist which did all reflex tests and muscle tests which he said were normal. He did however notice that glands in neck and above cervical bone slightly swollen. The last 4 days have been crazy, I wil get pain in a muscle in leg than a sharp pain like a needle in my leg. Then one night I had an electric shock through my leg then it was kinda numb for about 15 mintutes after. Then the next morning had electric shock in my head. Very quick and lasted maybe 1 second. Ct scan will be done soon but I really think that I have a virus that is doing this to the nerves. I will ask this specialist to run blood work for this just to rule it out. Like you said, my smptoms are so general and are happening everywhere in my body as well as vesticulation of the muscles often. The doctor thought maybe I was hyperventilating without knowing it. I do feel at this point like I want to give up and say whatever happens, happens. My back hurts so bad and the pain is spreading. I just wish they would do a spinal MRI but they want to see more symptoms. go figure! Don't  know why they are waiting. Any ideas on what kind of a virus if any would cause such things?\n\n",

I hope that you will visit The Lounge again and that you next experience here will be better than your last.  It is not uncommon that needle aspirations of thyroid findings return back \"non-diagnostic\" or \"insufficient\".  In such cases, it would be reasonable to see an Endocrinologist whom could evaluate the thyroid further.  I don't tend to just monitor the situation in such a case.  I get an Endocrinologist's opinion and expertise to help me.  Sometimes a formal biopsy is needed to get enough tissue material to run the required tests to see if there is a cancer present.

My 1 year old and 5 year old sleep in my bed, but I have no recollection of them kicking me, though it feels as if someone has kicked me in the ribs.  I usually only expereince the pain at night, however for the past couple of days, I can feel it during the day.  It also seems to be spreading to the center.  I went to the doctor and he prescribed me a medication for indigestion, however that has not helped.  He also told me I need to get a mammogram and a chest x-ray, however the soonest I can get a mammogram is in March, and I have been unable to get a chest x-ray as of yet.  I had an ultrasound on my heart, but have not gotten the results yet, and he also took blood, but I am awaiting those results as well.  Does this sound like it could be cancer, and if so, what type?  I am a mother of 5 young children, so this is making me a nervous wreck!\n\n",

Any suggestions would be appreciated\n\n",

    "title": "Large,hard swelling on 3rd ant. rib, 15 mos, now aches, pain",
    "content": "Hi, I'm hoping someone cangive me some common sense advice.   Over 15 months ago I noticed that the joint where my 3rd anterior rib is joined to the sternum had grown larger.  It did not particularly hurt unless I pressed on it firmly or frequently, in which case it felt a bit sore.  When  my Dr.first felt it she thought perhaps I had slipped a rib.   But I had not.   I hadr a chest PA last January and it showed nothing.   Then in April  I had a set of x-rays done.  One frontal and two angled to better show the ribs.  I have some very decent films of my posterior ribs, but the ant. are not well shown. There was no lesion shown in these either.    My Dr. did not seem concerned about the lump and said that people often get nobblylas they age and that is is not so uncommon.  I was not happy to hear this at 37 years old, but felt that I was being overly anxious about it all and and decided to  let it drop.   Recently, I noticed that the lump has grown.  Itt was beginning to be painful if one of my kids lay their head on my chest, and occasionally it was beginning to ache.  I brought it up again a couple of months ago and she mentioned we could do a FNA of the cartilage at some point.  Then I brought it up again 2 weeks ago when I last saw my her and againshe said we could look into doing FNA of the cartilage and MRI.  However, neither was scheduled.  This  leads me to believe that she is not too concerned, which I hope is good news.  However, she has not felt the lump at  any time in the last year, and it is definitely growing.  I have thoroughly palpitated the entire are from each arm pit to about the 7 or 8th rib.  The entire 3rd rib is now thicker and the fourth has a place that is getting thicker.  The joint where the lump is , is visable larger than the others on my chest.   I decided I really want to get this done and called her office to get the process going last week.  Nothing happened,  so I called again on Monday and actually spoke with her.   She said that the hold up for scheduling the MRI has been that she's not sure what if it is the right type of imaging that would be best for this.  After speaking with me and realizing that the whole bone is involved, she will not be doing the FNA.  She said that she would speak with the radiologist about what kind of imaging to do, but I have not heard back from her yet.   I have had 7 dysplastic nevi removed and also a  recent thyroid ultrasound  discovered two  nodules.   I am concerned about possibly having cancer with a bone  metastisis.  Am I worrying for nothing?  Or should I be pushing to get the imaging done quickly?    I feel that I have been patient for over a year, but I really want to know what the heck is growing in me.  Especially,  since it is now painful. Thanks  for your time, I know it is valuable. .\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I need some clarification on my recent bone marrow biopsy for pancytopenia.  The report states that there was a single non-paratrabecular lymphoid nodule of uncertain clinical significance found in the bone marrow core biopsy.  It goes on to stat under comments \"to clarify the significance of the small lympoid nodule present in the bone marrow core biopsy immunohistochemistry studies were attempted.  However, the lymphoid nodule was not present in the sections cut at (name of lab).  This doesn't make any sense to me since all lab materials were sent to the same place.  Should I be concerned by the lymphoid nodule?  My hematologist placed me on iron capsules as the bone marrow also indicated absent iron stores despite normal blood iron and total iron binding capacity values.    Thank you very much Delia\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Delia, I have already answered this question in a different thread. Please keep all the posts in one thread as this makes it easier for the doctors to follow up on your question.  To explain a bit more, a lymphoid nodule occurs when there is a reaction to some immune process. Lymph cells start to aggregate and form nodules to participate in the immune reaction. This can be seen in the marrow exam as a nodule. Nodules can also form in the marrow in lymphoproliferative disorders and hematological malignancies of lymphoid origin. To differentiate the two types immunohistochemistry is performed to determine whether the cells in the nodule are monoclonal or polyclonal. Monoclonal means they all come from the same mother cell, this is common with malignancy where many cells are produced from one 'malignant' clone. Polyclonality means this is a normal immune reaction coming from many differnt clones of healthy lymph cells that have multiplied to participate in the immune reaction.   Immune reactions of this nature are nonmalignant but can be the result of several diseases: infections, allergic reactions, autoimmune diseases.   The reason why we think its probably not malignant is because malignancies of lymph system would clearly show up on routine blood count and bone marrow examination. They would not show up as pancytopenia without the presence of a very large number of malignant cells that have taken up all the healthy space in the marrow and rendered it unusable by normal cells.   If you are still concerned you may add the results of the various marrow elements expressed with their relative normal limits.   Best regards,\n\n",

I have tried to get more information from the State and other resources, but have hit road blocks.  I feel that someone needs to investigate this further.  The multi-trillion dollar computer tech business may be hiding the real reason San Jose residents are increasing in cancer cases.  Best Wishes,   Rhoda\n\n",

    "content": "I too have had breast cancer in both breasts.  The cancer had spread to my spine as well.  They radiated the tumor in the spine and so far they feel they have killed it.  I underwent lumpectomies, radiation to both breasts and chemo.    I just discovered a new alternative treatment called \"dendritic vaccine\" with no or little side effects.  Check out their site at http://www.issels.com  The comprehensive treatment boosts the immune system to fight the cancer and to prevent a reoccurance.  I have my first appointment next week.  I feel for your son and his girlfriend.  This is a very extremely difficult time for everyone.  Tell her to say to herself every day that she is \"young, healthy and strong\".  This helped me through along with a lot of love and understanding from my family.  Let her know that I am a survivor as well as my mom, aunt and cousin.  They have two clinics in the USA - Santa Barbara, California and Phoenix, Arizona.  Their web site is full of great information.  I hope this helps.  Best Wishes,   Rhoda\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I'm very concerned about my mother.  She is 66 years old and has recently (within 1.5 years) been diagnosed with high blood pressure which she is taking medication for and it has been under control. This year, she was diagnosed with diabetes.  She had all the regular symptoms (thirsty, etc.) Sh is now taking meds, checking her blood sugar regularly and eating well.  Her doctor, she tells me, is happy with her blood sugar levels now.  She has only been seeing this doctor for about 1.5 years.  My concerns are that she has been complaining recently of a pain in her shoulder and neck.  Her doctor sent her for therapy but she claims it has not helped.  She is rapidly losing weight (which I know is partly due to her healthier diet) but it has become quite noticeable in just the last few weeks (hanging skin on her upper arms and around her knees).  She has also complained of being very tired which is very unlike her.  She is/has been a very active woman up until the last 4 or 5 months.  Lastly, she has complained of hot flashes.  Her doctor has put her back on her hormone pills that she was taking prior to her blood pressure and diabetes medication.  It has helped the sweating but not gotten rid of it.  She has been seeing a dietician, doctor, having her blood work done regularly.    My question is \"Is there something that the doctors could be missing?\".  I'm very concerned and wonder if it is my place to call her doctor and explain my concerns or could all of these symptoms just be due to her diabetes and aging.  Any information is greatly appreciated.\n\n",

But on the other hand, your mom has reached that age where a possibility of cancer (main concern for unexplained weight loss) is there.  If your mother has her routine health care check-ups including colon and breast screening uptodate. i think there is nothing to worry about.  On the other hand, if your mom continues to lose weight and you are still concerned, you can go with her to her doctor in one of her appointments and voice your concerns. i don't think that her doctor will be offended in any way.

    "content": "Hello, Its hard to tell over the internet. However if it is in the actual earlobe as you say, then what you feel is likely a type of cyst called an Epidermal Inclusion Cyst or EIC. These lesions are not unlike a pimple. These cysts contain dead skin cells, sebum, and purulent fluid encapsulated in a fibrous shell. They sometimes become inflamed for no apparent reason. If you were to squeeze the cyst (which I\u2019m sure you have done in the past), you might notice a bit of white thready discharge. However, these types of lesions won't pop like a pimple, because the fluid is contained inside of a protective shell. This is the body's way of isolating foreign material and protecting surrounding tissues. You should not try to pop or squeeze EIC's. You can actually cause damage to the surrounding tissue. These lesions must be removed surgically. It's really a pretty simple procedure, and is typically done in the doctor's office.  Ofcourse there are several other possibilities. Either way you should have it checked out.\n\n",

I'm just wondering if this is a cyst, the beginnings of a tumor, or am I just worrying about nothing and not paying enough attention to my body? After looking at pictures of the skeletal anatomy, it doesn't look like I should have a lump. I know I should probably have a doctor look at this, but I was hoping that maybe I could get some insight from this webpage first. The lump feels hard right now and doesn't hurt.

More details about the swelling could help, is it associated with any signs of trauma (bruises, ecchymosed path, a trauma can pass unnoticed). Is there any sign of inflammation (redness, oedema, usually painful ). Is it increasing in size, decreasing , stable? Did you lose weight the last few month may be u just noticed an old swelling because you have lost some weight. Is it mobile can u make it move a little bit (bone masses are fixed, skin or subcutaneous masses move). Hope to hear from you soon.\n\n",

The area is not discolored in anyway and it does not feel raised around the pectoral muscles. I guess I would consider it swelling over the xiphoid area, and not really cyst like. I noticed it because \"I think\" there used to be a defined indentation between my pectoral muscles. I haven't had any injuries in the area except for the recent sunburn. I might be worrying prematurely because of the sunburn. I will definitely have a physician take a look at it for me. Thank you for your assistance, it was greatly appreciated.  Jarik\n\n",

    "content": "ATL,  I am not an infertility specialist.  From what I am aware, most fertility treatments stimulate ovarian function.  There has been a concern about various medical treatments that either use estrogens (for example, hormone replacement therapy when a woman is post-menopausal) or stimulate the ovaries could increase the risk of a cancer from the organ being stimulated (e.g.- the ovaries)  or increase the irsk of cancer sensitive to the hormone (e.g.- breast cancer).  There has been controversy because the data does conflict, mainly due to clinical studies looking at the issue from different perspectives or from different ways.  Some studies were poorly designed.  Others had flaws that limited the results being interpreted.  There may be a risk of ovarian cancer from the use of infertility drugs.  There are other non-cancer medical risks.  I would recommend that you discuss the benefits and risks of various treatment options available to you not only between your husband and you, but between your doctor.  An honest discussions about these issues will hopefully let you make an informed decision.  No decision that has uncertainty about it is an easy one.  I wish you the best.\n\n",

This has been happening for about a year.  I've been trying to have sex with my partner, but it hurts, when i put my finger in it feels like there is a ball inside, its the same if i put my finger in my anus, is this connected some how, is it anything to worry about, is it natural.   Also I have a discharge of white/yellow stuff. This has been happening for over a year.  2. Hemrroids: I think i might have hemrroids but not sure.   I have been bleeding after I do a bowl movement for over a year, it doesn't happen all the time, and it doesn't matter if it is soft of firm stool.  Recently i've started a job and have been doing heavy lifting, so It feels swollen, and it itches sometimes, but doesn't hurt, not even when sitting.  (about a month)  I also feel tried, I don't know why.  I've had a recent test of my thyroid and nothing was wrong.  I'm just embarrassed to ask these questions so I don't want to ask my doctor unless there is reason to believe there is something wrong with me.   Please help me.\n\n",
