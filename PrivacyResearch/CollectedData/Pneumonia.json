    "content": "Hello,There seems to be a correlation between meteorological features and pneumonia.The lesser the temperature more common is the incidence of pneumonia.Relative humidity and precipitation are the other factors.Age,air pollution,immune status are the other factors.Relating to legionella pneumonia rainfall acutely increases the microbial contamination.Also changes in temperature if it is favorable to the vectors of a disease transmission becomes more. The increase humidity meaning more dusts and continuous heavy rain had led to sickness such as influenza and pneumonia. Best wishes.\n\n",

Respiratory syncytial virus infection in tropical and developing countries. Trop Med Int Health 1998; 3: 268-80 doi: 10.1046/j.1365-3156.1998.  The Northeastern, Southern, Midwestern, and Western regions of the US show large summer-to-winter increases in the incidence of influenza and viral pneumonia.The incidence of pneumonia during cold months in the Philippines (January-February) has been seen to increase. Incidence of malaria shows increases during periods of high temperature and heavy rainfall.  In some developing countries, the average body weight of the population shows a decrease during the rainy seasons. Marti J. Van Liere, Eric-Alain D. Ategbo, Jan Hoorweg, Adel P. Den Hartog, and Joseph G. A. J. Hautvast. The significance of socio-economic characteristics for adult seasonal body-weight fluctuations: a study in north-western Benin. British Journal of Nutrition: Cambridge University Press, 1994.  Whether this may decrease the immunity in the affected population is open to speculation.  Coccidioidis immitis pneumonia may develop following exposure to rain storms in southwestern united states.The incidence of legionellosis appears to increase during wet weather, suggesting that clinicians and public health officials need to be on the lookout for signs of the infection and possible methods for reducing environmental exposures during the rainy season.  \"don't get wet, or you may catch a cold (or, a pneumonia)\" has been a common saying in many cultures. It is beyond doubt that certain infections (including pneumonias) increase during rainy seasons in the tropics but, there is as yet no evidence (as far as i am aware of) that getting wet increases the risk of acquiring a pneumonia. Good luck!\n\n",

Basic labs including blood counts, ESR, a sputum smear for gram's stain and a routine sputum culture are indicated. A repeat chest X-ray may also be needed. Based on the clinical findings, your doctor may decide on requesting sputum smears for acid fast bacilli. Best wishes!\n\n",

After 3 months of this i finally went to the hospital  i got my blood tested urine teast and a chest x-ray iwas diagnosed with pnuemonia in my left lung. my left lung was very scard. I took clarithromycin 250mg and cerfuroxime axetil 500mg.  Its gone now but i still have shortness of breath especially when i play sports i even had to quit track breath i cant breath normally now i play tons of sports and its becoming a problem for me.  is there anything i can do to help my shortness of breath?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  In the adolescent age group, pneumonias are frequently due to certain organisms such as, - chlamydophila pneumoniae (C. pneumoniae), - mycoplasma pneumoniae (M. pneumoniae), - adenoviral infection,and - Mycobacterial infection.  C. pneumoniae occur mostly in children. Humans are the only known host for C. pneumoniae. Infections cause respiratory diseases such as sinusitis, bronchitis, and pneumonia. C. pneumoniae is typically acquired by otherwise healthy people in the community situation (community-acquired pneumonia). C. pneumoniae pneumonia is categorized as an \"atypical pneumonia\" because, diagnosis and treatment differ from that of the well known causes such as Streptococcus pneumoniae pneumonia.  Acute  C. pneumoniae infections seem often to precede episodes of asthma and is also involved in some exacerbations of chronic bronchitis. Moreover,it seems to be strongly associated with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  M. pneumoniae is a frequent causative agent of pneumonia among older children and adolescents. Mycoplasma accounts for 14-35% of pneumonia hospitalizations in this age group.  Some forms of viral pneumonia, particularly adenoviral infections, may cause necrotizing bronchiolitis or bronchiolitis obliterans.  Mycobacterial pneumonia has recently been noted with increasing frequency in socially deprived sections in urban settings.Children in shelters for the homeless, group homes and those with household contacts are particularly at risk. The diagnosis must be entertained in immunocompromised children as well.  For the sake of completion, i would mention Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or cryptogenic organizing pneumonia (COP), which is a rather vague entity. This usually begins between the ages of 40 and 60. May be triggered by bacterial/viral infections, parasitic infections, drugs, or toxic fumes. Some degree of hypoxemia may be demonstrable in affected individuals.  In conclusion, children who recover from an episode of pneumonia, but have recurrent or chronic symptoms, further testing is warranted. Further testing may include skin testing to identify fungal pathogens, tests for tuberculosis, sweat testing to identify cystic fibrosis, titers against rare pathogens, and bronchoscopy.  I hope this information is useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 39yr old female as you can see from my profile has a complicated Medical and family history.  In May I woke with a sore throat one morning and the next day I woke with a VERY HEAVY Chest and the beginning of more than 2 months of he!!   I was diagnosed with Pneumonia by my Dr after a clinical examination (listening to my chest, tapping on my chest etc) and history (shortness of breath, heavy lung feeling, infection taste when breathing, night sweats, fatigue, lack of appetite, low grade fever (37-38C), headaches, sore throat at beginning etc I didn't have a cough although I felt I needed to cough and this was put down to a side effect of medication (MsContin in HIGH dose) I take to help combat my Chronic pain condition (RSD) and did get one later for a short time.  I was put on Amoxicillin for 2 boxes worth, after 3 days I ended up in the ER with shortness of breath (my O2 saturations were said to be normal) and an x-ray was take and said to be mostly clear with \"something\" in the middle, I was subsequently diagnosed with Bronchitis or possibly Mycoplasma pneumonia, and given Doxycycline just in case as well as the other Antibiotic I was taking (I am allergic to Cephalosporin and Roxithromycin antibiotics as you can see in my profile).  10 days or so later back at my GP I was no better (in fact I was worse) and she was getting concerned, she sent me for another chest x-ray and an ECG to rule out heart problems (I have pre-existing trivial mitral and tricuspid valve regurgitation) and to the ER with a letter and the hopes that I would be admitted.  I was admitted (by this time I had been sick for more than 3 weeks) to hospital (and spend three weeks (21 days) in there), and put on IV amoxicillin every 4 hours, for 4 days and back on the Doxycycline as well. I also had/ have the occasional fast/funny heartbeat but this was not picked up on any of the ECG's I have had about 5 in the last 2 months. After 4 days I was transferred under a different Dr and continued on the Doxy for another 2 weeks or so. I was coughing up green gunk by this stage (Dr had me taking a (Bisolvin Chesty Forte) Bromhexine hydrochloride cough mixture (8mg/5ml) to help) and the hospital took sputum samples, and blood tests too (not sure of results, except the ones taken in the ER showed increased inflammation and white blood count).  While in-patient I was seen by a pulmonary specialist as I was having severe chest pains (eventually diagnosed as Costochondritis and possible pleurisy as well), I was changed from Doxycyline to Moxifloxin for about 7-10 days and had NSAIDS (firstly Voltaren and then Indomethacin) added to the mix to treat the supposed Costo/ Pleurisy. Got results of one of my blood tests that said I had Mycoplasma (or had had it) and was kept in an extra week after this.  I was sent home after 21 days in patient as they said everything that was being done for me could be done at home.  It is now 3 weeks since i was discharged and I still have shortness of breath (although all the time in hospital they said my O2 levels (by pulse oxymeter) were fine - about 95% or above), chest pains (especially if I lean forward, move about too much, and riding in the car hurts too), slight heaviness in my lungs, fatigue, I get cold too, normal temp to low grade fever (36-38C), night sweats (mostly on my lower half (not sure what that is about)), wheezing, and other odd breathing noises. I spend most of my days in/on bed sitting at a 45 degree angle (I sleep at this angle as well).  I am seeing my GP again in a week (she is away at present and has been since I got discharged), but until then am concerned about what is going on with my body, why after more than 10 weeks I am still not better/ well (I thought Mycoplasma was supposed to be a mild illness).   I am also seeing a Cardiologist on 28th August for a check up as I have not had my 2 yearly Echo to check my heart murmurs and also because one of the Dr's said she heard an Aortic valve murmur as well (and this is new). Although none of the above stuff is/was thought to be cardiac, I had multiple ECG's and blood tests including checking my heart stuff.  I am worried it was/ is more than Pneumonia/ Bronchitis/ Upper Respiratory Tract infection (All things I have been told it is). I am wondering if I should ask my GP to refer me for a Chest CT scan to see if this shows more? or what else could be going on or if this is simply normal???  Sorry for the length of this and congratulations if you made it all the way to the end  ANY help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Thank you for the very detailed post. Seems you had overlooked mentioning a few conditions which i feel certain your doctors must have been very concerned about (given the history of trivial mitral/tricuspid valve regurgitation, the appearance of a new aortic murmur, occasional fast/funny heartbeats, chest pain on leaning forward)- and they are,   - an infective endocarditis(IE): very rarely caused by mycoplasma spp., - myocarditis, and - pericarditis due to mycoplasma spp.  Mycoplasmal infecions are one of the causes of culture-negative IE.  The vast majority of organisms that cause infective endocarditis are readily isolated from blood cultures. However, in a small minority of patients with infective endocarditis, no organism is isolated. This may occurdue to certain factors, such as, - either because previous antimicrobial therapy has partially cured the infection, -  or because the infection is due to an unusually fastidious microbe,  - or due to a slow-growing organism.   Broad-range eubacterial polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification is a method available for detection of mycoplasma spp.  PCR-based method has both advantages and disadvantages. The advantages lie in its high sensitivity and quick turnaround time. A notable limitation is that it cannot provide antibiotic susceptibility data or minimal inhibitory concentrations, as is possible with conventional culture methods.  I guess these possibilities were entertained during your recent hospitalization apart from the possible mycoplasma pneumonia.  I feel that you should consult a chest physician or a cardiologist at the earliest. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you Dr.M.Aroon kamath,  As far as I know none of these conditions were looked into.  I had some ECG's to check my heart rhythms etc but they were all normal.  I had multiple blood tests but I think they were testing for normal things like FBC etc.  I think they checked cardiac enzymes at one stage after a bad episode that scared both myself and many of the nurses etc who came running (they thought I might have had a small collapse in my lung but the x-ray was clear).  I am seeing my GP on Thursday and am thinking of asking her if I should have  CT Scan for a better check of my chest etc, as my X-rays have been pretty clear all the way through this.  What exactly should I ask her to test for regarding these heart issues ( infectious endocarditis, myocarditis and pericarditis) you mentioned? Should I be having specific blood tests, x-rays, scans etc to rule these conditions in or out?  I am also seeing a Cardiologist at the end of August but that is more than a month away yet (and the earliest I can get in).  I have been feeling a bit heavy chested again lately and coughing up small amounts of white/ clearish stuff when I can cough but again am having a lot of trouble coughing properly (thought to be caused by the high doses of morphine I take for my RSD). I also have the night sweats again/ still and my temp last night got up to 37.9C (100F)  I was seeing a pulminologist while in-patient but no one ever mentioned my heart except to say it wasn't cardiac because my ECG's were clear. and to mention the possibility of the new aortic murmur.  I have had all of my Pathology results (blood tests and sputum tests) sent to my GP so she will have these when I get there, I also have all of the Chest X-rays that were done as well.  I don't know what method was used to diagnose the Mycoplasma except that it took about 4 days to get the results of the blood test.  Again THANK YOU for your answer and I will bring this up with my GP when I see her on Thursday.  Shazinoz  (Australia)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shazinoz, Thank you for your update.My reply to your question was based purely on the basis of the information you had supplied(without the opportunity of a first-hand clinical examination!).  It is quite possible that your treating doctor might have 'entertained' the possibility of an infective endocarditis, but might not have divulged it under those circumstances, - possibly because the evidence for it was not compelling or - for concern regarding precipitating unnecessary anxiety.  The comforting aspect is that you were on the necessary antibiotic therapy at that time.  The chest pain apparently developed AFTER you were discharged home. Mycoplasmal infections are not always mild illnesses. They can cause serious complications in some individuals.It is good that you responded fairly well.  I suggest that you may voice your concerns with your doctor and get investigated. A repeat ECG and chest X-ray may be useful. An echocardiographic examination also may help to exclude any vegetations on the heart valves. Hope this information is helpful to you. Good luck!\n\n",

I'm now on my 4th round of antibiotics in 4 months, and my 3rd round of steroid treatments in 4 months. I've been unable to work at my job all this time.  My symptoms are: (w/o the pneumonia) shortness of breath with ANY activity, but also sitting down; rapid heartbeat, pain/burning at the bottom of both my lungs with & w/o movement, fevers, dizziness, sweating, wheezing. I have NO coughing, unless the pneumonia is full force, but even then, nothing ever comes up.  My biggest complaint to my Dr has been the pain in my lungs. My lower right lung is the worst. Sharp pains/stabbing; burning pain whether I exert myself or not. When I walk even a short distance, or even to take a shower, I'm completely out of breath and lightheaded.  In June, I did the breathing tests and was told I failed; So, my Dr diagnosed me with COPD. I disagree with him. I've never had any of these problems before in my life. When I asked him if it could be something else, he cut me off and rudely said NO. My oxygen levels are perfect (98%). My blood pressure is perfect (115/64 I think).  If it were COPD, would I have this constant lung pain? Even with no cough? And if it's Pleurisy, how do I get rid of it? Nothing seems to work. I have cut back on my smoking and am trying to quit, so I know that will improve my health a lot. A nurse friend of mine suggested I ask my DR about Pulmonary Embolus(?), but my Dr dismissed that instantly, too.  I'm at a loss as to what to do. I HAVE to get better, so that I can return to work and go back to living a normal life again. Thank you!\n\n",

    "content": "I recently had surgery [over a week ago] and went under general anesthesia. Afterwards I was told to do breathing exercises so I wouldn't develop pneumonia. For some reason I completely forget to do them. Now I have this strange heavy feeling in my chest with slight coughing. The coughing is very sporadic. Sometimes I can't stop coughing and other times I'm perfectly okay. I'm not producing any colored mucus. From time to time I produce a little bit of clear mucus and that's about it. I'll run a fever about 99.5 but then it'll go away and then it goes back up throughout the day. My chest feels very tight. Sometimes I can hear myself wheeze when I breathe other time it's clear. The symptoms aren't very consistent. I'll feel fine and then I feel bad. I also have a tight feeling in my throat sometimes.  Could this possibly be pneumonia or something completely unrelated?\n\n",

    "title": "Family With Recurring Pneumonia-79 y.o. fem now in hospital",
    "content": "Last night, my mother-in-law was hospitalized for the second time in a month with difficulty breathing. The biggest fear factor I have is that this matches far too closely with what happened to her husband before he passed away.  I will attempt to give as much history of her current complaints and medical history, and I will reference his as it relates.  She is a 79 year old woman who up until a few years ago was very physically active. She is still fairly active, as she has farm animals (chickens, goats, etc) that she feeds every day. Her husband passed away in November of 2008, and she has slowly been becoming less active since that time, and her eating habits have degenerated somewhat.   Her house is older (she will be moving to a new one in the next few months) with previously leaky roof in a humid climate (possibilities of fungal growth and/or other problems).  She has had high blood pressure and high cholesterol (not dangerously so) that was controlled by medications. She was on a very, very low dose water pill in addition to those two medicines.  Starting a few months ago, she started becoming short of breath (her husband had printer's lung and had been a smoker, so in him, this was not a new symptom). It kept getting worse. Her primary care doctor made one change in her medication (which one, I'm not sure of) thinking that her difficulties breathing were a side effect.  In mid- to late-June, she called 911 due to difficulty breathing and chest pain she worried might be a heart attack. After testing, it was determined she had fluid build up in her lungs. This was immediately diagnosed as CHF and treated as such. They also stated that she had an infection in her lungs (he was only diagnosed with the lung infection and/or pneumonia on his first admittance, not with CHF). She was given antibiotics when she was in the hospital - less than a week - but was not sent home with any (he was given antibiotics to continue at home). She was given a steroid series to take after her release.  Her breathing was comfortable (i.e. not difficult) for only a few days before it began deteriorating again. She was scheduled for a follow up with her GP physician next week, but last night called 911 again. When they arrived, she was not thinking clearly and barely remembers how they got her out of the house (we believed her husband had the beginnings of alzheimers as he was often out of touch with the world - both in not understanding what was said to him and in not being able to communicate clearly).  When the chest x-ray showed fluid in her lungs at the ER, she was diagnosed with pneumonia and admitted (he was also re-admitted less than a month later with a more severe case of pneumonia).  In both cases, there was little coughing, little sputeum for them to test. Neither of them ran a high fever. He was tested for MRSA and was found to have been exposed, but we were never told if he was a carrier or had an active infection. She, to the best of my knowledge, has never been tested.  I've done some research on pneumonia and know it can have many causes. What I'm wondering is if it might be caused by some environmental factor (mold/fungus, bacteria in the house, insect waste or dust being inhalled, etc) or some contagion (particularly MRSA), but that her immune system was strong enough to hold it off until a recent injury and her depression weakened her immunity until the problem manifested in her.  What tests can/should be done to make sure that she doesn't follow the same course that he did? How can we find out what's REALLY causing the pneumonia (i.e. is it really CHF, is it fungal, is it bacterial-and if so is the bacteria resistant, etc)?  Any information or suggestions would be very much appreciated. If you need more information, please do not hesitate to send a question here, and I will answer with as much detail as I can (I have full medical history on her, including childhood illnesses and all injuries).

    "content": "I had a Chest XRay done about 3 days ago because I was having some pretty severe breathing issues.  I felt like I was suffocating almost constantly and my left lung towards the bottom of my ribcage (on the side, front AND back) was becoming painful and sore.  I was also feeling dizzy and somewhat sick to my stomach and having random bouts of extreme fatigue.  I went to the ER lastnight, and my doctor told me I have POSSIBLE Pneumonia only because the XRay didn't really come out all that great, but it did look like I had some fluid in there and it could be inflamed.    My only problem with the diagnosis is I am not coughing at all, nor do I have any feeling that I need to.  I am not weezing or having anything come up from my lungs at all.  I just continuously feel like I can't breath (shortness of breath) and feel like I am suffocating especially when I lay down.  It almost feels as if my throat is tightened up also and constricted.  Is there a possibility that I have something else going on with my respritory system that they could be overlooking?  I don't want to just be treating myself for something that could possibly be worse than pneumonia.  I honestly am afraid that I am going to just stop breathing all together.  Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "The information you've received certainly doesn't sound wrong. Assuming no mistakes have been made (and there's no reason to assume there have been, but this is the only qualifier to your question) this certainly is consistent with a common scenario in people of many ages, especially small children who cannot readily describe how they're feeling. The treatment also sounds appropriate. The condition is quite common, and generally runs a benign and self-limiting course. If she continues to improve and looks good at followup your daughter should be fine. If she develops any new symptoms or difficulty with breathing or extreme fatigue (or, of course, a higher fever) you'll need to notify the physician at once. Otherwise this normally will resolve fairly rapidly. Just keep her inside and away from sick people, and make sure she doesn't overdo -- she should be able to do pretty much as she feels up to doing, but shouldn't be doing a lot of zooming around til she's been declared clear, as even simple pneumonias can cause sudden energy drains and sometimes this can worsen the infection. On the other hand, absent any severe symptoms, while inside she should be able to play fairly normally.   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here as needed and give us an update also. Good luck to you.\n\n",

Once the infection is cleared up with antibiotics the mass will be easier to visualize. If it's still unclear what it is, it can be biopsied to determine its nature. It could well be just an old tubercular cyst that's been there for quite a while. It also could be a benign tumor.

As for that \"doctor\" thing, no problem, it happens all the time. I do thank you, though, for your kind words. I've been an EMT, paramedic, have been trained in critical care nursing (but am not an RN), and am certified in non-invasive diagnostic cardiology, so my scope has been limited to emergency care, which requires the most knowlege in cardiology, neurolog and mechanisms of trauma. It is a rather narrow field, although I also hold certification in critical incident stress management. I once thought I'd like to be a doctor, but after having worked with some extremely fine ones, decided at one point I'd rather be the extra eyes and ears than try to compete in that field. It's been very gratifying. The CNA license is required in my home state for many of the jobs I've held, and I have a lot of respect for what dedicated CNAs do on a daily basis, so good on you for that as well as for having chosen an equally challenging and important career path. I have done my research and continue to, as I want always to be learning and to be as useful as possible. That requires good teachers! I don't know that I'd be up to the rigors of internship at my age anyway. :)  It is a huge compliment you've paid me and I want you to know how much it's appreciated. Thank you very much. I hope your Thanksgiving is a wonderful one as well.  My best, John Kenyon\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr: I had severe, hemorrhaging ARDS/MODS, empyema, no pulse on arrival by ambulance in 1980, age 18 years.  Was on PEEP ventilator, albumen, saline, various antibiotics, etc.  Hospitalized 2 mths. Result:  Restrictive Lung Disease, deviated trachea, attacks of bronchitis \"everytime\" I get someone's cold. Problem:  I obviously can't climb more than 2-flights of stairs, as lungs don't stretch, and I can't job more than a couple blocks with my dog.  (Though I can speed walk, with some exercise induced asthma, at 3.0 max. on my treadmill, flat surface). I just read a four yr. old child developed swine flu and received same ventilator and damage to lungs from fibrosis.  They apparently can now \"strip\" this tissue off of lungs to restore normal lung function.  Question:  Could I be a candidate for this procedure, after almost three decades since I got ARDS?  It would be great; as I have always missed out on vertical hiking with my friends - I am always left behind huffing/puffing, frequently stopping until I get rid of the carbon dioxide trapped in my tight lungs.  I'd love to exercise more, and just thought there would be a way for me to do this. Thanks for your assistance.  PS....any studies on post-ARDS Restrictive Lung Disease survivors?  I always see COPD mentioned on every lung association website, and only Restrictive Lung Disease mentioned when caused by Kyphoscoliosis, or progressive type fibrosis.  So, I don't know if my condition is progressive (if I have to worry about pulmonary hypertension as I age) or what.  Annoying! Thanks, again. Renata\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -- Considering the profound extremity of your condition upon arrival during the acute illness, you certainly have made a remarkable recovery, and you do really well in terms of exercise tolerance considering all this. However, you're still quite young and obviously have more energy than you can readily expend, so this has to be frustrating. The \"stripping\" procedure is fairly new and I'm honestly not up on this, nor have I seen any studies on post-ARDS patients, have only heard anecdotal information that is largely very positive. There is, of course, in situations such as yours the need to avoid upper respiratory infections (and lower ones as well, needless to say), but you are doing really well. I would recommend checking with a pulmonologist at one of the major medical centers (Mayo, Hopkins, Georgetown, to name a few where this field is explored often and in depth, and depending upon your location). You may be or may become a candidate for the procedure or something similar, but it's difficult to say, especially after this much time has passed. The fact is the scarring becomes more \"concrete\" over time, although the question remains as to whether or not this can be removed from a healthy substrate. And that's where they lost me in the discussion -- the question of healthy substrate and how to reach it. By now it may be possible and is certainly worth a few telephone calls at least. I wish I could tell you more, but this is a pretty rarified area and there are a few pulmonologists around who may be more up to date on the latest on this.   I hope this is helpful, good luck to you, and keep up the great work. You're actually doing awfully well, but the frustration and desire to do more is felt here and very much understood. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Surgery complications for patients with Pneumonia",
    "content": "Hi luvher4u14,  Pneumonia is a frequent complication of hip fractures (joint between the pelvic bone and the head of the femur; the femur suffers the crack). Prolonged bed rest allows mucus to collect in the lungs with subsequent proliferation of germs, which originates lung infection (known as pneumonia).  Pneumonia is a major contraindication for surgery. Moreover, pneumonia after surgery is a severe complication because approximately 30% of patients die within 30 days following surgery. Also, the cause of death following a hip fracture is often due to blood clots, pneumonia, or infection.  For most patients with hip fractures the best treatment is early surgery (within 24 to 48 hours) followed by early mobilization, but for some patients precipitous surgery could increase the risk of complications.  To answer your question, the anesthesiologist is right; several studies found that postoperative deaths of patients with hip fractures were not related to the timing of surgery but to a poor physical condition. It is recommended to avoid early operation in patients with a severe disease who are not optimally prepared for surgery.\n\n",

I was on Amoxicillin-clavulanate for 10 days, I went back in for more x-rays and was told it is getting better but is still there (was put on Azithromycin, due to allergic reaction to first one). The day I went in for the second round of x-rays I discovered a mild to medium pain in my lower left rib area. The pain is much worse when coughing occurs and movement in the area can be felt when coughing. Today, 2 days after the pain first occurred, the pain is much worse and very sharp.

    "title": "Re: Fractured rib while having Pneumonia",
    "content": "Hi there --  While coughing due to pneumonia and other cough-producing pulmonary problems often can cause a cracked rib, more often the pain and discomfort is due to either muscle strain or costochondritis (inflammation of the connective tissue between the ribs) and in either case the cause, significance, symptoms and treatment are pretty much the same: first choice therapy is non-steroidal anti-inflammatory pain medication (NSAIDs) which are generally available over the counter (Advil, Aleve). There's not much to be done for any of the possible causes of rib, cartilege or muscle irritation besides this and sometimes application of moist heat locally.   In no case is this something to be overly concerned about, but it should be evaluated to make certain the pain is, in fact, from ortho-muscular stress and not directly attributable to pneumonitis percolating in the lung (although the latter is usually a rather dull, achey pain rather than what you describe). Assuming the pneumonia has been managed, the pain is almost certainly due to irritation and will resolve with time, but more quickly with help from NSAIDs.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up here as necessary.\n\n",

    "content": "My 14 month old Granddaughter was diagnosed from mother's cord blood with CF. She is getting the best care available at our local Children's hospital. She has had two different antibiotic inhalation treatments, twice per day, each lasting 30 days. 1st infection was pseudomonas aeruginosa, second infection was staph.  Throat swab was used to collect sample. She is normal height, weight, appetite, and learning landmarks.  My question is this:  They have 2 bunny rabbits in cages inside one of their two bedrooms. The room smells awful. The concentrated odor is stifling when one opens the door and walks into the room.They keep this door closed to the rest of the apartment. They sometimes open the bunny room windows to exhaust the odor. I have tried telling my son (age 33) that there is fecal bacteria and urine ammonia in the odor, as well as pet dander and most likely dust mites, and that he (they) should get rid of the bunnies. The bunnies kick up dust in their cages, which covers every surface in that room. I am of the opinion that this dust can migrate into other rooms of the apartment, and into the central air and heat system. I think that this environment is not healthy for a special needs toddler who has been diagnosed with CF. By the way, my fifteen year old Grandson sleeps in this room for tow nights about once a month when he comes to visit his Dad. Do you agree or disagree? Thank you very much for your time. A concerned Grandma.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cystic fibrosis and exposure to ^ concentration of animal e",
    "content": "Hello --  You're absolutely correct in your observations, as all the detritus from the bunnies can potentially cause problems in healthy people, and the risk is multiplied in those with CF, especially very small ones.  Now then: fastidious maintainance of the bunny room could very well minimize the risk to everyone involved, but this is the problem, at least according to what I infer from your post. And knowing that people who do not tend to domestic animals properly usually are more willing to give them up than get with the clean program and stay with it day in and day out, this is probably the best approach, if followed up with a very thorough cleaning of the room. It is actually possible, in many cases, to keep animals in situations, but not if they're being kept this way. It's also not goof for the rabbits, who, while not immediately endangered nor human, do also deserve some consideration. All in all, this is a real mess, and especially a problem with the small one with CF being exposed to this. Your conclusions about various bunny detritus and its spread throughout the dwelling is correct, although, again, this could be minimized with proper animal care, which seemingly is not being given. This is a serious concern, and may well need to be brought to the attention of child protection services, who could assess this objectively. However, this would no doubt cause a painful rift. It might be brought up as a veiled threat, and might get the attention of the parents, but it's still likely to cause family strain at least. It's difficult enough just being a grandparent and trying to pass along helpful insights without this very complex additional situation.   I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck with this, and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

Unfortunately,  they are not much help as their caseloads are staggering and they only have time for \"serious\" abuse.

She became ill with flu like symptoms (cough, fever, vomiting, diarreha, fluid in ears) last week and after 3 days I finally convinced her to see a doctor. The doctor said he thought she had pneumonia and sent her for xray. The xray showed a small \"spot\" on her left lung and the blood work showed elevated white and red blood cell counts. I know that and infection causes white blood cells to become elevated but what about red blood cells. I need to add that before she became ill she showed no symptoms. I am worried sick about this as my first thought was cancer but she has no family history of it. What are some alternative diagnosis that this could possibly be? All we have for right now is a \"I'll call you\" from the doctor. He didn't even tell us if it was in fact pneumonia but she is on antibiotics.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there --  Sounds like your girlfriend may have had a bad viral infection that may have allowed an opporunistic secondary bacterial infection. Pneumonia can be a very black and white finding or sometimes just a borderline thing, a very fine line. The spot on her lung could well be a pneumoccal pus pocket or cyst, could be an old scar from the smoking days, could be a calcified lesion. Cancer isn't the first thing that comes to mind, although it's natural to wonder and your concern is appreciated. The elevated red cell count is most likely due to dehydration from diarrhea, fever and being off food part of the time during an acute illness. We don't know how elevated it was, but just being out of range could be due to a confluence of those factors above, and is the most likely reason, or the doctor would have ordered addtional tests.   If GF is on antibiotics and actually had developed a secondary pneumonia it should start to improve very soon. I certainly hope it does. Doctor should do a followup chest x-ray after the respiratory infection is thoroughly cleared up -- maybe the spot will be gone too then. Again, your concern is admirable, just don't want you to be overly worried right now, because all the findings are consistent with a really nasty enterovirus/pneumonitis and should start to resolve shortly. If this was pneumonia GF may feel a little run down for a week or two after the acute symptoms are past, but this is normal -- for that.   I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you both and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

We watched my mother pass away from pneumonia in the hospital but she had an underlying illness (BOOP) and my girlfriend is freaked out about hospitals now. After a few days and a few trips to the ER late at night, they ordered her on oxygen at home and changed some of her meds. The oxygen helped tremendously with her recovery. They did a CAT SCAN and the spot was exactly what you said it could be. It was a little bit of scar tissue and some infection, which I guess was possibly the pus pocket you refered to.  What a relief to have her laughing and smiling again. She is still weak but that gets better everyday.   Thank you so much again for your reply.

    "content": "Hello,  In late March I developed the worst case of influenza I have ever had -- aches, high temperature, chills, etc.  The flu ended up turning into pneumonia.  On April 5th, being extremely sick, and extremely week (difficulty walking), I gave in and saw a doctor.  He put me on Levaquin (750 mg per day), on a five day treatment plan.  The Leviquin had some not so nice side effects, but I stayed with it the entire course.  Now, three weeks after being on this medication, I am feeling much better, but not quite one hundred percent yet.  The dark yellow mucus has now turned thin and clear.  I no longer have any signs of a fever.  I have been able to start working out again, etc.  However, there are a few lingering signs of the illness I had.  Particularly, an occasional wheeze (maybe a few times a day).  I have asthma, but it is so under control, until pneumonia, I rarely wheezed.  Another issue, the cough is 99 percent gone, but I can occasionaly feel stuff inside my lungs.  When that happens, I purposely cough to get it up -- it's now always clear.  Finally, perhaps once every few days or so, Ill notice trace amounts of blood when I spit out some of the clear mucus -- it's very minimal, but I'm still slightly concerned.  Like I said, I'm feeling almost back to normal, but is it normal for the symptoms of pneumonia to linger?  One final thing, Monday I had a follow up chest x ray, and was told everything looks normal.  Thanks  bassfisherman1981\n\n",

The aftereffects can linger for weeks or longer, so you're about where I'd expect after such a severe bout. Pneumonia will often aggravate latent or remiss asthma, so treat that as you normally would, and with time, as the lingering irritation (mainly from coughing) resolves the asthma should stabilize again. There may be extended fatigue, but it also will resolve eventually, especially with adequate rest and good nutrition. The blood flecking is fairly normal too, because there has been significant irritation and inflamation down in there, so some  tiny capilaries will occasionally break, but this, too, should get better with time.

    "content": "Hello --  While it is a rare genetic defect, there is such a one and it's well worth investigating the posibility that your daughter has inherited the trait you had to deal with. Since what she has is being called \"atypical\" pneumonia and is being treated with multiple approaches, it seems likely this is a familial thing. It's definitely worth a look, and even if your pediatrician feels this is unlikely I personally would request referral to a genetic counselor just to be certain this is not a heritable trait, as it could then turn up in subsequent generations and knowing if it's present is always useful information. If it's just a bizarre coincidence all the better, but this should be ascertained before writing this off to just bad luck. It seems a little too close for that.   I hope  this is helpful. Good luck to you and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "My son is 5 months old. 10 days back he developed whistling breathing with chest whizzing. He was diagnosed as having allergy and was given Decadron (Cortizon-bsed infant drug). When the symptoms continued for 5 days, a chest X-ray was done and he was diagnozed with Pneumonia taking 3/4 of the right lung. He never had fever, he was all the way active, though had lack of apetite for 3 days.  Doctors treating him were puzzeled by the fact that this baby has this X-ray as normally in such babies they are in hospital already.  He's being treated now by antibiotics at home. A blood exam yesterday was normal with no infection shown.  We are puzzled. Is there a Pneumonia with no fever? Are the X-ray symptoms of his right lung due to Cortizan?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Pneumonia with no fever",
    "content": "Hello --  There are two reasons, as a rule, that a pneumonia may present without fever. First, some viral pneumonias simply never rise to the level of febrile, although with such a large amount of one lung involed this is surprising. There is a second possibility too, however. There is a form of pneumonia known as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia or B.O.O.P. This is not an infectious pneumonia and usually will not trigger a fever (although it can). This type is usually of unknown cause, but is frequently found to be due to some inhaled or ingested substance which happens to trigger it.   There is also a possibility that, if cortisone (as Decadron) was administered, this may have suppressed any fever entirely, and this is the most likely cause of this in your son's case. Since steroids suppress inflammation they also suppress fever, and this is probably why,  by the time pneumonia was diagnosed, there was no fever.  I hope this answers your question. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

Four weeks later I was diagnosed with pneumonia.  Z-pack helped but didn't cure.  Follow-up chest x-ray was clear.  Sputum culture clear. Next prescribed Bactrim: caused severe allergic reaction at end of dosage.  Three days ago had a post-check with the physician who could not hear anything further in my lungs.  Same night I continued running fever >101. Began Levaquin yesterday.  Ran fever of 102.1 at night.     I seem to be relatively functional throughout day (although dyspnea and productive cough remain and energy level is quite low), but continue to run a nightly fever with chills, rigors, and uncontrollable coughing fits for a few hours late each evening.   Chest only hurts when coughing.  My wife also has been sick for the past six weeks which started the same way but has not progressed to pneumonia.  She continues to struggle with moist cough and energy level.  (Proximity to me is likely a factor.)  I can understand the dyspnea & cough lingering, but cannot understand why I continue to run nightly fevers.  Should other tests be performed to lend insight?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Since you've had a clear chest x-ray fairly recently but continue to have these symptoms and your wife is also having similar problems, you likely have a more stubborn form of bacterial or perhaps fungal pneumonia (or perhaps relapsing bronchitis which could cause pneumonia to start back up again). You're currently on a pretty strong antibiotic and hopefully your wife is being treated as well.   Have you been cultured to determine what, exactly, is causing the infection? This may be up for grabs, diagnosis-wise,and could warrant a change in medical therapy to knock this thing out once and for all. This would be my one suggestion, except that I can hardly imagine it wasn't already done. If not, though, that would be the one thing I'd ask to be added: blood cultures and sputum cultures. Perhaps even if you did have this done before it should be repeated, since there may have been an opportunistic bug that's moved in as often happens after a serious pulmonary infection.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you both, and please follow up here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Passing out due to excessive hard coughing is not at all unusual, but it's also not something you want going on, as you can get hurt on your way to the floor. The cough is the culprit, and you're going to need to find something that will help manage both the post-nasal drainage and the  cough. An antihistimine along with an expectorant. For the latter purpose (to loosen the secretions and help cough up what's down there without knocking yourself literally out) guaifenesin, brand-name Mucinex, is good. Also any cough medication that contains dextromethorphan should  help.   In the meantime, please do your best to not let the ticking and  congestion lead you into paroxysms of coughing, and if this is impossible then please make sure you're sitting down when you start to cough so as to avoid injury by falling. Try your best to avoid getting into these \"spells\", as they also aren't especially good for the pressure they cause inside your head. Again, this is a fairly common problem, but it's no fun. No need to panic, but please  take the appropriate precautions when it's happening. If it doesn't resolve within a day or two you'll  need to be seen by a regular MD as you may have a bacterial infection and might need an antibiotic to get this cleared up.  Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The CT is a good idea because with pneumonia and other pulmonary diseases, there can be lesions  left which can either reactivate, or can become calcified. It's important, even if there is a calcified nodule left over from this, that it be noted, so that in the future if you have chest imaging done and something \"odd\" shows up, it can be correlated with the CT finding. If nothing is found, all the better. Either way, it's a wise thing to do. Glad you're feeling fine now. Pneumonia can be really insidious, as you've found out.  I hope this answers your question.

    "content": "Hello, Pneumonia is a sever form chest infections that is diagnosed primarily by clinical picture, examination and radiological investigation of the chest (X-ray or CT).  The causative organism is defined by sputum culture and sensitivity as a wide variety of bacterial and viral organisms can cause pneumonia. Fungal infections are more seen in immunocompromised patients.  Treatment is in the form of antibiotic course that is usually long enough to eradicate the infection. Doses, duration and type of antibiotic therapy is determined by the severity and the type of infection. Hospitalization is usually needed in most of the cases.  Physician usually recommend a follow up X-ray in 2-4 weeks of treatment to make sure that the lungs are clean and the patient is not at risk of complications.  Your symptoms indicate that your lung or at least the bronchi is still recovering and more cautions is needed. Avoiding cold moist air, specially sudden changes in the temperature of the surrounding environment, closed places, smoking etc is an important measure.  If you are on antibiotics for that period of time and you do not have a colored (yellow, dark, green) sputum, it is less likely that you are still infective and people around are not at risk of catching infecting from you.   However, it is always better to follow up with your Doctor get checked properly to ensure your and your colleagues safety. He will be more aware of your condition and will advise you with the most convenient measures to avoid relapse.  Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Most of the time it is a dull ache, but sometimes the pain can be quite a sharp aching pain and can last for hours.  I get the pain if i have been lying still or go into the cold or i am stressed.  I have also got the pain for no apparent reason at all too.  I have been to the doctor many a times to be told that its just muscle pain and it will go away with time and to take pain relief if it occurs, but being 4 years on i would like to know if this is ever going to go away or is it something that i have to live with now as a result.  Please can someone help me understand whats going on and how long it is likely to persist and how to help alleviate the pain when it occurs.  Thank you very much.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello dusty ford -  While amojade has given you one excellent suggestion (as well as a very good observation about possible pneumonia), the description of your discomfort doesn't sound as much like costochondritis (although it certainly could be); with all you went through during your bout of pneumonia I'm thinking it's  possible there could be some lasting sensitivity from the pnuemothorax (collapsed lung) or just the area in general. This could be pleuritic pain or something of a similar nature. Of course the treatment for it would be the same as for costochondritis, which would be to take an over-the-counter non-steroidal anti-inflammatory like ibuprofen or naproxyn (Advil or Aleve). If this were to fail to help then I'd strongly suggest a second opinion, as muscle pain shouldn't last four years either.   Hope this is helpful.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  What you describe could be on the way to becoming pneumonia but at present sounds more like acute bronchitis (which is often a precursor of pneumonia when untreated). The tightening sensation in your throat would be consistent with pharyngitis secondary to a sinus infection draining post-nasally into your throat and on into the brochial tree. Hopefully you'll have seen  a doctor by now and will have been placed on an antibiotic, which would seem appropriate given the colorful discharge.   I hope you're doing well. Please do follow up with us. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -   As derek says, pneumonia wouldn't last for years. It can last a lot longer than a few days, though, just for the record, and people can have it for weeks or months before it is diagnosed. There are many kinds of pneumonias, but most of them have many other symptoms besides pain (if any, it is usually an ache in the ribs on the affected side). You may well have costochondritis, an inflammation of the cartilege between the ribs. You could also have a pinched nerve, or at least one that becomes pinched when you are in the most comfortable posture for going to sleep. It is probably an orthopedic problem. If an anti-inflammatory over-the-counter drug like ibuprofen (as Advil, for instance) helps, then it is an inflammatory collagen problem. If that doesn't help, then you should have a doctor evaluate you for possible nerve or other orthopedic problem involving your ribs on the affected side.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello xyzmale -  Your problem is a very common one. It is usually caused by postnasal drip due to allergy and/or a possible chronic sinus infection. This latter can produce pretty unpleasant breath odor along with pharyngeal irritation from the PND. There are several ways of combatting this: one, try and get any occult sinus infection resolved or allergy under control. Also, to help the phlegm move more readily and with less annoyance, an over-the-counter medication called guafenaisin (there is also a long-acting brand called Mucinex, and there are now long-acting generic versions as well) can help liquify, loosen and sometimes eliminate the phlegm. Drying antihistimines may be needed but also contribute to the thickened secretions because of the drying effect and sometimes lead to blocked and eventually infected sinuses. Seeing an ear, nose and throat specialist may be in order.  I hope this is helpful.\n\n",

It sounds like your husband had a very severe case of pneumonia and with all the various inflammatory processes, irritations, and interventions the pleura could be severely irritated or sensitized. Ibuprofen and naproxyn are the usual drugs of choice to reduce the inflammation and resolve the pain if this is, indeed, the case.   I hope this is helpful and that by now the pain has subsided.\n\n",

All I could really get out of the Dr.'s was that I have white blood cells in my stool and they tested it for multiple things and could not figure out what was causing it.  My cardiologist stopped by my hospital room yesterday and told me he was not happy about me being in the hospital again and there are some things he was going to look in to.  I have an appointment w/him next week.    I am scared with all of this sickness I have had.  Do you have any suggestions as to what kind of questions I should ask my cardiologist?

    "title": "Re: Pneumonia twice in 5 months",
    "content": "Hello Butterfly -  There are several aspects of your problem which I'd like to get some more information on: first, why a cardiologist was in charge of your case unless a) he also functions as an internist or intensivist or b) he has taken an interest in your case; second, why you would be treated for pneumonia with Prednisone if you were running a fever. Normally pneumonia with fever is because of an infection, and Prednisone would be contraindicated in most instances, as it would mask the signs of infection. Generally Prednisone is used only for pneumonias which are not caused by microbes,  such as bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP) or other forms caused by autoimmune responses.   The use of Prednisone also can suppress your immune system, which might have accounted for the second bout of pneumonia, but again there is that issue of the fever, something not usually seen except in infectious pneumonias. This takes us full circle, since iinfections are rarely treated with steroids.  As for the GI infection and why a cardiologist would be interested in that, I can only surmise that the cardiologist was following through because of having taken an interest in your case or in you as a patient. There seems to be nothing going on with your heart.   If you could provide any more details it might help to untangle the mystery. Meanwhile I certainly hope this finds you well. Please  follow up with  us.\n\n",

The inflammation caused by this extends to the Pleura [membrane covering the lungs] also, and it is this which causes,the pain when you cough.   If you are not improving with antibiotics a change is needed but this time the antibiotic should be changed as per the Culture-sensitivity testing done from the sputum.  If the pain in the ribcage has appeared or got worse, a repeat X ray shoul be done to rule out an associated Pleural Effusion [collection of fluid in the membrane].  Take care,   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Re_becca,  Pneumonia is infection of the lower resoiratory tract which consist of terminal bronchioles and alveoli that is the bubble like micro cavities responsible for gas exchange. These alveoli get infected and are filled with products of inflammation and are temporarily out of commission an cannot do their function of gas exchange. Technically this process of alveoli infection is called Consolidation. Severe forms can lead to hypoxia.[Low oxygen tension in blood.]  Complications of pneumonia can be Pleural effusion [Fluid filling bet the lungs and covering membrane], Empyema [pus in that same pleural cavity], Lung abscess, bacteremia [spread of bacteria in blood], septicemia [spread of infection throughout the body], septic arthritis, Infection of the heart muscle [myocarditis, endocarditis, pericarditis etc]. Most dreaded one is ARDS [acute respiratory distress syndrome] and respiratory failure. [You just possibly had this when your doctor said you could have died.]  I can't think of any other complication of pneumonia other than these and starting with a Ch. Your doctor could possibly mean a Chronic Bronchitis but this is not a complication of pneumonia, and an entirely different disease.  You should get in touch with your doctor on this and in fact it will throw some more light on the reason of your current breathlessness.   Apurva\n\n",

    "content": "My symptoms started out as if I had the flu. I was really tired, my throat hurt, my legs became really sore, my ears started hurting, I had chills-then later got really hot (and at some points nauseous), etc.  (All which I have read are signs of pneumonia). I got better from all that bad stuff that kept me in bed, but after that my throat was still bothersome, I was sneezing a lot etc. Two days ago I woke up and my voice was hoarse. Yesterday it was worse and today it was a little better. Along with the hoarse voice though came a bad cough. It is a dry cough. Once even when I was in a store I got a bad tickle in the throat (only in one spot) that I couldnt get rid of no matter how much I coughed. I was coughing so hard it probably sounded like I was going to throw up. I had to leave the store because it was such a horrible feeling and it wouldnt go away (but did once I ate something). I had that feeling twice before, once right before I got full blown pneumonia, and another time without pneumonia. My cough gets worse and night and worse when I lay down at night for bed. Sometimes I even have to think about breathing because it feels weird upon inhalation, a feeling I cant really describe. I have poor health insurance so a doctor visit is not the best option for me. Do you think this is walking pneumonia? Is there anyway to tell without going to a doctor? Are there any meds that can be prescribed without a visit? Thanks!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Star_4487,  Walking pneumonia is possible.  Walking pneumonia is a common name for an infection also known as an atypical pneumonia.  Atypical comes from the fact that it is caused by mycoplasma an \"atypical\" bacteria.  It is treated with an antibiotic called azithromycin.    Your symptoms may also be caused by the flu.  Influenza can cause all the symptoms you describe.  It is unlikely that you will be able to get prescription medications without being evaluated.  You may want to call your local health department.  Often there are clinics that can see patients without insurance on a free or reduced fee basis.  Your local health department can help you find these clinics.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Now i have a couple of questions, hopefully you can help in answering them.  How soon should I see benefits from amoxicillin?  So far, I noticed that I can breath a little easier and the way I cough has changed.  Still I have fevers during the day of around 39C. How soon should these fevers disappear after using amoxicillin? Is it dangerous to still have fever and continue using amoxicillin?  Although , already now there is some light improvement, how is determined whether the antibiotic is nog good enough?

    "content": "Hi Memetosan,  Typically, it will take 24-72 hours or so for the antibiotics to begin to take effect and the fevers to begin to improve.  More severe infections can take a bit longer.    It is not dangerous to continue the amoxicillin with a fever.  If you do not see your fevers beginning to improve in the next 1-2 days I would recommend you see your doctor again for a follow-up evaluation.  Occasionally, amoxicillin will not cover pneumonia (although most of the time it will).  This is usually signaled by failure of symptoms, including fever, to resolve.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "In short, I am 27 year old female who used to be very active and healthy and nonsmoker.  4 months ago I had a severe bout of strep pneumonia (in both lungs) and was hospitalized for 10 days.  I have been to numerous doctors and had tons of xrays, 3 catscans (with contrast), several blood tests and pulm function test...everything is coming normal or above normal.    HOWEVER, I am still having a 'squeezing' pain in my lower right lung when I take a deep breath in or yawn.  They are saying this might be damage to the lung wall from the pneumonia. Will it ever go away?  I have also noticed a bump on my left rib (close to the sternum) that has not gotten bigger or moved.  But it has been there since I got out of the hospital and is at times tender.  What could this be?  Lastly, it has been 4 months since I got out of the hospital and my hair is falling out.  It has been falling out for about 2 weeks and is getting noticeably thinner but no bald spots.  Could this be related to the pneumonia? And when will it stop falling out?  As you can see, I have been through quite a rough patch for the past 4 months and am getting more depressed each day.  Given my symptoms are the doctors missing something?    Sorry it's so long. Thank you in advance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ihasan,  Chest pain for some time following a severe pneumonia is not uncommon.  It may very well be that you have some inflammation of the lining of your lung (a condition called pleurisy) that is causing some of your pain, especially with deep breathing.  This type of pain is usually well treated with anti-inflammatory medicines.  The spot on your rib may be a normal area that has now become inflamed, also potentially started by the pneumonia or simple brought out the fact that it was there.  Costochondritis can cause significant pain due to the inflammation of the cartilage portion of the rib.  Regarding your hair loss, you may want to have your thyroid level checked.  Testing your cortisol level may also be helpful.  Follow up with your doctor is important to help make sure you are being treated appropriately.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I was put on 2 consecutive Z-packs.  2 weeks later after initial diagnosis, they did another chest x-ray and dr said I was still wheezing and sent me to a pulmonary specialist.  The specialist said there was a spot on the x-ray so she ordered a catscan.  I was put on 16 days of prednisone and doxycycline.  Feeling better but chest really tight.  The catscan came back with report that I have a lung lesion.  My blood tests came back positive for mycoplasma.  The dr said the z-packs should have addressed the mycoplasma so she said she was concerned.  The dr said they could not rule out cancer but it probably was just a bad infection.  They couldn't see me for 2 weeks.  I go in tomorrow but am very concerned.  Could you tell me what I can expect?  What could this possibly be?  Why can't they rule out cancer and what are the chances it might be cancer?  Thanks so much!  Wifeandmom\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Wifeandmom,  I would tend to agree that the area is probably related to infection and not cancer since you just had a bad pneumonia.  They are unable to say for sure because when a CT scan shows a consolidated lesion in the lungs it is unable to give much information about it.    You have several things that help me say that it probably is not cancer.  You are still young and you do not smoke.  I suspect that they will want to do some follow up imaging to look and see if the spot is getting better/worse or staying the same.  If it is getting better it is almost certainly related to the infection.  If it is the same or worse (still possibly due to infection) they may want to recommend you have a biopsy of the area to help determine for sure what is going on.  Azithromycin (z-pack) is the correct treatment for mycoplasma pneumonia.  Unfortunately, even with treatment, mycoplasma pneumonia still tends to cause ongoing cough/chest pain until it resolves on its own.  The antibiotic help keep the bug from being contagious but really doesn't do that much for treating an already established infection.  Best wishes.  I hope all goes well for you.\n\n",

Everybody apart from his occ health dr thinks that it is more than likely he picked the infection up at work. A more than 50% likelihood means it will be classified as work related.

But after a month the cough was still lingering and pretty bad so I went to my doctor who said my lungs were clear but felt that I had a sinus infection and was coughing from the post nasal drip.  So I was put on Augmenten for 10 days but the cough never went away.  About a week after the completion of the Augmenten the doctor put me on a cough medicine with codine and while it helped some the cough just persisted.  Last week I noticed what felt like movement in my back under my right lung when I breathed in or coughed and by the next day the movement turned into a sharp pain.  Of course I thought I must have pulled a muscle from coughing so hard and ignored it.  Well within a few days the pain spread to under my right breast, just opposite to where the back pain is.  I found it odd for the pain of a pulled muscle to spread so I went back to the doctor.  He listened to my chest and my back and said that based on the way my right lung sounds as opposed to the left he would say pneumonia except for the fact that I have no fever and feel relatively well except for the pain.  An x ray ruled out pneumonia.  The doctor did say he suspected pleuracy.  The pain is severe upon breathing in, coughing, and moving.  Breathing is extremely labored while lying down and the pain increases.  I spoke with the doctor today and he said that he cannot explain why I am still in so much pain which of course makes me more concerned.  Does this sound like pleuracy?  Thanks in advance for any help.\n\n",

One must always consider typical infections; however, at this point the body is immunocompromised, so the opportunistic infections must also be considered.    On top of this, the inflammation from your cancer may also be triggering the fevers.  I would strongly suggest you continue with very close follow up with your oncologist and consider requesting an Infectious Disease specialist consultation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Almost 2 weeks ago, he experienced rib pain, admitted himself to the hospital and was diagnosed with pneumonia. Cleared and released (although now in a rehab center), he has regained some of his strength, but after a day or so of being able to hold somewhat regular conversation, has begun hallucinating and showing signs of paranoia. It seems as though it is getting worse as time passes.  I've heard everything from possible urine infection, to withdrawal from the morphine he was (very) briefly on... We are still days away from tests, and I'd really appreciate any idea of how common something like this is, the chances of a full recovery of his faculties and the type of tests/care we should make sure is happening.

    "content": "Dear HDK, I certainly feel for you.  It is always difficult to watch a usually bright individual with all their faculties all of a sudden acting in an unusual fashion, especially when it includes paranoia.  There are so many possible reasons that he may be demonstrating these abberant behaviors at this time. Certainly infection is one possiblity, withdrawal from certain medications could contribute and the addition of any new medications could also be a factor.  I do however find that sometimes the answer is less obscure than that.  Many of our seniors keep their \"togetherness\" strong because they are usually surrounded by their loved ones and a familiar environment. Many of us, even, do not do well in strange places, with strangers in charge of our coming and our going, and to be at the mercy of someone else's choice of meals, activities and even television programming.  How much less adaptable might one be who has for the longest time been independent, and in full care of themselves?  The loss of independence is particularly frightening to many of our elders, and this fear can manifest in outbursts of paranoia, with the hallucinations being part of the mind's desperate attempt to make some sense of senselessness.  My best suggestion to you would be to include this supposition in the mix along with the attempt to isolate outside contributing factors.  Bring photographs of the family and other favorite items to the rehab as the facility permits.  Orient your grandparent to time and date, reminding him that the family is always there for him, and that he will be going home just as soon as the doctor deems him ready to go.  Above all, show patience and compassion, and share the photos with the staff members at the facility so that they also see the family involvement, and can be part of his reality grounding.

    "content": "Dear HDK,  The symptoms you are describing seem to fit a condition known as delirium.  While the exact cause is not known, this condition commonly occurs during illnesses, in the face of new medications, etc.  It does tend to be transient and often will resolve over time.  Suggestions such as Rspct4trth has made may help.  If the delirium is severe enough there are some antipsychotic medications that can help on a temporary basis until the delirium resolves.  Often delirium resolves completely after the stressor that induced it has resolved.  I expect the chances that your grandfather will make a complete recovery are high.  There are some other possible causes of this, so it is important to make sure his doctors are aware of his symptoms.  They can follow him closely and assess for any other causes.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Different viruses are known to causes the illness especially in winter. It is common to have eye symptoms with viral illness. Rhinitis and postnasal discharge result in cough due to irritation of the larynx.  - Walking pneumonia is terminology used to describe certain types of mild pneumonia in which the affected persons can continue his activity and do not have to rest in bed.   They on the other hand  may cause severe persistent (dry) cough, fever, chills, headache, and abdominal pain if left untreated, unlike a cold, it will get worse in 2 weeks if not treated properly.  The causative organism is Mycoplasma pneumonia which is responsible for majority of community-acquired pneumonia.  Direct clinical examination is essential. Chest -Xray and sputum or discharge culture (if needed) will identify the causative organism.  Follow up with your Doctor is essential for proper management.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  When symptoms persist for longer periods the possibilities are:  - Cough and nasal discharge are of the symptoms that last longer than two weeks after recovery from certain viral infections.  The respiratory tract wall  becomes hyperactive and a form of asthma may occur as spasm of the airway is easier to take place.  - If you are not properly treated or received in adequate treatment, infection and symptoms will  remain also for long time.   When your immune system becomes more weak, the organism will be more active and an acute form of the infection will be clear.  - Also if you are allergic, allergic people have similar symptoms when exposed to an allergen and the duration of illness may be prolonged.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor and to discuss with him this information.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It would be more helpful if you describe more the character of this pain, what aggravates the pain and if there are any other related symptoms or signs(dry cough, breathing difficulty etc).  Muscle spasm can cause chest pain of unidentified causes, it may occur due overexertion of the chest wall muscles after excess coughing.   Muscle spasm in many cases is the result of inappropriate posture for long time like traveling, driving, and certain types of work. These postures may not allow you to recover from the overexertion spasm caused by the previous illness.  Self care and avoiding the precipitating cause will lead to a gradual but clear improvement in the pain. Home treatment includes the use of Analgesics, cold or hot therapy. Rest for maximum two days is also beneficial  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

Being smoker and recovered recently from a pneumonia make your lung immune system weaker and more liable for repeated mild chest infections that present in the form of pleurisy.  There is no specific test to diagnose pleurisy. Auscultation of the chest shows a characteristic sound known as pleural rub. Chest x-ray sometimes showes mild pleural reaction obliteration the costophrenic recess.  Keep in mind also that smoking withdrwal symptoms include Tightness in the chest, chest pain and cough.

Abnormal Lymph node enlargement tends to commonly result from infection / immune response, cancer and less commonly due to infiltration of macrophages filled with metabolite deposits (eg, storage disorders).   Sometimes, following infection Lymph nodes occasionally remain permanently enlarged, though they should be non-tender, small (less the 1 cm), have a rubbery consistency and none of the characteristics described for malignancy or for infection.  An increase in nodal size on serial examinations is significant. Hence nodes that continue to grow in size are important and those that regress in size tend to be more reassuring.   FNAC although a very useful technique in the diagnosis of many diseases. But being negative does not exclude a pathological cause.  I advise you to follow up with your doctor.

    "content": "My husband has been sick since last Thursday with fever, cough, fatigue,  and shortness of breath.  I took him to a Prompt Care clinic on Saturday and he was diagnosed with bronchitis. He started Cipro that day but had an allergic reaction so started a Z-pack on Monday. He was also prescribed Duraphen II DM.   It has been a week now and he's not getting any better. He has been bedridden since last Thursday except for the trip to the doctor. His temperature has been over 100 and closer to 101 every day since that time. At night, it goes over 102, with 103 being the highest the night before last. He is taking Tylenol, but it is not helping. His breathing is very labored if he gets up and moves around or talks. His cough keeps him up all night. The mucus he coughs up is very thick and yellow, sometimes brown.  He also has diarrhea and no appetite.  He called the Prompt Care center today and they told him to keep taking Tylenol. I don't want to make him leave the house if that isn't necessary, but I am concerned that maybe he has been misdiagnosed.  Please advise as to whether I should seek a second opinion.   Thanks.\n\n",

One of the complications of pneumonia (aside from other conditions) in the older population and the very young is respiratory failure. When a person experiences this condition it affects other all cells and organs in the body including the heart. After the heart is taxed to such a degree, trying to pump harder to circulate blood and oxygen to organs and cells, it in turn stops as well. It would be next to impossible for me to state the exact cause of your grandfathers death. Again, my most sincere sympathies. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

Japan has many smokers but they have a lower lung cancer rate than majority of countries. This maybe associated with the antioxidants they get from 'green tea' - drink around 2 - 5 cups per day.  Antioxidants found in Green tea mops up free radicals. It  kills cancer cells and inhibits tumor growth. You will atleast minimize the risk of cancer significantly.  Also its very good for avoiding common illnesses such as  Flu, colds and can prevent food poisoning etc.. Green tea is very very good.  You should be fine. But if you want to avoid lung cancer you will need to lead a healthy life style.  Also try to follow some of the advice I just gave you.

    "content": "That's not nearly enough info - the smoking can eventually cause ED due to cutting off circulation in the tiny vessels that cause the tissue to harden.  If he truly only has one beer per day, it's ok, but if he gets even a little tipsy before sex, it can cause temporary impotence, especially if the drinking like that is daily.  Need to know if he can get an erection while masturbating, does he get erections in his sleep?  If he can and does, it's very likely psychological.  When it happens a couple of times before or during sex, men start to worry about it the next time, and that inhibits an erection, and so on.  He probably needs to have a test to measure blood pressure in the penis to rule out an organic cause.  If he has heart (coronary) disease, that is also a cause.  I also don't know how old he is; that is important.  If he is older, middle age and up he could also be suffering from a low testosterone level, although the symptoms wouldn't have been so sudden.    Certain medications like antidepressants and certain blood pressure meds can cause ED as well.  Meds for pneumonia 3 months ago have nothing to do with it.  If he has heart disease, that also\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dev,  i hope that your brother is feeling ok now.  Fever usually points to an infection whether bacterial, fungal, viral or parasitic. There are some non-infectious causes of fever as well.   Pneumonia can prove fatal if not treated.  After pneumonia, the most common cause of persistent fever is most probably infected fluid collecting in the space around the lungs. Another cause can be developing an abcess in the lung where the pneumonia was. Treatment of infected fluid collection around the lung is drainage by a chest tube placement together with antibiotics.  When a fever occurs, it is always a good thing to obtain cultures from the blood, urine and sputum and start broad spectrum antibiotics awaiting the culture results. Once the cultures results come back, antibiotic are switched to the results of the cultures and the sensitivities of the bacteria to the antibiotics.  i am not sure about malaria in south america but i think it can be a possibility.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",
