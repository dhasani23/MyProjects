    "content": "I thought I should come online to confirm that what I am planning to do is reasonable.  My cholecystectomy is scheduled for day after tomorrow.  I had one episode of feeling terrible, fever, and chills.  Several days later, I felt alittle better but my liver enzymes (always normal before) were very high (highest was in the 300s). They slowly came back to normal.  Ultrasound- done 2 months later- showed a gallstone (1cm), gall bladder polyp (1 cm) and a fatty enlarged liver.  A cholecystectomy was immediately scheduled.  The surgeon explained that it is bettter to do when I am fine than in an emergency situation (he thinks I probably had pancreatitis)  I understand this but I apparently what happened to me is unusual.  If it was just a random thing, then chances are it wont happen again so why take my gall bladder out?  Or does having it happen once increase the chances of it happening again?  I asked the PA of a liver doctor this and she said- no one knows.  Is this true?  Is so, how does one make a decision?  So how frequent is it that a gall stone (and they just found one)  blocks the common duct and causes a liver problem or a pancreatic problem?  And if it happens once, is there an increased likelihood of it happening again?   By the way, Ive had absolutely no other symptoms from the gall bladder. Thanks and please answer FAST as I need to decide immediately if I am going to cancel!\n\n",

    "content": "I was found suffering from Hepatitis c in November 2008. i went for anti-HCV, LFT, PCR-Quantitative, PCR-Qualitative, and HCV Genotype tests. the toprate of HCV-Quantitative was 274,144 IU per ml. The Genotype test said that the virus was 3a. Then I went for treatment and used interferon and ribaviron together for six moths continuously. When the second month was ending, my PCR test went negative, even then I completed the course. and my ALT dropped from 59 to 22. After that I got tested for PCR thrice after every three moths and it was negative. Now yesterday I went for LFT and in this test I found ALT again at 59. My anti-HCV test, however, has always been positive. Please suggest me what should I do? Should I need to repeat the treatment? Please guide me.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Is it a Hepatitis C Relapse case?",
    "content": "Hi, The goal of therapy for hepatitis C is to achieve a sustained virologic response (SVR), defined as undetectable HCV RNA at least 6 months after cessation of therapy. Several recent studies have shown that SVR rates after treatment for acute hepatitis C are as high as 60-100%, substantially better than those observed with therapy for chronic hepatitis C.  When interferon alpha(IFN-)is used alone, approximately 30-35 % of patients will become HCV RNA negative after treatment, but only 15-20% will have a sustained response once therapy is stopped. However, with combination therapy (IFN- and ribavirin), the initial response rate increases to 50-55% and the sustained response after treatment is completed is 35-45%. In general, combination therapy should be used unless there are contraindications to the use of ribavirin.  Longer-term observations have revealed that active hepatitis C may recrudesce in the biochemical responders with sustained viremia. A low viral load generally is taken as < 600,000 IU/ml by quantitative PCR analysis.  HCV genotype and viral load are emerging as the main independent prognostic factors in patients with chronic hepatitis C. HCV genotype non-1 infected patients have been seen to have a slightly better sustained response than genotype 1 patients. Thus,infection with HCV subtypes 2a and 2b (52% respond) or 3a and 3b (74% respond) are associated with favorable (complete and sustained) responses to IFN- treatment or combination therapy.  One other factor which may complicate the management of HCV infection (and vice versa), is co-infection with HIV. While co-infected patients can tolerate interferon therapy, few may respond and those who do may relapse. The main difficulty is the hepatotoxic adverse effects of some of the anti HIV drugs.   Studies have shown that following successful HCV treatment, co-infected patients are not more likely to relapse after HCV treatment than patients who do not have concurrent HIV infection.  HCV infection due to a non-1 genotype and the low grade viremia  are hopefully, in your favor.The ALT increase is minor and can be due to many factors.Discuss with your doctor and it is probable that nothing more than a regular monitoring of the liver enzymes may be indicated at present. Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: 25 y.o. healthy male...extremely elevated LFT",
    "content": "Hi, Liver enzymes should not be interpreted in isolation.Levels of liver enzymes must always be correlated with the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and the serum bilirubin levels.  Normal levels of AST may be 15% higher in African-American men.  May be 40\u201350% higher with high BMI. Strenuous exercise may increase it by three fold. Levels may increase more with strength training.  ALT also may be 40\u201350% higher in individuals with with high BMI. Usually, 20% lower in individuals who exercise at usual levels than in those who do not exercise or exercise more strenuously than usual. Effect of exercise seen predominantly in men (minimal differences of <10% in the case  women).   Generally, there is poor correlation between the degree of liver-cell damage and the level of the aminotransferases. The magnitude of elevation varies widely. Levels <100 IU are common and nonspecific, and of little clinical significance. Levels of 100-300 IU are frequently seen in numerous mild to moderate inflammatory processes. In acute viral or drug induced hepatitis, aminotransferase levels are typically in the 500-1,500 IU range, but in alcoholic hepatitis they are usually <300 IU, even in severe disease. Values >3,000 IU usually are seen only in acute toxic hepatic necrosis or severe hypoxia (\"shock liver\"/\"ischemic hepatitis\"). Aminotransferase levels are variable in biliary obstruction but usually remain <200 IU, except with acute passage of common duct stone, characterized by an acute rise to hepatitic levels and a steep fall over the ensuing one to two days.  In acute alcoholic hepatitis, the AST/ALT ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower.  In your case, it is difficult to attribute the very high level of ALT to exercise or alcohol alone. GGT is too non-specific. Viral hepatitis must be excluded. The possible underlying causes can not be further narrowed down without alkaline phosphatase levels, creatine kinase levels, serum bilurubin etc. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Alagille syndrome",
    "content": "Hi Alagille syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder manifesting with a number of abnormalities including those of the heart, eye, liver, kidneys and skeleton, and characteristic facial features.  The cardiac anomalies commonly seen are Fallot's tetralogy, peripheral pulmonic stenosis, atrial and ventricular septal defects, and patent ductus areteriosus.The liver abnormalities consist of a  paucity of biliary ducts or cholestatic liver disease.Liver disease is the major cause of morbidity. Because of the paucity of biliary ducts, little bile only is able to enter the duodenum.  I do not understand in which context, you would like to give her fish oil -- is she really deficient in essential fatty acids?, or is it because you feel that absorption of essential fatty acids is impaired due to lack of bile, or is it that you want to give it for its cardiovasular beneficial effects?  Omega-3 fatty acids are said to afford protection from cardiovascular disease (evidence mostly in the context of atherosclerotic heart disease and not congenital heart disease)   Several studies have shown that compared with saturated fatty acids, major dietary essential fatty acid (EFA), linoleic acid (LA)absorption and status remain relatively well-preserved despite quantitative or qualitative changes in intestinal bile salt secretion.  Of late, fish oils have raised some concerns. One major concern is that the fish from which they are manufactured may be poisoned with heavy metals and other marine pollutants.Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and mercury dioxins have been found in some species of fish.  Stomach upsets are frequent side effects of fish oil supplements. Diarrhea may also occur, large doses capable of causing potentially severe episodes.There are also reports of increased acid reflux, increased belching, indigestion, flatulence and abdominal pain. Fishy aftertaste is quite common.  These gastrointestinal side effects can be reduced by taking fish oils with meals and by starting low doses and gradually increasing the dose. However, mostly these side effects are associated with eating whole fish(potentially contaminated) rather than as the oil alone.  If the oil is fish \u2018liver oil\u2019(ex; cod liver oil), it also contains vitamin A. Large doses can result in vitamin A toxicity.  Although Omega-3 fatty acids are good for health, as far as your child is concerned, you have to critically weigh the risk- to- benefit ratio.There is an alternative source of Omega-3 fatty acids as well - and that, is from vegetarian sources. I will avoid giving a list of nuts, whole grains and green, leafy vegetables here (you can easily access them on the web) which are a rich source of alpha- linolenic acid (ALA), which in the body, gets converted to eicosapantaenoic acid (EPA), which is an omega-3 fatty acid.These do not have the risks associated with fish oils.  Therefore, you must discuss with your child\u2019s pediatrician and a dietitian regarding the need and (if needed), how best to supplement the Omega-3 fatty acids. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: failing liver or bruised from fall?",
    "content": "Hi, A fall such as you describe (more so, as you are pretty tall),is capable of causing internal injuries including major liver injuries. Fortunately, you appear not to have sustained any major damage.  Apart form major internal injuries, such a fall is capable of causing - fractures of the ribs(with or without a hemothorax), - fractures of the costal cartilages, - separations of costochondral junctions, - tears of the abdominal wall muscles(with/without hematomas),& - minor liver lacerations.  You concern about interferon-1a is well founded. Hepatic side effects that have been reported include elevated enzymes(ALTand AST), hyperbilirubinemia, autoimmune hepatitis,and jaundice. Severe liver injury (even hepatic failure requiring liver transplantation, has been reported rarely). Symptoms of liver dysfunction mostly appeared from one to six months following the initiation of therapy.  Alcohol+substance abuse+interferon-1a is indeed a formidable combination in its potential for causing liver cell injury. You must consult your doctor soon and have your abdominal trauma evaluated first (as even minor liver trauma may causes raised levels of liver enzymes).You may need an abdominal ultrasonography to begin with. If liver injury is excluded, then the liver functions need to be evaluated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 43 year old female @ healthy weight. I was drinking wine several times a week and probably would go through 3-4 bottles of white wine per week.  I take 100mg of Imitrex for migraines 5-6 times a month.  I also take Excedrin Migraine that contains 250 mg acetaminophen to try to ward off migraines 8-10x per month.  I take Ambien for insomnia - 5mg maybe 2-3 times a month. During my period I will also take Advil (400-600 mg maybe 2 or 3 times during that week for cramps). I also take a herbal constipation supplement that contains Aloes, Cascara Sagrada, turkey rhubarb, slippery elm bark, barbarry bark, phyllium, senna leaf, cayenne several times during the month.  1st blood work 5/11/10  Total Bilirubin (I don't have the breakdown for this date) 1.3 ALP 71 AST 48 ALT 58 Albumin 4.3  Because the AST was above 40 I was told to not drink or take any advil for 2 weeks and retest. I did that but continued the rest of the meds above and added in Prilosec 20 mg a day because my GERD decided to act up badly.  2nd blood work 7/2/10 Conjugated bilirubin .2 Unconjugated bilirubin 2.5 ALP 62 AST 29 ALT 45 Albumin 4.2 Doctor had me test again because of the bilirubin.  I tested on Monday 7/19  and had had 1 beer on the Sat and 1 on the Sunday.  I may have taking advil in between 7/2 and 7/19 but I don't remember - everything else (medications) would have been the same.  3rd blood work 7/19 Conjugated bilirubin .3 Unconjugated bilirubin 2.0 ALP 88 AST 61 ALT 85 Albumin 4.7  My doctor was happy that the bilirubin had come down a bit but not so happy because of the other values going up when 2 weeks before they had been fine. She had me do an ultrasound this past Friday and I am freaking out about what might have been there since the tech wouldn't give me any kind of indication at all (which I suppose is normal).  I feel fine and have no symptoms of any kind - no nausea, jaundice, pain.  Anyway, just wanted an opinion on if it's a reasonable assumption that all the medicines I take could make my values go up and down depending on what was still in my system right before the various tests.  I have had my blood tested many times before because of the Imitrex I take.  The last time I believe was 2007 (at least those are the last results I have copies of).  Everything was normal except for the total bilirubin which was 1.9 (and it was 1.8 in 2000).  This time my doctor (different) had actually been wondering if I have Gilbert's because of my bilirubin~ at least she was until my last results came back elevated too for AST/ALT.  Is it possible to have Gilbert's and have elevated AST/ALT; with the AST/ALT being caused by meds and alcohol?  thank you for any insight!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  It would be highly improper for me to suggest anlgesia for your partner(or anyone else) in a forum such as this without first hand knowledge about her condition.   Your query: \"Are there any painkillers available over the counter that will not be detrimental to her condition?\".  There is no analgesic in modern medicine(to the best of my knowledge) that is not potentially detrimental to her condition.  To discuss in general terms, choosing an analgesic in chronic liver failure(especially in decompensated chronic liver failure) is a dicey proposition. The choices are very limited and fraught with uncertainty in any individual case. The pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of an analgesic in any person with terminal liver failure can't be predicted. So, proper dosage is difficult to plan and adequate analgesia may or may not ensue.  Generally,  Paracetamol is considered relatively safe even in in the conventional doses. Non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are contraindicated.  Opioids may be used, but may precipitate encephalopathy (this is less likely with dihydrocodeine than codeine phosphate).One should keep in mind the possibility of  opioid accumulation even when administered at traditional doses.  You indicate that she has very severe tooth ache. If in case it is due to a pulp infection(pulp abscess), the pain is unlikely to be relieved with analgesics alone. Have a dental surgeon see her and decide on the management. Pain due to a pulp abscess, is almost certain to completely abate once the abscess is drained.This will obviate the need for analgesics.

    "title": "Re: rapid fluctuation of liver enzymes-viral hepatitis",
    "content": "Hi, Firstly, i must stress that one or a few of the liver function tests should not be interpreted in isolation.The entire hepatic function panel should be ideally be available along with the normal laboratory reference ranges for a meaningful interpretation.   You have provided only the AST and ALT values.Therefore, i can only answer in general terms.  Serum aminotransferases: are of two types. - alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and - aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  Elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. The AST is less liver specific than the ALT.  Elevations of the AST level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). Mild degrees of ALT level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise.Disproportionate elevations of the AST and ALT levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). The AST/ALT ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower.  Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse.  The ratio of AST to ALT may give additional clues as to the cause: - In chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis ALT > AST, - In chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis AST > ALT.  Extremes of the ratio of AST:ALT may also be sometimes useful: - ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and - <1.0 is suggests non-alcoholic liver disease.  One sample protocol (American Liver Society) for investigating a case of deranged liver enzyme levels noted as an incidental finding in a chemistry panel obtained for reasons other than suspected liver disease.is as follows...  - a review of the medication list (prescription, over-the-counter, herbal meds and supplements) and to discontinue, if possible, medications that are known to cause abnormal liver enzymes. -  patient advised to abstain from alcohol (suspect alcohol when AST > ALT and GGT elevated). - If patient is overweight, weight loss is encouraged. - Ongoing evaluation: Liver enzymes to be repeated in one month, and if still abnormal, following lab tests are recommended: HBsAg, HCV Ab,  ASMA,  Iron & TIBC (fasting), ANA, Alpha-1-antrypsin level,  SPEP,  Prothrombin time, Ceruloplasmin (if age < 40 yrs),and U/S RUQ.  AMA levels checked if alkaline phosphatase is elevated. For 'minor' elevations (ie,<1.5x normal ALT), if work-up returns negative and ultrasound is suggestive of a fatty liver, a trial of weight loss is reasonable.  I sincerely hope that you have fully recovered by now. Also, i hope that this information is useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

During this period my breast glands began to swell a little (not nociceable except without shirt). My doctor said this was a common side effect of XIPAMID which would go away when I stopped taking it. I am aware that this condition can also accompany cirrhosis itself; however it coincided only with this treatment. I have been off Xipamid for 8 weeks and otherwise my blood test results have been 'good',  but I notice no reduction in swelling (there is no pain or sensitivity). Is there anything I can do?

    "title": "Re: breast swelling from XIPAMID",
    "content": "Hi, Among the diuretics, spironolactone is a well-known cause of gynecomastia and may act by displacing androgen from the androgen receptors(anti-androgen activity) and and preventing it from interacting with dihydrotestosterone.   Furosemide(a loop diuretic) is a sulfonamide, but not a thiazide. Gynecomastia is not an adverse effect of this drug.  Thiazides and related diuretics were introduced in 1957.This group consists of a large number of sulfonamide derivatives. Since then may related compounds belonging to this group have been introduced. Xipamide is one of the newer entrants.  Gynecomastia and mastodynia are not among the accepted adverse effects of the thiazide diuretics. Xipamide is structurally related thiazide diuretics. Xipamide is a sulfonamide diuretic drug.  Gynecomastia is not a well recognized adverse effect of xipamide(to the best of my knowledge).  As you are perhaps well aware, cirrhosis of the liver is a known cause of gynecomastia. In your case, management should be directed towards the management of the cirrhosis and hopefully, in due course, the gynecomastia may subside with improving liver functions.  I would still encourage you to report this suspected event to the concerned authorities (such as the FDA in the US) in the country you live in. Every such report is vitally important in identifying adverse events. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: What causes Nutmeg liver ??",
    "content": "Hi, In congestive hepatopathy (hepatic passive congestion), the appearance of the liver which presents a close resemblance to the section of a nutmeg, a fruit of a yellowish color without and almost white within.  If chronic hepatic passive congestion continues for a long time, a condition called \"cardiac cirrhosis\" may develop (beter termed \"cardiac sclerosis\").Cirrhosis is a misnomer, as there is only very minimal nodular regeneration unlike in hepatic cirrhosis, nodular regeneration is a prominent feature.  Microscopically, the nutmeg pattern results from congestion around the central veins in the liver. This is usually due to a \"right sided\" congestive heart failure.If the passive congestion is pronounced, then there can be centrilobular necrosis.Liver infarcts may occur mostly due to arteritis as well as other causes.  A classification was developed (Roujeau, 1995) to distinguish between Stevens-Johnson Syndrome(STS)  and Toxic Epidermal Necrolysis (TEN).    - If less than  <10% of surface area of skin is involved,it will be designated as 'SJS',  - if >10%-29% will be designated as 'SJS-TEN overlap', &   - 30% or greater skin surface involvement is considered 'TEN'.  Drugs cause over 80% of all cases of SJS / TEN. However, 90-95% of TEN cases are caused only by drugs.  A number of drugs have been reported to cause SJS/TEN. Some of the common ones which are implicated are, NSAIDs, anticonvulsants(phenytoin),  paracetamol, sulfonamides, phenobarbital, carbamazepine,  lamotrigine and allopurinol.   SJS/TEN and the liver: Cholestatic liver disease, which may even precede the skin manifestations of SJS, has been reported to occur in SJS, but there have been only about 10 case reports of this association.Iam not aware of reports of SJS directly causing  cangestive hepatopathy(nutmeg liver).  HIV infection is known to be associated with TEN. HIV-related cardiomyopathy is now well recognized. This is known to lead to congestive hepatopathy.Thus, a nutmeg liver becomes a theoretical possibility. Incidentally, HIV antiviral drugs have been reported to cause SJS.  Your query does not really indicate whether you have a nutmeg-liver or you are just worried about developing one. It is best to discuss with your regular family physician in detail, your concerns. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Doctor-  Diagnosed with HCV in 1990, probably contracted in '72 when I was 15 years old. In 1997 I had a liver biopsy, it did not provide a stage #, but says \"fibrosis with significant bridging\". A prominent Hepatologist in Dallas looked at the slides in 2006 and told me it was \"overt cirrhosis\". 4 ultra sounds and numerous proddings by doctors since 1975 have always detected an enlarged spleen. I had 12 months interferon/ribavirin combo therapy in 1998, but was not a sustained responder. I had another 12 month combo therapy in 2006, virus undetectable at week 14 thru week 46. I lost my insurance imediately after that treatment so i do not know if I have had a sustained response or not, the cost of the test is prohibitive for me. During the last Interferon treatment, I developed type II Diabetes which was treated with an oral medication. At the end of the treatment, my blood glucose levels normalized somewhat, so I discontinued the diabetes pills.  This year, I am having trouble with my sugar levels again, A1C is 9.7%. I practice a reasonable diet, and have cut out all sugared foods, also rice pasta etc months ago. I am a carpenter and woodworker so I am quite active. My Doctor is having me take Metformin 1000 mgs daily the last 2 months. I have always refused to take anything not liver friendly since my HCV diagnosis. I do not drink, take aspirin etc. The Metformin literature implies it is assaulting to the liver.My Doctor does not seem concerned at all, he checked ALT (98) and seems to feel that is (low?)enough. I hate to second guess the guy, but it seems to me that long term use of this drug could speed deterioration of my liver function. I am thinking Insulin injections might be more appropriate (although much more expensive). Incidentally, my sugar levels are still high after almost 2 months on the Metformin, usually about 160 fasting in the morning. Any insight into my situation will be greatly appreciated. Thanks, Chris in Austin, Texas, 52 yrs, 5'10, 193 lbs\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hep C, Cirrhosis, and Diabetes medication question",
    "content": "Hi,  Studies show that up to 96% of patients with cirrhosis may be glucose intolerant and 30% may have clinical diabetes(DM).   DM, which develops as a complication of cirrhosis, is designated as \"hepatogenous diabetes\". Some studies indicate that this condition is  proportionately higher in patients over the age of 6o, women, people of European descent, and lower in people of African or Asian descent.  Hyperinsulinemia  and Insulin resistance in muscular and adipose tissues seem to be the underlying factors of diabetes in liver disease. An impaired beta-cell response in the pancreatic islets and hepatic insulin resistance may also be contributing factors.   Alcoholic cirrhosis, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, chronic hepatitis C (CHC) and hemochromatosis are seen to be more frequently associated with DM.   Insulin resistance increases the failure of the response to treatment in patients with CHC and enhances progression of fibrosis.   DM in cirrhotic patients may be subclinical. Hepatogenous diabetes appears to be distinct from type 2 DM, since microangiopathy appears to be less common and patients more frequently suffer from complications of cirrhosis. DM increases the mortality of cirrhotic patients (not per-se, but on acccount of the liver failure).   Treatment of the DM is rather complex in this situation due to liver damage on one hand and hepatotoxicity of oral hypoglycemic drugs on the other.  Some reports indicate that when diabetes starts before cirrhosis, the need for insulin is usually higher,than when diabetes follows cirrhosis (a low-glucose diet may be enough).  Some studies recommend that Diabetic patients with chronic hepatitis or compensated liver cirrhosis (Child- Pugh A) can be treated with oral hypoglycemic  drugs, preferably those with the shortest length of action. In the remaining patients, the use of regular insulin at meal times is recommended, avoiding delayed formulations of insulin(high risk of severe hypoglycemia).  I trust this information may be useful to you. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I agree with Liana. Your question is a valid one but you'll never be able to get an answer without a proper assessment and unfortunately not through the internet. First, we need to know which liver disease she was diagnosed with. Next your doctor needs to accurately assess the stage of liver deterioration. How severe is it?   Uncontrolled diabetes can lead to liver impairment making the situation worse.   Unfortunately, this is a complex nutritional issue. Any doctor would probably need to refer this issue to a nutritionist. There are special diets for diabetic patients and there are special diets for liver disease patients. The combination would mean you need a more customized solution.   In addition to the patient's diabetic and liver assessment she will also need a nutritional assessment. This means proper calculation of BMI, caloric requirements, hydration status and electrolytes. This condition will probably need to be treated in stages and closely monitored during the initial stages before being put on a maintenance diet.   I am sorry if I have made things seem a little too complicated. I have no way of knowing how severe the condition is but this could potentially become a dangerous situation.   Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,Dr.Fouad has rightly pointed out the need for proper diagnosis here.One condition that would need to be looked in would be Bronze diabetes.This condition is missed often when connecting liver disease to diabetes. It would be ideal to get your mother tested for serum ferritin levels.Treatment if so, would be phlebotomy ie blood letting.This would prevent organ damage if the excess iron deposit is causing both liver disease and diabetes due to pancreatic involvement.These are but random thoughts but indeed your mother needs active investigations to rule out other causes of weight loss. Hope this information is useful. My best wishes.\n\n",

Any such disrupting influence on the digestive system can lead to weight loss; however, the more rapid the weight loss, the higher the concern.  While I am unable to recommend a specific gastroenterologist, I suggest that you contact your local medical board (usually listed under county) and request the names of gastroenterologists in your area, and inquire if any have a specific interest or expertise in dealing with hepatitis C and related complications.  The effects on your liver, if any, can be determined by your doctor through blood tests and/or liver biopsy.  I hope this information is helpful to you, and I wish you the best of luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, brooklynboro,  Your description of your friend indicates that he does not have known liver disease or alcohol dependence.  The liver is a complex and very busy organ, with many functions.  It detoxifies substances introduced into the body, including alcohol and medications among many others.  It helps make amino acids to build protein, as well as both forming glucose and breaking down glucose, it makes cholesterol and triglycerides, participates in several mechanisms affecting blood proteins and clotting factors, produces bile which is needed for the digestion of fats, and provides storage.  Overusage of substances will make the liver work harder, whether it is alcohol, tylenol, fat, or any number of other things.  Thus, if your friend or other person is moderate in the ingestion of these things, the outlook is good that he will maintain healthy liver function.  If he has any doubts or concerns, please refer him to his doctor for evaluation and further information.  I hope this is helpful.  Good luck to him, and to you.\n\n",

My doctor says that based on my blood test results, and ultra sound that i cant have cirrhosis, so what has caused my symptoms??? he said i would have swollen ankles and legs, and fluid on the abdomen, and spider navei, and jaundice if i had cirrhosis. He says my symptoms are no specific.  I asked if i could have a biopsy done, and i was told that my bloods and ultrasound were ok, so he couldnt refer me.

    "title": "Re: Have I got cirrhosis of the liver?",
    "content": "Hi, Liver function tests need to be interpreted with caution. Abnormal values (especially those of AST & ALT) should be interpreted with an extra amount of caution.  Slight AST or ALT elevations (<1.5 times the upper limits of normal ref range) do not always indicate liver pathologies.   Unlike the biochemical values in general, serum AST and ALT levels do not follow a normal bell-shaped statistical distribution in the population. In the case of the typical bell-shaped statistical distribution, normal is defined as the mean of the distribution \u00b1 2 standard deviations (SDs). Going by this definition, 2.5% of normal individuals will have values above the normal range. As the curve(for serum AST and ALT levels) is generally skewed, this results in more normal individuals stumbling into the 'slightly above normal' range.  Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse.   Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase(GGT) is too non-specific. May be raised in many disorders( liver and others). Guidelines published by the National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry and the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases do not recommend routine use of GGT. These guidelines suggest that it can be useful in determining the cause of a high ALP.   In patients in whom the alkaline phosphatase (ALP) test values are elevated but, other tests such as AST and ALT are not, then a GGT test may be useful to determine whether the high ALP is due to a bone disorder or a liver pathology. GGT may also be useful in people with a history of alcohol abuse to monitor compliance with the de-addiction program.  Patients with cirrhosis usually show the following profiles.   Mild or latent (compensated):\u00ad - Increased GGT (alcohol drinking must be excluded). - often have normal or only slightly elevated serum AST and ALT levels and ALP. - Elevated postprandial plasma bile acid levels(a newer & perhaps more sensitive liver function test).  Severe (decompansated) 1- raised serum bilirubin. 2- Fall in plasma albumin with elevated globulins. 3- Prolonged prothrombin time. 4- Aminoaciduria, increased plasma ammonia and reduced blood urea associated with development of acute hepatic failure.  Your symptoms, signs and liver function tests appear to be non-specific (just as your doctor felt). It is likely that alcohol misuse might have been be a very significant factor. Discuss with your doctor and consider ways of treating your problem with alcohol(if it still exists).  Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Understanding blood test results (ALT)",
    "content": "Hi, The 'normal' laboratory reference ranges vary between laboratories. As you have not indicated the reference range, interpretation based on the values provided is not advisable. However, i will discuss in brief, how these tests are interpreted.  Serum Bilirubin: this exists in the serum in two forms - conjugated (water soluble)& - the unconjugated (water insoluble) forms.  Normally, 90% or more of  serum bilirubin is in the unconjugated form.   Normal values (one sample reference range): - total bilirubin:  0.3-1.2 mg/dl (1.7-17.0 mmol/L),   - direct bilirubin: 0.1-0.4 mg/dl, &  - indirect bilirubin: 0.2-0.8 mg/dl.  An increase in serum bilirubin concentration to above 2.5 mg/dl results in clinical jaundice. When the total bilirubin level is raised and the major portion (90% or more) happens to be unconjugated, liver disease is unlikely. This situation raises two possibilities.  - Gilbert's syndrome: patients are usually young and otherwise healthy & asymptomatic individuals. It is an inherited disorder affecting conjugation of bilirubin in the liver. All the other standard liver function tests are normal. In these individuals, 90% or more of the total bilirubin will be unconjugated. - Hemolysis is the other possibility.   The AST, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP) tests are most useful to make the distinction between hepatocellular and cholestatic disease.  Serum aminotransferases: are of two types. - alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and  - aspartate aminotransferase (AST).  Elevations of these are the two of the most useful indicators of liver cell injury. The AST is less liver specific than the ALT.   Elevations of the AST level may also be seen in acute muscle injury, (cardiac or skeletal muscle). Mild degrees of ALT level elevation may occasionally be seen in skeletal muscle injury or even after vigorous physical exercise.Disproportionate elevations of the AST and ALT levels when compared with the alkaline phosphatase level arise in diseases that primarily affect hepatocytes (ex; viral hepatitis). The AST/ALT ratio is not very useful in determining the cause of liver injury, except in acute alcoholic hepatitis, wherein, the ratio is usually > 2 and the AST level is 400 IU/mL or lower.  Common causes of mild increases in AST and ALT levels is fatty liver disease seen most often in the context of obesity, diabetes, hyperlipidemia and alcohol abuse.   The ratio of AST to ALT may give additional clues as to the cause: - In chronic liver disease with early cirrhosis ALT > AST,  - In chronic liver disease with established cirrhosis AST > ALT.   Extremes of the ratio of AST:ALT may also be sometimes useful:  - ratio >2 suggests alcoholic hepatitis, and  - <1.0 is suggests non-alcoholic liver disease.  Elevations of direct-reacting bilirubin does not always mean that a patient has a cholestatic (obstructive) liver disease.  In many types of liver disease raised or normal direct bilirubin levels may be seen, while the liver enzyme levels often elevated. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,You would rather be surprised to hear that alcohol is a not a stimulant but it really depresses the nerves by which it causes a so called stimulation.Also it is not absorbed like regular food and enters to blood stream to go to structure like brain with high water content.Irritation to gastric mucosa is the first thing that can happen.Liver can handle equalent to a big bottle of beer in an hour.A steep increase in blood sugar and the response of pancres can lead to hypogycaemia.Tolerance can develop and making a person to take more to get the same feel.Withdrawl symptoms can lead to morning shakes and hallucinations.Liver can become fatty or later fibrosed leading to cirrhosis.Secondary diabetes is a possiblity and obesity too.Driving would become unsafe,and could interact with other drugs.3 units perday ie 750ml of averadge strength beer a day should be maximum to avoid complications.Best wishes\n\n",

    "content": "I have a pain in my right quadrant.   I have been experiencing this pain for 10 years and have learned to deal with it.  Started running and couldn't deal with it anymore.  Had a CT scan that showed my kidney was ballooned up with urine.  Had surgery to cut out bad part and repair squeezed ureter.  Surgery took care of some of the pain but not all of the pain.  Doctor thought maybe gallbladder because fatty foods (big fat juicy steaks and milk products)  produce pain.  Ultrasound showed no stones and HIDAscan revealed gallbladder has 18% function.  I am not experiencing chills,nausea, vomitting, or shoulder pain,  sometimes the pain goes from my side(right in the middle) to my lower back (Lymph node area rt side only) sometimes to under my ribs, it has never gone up to my shoulder blades.  After I work out.  I have an ache in the middle.  After sitting for over an hour, I experience aching in the lymph node area as well.  After standing I cannot move whole lower back (think this is out of shape though)Woke up with huge dull ache right in the middle, had two large bm's and pain is gone.  I do not handle alcolhol well either.  When I do have too many (4 drinks) I vomit all the next day(yellow) Do I need to have my gallbladder removed?  My doctor that diagnosed my kidney as a cyst says I do and doesn't guarentee that this is even the cause of my pain. I don't feel that My symptoms are matching gallbladder symptoms that I find on the internet.  The 2 large bm's this morning and then pain leaving make me think not on the gallbladder as well.  Milk bothers me and potatoes, but am able to eat processed foods with no pain.Fresh vegies and fruit do not produce any pain, but I do love meat. not pork.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hida scan results 18% but not gallbladder symptoms",
    "content": "Hi, You mention that the gall bladder function is 18%. i wonder if you are referring to a gall bladder ejection fraction of 18%?.  Cholescintiscans (HIDA scans) are known to have significant false positive and false negative results.Therfore, should be interpreted with caution.  Pain of acute cholecystitis and biliary colic do not always follow the 'Text book' description of their symptomatology.They are known to sometimes present with epigastric(rather than right hypochondrial)pain and the classical description of pain being referred to the right scapula or the right shoulder may not be always present.  If your HIDA scan showed an ejection fraction of 18%, it is likely to be indicative of s 'gall bladder dyskinesia'. Even if one does not have symptoms,this kind of a  gall bladder predisposes one to gall stone disease. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "In May 2009 I underwent an ERCP due to upper right quadrant pain similar to pain with a gallbladder attack. I had my gallbladder out in 2001.  Prior to the ERCP,  I had an abdomen CT scan which was normal, sonogram which was also normal, liver function tests normal except slightly elevated alkaline phosphatase.  I had an open MRI (can't handle closed ones) and it showed dilated bile duct with possible stone.  The ERCP showed no stones and ducts were all fine. However, mamometry done on pancreatic sphincter showed pressure exceeding 60 mm Hg.  A sphincterectomy was performed.  I am now having the same terrible pain.  I have been to the ER but only get pain relief and then am sent home.  My GI doc doesn't want to help as he thinks besides the pain all my tests are normal.  I think I need another ERCP to see if the site has closed over with scar tissue and needs to be reopened.  Does anyone have any ideas what I can do?  Can scar tissue form this quickly and in the amount it would take to close off the opening?   I am in so much pain and feel that my doctor is not listening.  Katrinka\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Symptoms of sphincter of Oddi dysfunction (causing postcholecystectomy syndrome) at times persist despite what appears to be adequate management(as in your case).  Why a few have persisting symptoms, is not clear.  The initial option is for your regular doctor to try various non-surgical modalities based on clinical examination and symptoms. (it has been noted that in patients who abuse narcotics or alcohol,  management of pain is often unsatisfactory).  If all non-surgical options do not work, 'open' surgery (sphincteroplasty) may be considered.   Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I am a 26 year old male and for the past year I have been suffering from flucuating liver enzymes levels. The highest they have been the past year was 586 and the lowest 121. I have been on different types of medication, have been checked and cleared for Hep A,B and C and got an ultrasound which showed no problems.  I feel I have done everything in my capacity to combat this issue yet my levels are taking a long time to go back to normal. and seem to be back on the rise. Please help!  ===================================================  Here is a brief history of my levels:  July 2005:    Gamma GTP: 285 (Please note I was drinking alcohol at this time, unaware of any seriousness of this result)  May 2006*: Gamma GTP: 175 (Stopped drinking alcohol for one month and using  medicated Milk Thistle tablets)  June 2006*: Gamma GTP: 238 (Moderate alchol intake, maybe 2- 3 drinks per week, using Milk Thistle tablets )  August 2006*: Gamma GTP: 586 (After this test result I went off drink completely and have stayed off drink until now, December 2006)  September 2006: Gamma GTP: 190 (In September I was using herbal medication called HepAid)  November 2006: Gamma GTP: 121 (Medicated HepaBiol)  December 2006: Gamma GTP: 125 (After using the HepaBiol I feel that it has not worked well and I am considering using Milk Thistle and the herbal HepAid again)  ===================================================  I am happy in the knowledge that the levels do seem to be coming down. However some issues that I am concerned about include:   *Between July 05 and May 06 the levels went down when I did nothing to combat it at this time and continued consuming alcohol. Any ideas why?  *Between June 06 and August 06 I almost cut alcohol out completely yet it escalating to a very alarming level. Any ideas why? Was this because it had to escalate to this peak before falling?  *Between August 06 and September 06 it fell a great deal and seems to however now seems to have stopped falling again.  *Now in December 06 after abstaining from alcohol it seems that it may be on the rise again as I would have imagined it would have at least fallen a little this past month.    Therefore I wish to ask:  What else should I do to help advancing the levels to their normal range of 11-65?   Also would it be okay to please have a glass of wine this Christmas and how much would it effect it? I do not want to tarnish the work I've put in yet crave a nice red wine this festive season! You can be frank!!!  I am aware that this situation is not quite serious and I have made good progress but now after 6months trying to bring the levels down I am growing quite frustrated by it.  What else should I do to help my levels get back to normal soon.  Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It seems that your liver enzyme fluctuation is greatly affected by alcohol intake. It is not defined yet the amount of alcohol that can be taken daily with no risk of liver damage, partly due to personal variation and sensitivity to alcohol. Some defined moderate intake as no more than two drinks a day for men and one for women. Some also believe that wine is less damaging than hard liquor. Although others showed contrary data.   Keep in mind that this is the amount may be allowed before any evidence of liver damage. If liver damage is documented and due to alcohol intake, alcohol intake should be stopped to render liver enzymes into normal or near normal.  The majority of patients with alcoholic liver disease have enzyme levels in a lower range than those of viral diseases,e.g. AST(SGPT) is usually under 300 units/liter while the(SGOP) ALT is usually under 100 units/ liter. If higher levels are found ,other causes should be excluded and this is what your doctor did by other lab tests and US investigation.  If alcohol is responsible for the abnormal liver enzyme levels, stopping alcohol would render  the enzyme levels to normal or near normal levels in period of time that may reach few months.   Of importance avoiding any medications and any unhealthy food that would add to the liver damage and further enzyme elevation.  Any drugs, herbs, etc that are taken should be checked with your consultant to avoid further liver damage.   Follow up with lab tests, Abdominal US is essential. Keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Gilbert's Sydrome - still be a candidate to donate a liver?",
    "content": "Hu, Firstly let me appreciate your motivation.Assuming that your mother has been cleared as a  potential recipient for a liver transplant, let us recall a few known facts.....   Augustine Gilbert and Pierre Lereboullet first described Gilbert syndrome in 1901(an autosomal recessive condition). Thought to be most common inherited cause of unconjugated hyperbilirubinemia. This condition appears to affect about 5-10% of the population (you can surely imagine how many of those might have volunteered to donate a liver!).Therefore, studies on liver donors(with Gilbert's syndrome) are understandably scarce.   The first documented kidney transplant in the United States was performed June 17, 1950(Illinois,USA) and The first human liver transplant was performed in 1963 in USA(Denver, Colorado).Thus, follow-up studies following liver transplants (both on the donor and the recipient) are understandably less than in the case of kidney transplants.  People with Gilbert's syndrome have been shown to have a decreased risk of (1/3 the risk for both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease)-Those with mildly elevated levels of bilirubin (1.1 mg/dl to 2.7 mg/dl) were at a lower risk.How much of this benefit would pass onto the recipient is not known!.  People with Gilbert's syndrome may lack other enzymes in their livers as well. A subset of people with Gilbert's may have an increased risk of paracetamol toxicity. How the transplanted liver from a donor with Gilbert's would react to the various drugs normally administered following a liver transplant is also not fully known.  Criteria for donor selection include 'absolute' and 'relative' contraindications.Protocols for Donor (and recipient) selection may vary between institutions.Especially regarding potential donor with Gilbert's(to the best of my knowledge),protocols may be all the more variable. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "title": "How fast can fibrosis progress to late stage cirrhosis?",
    "content": "I understand that the speed of the progression of liver disease can be highly variable, so let me give you as much information as I can and explain why I'm asking this question so that you have a context. I'm sorry if this is long, but all the information is pertinent and a man's life may be at stake here. You can skip all the way to the end to see the the main question, but it's basically the same thing I asked in the subject line.  I have a friend whom I've known for less than a year. He's been an alcoholic for at least 10 years. He's 40 years old. He has a job, but he drinks several beers during his work day in order to avoid withdrawal (his employer turns a blind eye). He probably drinks something like 15 beers a day and his blood alcohol is probably a consistent 0.4, but he is habituated and he has no problems with coordination/ safety at work.   Unfortunately, I don't know the details of his prognosis. He couldn't explain much to me in detail, other than the doctor told him \"it's pretty bad\" during his most recent visit. He's mentioned possibly getting a liver transplant from his brother, but that doesn't necessarily imply that he's already progressed to the point of needing a transplant.  My guess is that he's got a significant amount of scar tissue in the liver, but he's not showing outward signs of later stage cirrhosis at this point. Again, I'm working with limited info. I don't know what his test results were. I guess the main thing I want to get across is that there's no jaundice or edema or many of the other symptoms. There has been wasting over the past year or two, however.  This man tried to detox at home recently, which is obviously a very bad idea (he was taking Ativan, at least). He made it through about 3 days, but was ultimately unsuccessful. He's an Army veteran and he tried to detox at the VA hospital once, and I think they locked him up in the psych ward or something. The bottom line is that he DID NOT want to go back there under any circumstances.   He also smokes and has a history of other addiction (mostly methamphetamine but that was in the 90's) and depression (currently being treated with Prozac).   Here's the crux of the issue: He's found a detox center through the VA that he's willing to go to. I asked him when and he said March 1st. I asked him if he could have scheduled this any sooner and he said yes, but that he intentionally scheduled it in March due to job considerations. I told him that he should go in immediately, as any sane person would.Obviously, he doesn't see this as a time sensitive issue. Perhaps it won't be a time sensitive issue, but there's no good reason to wait. He is very stubborn. I need a very compelling argument.  So he's going to intentionally wait 4 months when he could probably do this within a couple of weeks. Like I said, I'm trying to convince him to go ASAP, but I'm looking for something tangible that I can use to persuade him. Otherwise, he just thinks that I'm giving him the standard line. I need more hard information. My fear right now is that he's sitting on the precipice, and that those extra 4 months could be the tipping point. That's just my gut feeling based on what little I remember of his description of what his doctor told him.  I want to be able to say something like, \"Research has shown that liver disease can progress very rapidly, and that 4 months could prove to be the the difference between reversible and irreversible liver tissue damage.\" You know what I mean?   So, finally, back to the question....How fast can the progression of liver disease occur? How fast can fibrosis turn into cirrhosis and ultimately into liver failure? I know it's a tough question based on the lack of information, but I need something, anything to go on. If you were me, what would you tell him from a medical standpoint?  Thank you so very much for reading this. I really, really appreciate it.\n\n",

Finally, as i can sense your urgency, it  would be very useful if you could let me have the following details as soon as you can so that i can decide if can ever convince him at all! ... - does your friend currently use methamphetamine? - Has he any viral disease such as the ones i outlined above? - Which part of the world he is residing (mortality from alcoholic cirrhosis is reported to be higher in african americans and hispanics in USA) - what were the results of his most recent liver function tests? - Has your friend ever tried Disulfiram(has been in use for  adjunctive treatment of severe alcoholism- and has been reported to cause acute liver failure). Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm experiencing a slight burning sensation from just upper right of my navel and over to my hip bone and down toward the right side pelvic region. This began about a year ago and hasn't changed much since. I've cut back significantly on drinking beer that past month. Before that I was a heavy daily drinker for about 10 years. No other symptoms, just that mild burning feeling.  My liver panel is normal. CT scan (back in February this year) with contrast was normal. Two ultrasounds, one in February and another in September this year showed nothing but a slightly enlarged liver. Doctors don't seem to be concerned with this. Colonoscopy performed, and all good there. Endoscopy showed an inflamed stomach and was prescribed nexium which is hard to tell if it's working or not when I take it.  Could there be something seriously wrong with my liver despite the testing I've gone through? My doctor says I don't have any gall stones. Could there be other problems related to my gall bladder that could cause such a thing? Any thoughts would be greatly appreciated.   I'm a 38 year old male with a healthy diet. I'm not over weight either.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Eric55,  It is a little unusual for the liver to cause a burning feeling.  The pain may be related to an inflamed stomach, which can give a burning feeling, although the area usually affected is in the center of the abdomen above the belly button and just below the ribs.  Another possibility would be nerve pain.  It may be that you have damaged one of the nerves supplying sensation to the area causing it to be chronically inflamed.  My suspicion is that this is not the liver but something else that is causing your pain.  I'd recommend you follow up with your doctor to continue to work this up.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Simply having a hepatitis virus should not be equated with decrease in sex drive (libido).   It is the chronicity and whether cirrhosis has supervened will possibly dictate if sex drive will be adversely affected and by how much.  L-Arginine does appear to have positive effects on spermatogenesis as well as libido (as some studies have reported).   But, one should not forget to read about the cautions they advise...  At present if anyone wishes to enhance their libido by using L-Arginine must be willing to accept the risk of encouraging herpes virus infection (if any), to risk of enhanced growth of any occult malignant tumor (which they may be harboring) and a possible adverse effect on the heart (especially if one already had an 'heart attack').

    "content": "I have a bit of a complicated question. Here it goes:  I initially had a paramed exam done to qualify for medical insurance. They called me two days prior to the exam and instructed me to fast 8 hours prior to the exam. However, the days prior to the exam I had had at most 1 beer - so lets say 4 beers that week. The results revealed that I had a high GGT  (147) score. They denied me for insurance. They used a range of 0-45.  I received the results about a week later and I had just returned from a business trip, I had two glasses of wine. After reading up on GGT I have learned that alcohol, even consumed earlier in the week can severely affect the test, as it is very sensitive. So I waited approximately 5 days before I had a second blood test to evaluate my GGT. The results revealed that once again my GGT was high  (67) in a range of 0-60.  All of my other tests are normal, including my ALT, AST and Bili. Tot. None of the results are in the high range.  I am pretty certain that this is just a fluke, as I don't have a history of alcoholism or even severe drinking. Additionally, my GGT results are severely different.  I'm 24 years old, female and within the normal weight range. I have never had a problem with my liver and don't have any symptoms of liver disease.  How long should I wait to retest? What other factors could be affecting my results?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Isolated high GGT, retested",
    "content": "Hi vettechick, An isolated elevation of the GGTP level does not need to be further evaluated unless, there are additional clinical risk factors for liver disease.  An isolated high value for GGTP is not usuallly considered in any way as the hallmark of chronic alcoholism.  If it is accompanied by a raised MCV (mean corpuscular volume) and BAL (blood alcohol levels), then it assumes significance.  In social drinkers, blood alcohol levels may return to normal in the short term if they abstained, but in chronic alcoholics, even if they abstained,GGTP and MCV may take much longer to return to normal levels. Good luck!\n\n",

Ok, I'm 26 years of age never touched alcohol until I was at the age of 23 , I'm in no way an alcoholic , I drink only on the weekend and now down to only one day a week. I go out with my friends we have drinks we all usually get \"drunk\"...now here's my question...  When I first started drinking it effected me almost not at all, if always be clear headed when drinking .... I could drink all night if I wanted to and it would almost never effect me ...unless I drank stupidly and just blacked out when I've never done...   Well about a year ago I was drinking as usual the night was fine I came home when to bed and it seemed like something drastically switched inside of me .... Not like a hangover feeling like something else was wrong... From that day on , when I drink it effects me a lot... I get drunk much quicker ... I always feel bad the next day when before I felt no hangover effects ....and it seems like it's getting worse and worse everytime i drink ...even though the amount of times I drink monthly has reduced drastically.  I drank last night for the first time in I'd say 3 weeks but it felt progressively worse than the last time I had drank.  Could there be maybe a kidney or liver failure? Of does this just happen to everyone after they have been drinking for a while?   Thanks,  K\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Studies have shown that there are possible genetic differences between races, families and individuals in their response to the effects of alcohol. Even in mice, relation between activity of the brain mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2) and consumption of ethanol has been extensively studied and being studied ('drinker' and 'nondrinker' animals!). For example, some studies have observed that about 70-80% of the orientals have aversion to alcohol (development of severe flushing attacks) whereas, only 0-20% of occidentals seem to have aversion. I am not suggesting that you may have genetic aversion to alcohol....but, in the absence of any other tangible explanation, one has to necessarily look for other alternative explanations! It may be worth ascertaining that the liver & renal functions are indeed OK. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi AilingBlackLab, According to previous information provided by the American College of Gastroenterology acetaminophen should not exceed the package labeling. However new guidelines have been established by the FDA. You are correct in stating, people with liver disease should not exceed the FDA recommended limit of 3200mg. One of the reasons prompting the recommended lower dosage is because there are many other over the counter products that contain acetaminophen. People will take two acetaminophen tablets and then take Alka Seltzer Plus Cold for example, which also contains acetaminophen. There is a great deal of care recommended in reading package labeling and I would suggest that you not exceed the FDA recommendations. Best wishes! Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "title": "Effects of \"Pure\" Nicotine",
    "content": "Hi all,  I've been doing some research about the effects of nicotine on the mind and body administered in ways other than through cigarette smoking.  There have been mounds and mounds of studies done on tobacco use through combustion and inhalation, and it's no secret that the risks are incredibly high in many ways by consuming tobacco like this.  However, because of the strong (and rightly so) message from the anti-smoking lobby just to get people to stop, or not to start, smoking, sometimes the message is quite convoluted.  Nicotine is the main active chemical which tobacco users crave, and indeed is what causes the addiction, however cigarettes contain thousands of other compounds and cancer-causing agents which are the primary reason that they are so unhealthy.  Nicotine seems to be just another one of the \"bad bunch\" in there that has absolutely no benefit but to take lives.  But that doesn't really seem to be the case.  Just from browsing Wikipedia articles and other information online, nicotine in its pure form, though toxic at high doses, seems to offer many benefits when administered through methods other than combustion, such as Nicorette stop-smoking patches.  There seems to be a real lack of knowledge about pure nicotine's effects on humans, and the few studies that I have looked at are mostly positive.  It shows some protective effects against the onset of Alzheimer's disease, for example.    One thing I have noted is that nicotine is metabolized largely in the liver and kidneys.  Not being a medical student at all myself, I am wondering whether the metabolization of this compound itself could have any negative effects?  What causes damage to organs such as the liver and kidneys?  Is it the large-volume metabolization of any compounds, or are some worse than others?  The reason I'm asking beyond pure curiosity is because I've begun occasionally using \"snus\", a type of steam-cured Swedish tobacco held in the mouth with no carcinogens and very low nitrosamines.  I've never used cigarettes, I exercise and eat quite healthily, with no significant medical history in my family.    The obvious answer of many would be simply not to use any form of tobacco unless one is already addicted to it, but used occasionally (a \"snuff\" every few days), and produced in a very safe manner, it seems that the only health concern with this product is the effect of nicotine on the system and the potential for addiction.  What do you think?\n\n",

You know nicotine is, in itself, addictive, and I'm sure you also know because of your having done extensive research, that nicotine serves to increase heart rate and blood pressure, not only during use but also over time, which may set it apart from caffeine as a problem stimulant. Further, you must have noted the conncection between nicotine and possible pancreatic disease, which is nothing to sneeze at.  Since you're as well informed on the subject and aware of the controversy surrounding this form of tobacco, and since you've made an informed decision, there's really nothing to be added to the knowlege base you've accumulated. I'm not going to advocate use of anything with a potential for harm, and can only repeat back the information you've listed here. I'm not sure whether your're looking for an advocate to support your decision to use this substance, but you're equipped with all the available information, so your decision is yours and so is the responsibility for any potential consequences.   That's what I think, anyway.\n\n",

    "content": "\"snus\", a type of steam-cured Swedish tobacco held in the mouth with no carcinogens and very low nitrosamines.  I'll play devils advocate here and state (without having any facts) , that I'd bet my bottom dollar ,if the manufacturer backed up this claim in writing that the product was \"Scientificly evaluated\" and was proven void of carcinogens, that the manufacturer paid for that study, and had a pre-determined outcome,that being void of anything but Nicotine.  Take a step back and wrap your mind around this idea....If they were able to eliminate all toxic compounds other than nicotine, then why not go the extra mile and eliminate the nicotine? They aren't looking to sell you a product to offer any benefit. They are looking to sell you a product you will become addicted to, thus guaranteeing them your future buisness...they are not worried that you will find alternative sources for nicotine, because they played on your fear of the side effects of all the possible other sources.  The minds of the most brilliant people in the world suffer from the same cognitive errors that the rest of us do, and one major cognitive error is to focus only on the positive. Once the mind compiles enough positive data on a subject it then begins to discount the negative, now matter how glareing a single negative might be.  A few negatives for you extracted from http://www.drugs.com/sfx/nicotine-side-effects.html  Ocular Ocular side effects including vision problems reported in at least two patients have been associated with the use of the nicotine gums.  Endocrine Endocrine side effects have included hyperinsulinemia and insulin resistance during the long-term use of nicotine gum.  Hematologic Hematologic side effects have included increases in platelet aggregation and enhanced thrombus formation.  While they pertain to nicotine gum you would be recieving nicotine via the same delivery method, hence it would be logical to assume the same side effects could occur.  Why wouldn't the manufacturer inform you of these possibilitys?  Because it's not in their best interest to tell you something bad can happen from using their product...They want you as a customer.  If they quoted a doctor as saying it's free of carcinogens, first off how much did they pay him to say that ?(No Doctor would bang down the door of a company to endorse their product, they must be courted and in some fashion persuaded to do so.) Maybe the Doctor is on the board of directors of the manufacturer? Maybe he developed it and has reduced many of the risks associated with tobacco? If they attempted to market it as a stop smoking aid they would have to tell you of the possible side effects assosiated with nicotine,if they wanted it available in the U.S. market, but since they are marketing it the same way RedMan, Skoal and anyother chewing tobacco is ,all they have to tell you is that it contains nicotine.  Use your head man! Don't only look at the positives....If it could help stem the tide of alzheimers, I'm quite sure Neurologists the world over would be testing this , as it can easily be extracted in its pure form. If these tests are ongoing , why not wait for them to come to some conclusions as to an effective dose or delivery method?  It would really suck if the proper dose to be effective to combat alzheimers , turned out to cause insulin resistant diabetese or a pulmonary embolisim from a blood clot caused by increased platelet count, and put you in your death bed long before alzheimers could even develop now wouldn't it?\n\n",

I had complete blood work done in August 2005 and everything came back good except my AST level was 56 (high) and ALT was 24 (normal).  Just recently I had complete blood work done again and my AST level was 90 and ALT was 55.  My doctor ordered an ultrasound and more blood work that I had done last week.  I have not heard anything yet but was concerned about my results as the technician that did my ultrasound asked the radiology department doctor to look at my pictures to make sure they looked okay for a doctor to interpret.  I asked her if there was any problems and she said a doctor would have to let me know in 3 days.  What would make my levels continue to rise?  and if your liver can repair itself how long does that normally take?  Thank you for any input.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Mild elevations of the liver enzymes are usually discovered during routine blood tests in healthy individuals.  AST and ALT levels may reach twice the upper limits of normal in individuals with fatty liver (obese individuals, diabetic, and alcoholics even mild intake). The lipid profile should be assessed in these individuals.   Many medications result in elevation of liver enzymes, like analgesics, some antacids, hormones, vitamin A and antibiotics. Viral infection is a common cause of elevated liver enzymes but enzymes are usually very high.  So, levels higher-than-normal do not always indicate liver disease.  Elevated AST and or ALT levels should be considered together with complete history and physical examination for proper interpretation.  Isolated mild elevation of liver enzymes is considered abnormality and significant if it continues for six months or if rapid progression occurs. US of the liver is very helpful in the diagnosis.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Hope you find this information useful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Sudden onset of Jaundice, after recent drug use,Gilberts",
    "content": "Hello --  Have you looked at your eyes in a mirror or had a friend look at the whites of your eyes? Jaundice will show up  there before it will in the extremities, and this would be an odd presentation at any rate. That being said, you have been diagnosed with Gilbert's, so this is not out of the question, although I would still have a look at the whites of your eyes to confirm this is jaundice.   Now then: you mentioned crystal meth and vicodin. Whle methamphetamine shouldn't provoke jaundice (and out of respect for the Gilbert's diagnosis we'll assume that's what it is), vicodin, which is a combinaton of opioid and acetaminophen (the latter somewhat toxic to the  liver and so potentially a trigger for jaundice in Gilbert's patients) could account for this. You also have engaged in some behaviors that could put you at risk for liver disease, so again this is a remote possibility.   If you don't have health insurance and this does not resolve on its own (Gilbert's runs a pretty benign course as a rule) you might consider looking up a free clinic to have bloodwork for liver function tests. If this is negative there's probably no liver concern, but then if the problem continues or spreads you might need to spring for an out-of-pocket checkup with a regular MD. Hopefully this will resolve on its own in the meantime.   Again,  check the eyes for jaundice, and congratulations on your having learned something from  your experiences. Your health isn't worth sacrificing for a good time, especially when there are good times available that are pretty much risk free. Life is exciting enough without playing on the railroad tracks. :)  Good luck  to you. Please follow up with  us here as needed.\n\n",

The doctor says he doesn't know, and it's hard to diagnosis the cancer w/o invasive scoping which only has 50-50 chance of finding it anyway. I have no pain or appetite loss or other symptom whatsoever, except for the last week have had generalized itching. The enlarged bile ducts were found in October (5 months ago) when I went to emergency room w/ a short bout (8 hours) of acute chills/fever, shaking, and vomiting. Nothing else was found to be wrong with me after a night of much testing and scanning, and I felt 100% better and went home. I had three of these short bouts in a 3 or 4-week period. There was NO pain associated w/ these bouts, and I still have no pain. The bouts were similar to a reaction to an infection, and they have not recurred in these past 4-5 months. There is no way of knowing if I have had the enlarged bile ducts for many years, or what my previous CA 19-9 was because never tested before. I will be 86 in May but, besides arthritis, have always been healthy, not a drinker or smoker. Only symptoms are the enlarged ducts, the CA 19-9 level, and now the itching. No jaundice.

    "content": "Hello --  Since you had no baseline CA19-9 level before this first test, it would indeed be difficult to make anything of this one test. A followup test, later on, might give some idea of whether or not there might be a pancreatic tumor.  The scope testing would be pretty unpleasant, and since the first tumor marker test is basically of no use (although subsequent ones might be), it would probably be of little practical value to do the scope, compared with the risks and discomfort.  The symptoms actually sound a lot more like  cholecystitis (gallbladder disease) than pancreatitis or pancreatic tumor. The itching suggests possible liver involvement, which would be consistent with gallbladder or mild liver disease. Since you're doing fine with the exception of the three bouts of relatively brief illness, and are generally symptom-free, I'd probably take a wait and see approach, and if these episodes repeat again you might want to look at possible gallbladder or liver problems as well as then have a followup CA19-9 check. Otherwise, I suspect you're okay.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck and please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Iron serum 199 is liver disease",
    "content": "Hello,  Normal level of iron is in the range of 60-170 mcg/dl.  Although the level of iron in your blood is mildly elevated, it is not alarming especially if all other parameters are within normal. However, It is not clear for me the rest of your blood results like the complete blood picture and the serum ferritin. It would be also of help if the results of the precedential blood tests are available.   Blood samples for iron level tets should be taken while you are fasting and no iron supplements should be taken 24 hours before the test otherwise your iron levels may be falsely high.  Your lipid profile is (at most of a borderline high risk) also not striking if you have no other risks for cardiovascular diseases and you modify your dietary habits and your life style. A level of LDL less than 100 mg/dL is desirable if you have heart disease or diabetes and of less than 130 mg/dL if you have 2 or more risk factors.  Modifying your life style (exercise) and diets (low in saturated fat) are very effective measures. Drug therapy would be a next step if these measures fail.   Regarding the Fasting blood sugar result, a level of 100 to 125 mg/dL (5.6 to 6.9mmol/L) indicates impaired fasting glucose (prediabetes). In this case your doctor may recommend repeating the fasting blood sugar test few days to a week later.  I would advise you to follow up with up your doctor these results can be interpreted and managed properly only in the context of your medical history and in reference to the normal lab range.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I was wondering if it is possible that i have liver damage from overdosing on tylenol twice? The first time i did it was about 5 years ago and i was treated within 8 hours, i also mixed it with antidepressant. I went to the hospital and was treated . The second time i did it was 3 years ago i was also treated within 8 hours and i mixed it with Graval. Ive had liver ultrasounds that came out fine. I read somewhere that if you are treated within a certain time range and the treatment works you run no risk of liver damage of disease, i was wondering if this would be true in my case. Also, i am a regular drinken and x drug user.  i often have upper right quandrant pain , i notice it especially when i take advil. i no longer take any tylenol. Should i stop taking all potential liver damaging substances ?( alchohol, advil?) Or is it okay if i take it in moderation..?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Liver damage from past Tylenol Overdoses.",
    "content": "Hello --  While  it is unlikely you sustained liver damage, we don't know how much Tylenol you ingested either time, which would be a factor in trying to determine whether or not you might have sustained any damage. Also, while outlook with treatment inside of eight hours is excellent, it's not a guarantee you won't sustain damage. The good news is that it appears you did not, and that the liver is the only organ which is capable of self-regeneration (which should by no means suggest it is fair game for abuse, since if damaged too severely it cannot regenerate and then will fail like any other organ).  The best way to know for certain whether or not your liver is either damaged or sick (and the pains you're having could be due to a lot of non-liver-reated causes) would be to have blood drawn for liver function tests. If they come out reasonably normal youre probably okay. This is the only way to know for certain, and if you do have liver disease you're going to need to know about it anyway, since it's the only way to formulate a treatment plan.  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 43 year old male 6\" 215lbs and for over 4 years now I have had slightly elevated AST levels (range 0-40 and mine is 70IUL) I have had so many blood tests that I have lost count to determine its cause and all have come back negative.  I have had 2 physicians look at the problem and all say its serious but cannot explain why or the cause or effective treatment.  The latest one has just begun her quest to find the cause and provide answers.  I do not drink alcohol, have had nothing whatsoever for over 5 years and before I MIGHT have had one glass of wine ONCE a year!  I have taken no medication whatsoever, for any reason, for over 5 years, Not even for a cold or headache so we can rule that out.  My question is this.  My current and past physicians seem worried that this is something they should be concerned over but cannot articulate why it might be serious or how to treat it.  One has suggested exploratory surgery!  Whats the deal?  Why can't they articulate this?  Whats the real deal here? Since AST is found in many other areas in the body might they be looking in the wrong area?  Thanks for your time and response.\n\n",

    "title": "Liver damage resulting from narcotic and alcohol mix?",
    "content": "For about 10 years i have drank heavily on the weekends and then used prescription pain medications (percocet, vicoden, tylenol 4) as hangover cures. I know that using alcohol and these medications is a recipe for disaster eventually, but initially thought that if i wasn't actually washing the pills down with alcohol then that wasn't so bad.  Also there have been many times where i wake up around 11am and take a small dose of narcotic (1/2 tablet of a 325/7.5mg percocet or one tylenol 4 pill) then after the effect has worn off (say 8-9pm) start drinking, drink until 3am then the following day at 11am treat my hangover with more narcotic and so on.  I now realize that even if the 'buzz' is gone from taking the narcotic, the drug is still very much in my system. I know that i should IDEALLY not be doing this, but i'm curious to see if it's likely that i've done serious harm to my liver already by doing this. Also, if i were to binge and treat the hangover with narcotics only once every two months or so, would that also be an extremely bad idea?   I.e. I know the answer is \"don't do this, you're shaving years off your life\" but realistically i will probably end up doing it again at some point, so any less broad information or advice would be greatly appreciated! (Yes yes...i know i'm irresponsible =-)  To give a clearer picture i'm 160lb. male, 27 years old with a moderate tolerance for alcohol. I drink up to twelve drinks (high end of the spectrum) in an evening, stop drinking at 2am then may take a Tylenol 4 as soon as 10am. I've had spans of time where for two years i was doing this as much as 6 times a month, but also gone through two year spans where i may have done this only a 5-6 times throughout the year.  (My apologies for maybe awkward language/not knowing exactly where to post this as this is my first post.)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  This is probably the most appropriate topic for your question, and since we can dispense with \"common sense\" arguments and just get to the point, the simplest way to know for sure the answer to your question is to have blood testing for liver function and have a doctor interpret these for you. I mean, if you really want to know what risk you're running (despite having no great urge to do anything to change the outcome) this would be a good starting point. It's impossible to estimate the extent of damage or even know if there is any, without  assessing liver function. Once that's done and interpreted in light of your present  habits, a rough estimate of the long-term outlook could possibly be made.   It's as simple -- and as complicated --as that.  I hope this answers your question. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as necessary.\n\n",

    "title": "Colestipol - Elevated GGT and ALT - bile obstructions",
    "content": "Hello Doctors:  (preface: I'd rather give too much as too little)   I am a 46 year old male with a personal and family history of high cholesterol, BMI of 31 and slightly pre-diabetic. I have a history of migraines, IBS but BP is always good and overall don't feel too bad.   However, having a lifetime of total cholesterol 235 - 285 range and I have tried a number of the statins all of which I react terribly to by developing nodules and tenderness armpit/breast, neck, inside of the elbows and my arms and legs get where they feel as if I ran a marathon. Even under the best statin 10-15% drop was the maximum improvement seen.   I have tried a recent drug that was advertised  to work in the digestive tract with little observable result. That too was discontinued.  Colestid as you know is an old drug and not without side effects but has been tried. The most common side effect is constipation, not a problem for an IBS sufferer. I never observed that particular side effect but at the first blood draw after about 3 months Alk Phosphatase was 60 and GGT was 243. The dose was 2g once or twice a day.  I get results emailed ahead of the followup and ask at the time of the possibility of biliary tract obstruction. Caregiver seemed quite annoyed I asked. I was told not to worry. Three months later 75 and 391 respectively. Again I asked and a different caregiver reviewed my medications list and was told they all flush through the liver - not to worry at these levels. Again I asked about bile obstructions. \"Not to worry\" was the advise. Two months later an unexplained fever resulted (flu season - I had taken the shot well ahead of this) in another round of blood draws where the levels rose to 142 and 525.   ALT and SGOT have always been steady at about 100 and 38. CBC, BP, nutritional and kidney functions all in the normal range.   A week or so later they repeated after the seasonal fever broke and levels were to 146 and 517.  They ran a Hep series - all neg.  The GGT drop is easily explained with by fever related NSAID use discontinued after it went away.  I have had an abdominal ultrasound and will be finally going for a GI consult in about two weeks. My questions are largely in preparation for this upcoming consult.  I get a little twinge under the right ribcage but nothing severe. This may not be related to cholestid at all but for my satisfaction, these numbers have never been prior to and are clearly escalating hereafter.   1) Do you know how often bile blockages occur with Cholestid?   2) Is it even a rational or logical possibility of consideration?  3) Is it possible to have gallbladder or bile obstructions in an absence of described \"gut wrenching pain\"? 4) And lastly, I'm running out of options for cholesterol management, I've tried niacin, no-flush niacin, red yeast rice, diet exercise - nothing much budges it. Do you have any safer suggestions than Cholestid?  Thank you in advance.  Hanging_in_there\n\n",

Once again seemed to be discounted.   Even after a clear ultrasound (we know they are not an absolute conclusive test for many issues) but logic (to me) seemed to dictate if the drug had the potential to obstruct the common bile duct, which is of some size, then could it not then obstruct (potentially) the minor ducts and structures as well?   The point of that particular drug was it has a reputation as non-liver involving.   The bottom line for me is these (his tests) were run 2-3 weeks after discontinuing Colestipol and alkaline phosphatase had dropped to roughly to half. GGT was not yet available.\n\n",

    "content": "Update:  I went to the GI consult and low and behold, no records made the trip. This was somewhere 2-3 weeks after discontinuing Colestipol/Colestid.  The typical battery of GI questions followed in the initial interview, gay sex, iv drug use, alcoholism, tattoos, hepatitis, etc... all answered in the negative.  The discussion did encompass Colestipol/Colestid and bile complications. The doctor seemed to discount this as \"...it [Colestipol/Colestid] from what I remember, doesn't work that high in the liver. I works in the digestive tract by blocking the re-absorption of cholesterol.\"  It only seemed logical that if it could cause blockages in the common bile duct (a fairly large structure established clear by ultrasound), it might bind to bile acids in the minor structures within the liver and be responsible for Elevated GGT and ALT PHOSPHATASE. The doctor seemed to discount this in favor of something viral. I am no doctor and may be following false hope/bad lead but I know I never had irregularities of this nature prior to starting on this drug.  His tests did show a recent exposure to the Epstein-Barr virus and that I tested negative for the hepatitis series. Neither of which were surprising since I informed him of the same having been tested 2-3 weeks prior.   Interestingly though, his tests showed ALT PHOSP had dropped to roughly half (74) in these 2-3 weeks since halting Colestipol/Colestid therapy. GGT values have not been made available.\n\n",

    "content": "Hey Hanging in there,   You have been so patient in waiting for a reply and so diligent in your informative posts.  .  You have some information here that Im not sure if I understand.    First, when you ask if  colestid could cause a biliary obstruction...I don't think so.  When they refer to gastrointestinal obstruction for colestid I believe they refer to the pill itself lodging somewhere where there may be a stricture because of the size of the pill before it breaks down.  The pill itself doesn't go up into your common bile duct. The biles salts bind to particles and somehow lower the receptors for the bad cholesterol in your blood thereby lowering your level.  The makers of the medication say that a large number of patients had elevations in liver enzymes after taking the medication.  This is not uncommon at all. If you cant take any statins because of the side effects and they are trying you on this then you and your health care provider have to weigh the benefits of medicine related to your family and personal history for cardiovascular disease against the risk of elevated liver enzymes and choose the lesser of two evils.  Anytime you take a medication your liver has to process it, It handles every good and bad molecule  you put in your body. If   you're exercising and following diet guidelines in addition to the colestid then in a few months you shoul see some results.  You mention numerous GGt and alt levels during your time on colestid but not your cholesterol numbers.  When these two are elevated together they may indicate biliary involvement but perhaps you're GGt is chronically elevated because of family history and your pre diabetic status.  I'm sure you know that alcohol and certain drugs and give a high GGT, but some people always have a high one and they say it can be indicative of future problems.  If your ALT dropped by half after stopping the colestid then that was problably the reason for that.  So, together they can say one thing and seperately they can say something else.  I hope that makes sense to you.      If you had an ultra sound of your liver and gallbladder and you say it was clear and you don't have any nausea, vomiting , pain, intolerance of fatty foods, jaundice, itching then perhaps this was partially drug related and  you can see if things continue to stabalize without the meidcation in your system.  Are you taking a fish oil supplement and vitamin D?  Since You have a BMI of 31 I'm assuming that you're healthy weight.  Have you ever had a CT scan to look at your liver, do you have a family history of fatty liver?       Lastly, and this is highly unorthidox...I know of a drug that is not a statin but a DMARD, a (disease modifying antirhematic drug) that is actually an anti-malarial called Plaquenil, one of the side effects that is good is that it can substantially lower total cholesterol.  I don't know that any doctor would ever prescribe it for this purpose but it can really drop the numbers.  Mind you Plaquenil has it's own side effects and risks , one rare one that it can damage your eyes , so you have to have frequent check ups with an opthamologist.  It's an interesting point anyway. Please let us know what the doctor says and again thank you for your patience. Peace,\n\n",

Cardiovascular disease and death rates were similar among groups 1 and 2 and lower compared to the latter. I have taken fish oil for years now. Regularly consume olive oil just in cooking and maintain a normal BP.  I am virtually the sole family member older or younger that does not have hypertension. The youngest brother has even had cholesterol test(s) fail due to the triglycerides being too high to even measure. For a fat old man, I'm hanging in there ;-)  My last values were in December of Tot:256, LDL:173, r:5.4 Tri:178, and you mentioned the pre-diabetes, I monitor/keep and eye on things daily A1C has slowly crept up to a whopping lifetime high of 5.9.  But there is weight gain (not sudden but steady to BMI 33). That could have some effect.    GGT is sensitive to alcohol and I do have a beer occasionally but quite honestly, its hard to keep a eyeball on carbs and drink beer too - so it is very moderated if at all. It isn't the carbs but the alcoholic that bangs on the GGT I understand, it is just they are a package deal.   I'm due back at the GI in a week and will see what he has to say.   Thanks for the reply. It just may be he has to either find something else for cholesterol management, we accept as is or he finds something else hinky.\n\n",

Perhaps it serves beneficial to patients who may fear the worst upon utterance of the subject of potential liver disease.    Discontinuing the Colestipol halted the steady linear ramp in elevating GGT/ALT PHOS and after apx 4 weeks both flattened. Focusing on GGT it settled in 240-250 over a few more samples.  I finally conceded to a CT guided biopsy. No matter how much mental prep was done, nothing could ready me for the \"simple\" procedure. I did check out the core, quite nice by the naked eye - uniform in color is no guarantee but it is always a good sign. No black or white in it nor did it break after extraction. Time will tell.\n\n",

    "content": "For the past 6 months, I have been having right upper quadrant pain intermittently - it does not seem to be related to diet.  During my annual physical in October, my globulin was 4.3, A/G ratio was 0.9, RBC was 4.44, neutrophils were 72.9 and MCV was 100.3.  We did the blood tests again this week and everything has normalized except the globulin was 4.2. About a month ago I had severe upper right pain along with clay colored stools.  My doctor seems unconcerned about this, but he is concerned about the globulin level and said he thinks it is multiple myeloma.  I'm not in the medical profession, but couldn't the globulin be elevated due to liver or gallbladder issues?  Also, I have had endometriosis for 20 years.  Could endometrial tissue be on the liver area, causing problems?  We are waiting for results on my protein electophoresis tests.  Can you give me any reassurance this isn't MM?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  First, your globulin level was, at last check, right at the top of the normal range. Previously it had been .1 above that. This isn't an especially disturbing finding. Whatever had caused the earlier readings outside WNL seems to have resolved for now.  Second, while elevated globulin is often seen in instances of MM, it is also seen with various liver diseases, and this is the area where your symptoms seem to point, to I have no idea why your doctor would have a concern about MM, when the symptoms point elsewhere and the labs don't exclude that possibility. Strange.  It should be pointed out, for the record, that MM is not curable, but is now manageable, so that in many patients lifespan isn't shortened.   While endometriosis cells can, rarely, attach themselves to the liver, it sounds a  lot more like you may have either a gallbladder problem or perhaps some form of hepatitis. This of course should be explored and ruled out (or in).   I  wouldn't be overly concerned by the MM comment right now. It's fine to rule it out, but it doesn't seem to jump out as a likely cause of what's going on right now.  I hope this is helpful. Good luck to you, and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello --  Elevated GGT and ALT is usually associated with bile duct injury. This can be due to various disease processes, but very often is caused by gallbladder disease and/or passage of gall stones through the duct. However, your levels aren't grossly elevated, just enough to warrant a followup look. You don't mention any other symptoms, so I don't even know why the test was performed. If you've had any symptoms that might suggest gallbladder or liver disease, it would be helpful to know what they might be. You certainly don't appear to drink enough to have caused damage directly from drinking -- unless done in combination with certain medications or if you already had known liver disease.   Assuming none of those things are so, you probably don't have a significant problem.  If there's more to the story, please let us know.  Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "title": "Acetominophen Overdose",
    "content": "Hello,  Thank you for this service.  Approx 2 years ago I did something extremely stupid that I am embarrassed about and now fearful.  I overdosed on acetominophen.  I do not know exactly how many pills that I took, but I think it was approx 10-20.  I do not remember the dosage.  I then drank vodka.  I woke up late in the day the following day and recall vomitting during the night.  I felt horrible for about 3 days straight but I never saw a doctor.  2 Years have passed and work was stressful and I started to notice pressure under my left arm and even throbbing in my legs.  I went and saw a heart specialist since my family has a history of heart disease.  I did bloodwork and the doctor did not give me the full results of the bloodwork, only stating that he wanted to run more bloodwork since I admitted I did not fast 12 hours prior to the bloodwork being done.  When the nurse called and mentioned to go over my bloodwork initially prior to my follow-up doctor's appointment, she said that my results were mildly abnormal.  She then seemed to have slipped and told me that my liver enzymes were slightly elevated.  When I saw the doctor, he seemed to have avoided the topic but told me that he wanted to run more bloodwork for \"cholesterol\" but then also mentioned some tests on my liver since he was prescribing me medication to quit smoking.  1.  After 2 years, could I begin to now experience problems with my liver since it was never untreated?  Wouldn't I have noticed problems sooner?  I do not seem to have jaundice or any of the other symptoms I read about online.  I do have pain in the abdomen and under the right lower ribs.  I am also under a lot of stress and think it could be an ucler?  2.  Secondly, the doctor is the same doctor my mother goes to hence I never told the doctor of my espisode of overdosing.  He is not permitted to say anything to her shoudl I tell him the truth?  3.  Would it take 2 years for signs to start showing up now?  How long does liver failure begin to appear after an overdose as such.    4.  Is there anything I can do (take antioxidants, eat certain foods) to help my situation?  I read antioxidants help the liver?  I thank you kindly for your reply.  THe anticipation of my next doctor's visit in 1 month seems so far away!\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Acetominophen Overdose",
    "content": "Hello -  Thank you  for your words of appreciation for the site, and you're welcome.   The episode of two years ago would have produced immediate (and long-term) problems right off, and would not just now start showing up. You've no doubt got something going on which your doctor finds of interest, and it could even involve your liver, but it's highly unlikely any of it would by now be related to the earlier mishap with alcohol and acetominiphen. It would be a wise idea to disclose this to your doctor, as your complete history is a very valuable tool. I would recommend mentioning it just for the record. It's worth knowing about. That said, I still don't feel it could be just now showing new effects. The liver is the one and only organ/gland we have which actually has self-regenerative capabilities, so in the two years past, since you survived the initial insult, your liver is likely fully functional right now, although there could be some scarring or other markers of what had happened. This is one reason it's important for your doctor to know about it, since otherwise any such lesion could be mistaken for something else and confuse the issue. Your doctor is constrained from sharing this information with your mother or anyone else so long as you are legally of age.  I wouldn't fool with anything, any antioxidants, supplements, etc., until the cause of your symptoms have has been identified, as what might be beneficial normally can actually cause problems during times when things are not quite right. Other than that, I'd just go with the program,  let your doctor figure out what, if anything,  is wrong, and casually mention the fact that you once did have a problem which may have caused some passing liver injury.  Hope this is helpful. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  It appears you're doing remarkably well so far, but of course the main thing that will need attention is learning to manage stress, as it cannot altogether be avoided. With the arrival of a new baby, the change is a stressor, as are most major changes, whether good or bad. You're probably suffering some residual post traumatic stress syndrome symptoms from the recent distressing events, so the best thing you can do for yourself, since you're living very healthily in general, is to continue to work on your awareness of how panic attacks begin, so you can recognize the onset and nip them in the bud. If you haven't already, you might also consider adding an antianxiety medication specific to panic disorder, such as alprazolam (for managing things short-term) or clonazepam for long-term control of symptoms. If you'd prefer to avoid the drug route, more power to you.   I find it very interesting that panic attacks tend to come on around 7:00 PM, and you might consider what connection there could be between this time and the onset of attacks. It also gives you a target time for practicing relaxation techniques.  Other than that the only thing I can think of that you're not already doing (or maybe you are?) is to avoid caffeine, at least for the short term. With the baby coming you'll need to work on your overall flexibility and learn to adapt to a new schedule, which doesn't have to be terribly stressful, but just the new person in the house will be somewhat stressful at first, so just take it into consideration. It seems otherwise you're doing great already. Just keep up the good work!\n\n",

He Drank alcohol occasionaly for about 4 years and HEAVILY for about 6 months but, has not consumed ANY alcohol for over 2 years.

If your problem persists after finishing your medication...say three days after your finished then let your doctor know.  It could be a sign of gastric reflux, but I doubt it.

    "content": "I recently had my gallbladder removed on 12/8/08 because I was having gallbladder attacks (4 within 7 months), pressure in the middle of chest in the pit of stomach admonial bloating and everything I was eating was giving me indigestion.  The surgery was done larascopic and went fine.  I still get some nausea when eating certain foods and am taking an aciphex daily which seems to help.  I now have a constant pressure under the right breast.  It seems to be more intense after I eat.  It is not a pain, but very uncomfortable constant pressure.  I have not been able to wear a bra, because it causes more discomfort.  Before I had my gallbladder out this area was not an issue.  What could it be?  I did have a hida scan and ultrasound before my gallbladder surgery and the hida scan came back borderline and the ultrasound of my gallbladder, liver and stomach was fine.  I also had a endoscopy to have my stomach checked out for acid reflux, ulcers and that also came back fine. Now that my gallbladder is gone, I assumed all my symptoms were associated with that, but I'm still having pressure now under the right breast. Any suggestions of what it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  This will need to be evaluated either  by the surgeon who performed the cholecystectomy, or by a GI specialist. While it's probably directly related to the surgery, it's been almost a month now, and there could be something that needs attention: often a stray stone or, though it's an awfully long time for this, you still could have some of the gas/air (whatever was used to inflate your abdomen for the procedure) trapped somewhere that's been unable to escape osmotically as is usual.   So long as you have no associated symptoms (other than the ones you've mentioned, which aren't at all unusual following removal of the gallbladder), this is probably something relatively minor and anatomical in nature, but it should  be checked anyway.   Wish I could give you a more definite answer, but there are any number of possible causes for this, almost all of which are fairly to completely benign, but there's no  sense leaving anything to chance.  Hope this is  helpful. Best of luck to you. Please follow up with us here as needed.\n\n",

I still have mild episodes of pain, but nothing compared to the full blown attacks. I am a runner. I run about 2.25 miles 3 times a week. With in the last couple weeks I have been getting sharp terrible pains in my right side under my ribs. If I was an out of shape person I would just ignore them and think it was b/c I was out of shape, but it just started happening and nothing really has changed in my workout. Now I havent been able to do but like 10 mins of running and it hits me and normally knocks me down into a walking mode on the treadmill and does not let up until I am off and then I have tender pain there for the rest of the day. Just wondering if anything could be going on with my liver like some kind of flare up or inflamation of some kind. I do see my liver specialist in 2 wks but if it is something serious I will stop running until then. Any advice or info would be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there -  These items, while not specifically checked for, are noted as findings involving the condition of blood cells within the sample, and are not conditions in themselves. They are often seen as artifact (effect of glass tube, effect of additive in the tube, etc.), and in low quantities as found in your sample, are probably not significant for anything, although if enough of these slightly abnormal-looking cells had been  found it might have indicated some sort of medical problem. It doesn't appear to be the case here, but they have to be noted in the report, as would anything outside what is normal. The lab can't ascribe any meaning to anything, although if there is something seriously off-base, they will issue  to your doctor's office (or whoever is covering for him) what's called a \"critical lab finding.\" Clearly that hasn't happened, and wouldn't, given the small  number of abnormal cells found in your sample.   In short, without any significant history, these particular findings mean just about nothing. You can relax.   Hopefully this is helpful to you. Please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  You appear to have a marginal fatty liver, which, although it should be rechecked on perhaps a semi-annual basis as long as it's present,  is often either not  serious or is totally meaningless. While you do have some right side pain, you haven't gone into much detail as to the character, frequency, severity,  etc.,  so it's difficult to know if this is even related to the fatty liver. All your other blood work is normal except for the slightly elevated ALT, which fits with fatty liver  disease. The CA19.9 is well within normal limits (actually very well within), so it's easy to see why your doctors are not presently concerned. I also understand why you, being an engineer, have a need to understand why things are not \"according to spec.\" However, unlike most mechanical devices, the human body is a \"soft machine\" which in many instances has a much wider  range of tolerances. This is something  we have to accept as part of being the owner of a human body. Yours does appear (the liver, at least) to have some unremarkable deviations from textbook \"normal\", but \"normal\" has a much looser definition in medical circles than it does in \"hard\" engineering.  I hope this is helpful to you. Good luck to you and please follow up with us as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  You are very welcome, and please pass that along to your family as well. :)  Weight loss and restriction of fatty foods (and processed carbohydrates also) should be helpful in either correcting the problem or at least keeping it from progressing. I'm not sure what that pain sensation is you're getting, but if coffee seems to aggravate it, you'll have to consider whether or not coffee is worth the predictable discomfort. I think all us coffee drinkers find something about coffee we have to balance against the benefits of it.   The fact that your doctor only did a sonogram of the right lobe of your liver (the normally far larger part, admittedly) strikes me as a little strange. I'm wondering if this is what the report said specifically, or if it only mentioned the right lobe because that's where the focal fatty patches were noted. Sometimes when an imaging report is written some precision is lost in translation from the radiologist to the doctor to the patient. Perhaps this is the case?  Again, you (and your family) are very welcome. It's my pleasure to do what I can to be helpful here. And thank you for the happy new year wish! I wish you and your family the same in return.

    "content": "My 75 year old mother was diagnosed with Hepatitis C about 2 months ago.  It is believed that she contracted this during a blood transfusion during a mastectomy for breast cancer back in the 70's.  About 10 years ago, she was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathy, which was attributed to a chemical sensitivity, as she was not a diabetic, nor was she a drinker.  After some research, I have discovered that peripheral neuropathy is oftentimes a symptom of cryoglobulinemia.  So, my question is, could her peripheral neuropathy have been misdiagnosed, meaning that her Hepatitis C became active almost 10 years ago?  And, if this is so, what does that mean for her prognosis now?  She was diagnosed with Hepatitis C after her doctor ran blood tests to determine why her peripheral neuropathy seemed to be worsening, and her energy level was lagging.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hepatitis C and peripheral neuropathy",
    "content": "Hello -  Since peripheral neuropathy is often idiopathic (of no known cause), it would be sheer speculation to guess at whether or not the hep C was active ten years ago or not. It seems unlikely, but of course is possible. Many people have it for years before they are finally diagnosed, but there is no correlation between duration of its presence in the body and the prognosis from the time it is actually diagnosed.   Idiopathic peripheral neuropathy can be related to cryoglobulinemia, but this is very difficult to prove, especially so long after the fact.   The bottom line is that the issue is moot. Hep C is managed, often quite effectively, although it can certainly have its ups and downs. IPN is very common among people in their 60s and beyond, and is also treatable if it causes nerve pain. Each is managed symptomatically. You can safely regard them as two separate entitites, even if there could be proven a long-past connection at this point.   I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you and your mother. Please stay in touch with us here as needed.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  \"Diffusely low attenuation\" in a CT studies of a liver would mean that there were widespread, scattered areas where the imagery was less clear than others. It has no intrinsic meaning except that it was not an ideal picture in the eyes of the reading radiologist. The phenomenon can be caused by  any number of disease processes, injury, poor equipment operation or maintainance, and any other number of outside influences on the scan. If your doctor doesn't find anything to which to link this then it probably has no essential meaning, but simply describes the quality of the CT image. You may need to have it repeated.   I hope this helps answer your question.\n\n",

Patients with simple hepatic cysts require a thorough history and a physical examination, as well as liver function test which is usually within the normal range. Patients who have are not suspected to have malignancy may need no more investigations and are kept under follow up.  Asymptomatic individuals require no treatment since the risk of complications from the lesion is lower than the risk from therapeutic interventions.   However, when there are symptoms and signs that suggests underlying abnormalities more investigations are needed. Your parent\u2019s symptoms are concerning and he should be properly investigated to find out the cause of the presence of the blood in stool, losing weight and his progressive weakness. Benign problems that cause similar clinical picture are common but exclusion of serious conditions is essential. CBC, and stool analysis are very helpful and essential; colonoscopy and other radiologic tests are requested based on clinical findings.  Regarding the renal cyst, a simple kidney cyst is commonly seen in people older than age 50. It requires no treatment as long as it does not cause any complications.  I would advise you to follow up with his doctor and to discuss with him your concerns. He is more aware by your parent\u2019s condition and may reassure you about his status.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am trying to locate someone in her area of Southern NJ/Philadelphia. Her doctor is a GP and is not trained in this area (e.g., not able able to read or interpret her scans independently).  I understand her doctor relies on a report from another doctor.  I am sure relying on reports is quite common and I am not trying to criticize her doctor's skills, but in light of her issues and concerns, I want to take her to meet someone else so she can have a second opinion and pursue any needed testing, as her doctor I understand did not recommend anything of which you listed beyond scanning in 6 months.

    "content": "Hello, MRI is highly sensitive and specific in the diagnosis of hepatic hemangioma. It is also very helpful in the identification of mild to severe liver fibrosis or cirrhosis.   Elevated liver enzymes at different levels of rise occur when there is a liver damage even in individuals with fatty liver.   Decompensated liver (extensive damage) results in abnormal liver function tests like low albumin, prolonged PT and low PC. In this stage there is usually a clear radiologic evidence for the liver damage and its probable cause like fibrosis, cirrhosis or malignancy.  Alcohol may result in fatty liver as well as cirrhosis in chronic alcoholics.   If you are asymptomatic, with normal liver function tests and enzymes as well as MRI results of accidentally discovered hemangioma, there is no need to think of liver damage by fibrosis or cirrhosis. Consequently, there is no indication for biopsy.   Hope you find this information useful.  Follow up with your doctor is essential. Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Surgeons agree that a symptomatic large haemangioma should be treated. But controversy exists among them in how to manage asymptomatic large (>10 cm) hepatic haemangioma.  Some surgeons consider the potential risk of complications like spontaneous rupture, or intratumoral haemorrhage mandates immediate interference.  Others advocate careful monitoring only, based on the fact that there are only few case reports for complications from large asymptomatic haemangioma.   So, they keep individuals with large asymptomatic haemangioma under close follow up and consider therapy only when they have symptoms.  Surgical resection and enucleation are the most preferred treatments.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor. Hope you find this information useful. Please keep us updated.

    "content": "Hello,  Mild elevations of the liver enzymes are usually discovered during routine blood tests in healthy individuals.  AST and ALT levels may reach twice the upper limits of normal in individuals with fatty liver (obese individuals, diabetic, and alcoholics even mild intake). The lipid profile should be assessed in these individuals.   Many medications result in elevation of liver enzymes, like analgesics, some antacids, hormones, antibiotics etc.  So, levels higher-than-normal do not always indicate liver disease in cases.   The interpretation of elevated AST and or ALT levels should be integrated with the clinical picture to evaluate liver diseases.  Isolated mild elevation of liver enzymes is considered abnormality and significant if it continues for six months or if rapid progression. US of the liver is very helpful in the diagnosis.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor.  Hope you find this information useful.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Fatty liver can be caused by quite a few different things, but apparently you don't have any, with the possible exception of obesity (you didn't mention your weight or height) and high sugar intake. I am assuming no diabetes and you clearly don't have a drinking problem. Often fatty liver is idiopathic (meaning \"we don't know the cause\"). While it rarely produces symptoms and often does no harm at all, it can, over time, in certain patients, lead to secondary problems which can result in liver inflammation, which, again over time, can create serious problems.   Even your lipid panel is actually pretty good, assuming you have no history of heart disease. The main reason it is above the desireable level of 200 is that you have exceptionally high \"good\" cholesterol (HDL), which in itself has given you a total cholesterol-to-LDL ratio of 3.3, which is excellent. Your triglycerides, which are often elevated in fatty liver, are fine. In all likelihood your fatty liver finding could be a lab anomaly, and it could possibly -- possibly -- have been caused by having taken Advil (ibuprofin) in advance of the test, although it seems unlikely.   The follow-up should reveal a lot. As it stands now there is not too much to be concerned about. The internist will have to determine where, if anywhere, this goes from here. Things seem fairly innocuous given all the factors you've provided.  I hope this is helpful. Best of luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doc. Here's an update. Since my first posting of my mild fatty liver with elevated enzymes , I refrained from taking any over the counter pain medications and only taken milk-thistle and a product call Livercare52. I want for my blood test before I go to my internist (my appointment is stil a long wait) and here's my results:  Total protein      6.4 Albumin             4.0 A/G ratio           1.6 Glucose              97 Urea Nitro          17 creatinine          1.2 Bun/creatinine   14 AST                   21 normal ALT                   52 ALK                   149 Total Bilrubin      .6  As you can see ast went to normal levels , alt still little high but went down and alk went down somewhat but still high. So I'm not sure if it's the pain medications that was causing the liver irritation of the milkthistle and livercare52 or both. What do you think ?  At least on bright side the  enzymes did go down in a months time. Thanks for any input and will send updates when my appointment with internist  comes up. Have a good day.\n\n",

I suspect the improvements are due to a combination of having discontinued the pain meds and perhaps the milk thistle and LiverCare52. It's difficult to evaluate the role of the supplements, but they probably have done no harm and may have helped with the improvement.

My parents have always been squeamish on discussing the topic of alcohol with me, and as I'm going into college this year I'm hoping someone on this forum will help advise me.  In all honesty, I've been drinking for about a year, and I try to drink smart.  I've only drunken enough to be sick once, and its not something I intend to repeat.  My drinking habits usually include drinking 4 or so drinks in a night with my friends, once or twice a weekend for about 2 or 3 weeks, and then not drinking for about a month or a month and a half.  I spread out my drinking like this to give my body time to recover.  I try and drink lots of water and I take vitamins because I've heard alcohol can drain your body of vitamins.  I'm wondering how much damage drinking like this can do to your liver.  Is this within a safe range of drinking?  Would I be doing a lot of damage to my body if I had maybe 4 or 5 drinks in a weekend every week or every other week without the long breaks between?  Unfortunately I don't know much about alcohol and the body other than that it can cause a lot of problems if you do it too much.  I've just never been lucky enough to be told what \"too much\" actually means.  Thank you very, <i>very</i> much.\n\n",

    "content": "After several days of abdominal pain, my husband went to our doctor who took blood and sent him for a cat scan.  The cat scan showed he had appendicitis, and he was told to go to the hospital where he underwent surgery that night. The surgeon said the appendix had ruptured and when I asked him when, he said it could have been days ago.  We just received the results of the blood test from that day and my husband's SGPT was 158.  He's always had mildly elevated SGPT but never that high.  Could the ruptured appendix have caused the elevation?  The doctor told him to stop his zocor for a month to see if that affects the number.  Thank you very much for your assistance.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  A ruptured appendix with no clearly recognized time of rupture can cause peritonitis or even sepsis, either of which, in turn, could cause major illness and other serious problems. That your husband didn't develop either of these to any significant extent is remarkable with free toxins at large inside the peritonium. However, there could have been enough  contamination that the liver may have sustained some mild inflammation (this is only a guess). This, especially in  conjunction with the regular use of Zocor (which has the potential to raise SGPT levels on its own) could account for the unusually high count. Staying off the Zocor for two weeks seems like a prudent move right now. Your husband will be retested after that \"holiday\" from the drug and a lot more will be clear at that time.  Apparently your husband is a pretty hardy fellow to have got through the rupture of his appendix with nothing more than this having happend.   I hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you both for your replies.  My husband is doing well; the surgeon told him that his body had walled off the area of the ruptured appendix and had formed an abscess.  It has been 7 weeks since the surgery and he is scheduled for a colonoscopy next week (this is his first....he is 51 years old).  His last blood test showed normal liver enzymes which I'm relieved about, however, his last two blood tests showed low iron (38 the day before surgery and 41 a month later) and elevated CRP (5.1) a month after the surgery.  The surgeon told us that the inflammation appeared to have come from outside the appendix which is atypical.  I am very nervous about the colonoscopy, however, my husband says he feels good; he has not lost any weight (in fact he needs to but I'm relieved that his hasn't lost any since he hasn't been trying), and he has not had pain or unusual digestive or bowel issues since the surgery.  I'm hoping nothing serious is going on with him based on what the surgeon said and his blood results.  We should know more after the colonoscopy.  Thank you again.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello again -  Good news all around. While the circumstances are somewhat unusual, these things do happen. The colonoscopy should be uneventful since it  will  barely reach the location  of the former appendix so should pose no danger of perforation. It's also important to check and see if there are any other inflamed areas where something similar could be developing, so as to head that off. It's unlikely, but better to know things are all in order.   Otherwise your husband seems to be thriving despite all the fuss, so it is a very upbeat report. Thanks for the update and we'll be looking forward to hearing what, if anything, is learned from the colonoscopy.   Continued good luck to you both.\n\n",

The doctor found mild diverticulosis and a lipomatous swelling on the cecal tip, which he biopsied (he said he's not worried); no polyps.  We're all very relieved since we had read that appendicitis past the age of 40 may indicate a simulaneous colon cancer (a little knowledge can be a dangerous thing).  There still is the issue of his low iron which showed on two consecutive blood tests, one the day before surgery (38 ug/dL) and one a month after surgery (41 ug/dL).  Could ruptured appendix cause a drop in iron?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I recently did something incredibly stupid and am very worried.  On Sunday afternoon I got sort of drunk (4 alcoholic drinks) then drank a bottle of NyQuil (6oz).   I have never done this before and don\u2019t know where the impulse even came from.   It later occurred to me that Nyquil contains Acetaminophen.  I always make a point to avoid it Tylenol etc. because I am a heavy drinker and I know that it does not mix well with Alcohol.  I did the math and it I ingested 5,900 mgs of Acetaminophen in about 10 minutes.  I did throw up at some point, although I\u2019m not exactly sure as to the timing.  And when I woke up I kept drinking.  It is hard for me to even write this down as it is so reckless.  My questions are as follows. 1.\tDo I need to go to the hospital?  Could I potentially die of liver failure if I don\u2019t go immediately? 2.\tI have heard that it takes closer to 10,000 mgs to kill you, but could the alcohol somehow lower this number? 3.\tDid throwing up reduce the amount I took in, or does Acetaminophen get ingested quickly? 4.\tShould I not drink for awhile (besides the obvious I should not drink, I know that, but could I potentially be doing something really bad? ) 5.\tHave I permanently damaged my liver by drinking and taking so much Acetaminophen? Thanks for any reply.  DCN\n\n",

Early liver damage can be detected by abnormal liver function tests (elevated liver enzymes) this can occur within 2 to 5 days after overdosage.   Fatal hepatic toxicity, encephalopathy (with mental changes, confusion, agitation, or stupor), convulsions, respiratory depression, coma, metabolic disturbances, cardiac arrhythmias, and cardiovascular collapse are reported with overdoses more than 15 g.  Most painkillers have interaction with alcohol, and dose adjustment should be done when drinking alcohol. Alcohol is known to augment paracetamol induced hepatic toxicity. Paracetamol dose should be reduced inchronic alcoholics (resulting in liver damage) as well as liver damage due to other causes. You should always consult your physician regarding the recommended dose.   I would advise you to follow up with your doctor; he will recommend blood tests for liver function and US as need.

    "content": "I'm a 24 year old male and had a reux n y gastric bypass in december of 2007 and have lost 130 pounds as a result of that I had developed a lot of gallstones and had an attack at work and was rushed to hospital where they took my gallbladder out on July 30, 2008.  They had also diagnosed me with pancreatitis and hepatitis as a result of the gallstones.  It's been 4 weeks since the surgery and I've been having more abdominal pains.  They first started out in the upper left part of my abdomin and now hurts in my right and left upper abdomin.  Yesterday (09/01/08) I started having sharp shooting pains in my upper right abdomin.  I also am having problems eatting too, I can only eat one meal a day because I get really nausious and get pains after eatting.  I was eatting fine before my surgery.  About a week and half ago my surgeon ordered me a UGI which came back normal and also ordered blood work and a UA.  The  UA came back good except for my Urobilinogen was elaveted above normal levels and my Liver Function Test came back elaveted.  The nurse said something about the normal levels being between .2 and 1.0 and I was at a 2.2.  My surgeon ordered a HIDA scan for this friday.  But hasn't really said what he thinks might be the problem.  Should I have any concern of liver damage at all?  Should I go to the ER if the pain continues to get worse ( i'm at 5 on a 1-10 scale) and nausea continues?  Any opinions or advice would be very much appreciated.  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  According to the information you provided you may have a biliary tract obstruction. Obstruction of the biliary tract (bile duct) results in elevated bilirubin (mainly direct) and increased urobilinogen in urine. Damage to the liver cells will result also in elevated liver enzymes SGPT & SGOT. US of the liver can confirm the diagnosis.  After different types of operations in this part of your body, obstruction of the bile duct may occur due to anatomical changes or as a complication from the operation. Stones in the bile duct may also be a cause of bile duct obstruction.  HIDA is a test used to diagnose obstruction in the biliary passages. It is concerning that your pain is increasing in intensity. Relief of the obstruction is essential if it is due to anatomical problem. Infections in the biliary tract present also with abdominal pain, fever and jaundice and should be excluded and treated promptly.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor for proper investigations and treatment.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: HEP C  Cirrhosis level 2",
    "content": "Hello -  There are at least two grading systems for cirrhosis, the older one using A, B and C, and the newer, Pugh-Child system using 1,2,3 and sometimes stage 4 (end stage). These stages (or levels) don't always correlate well with the actual symptoms (if there are any), and are generally based on laboratory and other clinical findings. Generally the lowest stage (1 or A) has no appreciable symptoms associated. By stage 3 symptoms are commonly seen, and are often fairly serious. Stage 4 or end stage cirrhosis is indicative of greatest sustainable liver damage, but even then some patients do fairly well and have relatively good outcomes, while others succumb to some complication. Much depends upon the underlying cause, which is usually either due to hepatitis or excessive alcohol use. If alcohol use is curbed totally, some patients don't progress beyond whatever stage they are in, and  even an end-stage patient may do fairly well, with the caveat that any alcohol ingestion at that stage could potentially be fatal.  If cirrhosis is in remission, is cured, or is resolved, whatever level of cirrhosis was reached during the infection is usually not  exceeded so long as no other insult to the liver is sustained (again, drinking is a major factor, even if the patient is not a chronic alcoholic. Also some drugs must be avoided). With hepatitis C, which tends to stay while waxing and waning in some patients, cirrhosis can get worse with severe flareups, but if the underlying disease is well-controlled the patient may well have a good outcome.  With any degree of cirrhosis there is a slightly increased risk of develpment of cancer of the liver, but  this is only a statistical risk and does not automatically follow. By the same token,  any given stage of cirrhosis does not automatically, at some point, progress to a more severe stage. It can, but it's not a given.   With all other things being equal, excellent nutrition plays a very important role in a good outcome, along with the obvious avoidance of alcohol and certain drugs which are toxic to the liver. Your doctor will have counseled you on these issues, so the next step is to maintain a very healthy lifestyle in general and you may well have no advancement of the disease at all.   Complications of advanced-stage cirrhosis are usually the big problems, and even these are becoming more manageable, so we are seeing more good outcomes in general.   I hope this is helpful to you. Best of luck, treat yourself right and try not  to worry too much. Report any remarkable changes in the way you feel to your doctor and be sure to keep your follow-up appointments. Stage 2 cirrhosis is a long way from the worst case.   Stay in touch.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  The diagnois would seem to match well with Koch's, but were you given a TB test? A positive result would seemingly confirm the tubercular Koch's disease, and would likely also explain the joint pain. Also, are you routinely immunocompromised? This variant (extrapulmonary) TB is often seen in people with compromised immune systems.  More information would definitely be helpful in making an educated guess, but so would a simple TB test, which would likely confirm what would appear to be Koch's. Also, since much of the problem did respond positively to AKT, this would seem to make the diagnois likely. The TB test, I must reiterate, would probably yield a definitive answer.   If you have more history or other information to provide, please do so. Otherwise, best of luck to you. It would seem you are slowly making progress.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi I am a 34 yom. Good physical shape, eat healthy, exercise regularly. Take multi-vitamin, Glucosamine/Chondroitin, St. John's Wort, and creatine daily. No other meds.   Annual '08 work physical had abnormal lab blood results as follows in January (I'll list all normal results below them for '08). All urinalysis results were fine:  ALT (H): 101  AST (H): 119  Direct Bilirubin (H): .4  LDH (H): 302  Anion gap (H): 20  A/G/ ratio (H): 2.2  Chloride (H): 114  Carbon dioxide (L): 13  Eosinophils (L): .8   All other '08 results within normal ranges as noted here: WBC: 4.7 S. Neutrophils: 61.2 Lymphocytes: 28.2 Monocytes: 9.5 Basophils: .3 RBC: 4.96 Hemoglobin: 14.4 Hematocrit: 43 MCV: 86.8 MCH: 29 MCHC: 33.5 RDW: 13.8 Platelets: 314 MPV: 8.1 Blood Urea Nitrogen: 13 Creatinine: 1 Sodium: 143 Potassium: 4.2 Glucose: 94 Protein: 7.4 Albumin: 5.1 Calcium: 9.7 Phosphorus: 4.1 Uric Acid: 5.9 Total Bilirubin: .7 Indirect Bilirubin: .3 Cholesterol: 159 Triglycerides: 52 HDL: 42 LDL: 107 Alkaline Phosphatase: 81 GGTP: 24 Iron: 119 Coronary Risk Ratio: 3.8   In 2007 had the following abnormal blood results with normal urinalysis:  ALT (H): 62  AST (H): 71  A/G ratio (H): 2.6  LDH (L): 117  Lymphocytes (L): 18.4  All other results within normal ranges.   All pre-'07 labs were completely normal. I drink moderately usually, and sometimes heavily, but not every night and often go weeks with none at all. In fact, no alcohol intake at all for three weeks previous to the blood work done this year. Doc that did physical just said he didn't know and to follow up with a doctor. I blew it off last year since there's no symptoms and expected everyting to be fine this year.   So here are my questions:  -Are these anything to be concerned about?  -Would this mean there's actually permanent damage or just that it was irritated?  -If there is damage to the liver, how long does it take to fully heal after abstaining from alcohol (barring cirrhosis obviously)  I would just like to know what these results truly mean since I am very bad about getting to doctors. I have further reduced alcohol use, occasionally going 3-4 weeks with none at all, but do enjoy it sometimes and have no desire to fully quit. Thanks for any info.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  These are back-to-back, significantly abnormal LFTs, which warrant a follow up, although I don't understand the doctor's passing it of to \"a doctor.\" Nevertheless, because of the amount of periodic drinking you do, and the increased levels of the same components and with the addition of a high bilirubin count, I would be concerned enough to at least have a complete workup. It could have been a transient change, but it does appear to be a trend. The liver is the only organ which can regenerate itself, once the offending agent is removed. This would be alcohol in this case, and you may be in the very early stages of cirrhosis, which could probably be reversed, but don't take this to mean you can just stop drinking and be ok. First, stopping is  not anywhere near as easy as anyone with  a drinking problem chooses to believe it is (and they usually also choose to believe they don't have a problem. You do have one). Second, it often requires medical supervision, especially where there is early liver damage, which there may well be in this case.   By all means have yourself worked up fully by a doctor and consider the  possibility that you have a drinking problem which is harming your health.  Please follow up with us here, also. Good luck to you.\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for the feedback. I am going to get more bloodwork done in the next couple weeks. As it turns out I've actually cut back significantly this year just as I've gotten older (even before I got the results back early in the year), often going 3-4 weeks or more and at times 1 to 1 1/2 months without so much as a beer. The doc that does our physicals is an occupational health doctor so I don't know if he hasn't kept up on it or what. All he said was to follow up with a doctor. Anyway, been quite a few months since that draw so I'll go see what's up now and update then. Thanks again.\n\n",

    "content": "During a catscan after a car wreck, about 4 \"tumors\" were found on my wife's liver.  The doctor believes them to be hemangiomas but it is not 100% verified through the catscan and ultrasound.  The ultrasound report stated that it is rare to have multiple hemangiomas and also stated that one of the tumors may be a hepatic adenoma.  Her liver functions were normal during the time of the catscan.  He also told us that the hemangiomas were nothing to really worry about.  He will be sending us to another doctor and an MRI to try to get final verification.  Is it possible that these are something else such as cancer or should we feel comfortable with what he is saying?  I will also say that the techs had a very difficult time seeing them on the ultrasound.\n\n",

The information, along with history and physical exam helps the doctor to find out what it is.  A second opinion and/or additional tests can help confirm or dispel suspicions.  I'm sure that is why the doctor is sending your wife for further evaluation.  I hope you have received a good report by now.  Best wishes to you both.\n\n",

    "content": "I was recently prescribed Avelox to treat a bout of sinusitis.  By day 7 I was experiencing severe nausea, fatigue and stomach pain.  I discontinued the Avelox and began taking Keflex for two additional days.  My symptoms increased and I began to experience severe diarrhea, vomiting, and continued nausea and stomach pain.  I stopped the Keflex after the second day.  Symptoms have resolved except for some continued fatigue however, my ALT is at 98 and  AST is 61.  All other labs for liver are within normal limits.  Could this be due to the Avelox?  I drink moderately (usually no more than 1 - 2 glasses of wine or beer a day).  I had hepatitis B twenty-five years ago and was vaccinated against hepatitis A three years ago.  Have a history of benign cysts of the liver (no change on multiple CT scans).  Also history of colon cancer in family but all my colonoscopies have been unremarkable.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Nurider,  Avelox very rarely can cause some liver toxicity.  However, your AST and ALT are only minimally elevated and your symptoms may be due to many other causes.  It may be that you have developed a concurrent viral infection that is causing your worsening symptoms.  I would recommend you follow up with your doctor and have your liver enzymes checked again in a few weeks to see if they have improved.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Interesting case report. Thanks for all the good data. What stands out for me is the G I Bleeding in May 2005 for few months. I terms of treating the patient with interferon, the source of the bleeding is important in determining if the patient is a candidate for therapy.   From the data you provided, it is unclear if the source of the bleeding is from the esophageal varices or some other source. If the bleed is from her esophageal varices, then we could make a presumptive diagnosis of decompansated liver disease most likely from portal hypertension 2/2 HCV cirrhosis. If this is the case, then the patient is unsuitable for antiviral therapy at this time. We do treat patients with decompansated cirrhosis from time to time and is on a case by case basis.  Generally, if the decompansating event (be it encephelopathy, esophageal varicial bleeding or ascites) is stable for ~6 mos or so, one can attempt to treat. Usually all these patient have already been listing for liver transplant as a safety net.\n\n",

My liver was also looked at and it was enlarged and fatty (typical of being obese).  ALT is 16 AST is 19 Both are within normal range.  So, my question is, other than cutting out the alcohol (which I am now going to do), are there other ways to get my GGT back down to a normal range?  Also, what is the best way to get my liver back into shape and functioning perfectly?  I am sluggish all the time and feel generally \"blah\" and want to get my health back on track.  Thank you for your assistance!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Md1973,  GGT is an enzyme that is produced by the biliary tree.  This includes the bile ducts of the liver, external biliary ducts and gallbladder.  Often, it will become elevated when there is a blockage of the biliary tree, most commonly due to gallstones.    In your case, it may be related to some sludging of bile within the liver.  With the enlarged fatty liver, treating and improving this will likely bring the GGT level down.  If it remains elevated you may want to see a GI specialist for further evaluation.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For the last few months he is also having ascites and doctor has given him dieutrics to reduce the fluid. Current ultrasound examination shows His  spleen has enlarged,  HB and platelets count has dropped. Earlier the Count was 52000 and now is 48000. He repeatedly  get bleeding from gums. Can you please advise us if he can get the platelets transfusion in order to increase the platelets counts and better clotting. Our Doctor says that this will temporarily help and again after a week or so the count will drop. His blood group is O-ve To stop bleeding he some times get injection of Vit K and Transmin.  I will be waiting for your kind opinion in this regard.  Thank and best Regards.  Mujahid from Pakistan\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Cirrhosis with low platelets count",
    "content": "Hello Mujahid,  Receiving a platelet transfusion will increase his platelet count and can help stop bleeding that is occurring at the time.  However, I suspect that the reason your brother's platelets are low is due to splenic sequestration.  Basically, when the spleen becomes enlarged (probably due to the cirrhosis) it can begin to trap the platelets and destroy them.  With this sequestration occurring, if a transfusion is given the transfused platelets also will be destroyed and ultimately the platelet count will drop again.  The vitamin K and transmin injections will not help platelets.  They may help, however, because when the liver begins to fail it stops processing the vitamin K needed to make other clotting factors.  Increasing the levels of vitamin K can help increase amounts of the clotting factors to help prevent bleeding due to these deficiencies.  The ultimate repair may be a liver transplant.  In some cases, a splenectomy may help because it will eliminate the sequestration issue.  However, this has its own side effects and consequences and may not be an appropriate treatment for all.    If he is actively bleeding a platelet transfusion will stop the bleeding, though, since the platelets will stop the bleeding before they get chewed up.  Follow up with his doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Ray198,  These liver values are only slightly elevated.  There are many different causes of this.  It is very possible that you have a slight viral infection causing this.  Another consideration that should be evaluated for is a condition known as steatohepatitis or \"fatty liver\".  It can develop when the lipids in the blood are elevated.    Before getting too concerned I would recommend that you have these levels repeated in 4-6 weeks to see if they have returned to normal.  If they remain elevated there are several tests that may help such as an abdominal ultrasound to look for any evidence of steatohepatitis.  Seeing a GI doctor may also be helpful.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Age: 43 Sex: Male Past Diagnoses: Hepatitis \u201cB\u201d (August 1987) sick 2 \u00bd months, recovered, not chronic.  2 Herniated Disk in lower back (January 2006), COPD (January 2007) Past Surgeries: None Family History: Father: High Blood Pressure (Medication kept it under control) Past away from Complications of Clear Cell Cancer. Mother: Thyroid Cancer (Removed) 25 + Years ago,  Skin Cancer removed. Grandfather: Heart disease, past away from Heart attack. Grandmother: Past away from complications of lung cancer. Siblings: Both brothers healthy. Current Medications:  Suboxone, 2mg, 1 tablet twice daily due to pain medication addiction. Spiriva & Pro-Air HFA, Albuterol Sulfate for mild COPD.  I will make this as brief as possible.   Since I was 16 years old, I have abused alcohol. I would go out and drink 3 or 4 times a week. In 2002, I became a heavy daily drinker consuming 8-12 beers every night from 6 pm to 11 pm. In July 2005, I was prescribed Loratab 10-650\u2019s for pain in my back.  I gradually became addicted to the pain medication also.      My first symptoms appeared in September 2005. I woke with a severe constant sharp stabbing pain in my right side, radiating around to opposite side of my back. It would hurt worse if I slept on my back or right side, the only way to relieve pain was to sleep on my left side or get up. This usually lasted 1 or 2 nights and would go away.  After this happened several times, I went to my doctor, she referred me to the GI specialist. I told the GI Doctor I was worried about my liver because of my alcohol consumption and loratab usage. She said the pain I was describing sounded more like a gallbladder issue. She could not confirm this because Abdominal Ultrasound, Ct scans & Comprehensive Metabolic Panel came back normal.   January 2006 I switched my Primary care doctor. I told the new Doctor my past symptoms and I felt I was addicted to the pain medication. I wanted to come off the Loratab but every time I tried I had withdraw symptoms. She prescribed me Suboxone 2mg and sent me for an MRI because of back pain and my right leg was going numb. MRI showed two Herniated Disk in my lower back.  I was prescribed Xanax for anxiety in March, then In June, I was also prescribed Ibuprofen 800 mg for pain because the Suboxone helped with some pain but there were times it was worse.    So now a typical day for me until early November was:  Started drinking coffee - 0630 until 2-3 pm. Suboxone 2mg \u2013 1 tablet 3 times day for pain med addiction.  Xanax 1mg - 3 times day for anxiety.  Aspirin 80 mg - 1-2 times a day because I thought it was good for you. Ibuprofen 800 mg \u2013 1 tablet 2 times a day for pain.\t Nose spray - 3 or 4 times day for constant runny nose. Lunesta or Ambien CR \u2013 1 or 2 tablets @ bedtime to help me sleep.  I was also given other sample medications to try, Cymbalta was one of them, however I cannot remember them all.  From May 2006 through January 2007 I usually only ate once per day, Dinner. I thought this was because of the coffee and the medication I was on.  Then I noticed was my stool was almost white 2 or 3 different times. Each time it lasted for about 3 or 4 days and then returned to normal, so I did not think anything else about it. I was also becoming lactose intolerant. Every time I had dairy products, I would become bloated and produce a lot of foul smelling gas.    August 2006 I stopped drinking alcohol completely, I told my doctor I felt I had lost some of my sex drive and my eyes were dry and irritated all the time. She said sex drive would come back when I stopped taking the suboxone and eyes were probably allergies.   Then a month or so later in September my wife and I noticed new symptoms: Several horizontal raised ridges in my finger and toenails. Both of my leg calves, ankles and feet were swelling up leaving indentions from my socks. I thought maybe I was overdoing things at first but by late October, I started bruising much easier too. I received a large bruise instantly on my nose just from squeezing a blackhead and I had several large bruises on my legs. I had never bruised easily before. All of these symptoms were new to me; I had never had any of them before. Then in December 2006, I noticed my ears were ringing all the time, and every time I took an aspirin or Ibuprofen, I would come down with a flu-like reaction that lasted the entire next day. I called and scheduled another doctor\u2019s appointment. While I was waiting for the appointment, I noticed I was going to urinate much more often with less output than normal. Then somehow I drank too much juice and water, I became real bloated and full in my stomach. The next day I woke with a pounding headache, threw up all day and was extremely tired. This has happened 4 different times since. I did not drink any more fluids than I had in the past. It was as if my body was not processing the fluids as fast as it had before. When I saw my doctor I told her about everything that was happening and I also told her I thought I might have had a cholesterol deposit two different times on the top of my wrist a week or so ago. She said she did not think that was what I had. I thought it was a blister or something at first but I saw one online and noticed what I think it was. The ones I had were kind of a reddish rectangle shape. I think this is when I first time I told her I was itching all over a lot of the time now also. I also told her that I thought maybe the xanax were causing me to feel unwell and told her I wanted to cut back to 15 per month. My doctor checked my urine, sent me for blood work, and said both came back ok.  On 1/21/2007, we went to the ER because I was bloated and urinating only a very small amount even though I was drinking a lot of water. They told me everything was ok with blood and urine test and sent us home. The ER Doctor put Possible kidney failure for diagnosis.   I went back to my Doctor and told her I was worried about my urine output and that something is not right. I asked her to send me for more test on all my blood counts to see if it would show something that would explain. She sent me and said all came back ok for the most part except for B12 low. Start taking B12 supplements. Still waiting on rest of test results.  On 02/17/2007, I went back to Primary Care Doctor for follow up; she stated I was hypoglycemic (Glucose Tolerance Test - 1st hour 150, 2nd hour 90).  She said my body was using up all the sugar at once and I was crashing. If I did not change my dietary habits, I would be diabetic within a couple of years. She gave us a diet plan; I could have little or no sugar. No fruit juices, cookies, candy etc. I need to watch the carbs I was eating. Said I needed to re-train my Pancreas. We went home thinking this was all that was wrong.  On 03/13/07, I was feeling stressed and anxious again over finances. I called Doctors office and they filled xanax again. I reassured myself that all was ok and the Doctors were right, it was all in my head. I was cutting back on suboxone; I was not having the problems urinating (looking back I was drinking more coffee again) and was looking for employment again etc. I felt fine except for a little anxiety. Picked up xanax on the 14th. By the 3rd day, my ankles were swelling again and by the 5th day, I was having some body aches. I thought that maybe I was overdoing things again. By the 21st, my body aches were getting much worse. I started thinking the worse and flushed the rest of my prescription.   By the 24th, I had a constant low-grade fever (98.9 \u2013 100.4) and my joints ached. This lasted for 2 months. Stool was a light color again, almost yellowish, goes back and forth from loose, watery to constipated. They smelled like ammonia, floating, it also looked as if whitish grease was floating around it with a lot of undigested food particles.  Seem to have more trouble thinking and lose thoughts easier when we have chicken several days in a row. I became dehydrated somehow during same time even though I drink about a gallon of water per day.   When I stop drinking coffee, within 3-4 days I have trouble urinating again, feel real bloated and cannot eat. Urine has been very foamy lately and dip test at Doctors office confirmed protein every time lately and keytones were found some of the times. Foam worse after eating high protein or drinking Boost. Urine looks like a cloud or something is floating in toilet. Since all this started I have experienced all the following: For two weeks after the 24th, I could not eat anything fattening without feeling as if I would throw up.  Have pain in center by breastbone after eating  Low grade fever between 98.9 \u2013 100.4 everyday, am ok, by 2-3 pm temp goes up Night sweats \u2013 (had to change shirts 2-3 times due to sweat sometimes) Ears ringing all the time  Joint aches  Sleep patterns have changed several times Weight loss \u2013 I weighed 225 one and a half years ago, now 176 Multiple medication/chemical sensitivities Aspirin, Xanax, Coffee, Flexeril,  Coated tongue that will not go away Itchy skin (was worse at night on fingers and feet) Couple of spider veins on chest - (I was told wrong type for liver disease) Testicles seem smaller - (multiple varicose veins visible) Lack of sex drive Dry red itchy eyes for over a year Starting to get headaches a lot (never used to get any)  Skin on face breaks out \u2013 (Butterfly Rash) Tips of fingernails turning reddish color Hair thinning out Urine foam is getting worse Cannot think clearly  On 04/10/07, I was very bloated from fluids staying in my stomach. They are not reaching the bladder for some reason. I called the pharmacy and the recommended a mild diuretic. I took 1 of these and within 2 hours, I was urinating about every half hour. My stomach shrank and I was able to breathe easier. I found out later that day this was dangerous because of potassium and to go to ER.   All this has happened within the last year and a half. Somehow, after each medication usage since August 2006 it seems like I have become worse than the time before. I know it does not make sense but these symptoms are real and not something I created. Obviously, something is not right which is why I am so concerned. I have quit all other medications.  Since then, I have seen another GI Doctor, Infectious Disease Doctor, Neurologist and Endocrinology Doctor. All checked blood work and say nothing is wrong.  I know you are busy, but if this were happening to you, what would you do. What do you suggest I do for all these unexplained medical issues? Where or who do I turn to now? I have asked for a liver biopsy but because of the blood work, they will not consider.   Thanks, any help would be appreciated.\n\n",

There is a leap of faith involved and sometimes we never do get the full answers we would like.  We often have to learn to live with a condition even when we don't know what to call it.  The important thing is that they have investigated the potential serious problems and if they believe they have covered all the bases, I doubt anyone on the internet would try to second guess them on it.    This may not be the answer you are seeking but you asked for an opinion and this is what I think.  Stay in touch with your primary doctor so if new symptoms develop you can follow up on those.  Good luck.\n\n",

It can increase in size during acute infections similar to the lymph node enlargement that can occur in the neck.  This is very unlikely to cause any problems.  The risk of spleen damage is minimal unless the spleen is very large, which I'm sure your doctor would have told you.  Your doctor is correct that the spleen will return to normal size over time.  It should be safe to travel, assuming this is what is going on.  Best wishes.\n\n",

Is your urine clear and normal color?  An ultrasound and a CT are non-invasive tests that are routinely used in an Emergency room to help diagnose abdominal pain.  H Pylori is a bacteria known to be a culprit in gastric ulcers, so I am glad you were able to complete the course of antibiotics to eliminate that threat. But the abdomen contains many organs and is a complex area that needs careful investigation by either your primary doctor, or ask for a referral to a gastroenterologist - a specialist in the stomach and intestines.\n\n",

The additional details you presented in your last post is suggestive of a malabsorption problem.  This may be enteric, or may simply be a matter of changing your diet somewhat.  Sometimes a sample of stool can tell the doctor if there are any abnormalities that need to be addressed. Your doctor or the specialist can tell you if that is an optional or valuable test in your case.\n\n",

I am glad to hear your earlier tests were normal.  Please be aware:  Prednisone at 20 mg is a fairly hefty dose.  Prednisone has been accused of contributing to weight gain and other complications.  It also must, must, must be weaned properly to avoid certain pitfalls from a too rapid decrease of the drug.  Please follow any weaning parameters carefully!  Thank you for your feedback.\n\n",

I usually drink beer, but also drink wine and will sometimes drink a bottle of wine in one night. I recently had a knee injury and was prescribed vicodin. I have had a total of 3 vicoden in the past 5 days, and one day drank 3 beers with the vicodin. Since then,  I have had a weird pain in my right side of my abdomin for about 3 days. it's more of a discomfort than a pain and it does seem to radiate from my side, under my rib, further down, and in my back.   Is this a sign of liver disfunction from alcohol, and acetametophin? Should I consult a doctor? I'm not sure if I really have a medical problem, or if I'm being paranoid.

Your pain may be from some liver inflammation or may be from several other things, including some gastritis or intestinal inflammation or possibly even the gallbladder.  The amounts you are describing would typically be considered safe for most people but some do react to even small amounts at times.  If your pain continues I would recommend you see your doctor for an evaluation to figure out why you are having this.  Best wishes.\n\n",

He was in the hospital for seven weeks and I just brout him home my question is what will happen now? He seems to get worse each week. He has a wound vac and a drain in the liver that collects bile.

    "content": "I have read related topics, but find that each person's scenario is slightly different.  I am a 30 year old female, perhaps 15 pounds overweight (have been going to the gym 4 times a week since July 1) and my weakness is alcohol.  However, I have a great career, albeit stressful.  I really do not know what is considered to be a 'heavy' drinker, and therefore I really do not know whether the pain I am feeling is potentially liver related.  My background includes the following. I do not drink daily (weekends mostly unless I have a glass of wine a time or two during the week) but I know that I do binge drink.  Most Friday nights consist of about 3 stout drinks, and most Saturday nights consist of about 6 drinks.  There have been occasions when I have way overdone it and vomited or had memory loss, but those are limited (maybe once a year vomiting, 5 times a year memory loss).  Am I at risk for liver disease?  I have had pain on the right side under my rib cage on and off for a year or so.  A couple of years ago, I had an US of my abdomen and it was normal.  I have also had liver enzyme levels checked twice in the last couple of years, most recently a few months ago.  The doctor just said all levels were normal.  It does not hurt any more when you push on it that it does when you don't push.  The pain is usually about 1 or 2 inches below the last rib in vertical location, and about halfway through the rib width in horizontal location (maybe 4 inches from my side?).    Any help would be great!\n\n",

This continued until slightly over a year ago when I felt a moderate burning sensation and mild bloat in mid-lower right abdomen. I completely abstained from alcohol for 4 months after this, sensation went away within first few weeks. I drink only once to twice a month now, sometimes slightly more. Sometimes I get a mild burning sensation only after drinking, that goes away within a few days. It is in the lower right abdomen just to the right of navel. Going to permanently abstain from alcohol from now on.  -Was curious about lower right mild burning reaction after consuming alcohol -If this is a symptom of the more advanced liver fibrosis or cirrosis. I have not felt nausious or have any loss of appetite, no yellowing    Thank You.\n\n",

I suspect that this may be the cause of your increased level.  Regarding the increased liver size, this is actually a very non-specific finding.  The liver can increase in size because of many things.  It may be an infection, increased blood volume, or increased pressure in the liver.  Further evaluation is needed to help sort this out.  I suspect that you are currently seeing a GI specialist based on the tests that have been done but if you are not this would be a helpful evaluation.  Follow up with your doctor is important.

    "content": "Hello Doctor. My question is regarding my husband who is 44. I will tell you briefly about his history. He was the perfect image of health until April 2006 was diagnosed with ALL and underwent chemotherapy. In October 2006 he had a stem cell transplant and the donor was a male sibling. Despite that the donor was a 100% match, in april 2007 Graft Versus Host Disease attacked my husband's liver. The doctor got it under control with the prednisone and started him on 200 mg for few days and slowly decreased the dosage. Last week and finally after 4 months of steroids he was down to 15 mg of prednisone every other day. For the past 2-3 weeks the bilirubin has been going higher and doctors thought it was the posaconazole that he has been taking for the past months for a fungal infection on his lungs; therefore they stopped that, put a pick line for him and started infusing Abelet every night at home. However, last wednesday we got a phone call from the doc. that the bilirubin went up to 10.4(indirect 4.3/direct 6.1)rednisone. they believe the GVHD is back in the liver. I am very nervous specially when i look into his yellow eyes and he has been having average of 5 to 6 bowel movements a day and it's not diarrhea and he complains about pressure and sometimes pain on the right side which where the liver is. We have a doctor's appointment monday but i wanted to get your opinion. My question is how dangerous is 10.4 bilirubin? and are the symptoms that i mentioned normal when there is problem with the liver. Thank you in advance for taking the time to read this.   ES\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Dr. Lowe Thank you for responding to my question. Last Monday september 10th we saw the doctor and my husband's bilirubin was still at 10.4. It was excatly what it was a week prior. So the doctor decided to wait another week maybe the prednisone will quick in since it was only 60 mg/day. Well yesterday sep. 17 we went back and as usual they run whole bunch of test for post transplant patient and of course they checked the liver. And since the liver results come out later on that day we received a phone call this morning that the bilirubin is up to 16.4 (indirect 6.9 and direct 9.5) and my husband needs to be admitted back to the hospital for them to try to figure out what's happening and of course to do a liver biospsy, an ultrasound and whole bunch of test. Now the funny thing when we got to the hospital today around noon the first thing they did of course was draw blood and early evening the doctor came and said that the total bilirubin was down to 14.0.  My question to you is: is it possible the total bilirubin went down from monday to tuesday by 2 points by itself? or is it some kind of miracle? Do you think his body wasn't responding to the prednisone and now it starts to respond. Because I mentioned in my first email that they believe it's GVHD(Graft Versus Host Disease) but now they want to biopsy to confirm. Can you please also try to tell me when someone has such high bilirubin what kind of treatment is given to bring it down and approximately how long does it take to start going down? I forgot to mention some other tests related to the liver. Albumin 2.6 L Alkaline phos 171 H Aspartate amino. 301 H Ala amino 375 H My last question to you. I was giving him milk thistle 3-4 times daily(40drops each dose) before the bilirubin reached 10.4. Please tell me did that have anything to do with making his liver worst. I hope i didn't damage anyhing.  As always i appreciate you taking the time to answer me and God bless you for saving lives.\n\n",

More sophisticated testing using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry are much less likely to give a false positive.  If needed the GC/MS testing can be used to confirm the presence of THC in cases of possible false positives.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "title": "HepB Vaccination Question",
    "content": "Hello- I am a 27 year old young physician early on in training who needs some help in deciphering my tests. I am very healthy and have tested negative for HIV and HCV recently. No risk factors (no drugs, tattoos, and never sexually active).  I was vaccinated for HepB back in 1997 with a full course. I however was never titered. When I started medical school they required me to be titered and my HepBSAb came back negative. At the time, one doctor suggested I be tested for HepB Core Ab to see if I had been previously infected. Another physican told me that according to the CDC, a titer outside of 1-2 months after the last dose is meaningless as Ab levels can diminish over time and be below the qualitative threshold (e.g. <10mIU/ml) and hence a negative test. She recommended a booster dose and a re-titer. I did this, and my Hep B S Ab screen at one month post vaccine was positive. I felt relieved knowing I was immune, and really haven't given it much thought since.  Recently though, what the first doctor said has been creeping into my head and has me worried a bit. I have never had any elevated LFTs and also was getting repeat testing while on Accutane for acne, and did not have a bump at any point. I feel fine, but am worried that even though I am now \"immune\" based on the Hep S Ab result, I may be a heterotypic case or may have been someone who was vaccinated even though I was infected.   Would you recommend testing for HepB C Ab and HepB S Ag? Again, I have absolutely no risk factors (and the positve Hep B S Ab result was obtained prior to being on the wards without significant patient exposure). I was born in Lebanon (not listed as an endemic region on the CDC website), and I am assuming my mother is Hep B negative as she is alive and healthy without any apparent liver dz or LFT abnormalities. She was a health care worker as well, however.  Help would be appreciated. Thank you :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Worrywart911,  I don't think you need to pursue being tested for HBV core Ab or HBVsAg.  It is unlikely that you have contracted HBV without any exposure to the transmission routes.    Most likely your antibody levels slipped below the \"positive\" mark for the titer.  In that case, it was completely appropriate to get a booster.  Your + titer is indicative of immunity now.  Best wishes and good luck in your training.  Medicine is a great choice.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Really Concerned,  Mild hepatosplenomegaly may be normal or may be due to several causes.  If the liver is enlarged due to damage blood may have trouble flowing freely through it causing it to back up and make the spleen larger.  The possible reasons for this are quite extensive.    The first step, though, is to find out if this is truly abnormal.  Your doctor may be able to follow your liver/spleen size by physical examination or you may need a repeat ultrasound in a month or so.  Follow up with your doctor is important.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, 36 female with history of heavy drinking. Almost everyday in my twenties and then probably three times a week until March 07 when I quit. I had previously posted a question about me having Terry's nails and a few spider angiomas. Since March more spiders have developed on my arms and more recently my palms turned very red and splotchy. All bloodtests have been normal (five in the last two years), Ct scan showed normal size liver with two cysts and two old calcified granulomas which Dr. said was no big deal. No free fluid and veins were patent. Dr. said I'm needlessly alarming and does not believe I have cirrhosis. Dermatologist says spiders are just aging. My questions are:  Is it possible to have three major symptoms of cirrhosis (Terry's nails, red palms, and spiders) and not have liver disease? Could these symptoms be caused from chronic heavy drinking alone?  What are calcified granulomas in the liver. Ct scan said they probably represent old tuberculosis but I never had tuberculosis that I'm aware of.  Please take your time in responding as I realize you are volunteers and have busy schedules. I really appreciate this site and your input.\n\n",

I have spiders and occasionally red palms as well and I'm around your age, 37. Also with a history of drinking. Terry's nails has other causes beside cirrhosis. Wikipedia.com it. If you had cirrhosis your liver panel would show that. Liver enzymes only start to look normal in end stage cirrhosis. If that were the case you would likely have more severe symptoms. Additionally, a ct and ultrasound should rule out this type of condition. Best. Eric\n\n",

Of course they won't do a biopsy with normal tests and even if they did find damage they'll just tell me to stop drinking which I did already.

    "content": "I'm a 38 year old male with no history of excessive alcohol consumption (aside from my college days) and have never used tobacco.  I've always been in very good shape and exercise on a regular basis.  I've always had a clean bill of health, however, something has come up during standard blood-work when applying for life insurance.  In short, my total bilirubin came in at 1.6 (.1-1.2 MG/DL), while my ALT was 84 (1-45 U/L), with everything else coming in \"normal,\" such as AST 40 (0-41 U/L).  Test were negative for Hep B and C.  Follow-up tests included a complete scan of my liver, kidneys, etc. with nothing significant being found.  Additional blood work included the typical test for iron, copper, and a full hep panel, all coming back as normal.  These same follow-up tests found my AST up a wopping 1 point to 41, however, my ALT had now dropped to 76 and my biblirubin was up to 3.0.  My doctor does not seem to be overly concerned about things and has scheduled a follow-up set of tests for three months.  It is also his opinion the Gilbert's syndrome is not the cause.  I can't seem to find anything anywhere that would adequately explain elevated bilirubin and alt with everything else remaining in the normal range.  For several years I've replace my morning meal with a protein shake/meal supplement from GNC, and often have one after working out, but I can't imagine that would have any effects on liver function as it does not contain things such as creatine.  Having a three year old and a one year old now depending on me, I've become a little concerned.  Any thoughts on the matter that someone could pass along would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you!\n\n",

If you have something causing your red cells to break down faster it can cause an elevated ALT and bilirubin.  Gilbert's syndrome would not typically cause an elevation in ALT.  Rather it is an isolated minor elevation of the bilirubin.  I would recommend having your hemoglobin and hematocrit tested to see if they are low.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I understand your confusion about this problem.  I will try to give a little information here.  As for the lab results~  A standard reference range is not available for this test because these are dependent on many factors, including patient age, gender, sample population, and test method, numeric test results have different meanings in different labs. Your lab report should include the specific reference range for your test and your doctor can better interpret in light of other symptoms.  Lab values such as ALT does not in itself diagnose illness but it is part of the clinical picture and it can be useful in discovering problems.  Don't be afraid to ask for full explanation, taking into consideration your specific case.  A high ALT value does suggest some type of liver injury or insult.  This could be related in some cases, as you suggested, to strenuous exercise or alcohol (both of which your boyfriend does not have risk for).  It could also be the result of medications taken (prescription or even \"natural\" or \"herbal\" products) or bile duct blockage.  Acute or chronic disease Hepatitis can be caused by viruses contracted through exposure such as food (Hepatitis A) or blood contact, sexual or other body fluid (Hepatitis B or C) and there is also an auto-immune form where the body attacks itself.     Again, this is just general information to help you understand liver conditions that may be reflected in this lab report.  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "I've had a re-occuring slight burning pain on the upper right side of my ribs about 7 inches under my arm pit. I also have a dull very mild ache or full sensation in the lower right abdomen about 3 inches below my ribs and tends to not always be in the same spot. I've had comprehensive blood tests, urine test, stool sample, ultrasound, full upper body CT Scan (with contrast), chest X-Ray, Lung compacity test - ALL tested normal. I have no other sympotoms and feel absolutely fine. My AST is only slightly elevated (50). All other liver function test are normal. Also, this discomfort is not present in the morning and don't notice it while I'm sleeping.  This has been going on for about 7 months. I've been very concerned there could be a problem with my liver as I have been a heavy drinker for about 11 years. I still drink, but a bit less. I also drink about 3 cups of coffee per day. My diet otherwise is healthy and balanced. I'm not overweight and I'm a 37 year old male. I come from a family of heavy drinkers but no occurances of any liver problems. Mostly colon problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Eric55,  It seems that everything is O.K with all your tests,but at the same time heavy alcohol drinking is very harmful to the liver tissue(parenchyma)...It might not be seen now, but it is in progress to something called cirrhosis and hence the slight elevation in your AST ,although your ALT should be elevated as well.  Cirrhosis is disruption of the liver cells' architecture that can impair their normal functions leading later on to liver cell failure or even liver cancer.  I advice you to decrease your alcohol consumption , also try to cut down on fatty food,excercise regularly and drink plenty of fluid. Re-do the liver functions after 3 months and have your doctor do a thoroughly abdominal examination for you.  I hope this have helped. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you doctor for taking the time to respond to my question. I did just recently had my blood retested and AST still just slightly elevated and ALT is well within normal range. Actually it's on the lower end of normal.  My doctor verified that my liver looks normal, no fatty infiltration, enlargement or irregularities (based on CT/Utrasound results). I was sent to a GI specialist whom has decided to preform an Endoscopy and Colonoscopy due to the LRQ location of my discomfort. Unfortunately I am very aware of exactly what cirrhosis is (hence why I'm on these boards). With the upmost respect, you scared the #@* out of me when you said that my liver was in progress to cirrhosis. After researching on my own and consulting with my doctors, I'm a long way from developing anything like that. Never-less, I've cut back significantly on drinking. Less than 20 drinks in a week (down from 45). Basically 2 light beers after work and a glass of white wine with dinner. Thanks again for your response.\n\n",

It's a good thing that they will do endoscopies for you, they are ruling out any gastrointestinal causes that might lead to a referred pain in your ribs.  ALT is more specific for liver disease than AST because AST is produced in other places besides the liver (e.g. heart, intestine, muscle).It is only elevated if there is injury in any of those tissues.  Have you had a blow to your ribs that might have caused the pain? how about your exercise habits? Best wishes,\n\n",

When you say that all tests were negative, did your son get evaluated for the large number of conditions that can predispose to developing clots, such as Factor V Leiden and Prothrombin 20210 mutation?

    "content": "Hi GPanonymous,  I think your overall chances of contracting HBV from this exposure are quite small.  HBV is not a particularly strong virus when it comes to infections.  This is why it is considered a blood transmitted disease.  The amount in saliva is unlikely to cause infection.  Also, the hepatitis B vaccine series is known to be very effective in preventing infection.  It is very likely that you are still well protected by your vaccinations.  Finally, blood borne infections are much more likely to be transmitted via a hollow needle (such as getting stuck with an IV needle) than a solid object (like a sewing needle).  It sounds as if you were stuck with a solid object (I am presuming).  All these factors together make the chances of contracting HBV very unlikely.  That being said, if this happenned at work I would encourage you to report it.  There are some blood tests that are often done at the time of the incident to assess your current infection status and immunity status.  This will help to determine if infection may have occurred from this incident should you become positive in the future.  Most healthcare facilities have a very understanding policy regarding infection exposure.    Best wishes.\n\n",

I believe with all the listed condition you have had: 1-GERD. 2-Hiatus hernia. 3-Ulcers + H.Pylori. 4-Diverticulosis. 5- IBS. 6- and internal hemorrhoids..... have had a great deal in making you feel fatigued already!   On the other hand..Fatigue can be also due to: -anaemia from chronic blood loss throughout the years,  -cholecystitis,causing both fatigue and right upper abd.pain (you ought to decrease your fat intake),  -your liver lesion(1cm) is it subcapsular? irritating the liver capsule and hence causing the pain. what is the nature of it?( Duplex can give an idea during an ultrasound)  -GERD and Hiatal hernia should be treated to prevent heart burn, bleeding and later on serious esophageal  problems like cancer.  Mental confusion can be due to anemia as well and also may be due to damage of the brain tissue from drinking copious amounts of alcohol.  I believe your Gastroenterologist is doing a great job, you can take multivitamins, cutt off on fatty food, investigate the liver lesion and check your hemoglobin level for anemia.  I hope that have helped, Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Your liver enzymes are very minimally elevated.  I would recommend you retest them in a month or so to see if they have resolved.  They really are not elevated to the degree I would expect if you had hepatitis.  The low ceruloplasm is interesting.  If there is truly concern for Wilson's disease there are more tests that are more specific.  The most sensitive test to rule out Wilson's disease is actually a liver biopsy.  Normal liver copper levels essentially rules out WD.  Elevated levels is very suggestive of WD but can be found in other conditions.  A 24 hour total urine copper level can be tested as well.  I am more stumped by your low cholesterol.  Cholesterol levels that are too low can lead to impaired cellular membrane formation and stability.  This may be normal for your but it is certainly lower than I would expect.  I would recommend you see a GI specialist for further evaluation.   Best wishes.\n\n",

Given that you have no other issues with the liver (all enzymes are normal, etc.) it seems less likely that you are experiencing liver failure causing your elevation.  If, for some reason such as a viral infection or medication reaction, you had some increased breakdown of red blood cells your bilirubin levels can go up transiently.  Another common cause of an elevated bilirubin level is a condition called Gilbert's disease.  This is a condition where the liver does not process bilirubin properly, leading to slightly elevated bilirubin levels.  It is a harmless disease.  I would recommend you have your level repeated.  If it remains elevated, I would strongly suspect Gilbert's disease but would recommend that you see a GI specialist to get an expert opinion.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "I just received a phone call from my 31 year old daughter.  Her doctor told her she has a blood mass in her liver but did not elaborate.    She also has a gallstone in the binary duct. And an infection in her lymph node under her ear.    My mother and I both have had gallstones, I know it's hereditary.  My mother has also had throid cancer in the past.  I have Crones Disease.  Prior to the antibiotics for the node infection she has not been on any medication.  I never heard of a blood mass before.  Please if you could explain what it is, where it comes from and treatment.  Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "My mom fianlly admitted to me a few weeks ago that she was diagnosed w/ liver disease last year.  She's been an alcoholic as long as I can remember (I'm 31 now, she's 55).  Although she told me that she doesn't know what stage her disease is in, she did say the doctor's told her that there is nothing that can be done, I'm guessing she's already into Cirrhosis.  She doesn't give me details because she is trying to spare me so getting any information from her is difficult and I'm left to sort through her symptoms on my own.  Last week she fractured her foot and the orthopedic doctor told her she has osteoporosis.  They cannot cast it because of the swelling in her leg.  She tells me the swelling is a normal result of fracturing her ankle, but I've never heard of someone having to wait a week or two for the swelling to go down before being able to get a cast.    So, thanks to the internet I know that osteoporosis is common in people with liver disease, but does this swelling sound right for just a fracture or could this be edma?  Thank you very much\n\n",

    "content": "Tough question as it may be a combination of both.  After having a fracture of the ankle there can be significant swelling because often the fracture is also associated with some trauma to the ligaments and tendons (basically causing an ankle sprain along with the fracture).    It is fairly common to first splint a fracture then place the cast in about a week to let any swelling go down.  With liver disease, the blood albumin level can drop and result in edema.  One way to help sort it out would be to compare the ankles.  Edema would present with swelling of both ankles.  If the broken ankles is larger than the other, the difference in size is most likely due to swelling.  Best wishes.\n\n",

The bilirubin level in the blood can rise if the liver is having trouble processing it and excreting it.    There are a few other causes of elevated bilirubin and there are a few other causes of yellowing of the eyes including variations of normal coloring.  I suspect in your case, since it has been going on for 10 years it is very unlikely to represent liver issues.  I would recommend you mention this to your doctor at your next check up.  You may want to have some liver enzyme testing to measure your bilirubin and enzymes as a screening test for liver problems.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "It sounds as if you've had a very thorough work up already.  I really can't think of much else to add.  Have you had a HIDA scan?  This is  a nuclear medicine study that uses a small amount of radioactive tracer to see if the liver is excreting substances properly.  It can be very sensitive at detecting problems with liver function if there is a blockage, etc.  If the questran is helping your itching and your liver is normal, one possibility would be that your GI tract is reabsorbing bile salts too much.  Questran binds to the bile salts and inhibits their reabsorption.  I am not aware of any such conditions that exist; however, theoretically it makes sense.  Theories often don't translate to reality well though.  Also, if your ultrasound was done without doppler flow evaluation this should be done to be sure that the blood flow entering and exiting the liver is normal.  Sorry I can't be of much more help.

    "content": "41 y/o male, average weight, no medical history of significance, after my annual physical a few months ago all was ok and all lab tests were normal with the exception of some hyperlipidemia, so I received atorvastatin 20mg/day for 12 weeks. Then, stopped it and my labs showed elevated total bilirubin (25.1 umol/L), mostly unconjugated, with NORMAL AST, ALT, ALP, LDH, CPK and serum proteins. Blood lipids profile has normalized too. Hepatitis markers had been previously done as a part of a check up and were all negative and I don't have any symptoms or signs right now (but I did have some itchy  drug reaction rashes on and off during the treatment and even once in the last 2 weeks after discontinuing the drug).  I am rather concerned about the prognosis of this apparently cholestatic condition (as I was told), and the possibility of an aggravated hepatic condition. Could this elevation be a mere coincidence? If there is indeed a drug \u2013induced cholestasis, could the enzyme levels start to rise after two weeks of discontinuation of the treatment, or do I have enough grounds to be reassured this is likely to be a self-limited reversible condition? What to be on the alert for in the future? How often must the liver lab tests be repeated and when to expect bilirubin to return to normal? For how long this condition may persist? Thanks a lot\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I have had losse stools for seven years now and during that time drunk to much alcohol from stress and anxiety because of health worries. I had all sorts of unexplained joint pain and burning urine, feeling spaced out. Very worrying. All blood work apart from liver was normal, CBC, ESR, CRP etc. Tested for diabetes normal. My liver enzymes have been elevated ALT and AST 140 for this time and vary. My GGT has been 500-700 at times. My albumin, bilirubin are and all other tests I am told are normal. HAd tests for Hep ABC all negative.This all started on 2000. I abstained form alcohol for 6 weeks in 2001 and my readings didn't change. So had a liver biopsy which revealed a mildly fatty liver not enlarged and no damage. So Doc's said moderate alcohol lose weight and exercise. So I did but continued to drink socially. I also took milk thistle which helps keep the readings down to 90 ish. My urine is sometimes darker than normal but contains no bile. I went back in 2003 after my stools and joint pain didn't resolve. Been for endoscopies both ends, had rheumatology tests, brain scan et al. All nothing showing. So they did another biopsy which showed a fatty liver again with no reason for the symptoms I was experiencing. The moderated alcohol seemed to be making no difference. So they said just stay the same. So I drank socially maybe a glass of wine or two 2 or 3 times a week. Or occasionally more at the weekends.  My stools are still pale and seem greasy and I have checked the internet for liver symptoms which scare me to death. I do have Terry type nails not white but distal band redness white deposits in the nail. My eyes are somewhat blurry and I do have tenderness in the right upper quad and back stiffness particularly in the morning but my doc thinks I am a hypochondriac. Drank a little more over the last year due to depression and no real answers in sight but this makes things worse and I begin to worry if this is harming me more so I have now stopped for over five weeks but no improvement as yet. I don't know where to go next but do wonder about my liver. If its just fatty liver with diet and exercise will this resolve? Should I do a liver flush to help release the fat. Not sure what to do next. Any ideas please.\n\n",

I am concerned about the GGT tests...it indicates that you do have something wrong in your biliary system... and to have pale loose stools, that indicates that you have a problem in fat digestion, which supports the idea of a biliary problems +/- a pancreatic problem.  What needs to be done now is to discuss doing a CT scan of the abdomen and pelvis with contrast with your doctor... instead of doing an ordinary abdominal ultrasound and then do a CT scan...so we'd be able to view liver , its biliary tree, gall bladder,pancreas and any enlarged lymph nodes pressing on the common bile duct leading to malabsorption of fats.  I need you to check your bilirubin levels for me in your previous lab tests...the direct and indirect ones. then after the CT scan results, get back to me and we can think up a list of possible causes, ok?

    "content": "Ok.  Will talk to the doc next time I am there. Not sure he will want to do the test but I will try. In the meantime my total bilirubin was 13 umol/L and my direct bilirubin was 2 umol/L. Also for reference albumin was 47 G/L, Globulin 25 G/L. ALT 145 U/L, AST 86 U/L, GGT 587 U/L. Always assumed that my drinking caused this especially the GGT. Should I continue with the milk thistle or is this giving me false readings. Was fearful of stopping if this was helping in the light of no further help from the docs.  Many thanks. Andy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear AndyH8,  All your liver functions are absolutely fine apart from the ALT and AST ofcourse...you can continue use the milk thistle.. it is a herbal extract , safe to use  and is very beneficial in liver diseases.Its active ingredient is called Sylimarin and it is an anti-oxidant that protects the body and thus regenerating cells in a better enviroment.  As for the GGT?! well, you can also ask your doctor if he approves on adding dandelion root extract to the milk thistle.. it is a herb as well, liver tonic,mild laxative and very good for the biliary system.  Best regards,\n\n",

Do I need to worry?   I know the liver is good at healing itself, but I can't stop worrying. I have spoken to her about it, but she just says she doesn't drink that much. Maybe I'm being paranoid because I don't drink that much and it seems like she does? :-( Please help.  I wasn't sure where to post this, so sorry if it's in the wrong section.\n\n",

    "title": "Binge Drinking",
    "content": "Every person is affected differently by alcohol. Female drinkers reach higher blood alcohol levels faster than males because of less water, higher fat content in the body and differences in metabolism. Also, hormone changes in women can affect the blood alcohol level. There are other factors that affect how fast alcohol is processed in the body such as body weight, level of health and the consumption of food.  Moderate drinking for women is defined as an average of 1 drink or less per day. When blood alcohol concentrations reach very high levels, the brain's control over the respiratory system may be paralyzed. A .30 BAL is the minimum level at which death can occur; at .40 the drinker may lapse into a coma. At .50 BAL, respiratory functions and heartbeat slow drastically, and at .60 most drinkers are dead.  Long-term use of alcohol can increase the risk for:  Liver damage Heart disease Cancer Pancreatitis Hypertension Alcohol related birth defects Neurodegeneration  (the death of brain cells and reduced brain-tissue mass) Stomach and Intestinal ulcers Poor nutrition (decreased levels of iron and vitamin B, leading to anemia) Infertility Premature aging Increased risk of accidents  What Are the Signs of a Problem? -Has your friend ever felt that she should cut  down on her drinking? -Has your friend been annoyed by people criticizing her drinking? -Has your friend ever felt guilty about drinking? -Has your friend every had a drink first thing in the morning to steady her \u201cnerves\u201d or to get rid of a hangover -Has your friend experienced \u2018black-outs\u2019 during binge drinking?  If she answers yes to any of the above questions, then she may have a problem and should see her doctor for help. If your friend refuses to seek help, then you can try some of the following:  -Don\u2019t cover up for your friend if she has done anything \u2018embarrassing\u2019 or  \u2018illegal\u2019 during her binge drinking -Find a time to be alone with your friend (when she is sober) and let her know your concerns regarding her drinking. Use any examples of ways that drinking has caused problems for your friend or her significant others.  -State the results. Explain to your friend what you will do if she doesn't go for help--not to punish her, but to protect yourself from her problems. An example would be to refuse to go with her to any social functions in which alcohol is served. -Give your friend information and facts concerning the effects of alcohol abuse and where she may find help.

    "content": "Hi Musedeplath,  If you are referring to the infection of Hep C  ?  Hepatitis C is usually spread from one person to another by direct exposure to infected blood or blood products, and needles or other sharp objects. (body piercings, tattoos ).    Although chronic hepatitis C may not produce symptoms, the damage to the liver often continues and gets worse with time. When the liver is damaged (for example, by the hepatitis C virus), it tries to repair itself and forms small scars. This scar formation is called fibrosis. . The liver damage caused by chronic hepatitis C usually occurs gradually over a period of 20 years.  Because hepatitis C infection can damage the liver without any symptoms, it is important to get diagnosed early and discuss treatment options with your doctor.   Clay colored stools can be passed without the presence of Liver problems.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sir/Mam,   My father aged about 56 years is suffering from Hep. B and is on Adefovir (Hepsera) , recently he had undergone Sonography and MRI which reported as under :  MRI :  \" The study shows ultered signal intensity of lvier parenchyma. Focal Lesion measuring 24x21 mm is seen in Segment 6 of right lobe of liver appearing Hypointense in T1W & hyperintense in T2WI with tiny hyper intense focus in T1WI. The lesion shows heterogenous enhancement post contrast study with small non-enhancing areas within. The intra hepatic biliary radicals are not dialated. The prota hepatis is normal, the spleen is normal \"  The reports for other organs revealved normal except a small cyst on right kidney.  Sonography :  \" Liver is normal in Shape with normal echotexture. There is an approx. 33x41x37 mm S.O.L. with hyoerechoic texture with breakdown with mildly hypoecoic Halo  / Cronic(Residual) abscess  / Mitotic Lesion- No Clarification \"  ONE IMPORTANT THING ONE MONTH AGO ALSO HE HAD UNDERGONE A SONOGRAPHY WHICH REVEALED EVERYTHIN IS NORMAL IN LIVER AND THE VIRAL COUNT FOR HEP. B WAS ALSO UNDER NORMAL RANGE. BUT IN ONE MONTH VIRAL COUNT HAS ALSO INCREASED TO 5.82 AND THE MRI/SONOGRAPHY REVEALED AS ABOVE.  His other Liver Funcition tests like SGOT/SGPT/Albumin/Biliburin /Phosphate are slightly abnormal ranging to 50-100% higher than the normal values  MY FATHER'S CHILD SCORE IS 10.  Request you to guide me on the following points :  1. Whether he is suffering from Liver Cancer , if so can the stage of cancer be found out by the above reports ?  2. Whether he should go for liver transplantation or should go for RFAPI /Chemo Theraphy ?  3. What is the life expentancy in such cases ?  4. Do he continue Hepsera(Adefovir) or switch to Entacavir ?  5. Can this development takes place in only one month as the one month prior sonography revealed everything normal , do you suggest to undergo for retest ?  I know the questions are many but will be highly obliged and grateful if you can answer them ?  Thanks.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  An ultrasonographic examination of the liver is an excellent screening tool. But it can not be conclusive whether the lesion is malignant or due to another pathology.  MRIs, especially T2-weighted studies, are particularly good at detecting intrahepatic lesions. T2 W can help in distinguishing hemangiomas from carcinoma as carcinomas are of less intense signal at this level.   The characteristics you have mentioned can not be diagnostic for any pathological cause.  If malignancy is suspected there are other investigations to confirm the nature of this lesion. Non invasive techniques are available and help in diagnosis. Helical CT, study provides specific patterns of enhancement  that help if differentiating malignant lesions from hemangioma and, to a lesser extent, focal nodular hyperplasia (FNH)  Other investigations include:  Serum AFP a tumor marker known to be high in liver carcinoma. FNAC a cytological examination from suspicious lesions.  Having a chronic hepatitis B disease and being of old age make the need to exclude malignant nature of the lesion mandatory.   Before taking any decision in the treatment plan, the definitive diagnosis should be reached.  I advise you to follow with his doctor and discuss with him this information.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Although the level of (alpha feto proteins) is higher than normal, it is not conclusive for malignancy, in fact in patients with chronic liver disease have high level of this marker but generally less than 400 IU/ml.   Being at high risk for developing HCC ( chronic hepatitis B infection), and his MRI results makes malignant nature of the lesions is to be considered.   However, the decision for further approaches assuming that the lesions represent Hepatic carcinoma, should be taken by an oncologist after complete physical examination and work up evaluating his liver condition and his general medical status.  Surgical resection and liver transplantation are the only chances of cure in patinets with limited disease .  Indications for respectability include tumor size (less than  5 cm) and adequate liver function ( normal billirubin, albumin, etc).   From his results, his liver condition may not make surgery an appropriate approach.   But transplantation is still an option, however, opportunities for liver transplantation are limited thus doctors keep it as second option after surgery.  Other alternative local therapies are radiofrequency ablation, cryoablation, and radiotherapy.  Keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

A randomized trial in patients with cirrhosis and a small hepatocellular carcinomas showed an improved local recurrence-free survival in patients underwent radiofrequency ablation as compared to percutaneous ethanol injections as their  only form of treatment, but overall survival was not changed.(2)   Other approaches like embolization of the hepatic artery with  chemotherapy (adriamycin)  although result in central tumor necrosis, reduction in tumor size,  pain relief,  benefits are usually transient.

    "content": "Dear Dr.Safaa Mahmoud,  We have got RF ablation of liver tumors of my father, in the CT scan taken just before the RF ablation doctors told that there are three lesions in Segment IV, VI & VIII segment.  They have abalated lesions in Segment IV & VI , post RF my father's general conditions is ok and there is no bleeding and water in abdomen.  Regarding the third lesion your help is required on following doubts :  1. Recently one week after RF we got my father's ultrasound done which shows that there is no lesion in Segment VIII of Liver . Shall we get another CT Scan/MRI done before taking decision for any treatment .  2. Which test CT Scan/MRI is better for finding whether lesion is present or not ? When it can be done I mean after RF will it be harmful ?  3. If the third lesion is there Doctors are saying that it is very near to lungs for which RF would be difficult, should we go for RF / Chemo Embolization/ Surgery?  Thanks a lot , your opinion counts as always  regards,  vishesh singhvi\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Sorry for the delay in replying. Good news that your father has improved on RF.   If I understand well you said these results are obtained by US and A CT Scan or MRI will be done to confirm results.  A very important information while choosing the technique for reevaluation, is the initial one used in patient diagnosis and staging, and as I remember your father MRI showed all the lesions clearly, thus it is reasonable to repeat the MRI study for comparison and reevaluation.  In some countries a multi-phase spiral CT scan is the scan of choice and in others  MRI scan is the most preferred.  - As for Chemoembolization versus R, or surgery F this will depend on his general condition, his lab results (liver function tests), and the Scan results.   If it is still possible to treat (the remaining lesion if any) with RF, It will be reasonable approach since he responded well and his general condition was improved on this type of treatment.   Best regards. Keep us updated.\n\n",

One thing as I mentioned earlier his general condition post RF ablation is good, but after stopping pain killer medicine ( Tramazac 50 mg) he is feeling pain at a particular point in right side of abdomen , the doctor here are saying that sometimes it may happen because of the track they burn along with the tumor and it will go by time.  I wish to know that is something like this is normal   (as sometimes the pain becomes unbearable and even by touch of finger tip he feels pain) , he is having no other symptoms of abnormality like fever etc. and his liver functions tests have also improved in comparision to tests done immediately after RF Ablation.

Some of these cysts present at birth  while others discovered later in life. thus, discovered incidentally during routine radiological study.  Most of the liver cysts grow slowly and cause no symptoms.  Large cysts causing symptoms are the only indication for medical or interventions therapy. As long as there are no symptoms it is advisable not to treat them to avoid any possible complications.  Follow up with your Doctor is essential, inform him once you feel any pain or GI changes.

    "content": "I am 33 male with a bad history of alcohol abuse (from 15 to 25 only weekends but heavy consumption sometimes) then until 30 maybe 5 or 7 times a year until last year when I quit completely. First of all I feel really bad with myself about all this body damaging and wish I could go back and change things. Since 28 I exercise every day, (cycling) eat completely healthy (mainly fruit, vegetables and fish, no fatty food, etc)  When I was 18 I had (the doctor said then liver inflammation, never called other way such as hepatitis) Then I stopped completely and have diet for about 6 months.   In the last 5 years I have been checking my liver regularly and Doctor has said always that everything was ok. (Two times I had AST above its limit (39 once and 46 but I think was just after one of this 5 or 7 times a year) and nothing else.  What it has been found regularly is cholesterol LDL around 120. (I attribute this to something with the liver as I do exercise and eat healthy every day). Also have had lots of ultrasounds of the liver and everything has been ok.  I was feeling very healthy and as said I exercise every day and even was participating in competitions but three weeks ago I started to read on the internet about cirrhosis and since then I have lots of anxiety, can\u2019t sleep or do anything else because I am completely scared with the possibility of having it. I don\u2019t know if it is my imagination but I feel I have some of the symptoms. I have visited two doctors and all said there is nothing to worry because to have severe liver damage I would have had to drink every day for a lot of years and not only weekends. But I know that it could happen other ways also and then I think something wrong is happening.   In my last analysis bilirubin was above its level. Direct 0.4 indirect 1.6 (haemoglobin and anything else in the CBC was correct) (last year my bilirrubin was ok before I quit completely)  ALT 25, AST 23, GGT 16, Alkaline Phosphatase 143 (70-279), Iron 99 (60-160).urea 30(20-50) creatinin 1,08 (<1,3) Time of Prothrombin and proteinogram was ok. these have worried me a lot.   Other Symptoms that I have sometimes not always (now I feel it more) I have small disturbance on the liver area below the rib. My stools are soft and clear brown and I go every day to the toilet, sometimes just after having breakfast. I have noticed lately that I have dry mouth and when I eat something it decreases but I have to drink a lot of water to feel better.  Sometimes the palm of my hands are red and my face seems to have good color like a suntan which the doctors interpret as a healthy sign but I know I haven\u2019t seen the sun lately. My nails doesn\u2019t look bad but seem a bit white and pink. And today I have had my arms sleep because of having them above my head in the couch and when I have realised the palm of my hand seemed to have spider veins that have disappeared in minutes.    I don\u2019t know if everything is caused by the high anxiety lately or if I have to go a bit further in the investigations. I know a biopsy is high risk and doctor would discourage it with this analysis but I can\u2019t live this way, thinking all the time and punishing myself for being so stupid when I was younger.  It should be obvious that my liver it is not going to be as healthy as one no drinker but Do you think I have a more serious problem??? Any help would be very much appreciated.  P.D Have you hear about fibroscan?  I think it is like a scan but it can measure fibrosis but have no idea where to do this.  Sorry for the long post but I needed to talk with someone and hope this helps to other people.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I agree with your Doctor, there is no need for too much worry but regular follow up is mandatory.   Your enzymes level are within the normal range. They are good indicator for liver damage and injury. Even isolated rise is not something to worry about, persistent or rising levels are significant.  Normal levels of Direct bilirubin: 0 to 0.3 mg/dl  Total bilirubin: 0.3 to 1.9 mg/dl   Thus your results show mild elevation and should be repeated to confirm the results.  Direct bilirubin elevation is more related to disorders in the biliary system, if both are elevated, liver damage is the cause, and if the indirect form is more elevated, blood hemolysis should be excluded and examination for a  hematoma in the body should be done since you exercises regularly.  Abdominal US is very helpful in evaluation of the liver. I advise you to repeat your blood tests, do abdominal US and follow up with your Doctor.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I'm 22, 5-6 and weigh about 130.  Before I list my symptoms, I think it's important to say that I have had dry, itchy skin off/on for years, and also pain in the kidney area off/on for a few years, as well.  I've been to the doctor once for the kidneys, they gave me some pills to take, and I guess it went away for a while, but comes and goes.  Now, for about 6-8 months, I have drank enough per week to be considered alcoholic.  Recently, for two straight weeks, I binge-drank about three nights a week.  On the third week, after binge drinking on Friday, I woke up with a dull pain/sore feeling on my right side, from the lower part of my ribs down near my waist.    For a few days, it was mainly just that dull pain/sore feeling.  Then, after about three days, I started getting new problems.  I started getting little chest pains on either side; taking a breath, exhaling would have a little pain.  Also, I became short of breath and tired very quickly, to the point of feeling like I was going to pass out one day while walking around for an hour or so.  Also, I started burping excessively.    It's been about two weeks now, haven't drank since two weeks ago Friday.  Also, my kidney pains are coming back now, usually first thing in the morning.  The shortness of breath and burping usually came with an odd feeling in my throat.  Also, every now and then, my heart skips a beat, like fluttering a little bit.  The dull pain is now only around for a few hours a day, as are the other symptoms.    Was wondering what this points more toward, liver, gallbladder, something else entirely?  Have a doctor's appointment in a week, just going crazy wondering what might be wrong.  Any ideas?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  This sounds like, GERD resulting in esophagitis .  The anatomical relation between the diaphragm and the Lowe Esophageal Sphincter LES prevents the gastric acids to come up into the esophagus (reflux). Acid reflux causes severe pain and discomfort in the chest mainly in the morning. Others may experience burping, a feeling like the food stuck in their throat or tightness in the throat, dry Cough and Shortness of breath similar to Asthma.   Diagnosis is made by complete history taking, physical examination, investigations like Upper Endoscopy, Manometric studies, and other lab tests that can be recommended by the doctor accordingly.   Certain foods are known to aggravate the condition, and you better avoid them. These include chocolate, beverages containing caffeine, fatty and fried foods, garlic and onions, spicy and tomato containing foods. In addition smoking is one of he precipitating factors that should be avoided.  Psychological or emotional stress and Anxiety, in these cases the diagnosis is made by exclusion of other causes.   Other causes like gastritis , gastric ulcer, gall bladder diseases and hepatic injury should be excluded as they give similar clinical picture..  Best regards\n\n",

Steps for liver biopsy are generally: -Patients stay in supine position. -Ultrasound or CT imaging are usually used to guide for the biopsy site. -Local antiseptic measures are done here the needle will be introduced. -Local anesthesia with 1% lidocaine. -A small incision in the skin is made for the biopsy needle. -Biopsy is taken. -Pressure over the biopsy site, then an adhesive bandage is added.  -Patients stay in this position for 1 hour to avoid  bleeding or bile leakage.  -Vital signs are measured frequently till discharge.  Complications are rare and occur mostly during first 24 hours(majority in the first 2 hours) Pain accounts for 30% of compactions reported by patients but usually remain for short duration and relieved by analgesics.  If severe abdominal pain occur your Doctor should be reported immediately.  Best regards.\n\n",

So, I think your levels are not significantly high. Of importance the results of other blood indices  in addition to the clinical picture as well as your complaints to give a clearer picture.  Normal BUN/creatinine varies from lab to another but within a range of 10:1\u201320:1. I can also tell that your level is not so far from normal, keeping in mind that the ratio get lower in people who do not eat enough proteins and those who drink alot especially the day before doing the test (hydrated). Some drugs also do this effect.  The normal range of values for AST (SGOT) is from 5 to 40 units/L. This means your enzyme level is within the normal range.  Follow up with your doctor is essential.

The duration of treatment varies from 24-48 weeks...preferrably if you  are a good responder to Interferon and you became PCR -ve early in treatment, you should continue to 48 weeks.  you can check on HCV on our site here under gastroenterology/diseases and if you need more info ... you can check this easy to use website http://www.hepatitis-central.com   Please feel free to ask any other questions .

I had an abdominal/ pelvic ct done in the last month which said the liver was normal in size and ct attenuation. There is a small cyst on the liver.

My fingernails are now starting to match my toenails, all white except for the distal band is pinkish or brownish. I have \"paper money skin\" on my chest and two very small spiders. No jaundice. My doctor has stated if I had liver problems it would have shown up in the bloodwork or ct scan and believes I am healthy and no follow up is required. I feel healthy but am concerned about the nail changes.  My question is can you have Terry's nails at my age without liver problems or could we be missing something? I thank you for your response.\n\n",

Also the doc in here told someone in here that was worried about terrys nails that it was not an accurate way to tell if your liver is messed up becouse the link between them was noted back in the 50's and can not alone be a big deal, so if your liver function tests are normal i would rest easy. I am no doctor i just want to help ease your anxiety tell a doctor can post . =)\n\n",

You say your liver functions are fine and your ultasound as well with no free fluids...I believe your situation is stable..you might have a little bit of low albumin level though. you need to eat well,get a healthy diet and life style and quit drinking alcohol to give your liver a chance to renew its cells if the ultrasound says that there has not become cirrhotic yet.

I started iching all over and had tingeling in my hands and feet , had high bilirubin levels and alcaline phosphate so I thought i had mono or hepititus but all was negative. I then got a sonogram and it was normal, the Clorestamine they put me on got rid of the itching and i had no swelling in my liver and eventualy they just said I was \"growing\" and had nothing to worrie about. 6 years later and its come back. I had sever itching and i knew what it was instantly. Same tests High bilirubin and high alcaline phosphate. Tested for HEP and all clean. Got a sonogram, nothing abnormal. Im on Phonobarbital and clorestamine and the itching is gone. My last lab showed all enzymes back in normal range but now i have pain in uper right quadrent and back. Could this be a side effect of the clorestamine becouse im very constipated. Also im going to go see a GI when i get some money but in the mean time im so scared. what could this be ? its obviously chronic  any ideas?  -David Bohannon\n\n",

Initial Stool examination, liver function test and CBC can be done.  You can follow up with your doctor where you are now for initial evaluation. If you do not get improved or you feel not confident, as soon as you are back take an appointment with your consultant for proper management.  Keep us updated. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear lholmesjr,  Mild elevations of the liver enzymes are usually discovered during routine blood tests in healthy individuals.   ALT levels are usually in the range of twice the upper limits of normal. Fatty liver in obese, diabetic, alcoholic people are the commonest causes. The lipid profile should be assessed in these individuals.  Higher-than-normal levels of these liver enzymes does not indicate liver problem in all cases.   The interpretation of elevated AST and or ALT levels should be integrated with the clinical picture to evaluate liver diseases.  Isolated mild elevation of liver enzymes is considered abnormality and significant if it continues for six months.   Follow up with your doctor is essential. You better repeat your tests in a 6 month time for follow up.  Hope you find this information useful.  Best regards,\n\n",

I do not drink more than 3 or 4 alcoholic drinks a month, so I do not think this would be a cause for my elevated enzymes.   I have had a lot of heartburn and diarrhea in the past couple of weeks.  My question is, is it ok to wait 6 months and see what my enzyme level is then, or should more be done to figure out the cause?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear tdgang5,  Elevated liver enzymes can be due to many causes like: - Medications phenobarbital, anti-convulsants, phenytoin, acetaminophen, vitamin A, cholesterol-lowering medications, and some antibiotics.  - Elevated triglycerides due to fatty liver - Drinking too much alcohol  - Obesity and Diabetes also due to fatty liver - Infection, such as viral hepatitis   - Autoimmune hepatitis and primary biliary cirrhosis  - Tumors in the hepatobiliary system. - Metabolic liver disease, such as hemochromatosis.  Abdominal US can help in the d differential diagnosis.  Isolated mild elevation of liver enzymes is considered abnormality and significant if it continues for six months.   Since, there are no symptoms; your doctor advised a follow up test after 6 month. But, you have to inform him with any new symptoms. Follow up with your doctor is essential.  Hope you find this information useful. Best regards,\n\n",

The checked my gall bladder and said it was fine ran a abdominal CT scan on me and said that everyting looked normal now shrinking or swelling.  I still have a elevated bilirubin and i have noticed some mucus and blood in my stool everynow and again, also there is a weird rash all along my hair line.  Also it looks as if i am losing weight like i am getting thinner.  I also got tested for all heps. that was clear and got a barrium enema done they said that all looks good... the only thing i could think of is some kind of virus they haven't caught yet... they have tested my stools for some virus's but haven't came up with anything... i also had some bad fish like a few months before all this happends but they tested for almost anything i could have got from that...  The only other things maybe is C-Diff. or salmenilla in the blood stream.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear A-Train8486,  Is it a sole elevation of the bilirubin, or liver enzymes are also elevated, even for transient period initially? I need also to know which is more elevated the direct or the indirect form of bilirubin. Direct bilirubin elevation is more related to disorders in the biliary system, if both are elevated, liver damage is the cause, and if the indirect form is more elevated hemolytic blood disease are expected.  If there is elevated liver enzymes, causes include: - Pancreatitis usually presents with severe acute Abdominal pain that is felt in the upper abdomen and or in the back. In mild cases the pain is mild and becomes more severe with eating and is associated in many cases with Nausea and Vomiting, Fever and Tachycardia. Ultra sonogaraphy shows characteristic changes in the pan crease.  -Did they exclude non infectious causes; a toxic cause, like drug induced hepatitis. Have you received any medications before this condition started. Drugs induce hepatitis include phenobarbital, anti-convulsants, phenytoin,  acetaminophen, vitamin A, etc  - Autoimmune hepatitis (AIH) is a remote but still possibility, it always becomes chronic, this after 6 months of symptoms without identifying a cause,  the disease can be proved. in most of cases however, there is hepatoslenomegally.  If it is sole elevation of the bilirubin then other causes like , blood diseases, liver cirrhosis (enzymes may show mild elevation) should be investigated.   CBC, Liver function tests including ALT,AST, PT, PC and albumin, alkaline phosphatase as well should be repeated.  I think your doctor may consider an ERCP to examine properly the Biliary tract. Sometimes liver biopsy is needed to reach the diagnosis.  Hope you find this information useful. Follow up with your doctor is essential. Best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Dear cakebaker,  Causes of Right Upper Quadrant Pain associated with loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting- include:  - Gall Bladder or Biliary  tract problems: Abdominal US, CT and ERCP are used to diagnose these diseases.  - Hepatitis: measurement of the liver enzymes and virological examination is essential. Viral Hepatitis include (HAV, HBV, HCV, etc.)   - Pancreatitis Ultrasonogaraphy and CT shows characteristic changes in the pancreas. A threefold or more increase in ALT strongly suggests pancreatitis.   - Appendicitis the pain is felt in RT lower abdomen, associated with mild fever and leucocytosis. Clinical examination is very helpful in the diagnosis.  - Renal pain   are colicky pains that are felt in the upper abdomen, back and radiates down to the groin. Pelvi- abdominal US, CT as well as IVP are used in the diagnosis.  - Recurrent abdominal pain, associated with Gasl, related to meals is more likely to be due to IBS.  Diagnosis is made by exclusion of other GI problems like GERD, Gastritis and gastric ulcer.  Pitting LL edema could be due to anemia, renal and liver disease. Complete liver, kidney function tests and CBC should be done initially in your condition.  Initially CBC, Liver and renal function tests should be done.  Only by complete history , physical examination and investigations , the correct diagnosis can be reached. I advise you to  Follow up with your doctor.  Best regards,\n\n",

    "title": "Gallstones or Liver problem ??",
    "content": "I am sorry this is long. I will try and be as brief as I can.  I wonder if there is anyone who can give advice on whether you think I have got gallstone problems or if it is more likely some thing wrong with my liver.  InAugust I was really sick and had 4 *pain attacks* which frightened thelife out of me. I rangthe Dr and he said it was just inflammation as I had been so severely sick. Afterthe worst attack which lasted for 8 hours I went to the Dr and they took blood and referred me for a scan. The blood came back t hat very day and they phoned me and said my liver function tests were so grossly abnormal. Levels of 1300. They asked me to go back and have more tests done.  That time it was down to 689 in 2 days and they tested for Hepatitis - which was all negative.   A week later it was down to 129 and 2 weeks later was normal.  The Drs said that I had some *mystery virus* which we would probably never know what was wrong. I also had had jaundice and orange pee. All of which is gallstone symptoms.  It takes ages for scans here and when my levels were normal the Dr said that he didnt think it was gallstones as the levels in the blood dropped too sharply. Gallstones do not produce those sorts of results. They are a more drastic recovery.  He said he didnt think I should have a scan as it could bethat I DID have gallstones inside me but that it wasnt necessarily what was wrong with me.  The scan appt came through and of course I did go AND it showed gallstones !! 1 large one and lots of small ones.  Now they are saying wait and see if I have more attacks.  Well since August/Early September I have not had a *pain attack* but I have been very sore and uncomfortable in  right upper quadrant , in ribs etc.   I thought gallbladder pain was all or nothing ? Not a constant ache like t his ??  So my question is - do you think  that it has been all gallstones since the  beginning or is it possible there is something else wrong with my liver ??  I'm afraid to eat or drink anything much. Trying to diet anyway as I am overweight but I am scared to eat anything really fatty, or anything creamy as that seemed to set off the last and worst attack (A creamy pie dessert) ...... also not sure whether to drink any wine as if it isthe liver I don tknow if drinking alcohol may bring the pain back.  When I hadthe scan the scanner lady said that I had stones in t here but to be very careful about havign it out as so many people rush to do that and it isnt that at all ???  So any help or advice or opinions would be very much appreciated.  Thanks and sorry it is so long.  Liberty.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear liberty,  - A possible scenario is that the common bile duct was occluded by one of these stones which moved quickly allowing d proper bile flow and rapid recovery of the liver problem.  - Another possibility is acute pancreatits.  Pancreatitis  usually presents with severe acute abdominal pain that is felt in the upper abdomen and or in the back. In mild cases the pain s mild and becomes more severe with eating and is associated in many cases with nausea and vomiting, fever and tachycardia. Ultra sonogaraphy shows characteristic changes in the pancrease   Elevated levels occur in many disorders including: hepatic disease, active cirrhosis, infection or toxic hepatitis, pancreatitis, myocardial infarction.   Liver enzymes known as aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) are elevated when common bile duct stones are present.  If obstruction of the biliary system is suspected Alkaline phosphatase level should be measured as it is elevated in such cases.  A threefold or more increase in ALT strongly suggests pancreatitis. When the cause of pancreatitis is gallstones, surgery is usually needed to remove them. Mild cases (mild) require a week to recover from their symptoms.  - Also a viral hepatitis gives similar clinical picture, but the course of the disease is different. Viral Hepatitis include (HAV, HBV, HCV, etc.)    Follow up with your doctor is essential. Hope you find this information useful, Best regards,\n\n",

Now I had a catscan back in nov or dec of 2005 and there was nothing on  my liver so my question is how serious is this? Should I be worried? What causes this? My blood work levels came back normal except for glucose which has been 51 in Jan and 53 in May. So I am not sure about if that plays apart in that or not. How does the doctor know they are cysts instead of something worse like cancer if they didnt do a biopsy? I am very sorry for all the questions but I am scared to death. How do they just appear and do they go away or will they always be there now?\n\n",

    "content": "Dear FRIDA  There is a simple hepatitis B blood test that your doctor or health clinic can order called the \"hepatitis B blood panel\". This blood sample can be taken in the doctor's office. There are 3 common tests that make up this blood panel. Sometimes the doctor may ask to check your blood again six months after your first visit to confirm your hepatitis B status. If you think you have been recently infected with hepatitis B, it will take 4 -6 weeks before the virus will be detected in your blood.  Understanding your hepatitis B blood test results can be confusing, so you want to be clear about your diagnosis - do you have a new infection, have you recovered from a past infection, or do you have a chronic infection? In addition, it is helpful if you request a written copy of your blood tests so that you fully understand which tests are positive or negative  The hepatitis B blood panel requires only one blood sample but includes three tests:  HBsAg  (hepatitis B surface antigen)  HBsAb or Anti-HBs (hepatitis B surface antibody)  HBcAb or anti-HBc (hepatitis B core antibody) The doctor needs all 3 blood test results in order to determine your diagnosis  To answer your question about HBSag: it is Hepatitis B surface antigen This tests for the presence of virus. A \"positive\" or \"reactive\" HBsAg test result means that the person is infected with the hepatitis B virus, which can be an \"acute\" or a \"chronic\" infection. Infected people can pass the virus on to others through their blood and infected bodily fluids.  as far as for hepatitis B surface antibody (HBsAb or anti-HBs)  A \"positive\" or \"reactive\" HBsAb (or anti-HBs) test result indicates that a person has successfully responded to the hepatitis B vaccine or has recovered from an acute hepatitis B infection. This result means that you are immune to future hepatitis B infection and you are not contagious. This test is not routinely included in blood bank screenings.  The third test or the HBcAb is an antibody that is part of the virus- it does not provide protection. A \"positive\" or \"reactive\" HBcAb (or anti-HBc) test result indicates a past or present infection, but it could also be a false positive. The interpretation of this test result depends on the results of the other two tests. Its appearance with the protective surface antibody (positive HBsAb or anti-HBs) indicates prior infection and recovery. For chronically infected persons, it will usually appear with the virus (positive HBsAg).  Since you said your HB sAG is negative, and \" if you previously  had previuos positive core antibody, that means that you previously had hepatitis and now you are better, therefore you negativ HBsAG  indicates that you don't have the infection.  you may want to check with your dr back, in few months, to have the panel tested again to make sure you are not re-infected.  As far as for your husband, usually signs of hepatitis, are sign of jaundice (yellowish  eyes, skin, etc), light stools, and dark urine. usually the patient also complains of abdominal pain and discomfort. What you have described as of diarrhea, fever, red urine, could indicate many things, including viral or bacterial infection; so i will recommend that he sees a doctor to rule out the cause.  thank you very much, and i hope you both feel better\n\n",

Living related liver transplantation has to be performed in centers specialized in such surgeries.  If your daughter still insists that she wants to donate part of her liver to her younger sister (which i think is a very impressive act of love), she will have to be informed by the transplant surgeons in full about the possible side effects of surgery.  Your daughter will be very thoroughly evaluated by the transplant team to see whether or not she is going to be fit for such a surgery.

    "content": "Dear Blue,  ggt is a very sensitive way to detect the liver being affected by anything. It is so sensitive and very non-specific to the extent that some doctors don't rely on it that much.  It is kind of expected to be elevated in people who drink alcoholic beverages. If you drink any amount of alcoholic beverages, your ggt is most probably going to be high.  If your other liver enzymes are not high, there is absolutely nothing to worry about especially that the elevation is very mild.  Thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and I hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

For example, if the CT Scan was ordered for progression of Cirrhosis, the radiologist would specifically look for this disorder (it essentially depends on the specifics of the ordering physician). The entire report needs reviewed verses reading the last line regarding normal/abnormal in which some people make the error of doing. Again, notify your physician's office and request that he or she return your call regarding this diagnostic procedure. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

When this occurs bile gases are produced.  Bile gases crowd the abdominal area/organs. This inhibits visualization of your organs during an ultrasound.  Hope this answers your question.

Perhaps you had a toxic reaction to something you were exposed to, you did not say how high the levels were.  There are 5 different strains of Hepatitis.  The CDC website has some great information on all of them:http://www.cdc.gov/ncidod/diseases/hepatitis/.  Hope this is helpfu., please keep us posted.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi. I am a 29 year old male.  I have a very healthy lifestyle - thought through my late teens/early twenties was keen on weekend binge drinking.   A few years ago, I went to the doctors as I thought I may have diabetes.  After quite a few tests and having found nothing wrong, more tests were carried out and the results came back saying that I was found to be Hepatitus B AntiBody Positive.  I was in complete shock but to be honest didnt know what this meant.  I asked the doctor and at the time was made to feel dirty and he said that it comes from homosexual encounters etc.  I said that I was not homosexual and never have been and am therefore confused as to how this could happen.  I have only had 3 sexual partners (all female) and all long term girlfriends of 3 years or more.  To this day, I am confused about how I could have become infected.   Anyway, putting that aside, I am now unsure as to what this means for me.  Are there any side affects of being anti body positive. I was told that I am not a carrier so do not have to worry - and my girlfriend of 5 years has been tested and is fine. However, since hearing this news back then it has always played on my mind as to how it happened. Is there a chance that the results are incorrect? Can i get re-tested? I also want to be a blood donor but does this mean that I cannot? Also, I am due to go travelling this summer for a 6 months out.  Am I still ok to get all of the usual jabs that you need for Hepatitis when visiting south east asia, or would it react to my condition.  I hope you can help me with this information.  I am at a loss as to what to do really to get further information as I have been made to feel embarrassed by the doctor i saw 2 years ago.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Hepatitus B AntiBody positive",
    "content": "Hepatitis B is a bloodborne illness.  You can contract it from exposure to blood or body fluids.  You do not have to be gay to contract Hepatitis B.  You can contract it during heterosexual activities.  Semen and vaginal secretions both contain this virus.  Mothers can spread the virus to their babies during pregnancy, the birthing process and or breastfeeding.  You can contract this virus while getting a piercing or tatooing if the person doing the piercing uses a needle that has been previously used on someone else without sterization.  You can get it an additional way if your tatooer does not use single use tubs of ink.  Sharing needles whether it's someone who shoots up heroin or is an athlete who abuses steriods to enhance his muscle building.    Healthcare professions can get it by being stuck with a used needle.  Not so much now, but you used to be able to get it if you had to have a blood transfusion or organ transplant.  We are better able to test the blood these days.  You are antibody positive becuase you had the disease before, just as if you had measles before.  Your doctor said you are not a carrier so you cannot infect others.  However, I believe the Red Cross does not take blood from those who have had this virus.    If you are treveling it is safe to get vaccinated against  Hepatitis.  They normally vaccinate travelers fro Hepatitis A, which is a ompletely different virus.  That one is contracted by diringing conatminated water or food.  Have fun on your trip.  MaryAnnRN\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Starla   There are many adverse effects seen with the use of interferon which have a medical and psychiatric overlay. It is also important to consider that the interferon therapy may amplify symptoms of an underlying depression. In addition, flu-like symptoms, and gastrointestinal distress  can all have a profound effect on the psyche.  The described neuropsychiatric side effects occur in greater than 20% of the interferon treatment population and include: Depression  Irritability  Somnolence  Insomnia   There may also be an effect of interferon on the serotonin transporter. Clinically, the use of selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRI), such as Paxil\u00ae, have been shown to work on the serotonin transporter level and treat the depression induced by interferon.  some important counts to monitor are, ( and you should check with your doctor while taking interferon 2b are the following):   CBC with differential \u2022 chest X-ray \u2022 ECG \u2022 LFTs \u2022 ophthalmologic exam \u2022 thyroid function tests (TFTs)   As i said above, you  may  notice from receiving peginterferon alfa-2b, and depending on  the dose, and other types of medicine given at the same time, and the disease being treated.   Side effects that you should report to your prescriber or health care professional as soon as possible: \u2022low blood counts - peginterferon alfa-2b may decrease the number of white blood cells and platelets. You may be at increased risk for infections and bleeding \u2022signs of infection - fever or chills, cough, sore throat, pain or difficulty passing urine \u2022signs of decreased platelets or bleeding - bruising, pinpoint red spots on the skin, black, tarry stools, and blood in the urine \u2022blurred vision or any changes in vision \u2022depression \u2022difficulty sleeping \u2022difficulty thinking or concentrating \u2022irregular heartbeat, palpitations or chest pain \u2022nervousness  as for any possibility for interaction between the two above herbals you have mentioned with interferon 2b, i have checked many references, and non were found.  i hope you always feel better starla, and remember to address any concerns that you might have with your doctor, because what you have could be side effects of the drug.  best wishes  thank you very much.\n\n",

Since I last posted we went to the doctor and they have run more lab work but still have not seen a Gastroenterologist. I don't know what is going on. My husband goes to a Community Clinic because the only insurance we have is State Medical so I don't know if that is why we have not seen a specialist. We live in Vista California.  Right now the symtomes my husband has is pain in lower part of rib cage and a strong pain in the lower back where his kidneys are his pain was so great he thought he might have to go to the hospitol but in the morning when he took his methadone it went away. This pain comes once in a while but painful. What can I do so the Doctor can refer him to a specialist?  What are his test results tellimg me? He goes to the Clinic in two weeks and his nose bleeds are comming back. Thank You\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Alcoholism can cause liver inflammation (alcoholic hepatitis) and scarring (alcoholic cirrhosis). Another reason for fatty liver when a person does not drink is AFLD/NASH.  A Nonalcoholic Fatty Liver Disease/Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis (AFLD/NASH) can be caused by obesity, diabetes mellitus, medication such as rheumatoid arthritis meds & corticosteroids, poor diet, autoimmune disorders, certain types of illnesses such as tuberculosis, and NEW FINDINGS - gastric bypass surgery for obesity after the removal of small intestine. A person is diagnosed with a fatty liver when the fat makes up at least 10% of the liver. Just eating fatty food by itself DOES NOT produce a fatty liver.   Usually a doctor will have a suspicion in a patient and request liver enzyme tests, ultrasound, CT or MRI, sometimes you may find out your liver enzymes are up in a routine blood screening. Once the fatty liver is diagnosed, depending on the severity, your doctor may confirm the finding by a liver biopsy so the appropriate treatments can take place.\n\n",

My AST is 75 and ALT is 45.  I was also diagnosed with fatty liver in 1997.  I also am slightly overweight and do not drink excessively.  In fact rarely.  I do not smoke either.  My urologist ordered the CT scan because of hematuria.  He ordered another CT Scan, which I had on 28 Nov 2005.  My Gastroenterologist did an endoscope and found chronic inflammation in my stomach and esophagus in spite of the fact I have been taking prevacid since 1997.  He also received a copy of the report on the second CT scan and it said the spleen and kidneys were normal and there were no stones and said nothing about fatty liver.  How can 2 CT scans performed the same way at the same facility in such a short time be so different?    :shock:   Thanks for any information you can provide.  I go back to my Gastro Friday.\n\n",

I was hospitalized with nausea/vomiting twice in last two mo very severe, and diarreah. They admitted me and did CT and US of the liver My pancreas could not be seen due to overlying bowel gas. I do not drink, never have, am just the right weight. I do have diabetes in my family, very prevalent. So far the only elevated enzymes I have are Lipase, amylase (2-3x the norm), protein 8.8, elevated WBC and RBC, and I did have ketones in the urine 5+. I am wondering if the fatty liver is causing symptoms or is it my pancreas? Who should I follow with the hepatologist doesn't seem to think these are liver symptoms. Should I ask my gastro when I see him next mo. or can you shed some light onto this matter? Thanks.\n\n",

I am 26 years old and weigh 110 pounds-  I was drinking quite a bit of Gin, and felt rather drunk so was going to lie down and sleep. But i needed to use the toilet beforehand.  When i got to the toilet all of a sudden i felt intense nausea and cold intense cold sweats - i thought i was going to throw up and pass out at the same time, so i called for my boyfriend who helped me back into the bedroom  I lay on the bed for 10 mins feeling this but then it got worse. Something happened that scared the life out of me, and ive never had this before, and don't know about anyone else who has had it either. I started to get shaky and then all of a sudden every 10 minutes my body would surge me with what felt like electric shocks! these were really painful! would take over my whole body and it was like i was getting electrcuted! all the fingers on my hands would curl up and i couldnt put them straight... i was also getting crazy pins and needles throughout my entire body! this event lasted for about 4 hours non stop! everytime one of the electical waves came over me i would scream with pain - and they would last about 1 minute - everytime it happened my legs would go stiff and my fingers would curl inwards...  I was so glad after this finished as i thought i was going to die. I am now extremely affraid of alcohol. I once had a glass of wine and it started to do similar reactions but not as intense. So now i don't touch alchohol.  But i have no idea why this happened, what could it be? I have friends who always get drunk and they never experienced this?  Please help\n\n",

    "content": "\"Bereal\",  Bilirubin is a degradation product of Haemoglobin (the substance in red blood cells responsible for transporting oxygen). The bilirubin is transported to the liver bound to a plasma protein called albumin. In the liver, the bilirubin is transformed (conjugated) and excreted into the intestine through the bile duct.   Raised bilirubin can be caused by a number of different things. In liver disease, bilirubin is often raised, together with some or all of the other important liver function tests - such as AST, ALT, ALP etc... You did not indicate whether any other tests were done or if you have any symtoms. Without that information it is hard to say anything else.  If other liver tests were taken and came out normal, there is most likely nothing to worry about. A fair percentage of people have a congenital dysfunction in liver metabolism causing an isolated raise in bilirubin levels. This is called Gilbert's syndrome and is quite harmless. The other possible cause of an isolated raise in bilirubin levels is haemolysis, ie increased degradation of red blood cells. But again, that would cause other tests (Haemoglobin level) to come out abnormal. Finally, in isolated test abnormalities, there is always the possibility of a chance error at the lab (happen's all the time).   Summary: A raised bilirubin level is not dangerous by itself.  Consult your doctor again for further information/advice.   Good luck! Anders, MD\n\n",

    "content": "The liver functions as a filter for the blood, processing and removing wastes and toxins. A damaged liver can repair itself to a certain extent, but some types of liver damage are irreversible. Milk thistle seeds contain the active component, silymarin, which is a powerful anti-oxidant. It helps the liver flush toxins and has been shown to repair damaged liver cells,  There are few known side effects of taking milk thistle, which has been used as a food for centuries, although a very few people may be severely allergic. Check with your doctor to be sure it is safe for you.  Dandelion (the entire plant preparation) has been used for stimulating appetite and for relieving stomach fullness and gas (dyspepsia). Dandelion leaf has been used for stimulating the appetite, and for promoting water loss and blood circulation. It has also been used for gallstones and arthritis. The leaves are also sometimes eaten as food. Some herbal/diet supplement products have been found to contain possibly harmful impurities/additives.  The FDA has not reviewed this product for safety or effectiveness. Consult your doctor or pharmacist for more details.

I  move my bowels on adverage 8 times a day always runny or soft. My abdomin swells as if I am preganat, and stays like that for hours, and with that have pain in my r side under my breast. This is cause by eating very small amounts of food and water.Over the last month I am very run down, no engery and have pain under my r breast area,  can nor sleep at night thought it was my gal bladder and that came neg, with a visit to the er. and now two months later with routne blood work, to check for thyroid problems, I now have high levels in these areas:  ALT (SGPT) is at 60 Triglycerides is at 275 HDLCholestrol is at 30, (which Is below normal) CHOL/HDL RATIO is 5.7 Red cell count is 5.26  I do not drink, not even ocassionally, last drink I had was over five years agao, before I had my daughter. I know it may be fatty liver, I recently had another blood work to check for hepatitis, if that comes back negative the hep, and my alt levels are still high, what does that mean. And will I always be weak and tired.   One more question, a liver biospy, if needing to have that done, do pateints have pain afterwords, and can a calmant pill be prescribes to calm a patient down or would that effect the liver and also moving bowels as much as I do and it being most of the time runny like diariah what could cause that if diet and excercise are ok. Any advice would be helpful. Thanks a bunch.\n\n",

    "content": "Over the last several years (during annual physicals) I've always had an elevated bilirubin count, which my doctors said was nothing.  This last time I was more proactive and asked them to investigate further, since it's always outside the norm.  During my last physical, I had the following lab results... WBC 4.7 RBC  4.53 (Low) HGB  14.8 HCT   43.4 PLT    174 MPV   9.8 MCV  95.8 (slightly high) MCH  32.7 (slightly high)   MCHC 34.0 ALT  28 AST  33 ALP  38 (Low) BIL-T 1.5 (high)  Based on the high total bilirubin, my doc ordered another blood test on my liver, showing Total Bilirubin = 1.1 (slightly high) Direct Bili  .2 Indirect Bili 1.0 (slightly high)  After these tests, he was still unable to explain why my bilirubin was higher than the lab ranges, so he ordered a CT abdomen.   The results of that test came back 'normal' for the liver, kindeys and pancreas and just told me not to worry about the bilirubin.  I know the bilirubin levels are slightly higher than the range provided by the labs and my RBC is slightly lower, but are these results anything to worry about?    Physically, I feel fine but don't want to overlook some action (diet, Rx, etc) that I should be following up on.  As far as personal history, I was born jaundiced and had a blood transfusion but that was over 50 years ago and I use to be a heavy drinker in my younger days but no longer drink.\n\n",

    "content": "I have FMS, CFS, Acute anxiety syndrom (panic attacks), and for the last 4 months cronic hives.  I just had blood work performed, and the results are:    ALT 66, range 30-65    /    AST 13, range 15-37    /    BUN 9, range 7-22    /    BASO 1.11, range 0-0.8    /       Creatinine 1.3,range 0.8-1.3      /      Trig. 575.  My triglicerides have ran from 440 to 880 since I first had it tested in 1988, other levels are mostly ok.  Eight months ago:   ALT 56,    AST 36,    BUN 9,   Creatinine 1.2  I have taken Tranxene 7.5mg 1x daily since 1988 to control panic attacks.   I have taken a suppliment called CALORAD, a bovine solution, for my FMS, 1 tbl.sp. daily for appx 3.5 years.  I had taken Loratadine 10 mg. 1x daily for 3.5 months, and now 1x every other day for appx. 3 weeks.  Whenever I stop completely the hives return.  No other medications being taken at this time.  Could the Loratadine be causing the change in the ALT & AST numbers.  I have copies of test dating back to 1999, and these have numbers always been in the center of the normal range.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sebby718, An elevation of bilirubin levels of 4.0 is abnormal. Because your bilirubin is mainly indirect it is suggestive of hemolytic anemia. You should have a blood count performed and a reticulocyte count. Once hemolysis is established, the cause is determined using the clinical history, Coombs' test and red cell morphology on blood smear.  For a more thorough understanding please visit our hemolytic anemia page.  Best regards,\n\n",

I have had an elevated biillirubin count (not sure of the numbers) but it only happens during a fasting blood test. the first time it happened my then Doctor was a little concerned. After going for a second opinion that docotor concluded that I had something called Gilbert's disease (syndrome) and told me I needn't worry about it, that it is a genetic disorder and shouldn't really cause me any problems. Most times since then, my levels have been normal. Try not to worry too much, but keep an eye on it, by all means. Laurie ps I think you can search engine Gilbert's and get an idea for what it is.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Docc, Approximately 30 percent of patients with chronic HCV infection have normal ALT levels, and another 40 percent have ALT levels less than two times the upper limit of normal. Although most of these patients have mild disease, histologically, some may progress to advanced fibrosis and cirrhosis. Experts differ on whether to biopsy and treat these patients.  Numerous factors must be considered in recommending treatment, including favorable genotype, presence of hepatic fibrosis, patient motivation, symptoms, severity of comorbid illness, and the patient's age. When patients with normal or minimally elevated ALT levels are treated with monotherapy, their SVR (sustained viral response) rates are similar to those of patients with higher ALT levels. Studies of pegylated interferon with ribavirin have not been completed in patients with normal ALT levels.  Have you done a biopsy and have you determined the genotype involved.\n\n",

My mom quit drinking and did very well for about 4 years, she recently passed away in March though. There is a support group for people with cirrhosis and family members, it's very informative and will answer alot of your questions.the link is: Click here!   Take care Tanya\n\n",

I did find out that one of the drugs you take, called Coumadin, could in fact bring about fatty liver. A fatty liver per se is benign, but combined with inflammation, it may progress to liver fibrosis and cirrhosis, and may result in liver-related debility.  I also feel that your case needs discussion with experts in the field, and encourage you to be open with your fears and discuss with your care providers.  Praying for the strength to fight all ailments,  bill\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Weeezer40,  Having yellowish skin discoloration and a yellowish discoloration of the sclera (the white of your eye) means that a substance in your blood called bilirubin is high. Most of the time this means a liver problem. It could also mean that you are having increased production of this substance but the liver is unable to deal with this increased production.  You have to be examined by your doctor and have blood tests done if your doctor thinks it is really jaundice that you have.

    "title": "Cirrhosis of the liver.",
    "content": "Hi,   Around 2 months ago I awoke one morning feeling very ill - nausea. I was sweating a lot and felt very faint and fatigued. By lunchtime I noticed I'd gone a slight yellowish tinge - not very much but it was noticeable - also in my eyes (slight jaundice). I felt quite delirious and faint.  I put it down to a lot of alcohol consumption over Christmas and was about to go to the doctor but the yellow went away after two days and I felt fine again. A few days later I was looking on the internet and found a website that matched my symptoms - cirrhosis of the liver. I panicked and went to hospital where they did a physical exam of my liver, spleen etc and an lft. A few days later my doctor told me over the phone after he received the results that I had an elevated ggt which he put down to drinking too much (in hindsight I drank a lot over the xmas period) - everything else was normal.  My GP suggested I go back in a month for another lft but I'm in constant terror that I might have cirrhosis of the liver because I found this other symptom on the web called 'terry's nails' - which is white fingernails with 1-2mm red tips (at the distal edge).  I've mentioned this to my gp and he either hasn't heard of it or doesn't think it's anything to worry about.  Have you heard of this symptom?  I would really appreciate it as I'm waking up in fear at night thinking I have liver cirrhosis.  Thank you,   Soirse.  p.s. What makes all of this worse for me is that I have a history of hypochondria!\n\n",

I'm so glad a resource like this is available - i beats trying to get through to my GP who's inundated with patients - he's one of only two doctors for over 52,000 people locally here in Ireland.  Reading the articles you find on the Internet like the one I found about Terry's nails does make it very easy to convince yourself that something serious is wrong.   The fingernail thing though - I remember noticing them around a year ago and didn't think of it as anything to worry about until I accidently stumbled upon it as a symptom when I was trying to find reasons for my going yellow for those few days - have you any idea why this might have happened? - my brother thinks it was probably a dose of hepatitis from a dodgy meal out somewhere - but then again - he's only recently finished medicine and probably has very limited knowledge. If it was hepatitis would it have shown up in my LFT?  So you think there's nothing to worry about then? As in if there was anything 'really' serious like cirrhosis it would have shown up on the LFT?   I have to make an appointment to get another test done - do you think the GGT (whatever a GGt is) will have gone down? If it hasn't what could this mean?  Sorry to ask so many questions but I've been very scared recently about this whole thing.  any help is much much appreciated.\n\n",

Needless to say, it was yet another amusing sketch in that what I though were spider naevi due to portal hypertension on my shoulders was just a couple of broken veins. Show's you what self diagnosing yourself can lead to!!  He actually commented on me being physically fit (which I find surprising given I'm not very athletic at all) and said I was a long way off from getting cirrhosis. He says it takes a good 40 years of constant abuse to end up with what I thought I had. Nevertheless, it's given me a bit of a scare so I think I'll be sensible from now on.  The nails oddish colour and red bit at the tips he says are due to Raynauds syndrome which I've had since I was around 13. He also checked my spleen which apparently was fine.  He did another LFT to see if the GGT has gone down. I get the results on Monday. Wasn't impressed to discover that I'd been drinking shots prior to the first LFT.  Thank you sooo much for your help I really do appreciate it. I'll let you know the results of the LFT on Monday.  Cheers,  Egan.\n\n",
