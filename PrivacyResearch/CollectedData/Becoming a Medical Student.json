    "content": "I am 29 years old. I have a BA in political science and was a reporter for various newspapers until a couple of years ago when I returned to school and became a radiographer.   I've considered medical school on several occasions, but researching that avenue has always been discouraging. The fierce competition is intimidating. All admissions literature indicates that only the best of the best should apply, and then only if they've been working solely and ferociously toward that goal since birth.   I don't have a history of impressive volunteer and extracurricular activities, my verifiable work history is patchy, I haven't been published in high-level medical journals - in short, I don't know if I'd stand a chance. Even if I made it to the interview process, I don't have a background that's going to knock a panel's socks off. My GPA is good and I know I would do well in school and as a doctor.   But should I not even bother applying? Would I be better off applying for PA school? And would my matriculation odds be any better there?\n\n",

    "content": "Of course you would have a chance.  It's not so much about your lifelone preparation as it is your passion, which is what the interviewer's will see in you personally and not just what's on paper.  Take some MCAT prep courses, study hard and long, and score high on your MCAT and you'll have just as good of a chance as anyone else.\n\n",

    "content": "You don't stand a chance UNTIL you at least meet the prerequisites for medical school, which involve taking the general sciences: biology I/II (one year so I/II/III for quarter system), general chemistry (one year), organic chemistry (one year), and physics (one year).  Once you've met these requirements, you need to have a decent GPA for allopathic (MD) medical school. A GPA of 3.5 or above is preferable, but above a 3.6 is needed to be above the average. At the very least a 3.0 is required for a very low chance, any lower and you'll most likely just be wasting your time.  Next you'll need to take the MCAT. This is a very difficult test, and it'll be hard to pass unless you're up to date on your sciences and have reviewed. A MCAT score of 30+ is highly recommended.  Additionally, although not an explicit requirement. It is almost impossible to get into medical school without some form of clinical experience. This can be in many forms: shadowing, volunteering, working, etc  You're 29 now, even if you applied to medical school next cycle, that wouldn't mean you start medical school until you're 31. Follow that up with 4 years of medical school and 3 years of residency, and you'll be 38. Most likely though (if you haven't done the sciences recently/at all), you'll need 2 years to prep your application so that could bring you to 40. This amount of time investment is very real, and you'll be spending almost all of it on intense study. Ask yourself if this is what you really want to do.  If you still want to pursue medical school but don't have the GPA or MCAT scores, you can try for DO medical school which is more lenient in their admission requirements and allow for the replacement of grades with retakes (to improve GPA).  Matriculating into a PA school is much easier than either an MD or DO medical school. The GPA and MCAT requirements are lower, many schools don't even need an MCAT score to apply. Moreover, the schooling only requires 2-3 years instead of 7, and the study hours is much more manageable.\n\n",

I've recently tried to return to the military to help pay for some of the costs...but i can not enter without completion of a drug and alcohol class/rehab. I have been told that with a drug charge/rehab in your background, it becomes impossible to become a MD. I was just wonering if there is any truth to this. Would the treatment actually show that I have squared myself away, and am no longer the kid I was, or should i just try and find another major, and pursue another career. I would hate to put in all the time and effort it takes to become a great doctor, and it be fruitless. Thank you for any guidance you can give me on the matter.\n\n",

When you begin college, your advisor will be able to list the classes necessary for medical school admission.  Pre-Med is not a major.  Your college major could be Music, but you can apply for med school as long as you have all of the required classes and grades to back them up.  You can begin your research by going to the college you are planning on attending for undergraduate studies.  Universities have information books that list the different degrees available, and if they are directly affiliated with a medical school, they will have requirements also listed for admission.  Good luck in your ambitions!  There are many different ways you can get where you want to go.  Decide wisely and work hard!\n\n",

    "content": "MUSChopeful:  I think the first thing to do is find out what the medical school's prerequisites are.  When I went to med school (not that long ago), there was no particular undergraduate course of study that you had to complete.  For example, some of the students in my med school had degrees in art history, engineering, etc.  I will say that you should probably avoid underwater basket-weaving, though.  Study what you enjoy, and what you do the best, because it will help you open your mind, and learn how to think.  That is what college is for, after all.  Then, once you are in your senior year of undergraduate college, take the prescribed prerequisites.  Usually they are Biology I & II, Chemistry, Organic Chemistry, Anatomy and Physiology or Biochemistry, and maybe Physical Sciences.  Usually only introductory level classes are required.  Having done that, get yourself into one of MCAT prep courses.  They are designed to teach you not only some of those basics, but they also teach you how to do well on the MCAT.  Hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "College will be four years no matter where you attend. Then four years in medical school if you donot want to do a MD/PHD while in medical school. Then four years in residency training in emergency medicine. Then you get to practice on your own as a qualified specialist in that field.  I am excited that you are planning out the time period and commitment needed. I am in the same field and I love the ER, though I have practiced in the typical group practice w Hopsital inpatient and outpatient work as well as housecalls. I believe what is also very important is how you spend the time along the way at each step. One must realize that we can learn at all the steps and we are never done no matter what field of work you go into, especially in medicine. If you enjoy learning and have a constant inquisitive mind then this is a good philosophy, if not... then goal oriented thinking is good also as you will need to have stamina, perserverance, and true love of medicine and helping people and sounds like you will succeed w the right attitude. Emergency medicine is challenging in that it helps alot if you can think on your feet, if you enjoy managing situations that might make others nervous or paralyzed intellectually or practically, if you enjoy variety, if you enjoy pressure and it drives you and challenges you all the time. Remember study hard always, play to win always as your patient will count on it, party hard, and make all your days in this world count for yourself and others. Best wishes young colleague!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I would recommend doing lots of reading on medical-based websites, in books and magazines.  You could subscribe to one of the nursing magazines.  Just immerse yourself in the medical field.  In addition, it would be very helpful if you were able to work part-time as a CNA or technician so you were exposed to this terminology on a regular basis.  If you sit in on report at shift change and talk to the nurses about their patients as well as reading your patients' charts, this can help you to become more comfortable with the verbage, charting and dialogue in the hospital setting.  Good luck and congratulations on your choice of a wonderful, fulfilling career.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I assume you are talking about becoming a certified nurse midwife as opposed to a direct entry midwife.  If so, you will need to achieve your bachelor's degree first so, while an associates degree is a good place to start, you will need the bachelor's before you will be admitted to a nurse midwife program.  That is considered graduate work so after the bachelor's you go on for the nurse midwife program.  Plan your classes to be sure everything will transfer to apply towards your bachelor's degree later.  Sometimes people lose classes because of the numbering system and then they need to take more to compensate.  I would talk to a university nursing program counselor to be sure everything you do in the first two years will apply to your BSN (or other bachelor program) without any loss of credits.  This is a good goal and I wish you luck in your endeavor.  Nursing itself affords a huge variety of rewarding job options.  Best wishes.\n\n",

I never used to be scared of blood, but recently the sight of blood other than my own makes me feel a bit sick. Although I think it's more of the thought that the person is in pain that is causing that feeling.   I still really want to become a doctor, but how can I?!  My family doctor once told me that he fainted a few times during med school. It makes me feel better knowing that. =)  Is this something that I'll be able to overcome? I guess that might be a question only I can answer. A better question might be: how can I overcome this recent fear to continue reaching towards my goal? I have no other back up plan; there isn't anything else that I want to do.   Care to share some thoughts/stories/experiences?\n\n",

    "content": "Every medical person I have come across has some story or medical scenario that is unpleasant for them specifically and they seem to deal with it just fine. I am quite impressed that your goals have been that clear and remain clear as to helping humankind w lessening suffering and pain of any kind and want to choose a profession of healing since such a young age. I ,myself, love medical procedures and truly enjoy suturing, surgical procedures, running codes when a pt stops breathing, and helping control bleeding. However, I have great difficulty in hearing, watching a person throwing up and that makes me want to throw up also, and I never throw up in my life much at all. What I have learned is to not concentrate on the smell of vomit, the sounds of vomit, or anthing else related to it and I do just fine.  I have found that our mind can control so much including our reflexes and any problem we have can be controlled at least by practice of mental discipline and repeated exposure to what bothers us.  I have also learned that our general attitude every moment, our physical and emotional health currently, our awareness or lack of awareness to the wordly signs of say bleeding as in your case is what helps us manage our dislikes. When I am exposed to this situation that can bother me physically and mentally, I try to think of other things such as how much I care for this person, what would I want if I was in their situation out of the person helping me, what is special about this person I am treating, what a gift it is to be able to help a person with any medical problem, that just by being in control myself as best as I can I am that much closer to helping this person get better, the fact that I am a human being also and I am not supposed to be perfect and I need to do my best and try hard always, honestly. And I find that as I am doing this the literal things that affect me such as smell of vomit, sounds of vomiting, donot seem so real to me and offending and controlling of me as they could be otherwise. In psychology teaching, we learn that repeated gradual increasing and escalated exposure to the stimulus that upsets us will gradually make us comfortable or at least not overly sensitive to the stimulus/blood/vomit that we find so bothersome...this process is formally called ....\"habituation and graded densensitization\" and you should read about it in any psychology/psychiatry forum online. This habituation is how we formally treat \"post traumatic stress disorder\" and \"phobias\" of all kinds and your problem would most likely fall in the phobia category. In this way , I have seen many colleagues deal with their specific medical, physical or emotional specific problems in taking care of patients and they do just fine and sometimes we have backsteps but just like everything in life nothing is too powerful, too overwhelming UNTIL we decide it is and then it most surely will be unfortunately. So, my counselling to you is to realize that in just asking this question and having the desire and wish to succeed in this calling of helping the ill, you have already started on the right path by your thinking, questionning, seeking advice, and that all you have to do is see what helps you today already in everyday life to cope with your particular problem. This problem may be too much for you to deal with everyday as a part of your profession and if so there are fields of medicine that you can go into that donot expose you to that much blood at all and some that will expose you all the time and you must decide if this is one way for you to be flexible in your preferences but still be a physician.  If it is just a mild aversion to blood and you can handle it as you seem very capable of doing then by all means proceed full steam as advised above and make sure you play to succeed and truly work hard at solving your problem.  If it is very serious problem and a major aversion to blood, then perhaps you may need to reconsider if being some nervous  everyday while working in your preferred occupation as a physician is going to make you happy in your heart of hearts, if so great, if not great, but decide first honestly and then proceed with your  goal. Regardless of what you decide, it sounds very much that you will succeed in whatever field you train in and I am confident that you are proceeding in the most sensible, caring, introspective, thoughtful manner, and I as a pt or fellow colleague in medicine would be much more proud to work alongside someone such as yourself and most importantly receive patient care from such a serious professional. Hope I have given you some real tools to sort through this process, Dr. Janak Patel, MD\n\n",

    "content": "Hi GC15,  Many people face the same question you are when contemplating a career in medicine.  Is it worth it to put in all the time and will I be able to do other things.  The short answer is that it takes some work but it is quite possible to start a family during medical school or residency.    Good time management is important to be able to coordinate all the aspects of your life and not let any of them get overlooked.  Also, it will take some understanding of your partner that your medical commitments will be a lot.  But, with open communication it can work very well.  I personally got married during residency and several of my friends got married during medical school.  Others in my class were married before starting medical school.  Still others chose to wait until after residency.  Basically all options can work if you're committed.  Best wishes.  Perhaps we'll be colleagues some day.\n\n",

If i get a BHSA, an MSHA, and pursue a doctorate online, the curriculum's aren't accredited under AUPHA or CAHME (yes, i'm looking at the University of Phoenix as a heavy option).  would i be shooting myself in the foot?  i could always take extra classes to try to mirror AUPHA and CAHME.  i've wanted to pursue medicine since first grade, and i just cant see myself not doing something in the field.  Health Administration seems to be my best bet now, for a job that is challenging and far enough up the chain that i can make my own decisions.

Well, I make it sound too simplistic - I do have most of my basics done prior to my ADN.  So count another 2 years of being a free lance student of nothing.  As for the online education - I spent my BSN, and MSN 100% online through UNA. Most universities now offer online education - I suggest that you check out your local university for this option.  It is cheaper than UOP, and you will have the benefit of having a campus to go to just in-case you need to go there.    I also would not give up on the MD dream yet - if anything look into being a NP, or MA. We do need good hospital admin., but personally I would like to see someone up there that has some medical background - this is why my MSN is like a hybrid + MBA.\n\n",

When applying to medical school, part of the process is writing a personal statement and interviews.  With these two aspects you can explain why you had the rough semesters.  A GPA of 3.5 with a rocky start is very respectable.  With some explanation of why your initial grades were low I suspect the medical schools will see this as 1) understandable and 2) that you have really committed to this to pull your grades up so dramatically.

    "content": "There are many tips on getting in to medical school.  Several books have been written on the topic that can be helpful.  The basic needs are:   1) to do well in your undergraduate course work-especially in the sciences (but keep in mind that you do not need to be a science major to apply to medical school-major in what you like and be sure to take the science prerecs.)  2) Study and do well on the MCAT.  Double digit scores in each category are generally considered competitive.  3) Get some good volunteer experience in the medical field.  4) If you can, do some research.  5) Look into the schools your interested in to see if they have any specific requirements or \"preferences\" for their applicants.  Above all, look into the medical field some and see if that is really what you want to do.  Medicine is an extremely rewarding and fun field-but not if you don't really like the medical field.  Those who go into medicine \"for the money\" or some other type of reason tend to find themselves unhappy in the end, but those who really love medicine go on to have very fulfilling careers.  Regarding a medical school vs. a teaching hospital, all medical schools need to be affiliated with a hospital somehow to be able to let their medical students have a place for their clinical years.  Really, the two are inseparable.  Best of luck.  Medicine is a challenging and fascinating career.  Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi\u00b9 I am a 4th year medical student.  The most important thing for you if you want to explore your interest in oncology is to get into medicine in the first place.  To get into medicine, you need high grades, involvement in your community and a well-balanced personnality (i.e. other interests).  As for oncology, you will be able to specialize in that field after premed, 4 years of medicine, 3 years of internal medicine and then you will do a fellowship in oncology.  In short, you will have a lot of time to learn about this field, so I suggest you take any classes that you are interested in for now. What might relate to oncology include immunology as it relates to cancer treatments. Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Sherille,  well, Immunology is the science of The immune system(immunity)...It's very specific...yet very IMPORTANT....The immune system apart from being your body's defensive system, sometimes it goes crazy and causes you a disease i.e. the immune system even plays a role in most of the diseases these days .  It's a very interesting field....helps a lot of people in all aspects. A new trend in Medicine...and what's also new and extremely as important as immunology...is genetics, especially with the increasing incidence of cancer among people all over the world.  To study either of them , you have to enter Medicine.I think it takes about 6-7 years to finish it...2-3 years premedical and 3-4 years medical, I am not sure how's it like in the States?(will contact a friend of mine and tell you )  you can check out websites of medical schools near you. send them e-mails and they'll reply back and even send  ua prospectus of their school and its facilities by post.  There is a nice and simple book for  immunology... you can read it, it's easy and actually very funny!!... called \" how does the immune system works\" by Lauren Sompayrac .  anyway, i hope i've helped, and about Dr.House on the tv show \"house\"...I'll check it out and tell you  , never watched it before!   Best wishes,\n\n",

    "content": "Hi,  After a long hard thinking time, I have decided to go for a career in medicine, specifically in Oncology/Neurology.   I have asked around my area and they have told me I have to get a GP qualification, or at least become a doctor first. I still have 2 years left of secondary education, and I need to know:  1. What marks will I have to obtain in Year 12 VCE? And in what areas?  2. After Secondary School, if I want to study medicine/specialist field, do I head over to University or somewhere else? Please answer this one in depth as the GP's I've asked weren't to clear about it.   3. How much years of study am I in for if I want to become a specialist (Oncology/Neurology)?   It might seem to everyone that I am a little young to want to become a doctor, as for most people when they are children want to become doctors as well, but I have my mind set on Oncology/Neurology. Family experiences and my father having a run-in with RCC have made me decide on my future. I also have backup plans just in case i fail at Oncology/Neurology, or even becoming a GP. I need all the information that I can get so I can strengthen my weaknesses to at least be ready.   I want to prepare not only for Year 12, but to ace it and hopefully fulfill my dream of having a career in medicine.  Regards,     Angel C.

Does anyone know if this is a hard thing to do? It seems really quite complicated to become a doctor in the states. Applying to medical school is very different from in england because most people apply straight after school- does everyone have to take a university course before you can apply to medical school in the states? Also we can only apply to maximum of 4 universities and I hear you can apply to loads in the US. Anyway any advice on how to be a doc in the states after I graduate would be great.  Thanks!\n\n",

Then you can apply for residencies. It is, ofcourse mucfh more difficult to get a residency if you are an IMG, but definately doable, and even easy in some states (New York). If you need a Visa, it's a bit more difficult, so make sure you score very high. Some residency positions (Dermatology, Radiology, Neurosurgery, Orthopedics) don't normally take IMGs and scores that are minimums for interviews would be in the high 90s (98, 99). If you can't get accepted in the States, do what you can and go through this procedure, but know the consequences attached.  Oh, study Kaplan!  Good Luck!\n\n",

    "content": "I am currently an osteopathic med student and I can tell you the difference between MD's and DO's. When I applied to med school- I applied and was accepted to both allopathic (MD) and osteopathic (DO) schools...and I chose to go osteopathic. Since you are probably already aware of the general abilities of an MD, I'll just tell you that DO's can do EVERYTHING an MD can do..and MORE. DO's have all of the same rights to see patients, diagnose, prescribe medicine...everything. There is no difference or inferiority in that realm. I say that DO's can do more because we have a more \"whole-person\" view of medicine and because we also can use manipulative treatment to help patients feel better. Everything in the body is connected and oftentimes a medication is not necessary to make someone feel better... a simple adjustment to their body structure- whether it be bones, muscles, or other tissues... can heal the body just as well, if not better, than putting a medication into your body. This is not to say that we don't like meds or anything... but we try to use ALL the aspects of a person rather than just utilizing the physiology of a drug's mechanism in the body. Another example- if a patient comes into our office with a headache...we are not just going to automatically prescribe a pill and send them on their way...we're going to talk to them, get to know them, and find out what else in their life might be causing the headaches..i.e. stress, a misalignment of their body structures, etc... we don't just see a patient as a particular set of symptoms walking through the door... we see them as a person and try to treat them accordingly. Hope this helps!\n\n",

His argument is:  berkeley students need a 3.74-3.87 and princeton students need a 3.62 to get into uc-davis medical school whose average gpa is 3.55, thus medical school does not give preference to very rigorous colleges. He also thinks that \"WSJ top feeder list\" is useless and the reason why harvard, princeton, yale, and stanford top the list is because of grade inflation.

    "content": "To anyone who can provide good advice:  I am 25 and have considered going into medicine, but my undergrad was in International Relations.  I have experience living abroad, but would it be possible to start medical studies in Egypt (pre-med included....meaning everything).  I would like to be able to practice in countries where doctors are scarce and basic medical training is an asset (I know there is a large list of countries that fit this description).  Also, any ideas on what are needed areas to specialize in?  Any and all advice would be much appreciated.  Please be honest with all answers (pros/cons).  Thank you/Shukran,  Mike\n\n",

To be honest medical education in Egypt is better than some countries in the region but still falls way short of the kind of education you would expect to have in the US.\n\n",

I just have a few questions that maybe someone could help me answer. And if there is a pediatrician logged on, I'd appreciate it so much if he/she could give me advice on where to start!  *Does the undergraduate school that I chose matter that much? *What courses, besides pre med, should I take in undergraduate school? *Are there colleges with \"Pediatrican classes\" so to say, and if so, where can I learn more about them? *When should I start looking at medical schools? *Where, on the east coast, would you recommend an undergraduate and medical program?  Any other information you are willing to give will be so greatly appreciated! Thank you so much and God bless.\n\n",

People may need corrective surgery for a birth defect, or they've had devastating injuries that need intervention. Older folks have cataracts and think they're blind. Dental hygiene is often poor. Ear infections, diarrhea, communicable diseases, obstetrical/gynecological issues, heart disease, immunizations... The list is endless.  I imagine that ANY specialty would be useful. Were you thinking of specializing in something with the purpose of serving in this capacity?? That would be wonderful... I would think that if you email one of these agencies, they'd be happy to give you advice.   Good luck... and if you find something out, let me know. I'm curious now!\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a senior in high school and have been an aspiring doctor since I was very little.  I can't even remember making the conscious decision to become one and there are no doctors in my family.  I have two cousins who are recent biochem majors, but otherwise, I would be the first scientist.  My family all have high hopes for me and are worried that my grades might be indicative of my success, or lack thereof.  First, I have to say that I am a student in the Full IB (International Baccalaureate) program, which is even more stringent and rigorous than AP.  Thus, it is understood that my grades may not be A level, but still make an equivalent A+ in other science classes.  That being said, I took Introductory Bio in freshman year and got an A both semesters.  Then I took Introductory Chem and got an A- and B+.  Then I took Inorganic Chemistry and got a B and a C+ (yikes inorganic is hard!), and now I am in Organic Chemistry and have a B+ or so.  I realize this won't bear too heavily on my medical school applications in the future, if at all, but I was just wondering if there is anyone who would think this could be a good, bad, or mediocre indicator of my potential to become a doctor.\n\n",

So obviously, I thought it was impossible to study it. After overcoming the problems I had at school, I'm now taking my exams at college, and I'm hoping to become a medical student if and when I pass.   The problem is, I'm unsure of which field I'd like to work in. I've searched on the internet for some information, but I haven't really found anything helpful. I thought maybe Dentistry or Audiological Scientist, but I'd like to know more about the other fields of medicine before I make a decision. Does anyone know of any useful sites that would tell me what's involved and the qualifications needed?  I hope someone can help. Thanks :)\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I graduated from college in 2000 with a 4-yr degree in Eglish/creative writing. Over the past few years I've seriously given some thought to going into medicine. (I'm 27--I know it's a  late to make such a drastic change in life--maybe unrealistic even. As an undergrad, medicine was the farthest thing from my mind so I have very few of the required courses needed for med school admission. However, I did have great grades, etc, including in the science and math courses I did take (In college I had only zoology, algebra and stats that would relate to medicine, although in high school I had gen chem, biology, anatomy/physiology, physical science, etc.) My question is--what would be the most practical way to get on a \"fast track to medicine\"  at this stage in my life? I know I need to start by taking chem 1 and 2, physics 1 and 2, biology 1 and 2, and organic chem 1 and 2. But what would be the best way to get these classes--do med schools accept community college or CLEP credits? Or should I take these classes at a 4-year university to be competitive? Also, anyone know of med school programs designed for people who have BAs in something else? Thanks for any info along these lines\n\n",

    "content": "Gee, 3 sciences at once?  Is that kind of unusual there as it would be in the US? You say you procrastinate.  Is that just a motivation thing, or is it possible you both have ADHD but do pretty well because you are gifted (as I was)? You seem to have enough science background for your level; in college diversify, satisfy other curiosities, follow various interests so you can find studying more interesting and raise your average, while keeping up with how much science most other pre-meds take. Borrowing is feasible if you are going to make it into med school AND if you will love medicine so much that you don't mind paying a big chunk of your income on college loans.  Volunteer in hospitals both to make sure you are realistic about your interests and to diversify your applications when you get to med school.  Also learn in the hospital more about what other health care workers do, partly because there are too many applicants for med school. premed16 wrote:Hello.

    "content": "Yeah, it is kind of unusual to take the sciences at once here too. Everyone thinks I'm insane for taking all 3. Even I thought I wouldn't be able to do it, but half way into the year... it's not so bad. I've adjusted to it. For the procrastination... it's not so much motivation as it is laziness. When I start studying, I'm on a role. But it's getting into the position of starting that's my problem. However, I finally realized that I need to stop procrastinating in order to get some better marks... I have a GPA of 84% for term one. That's when I wasn't really applying myself and putting things off till the last minute. This term, I'm actually starting to study whenever I can and I actually care about future tests. I guess that's the first step right?    I still haven't started volunteering at hospitals, but you're right, I think I should start now so I know for sure that that's the kind of environment I want to work in. It would be such a waste for me to be all set to go into medicine and then realize that I don't even like it. I don't think that'll happen though, because I can't imagine NOT wanting to go into that field. I realize that there are a huge number of applicants for med school, and that's kind of the only thing that is holding me back. I don't want to study in this field for 4 years only to be shut down. That's a good idea, to learn what other health care workers do. I will definitely keep an open mind. Thank you very much for your advice, I will certainly take all what you said into consideration.\n\n",

Chances are you will have to discuss what you wrote in your interviews, so you better have something to say about the experiences you talk about.   Do not hesitate to talk about your accomplishments other than academics. It will show your wholeness as an individual. Talk about the volleyball team in which you've been for so long and how you exerced your leadership in that team... etc.   Most importantly, be yourself!  Good luck.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Marissa,  I am pleased you wish to become a doctor.  It is a very rewarding, if also a very demanding profession, and hope that you are able to fulfill your ambitions.  Most Universities require science at A level.  The order of preference at A level is generally felt to be Chemistry, Biology, Physics and Mathematics.  If your A'levels includes three of these then you will stand a good chance.   The grdes you reqire generally are at least one A and a couple of Bs.  However you just need to show (according to your GCSEs and your teachers report) the potential to reach these grades to get an offer.  Certainly at GCSE you would have to have sciences, mathematics and English, and perhaps something that suggest a breadth of knowledge.    If you apply to Oxford or Cambridge, they have their own tests that bypass the A'level to some extent.    Other critical factors that you can do to make yourself a better candidate,  in any field really, are things like Edinburgh Awards, or  Volunteering, or an expertise in Computing etc.  This helps the selectors sort out the huge numbers of applicants that try for Medicine.  This way is effectively the fast track for getting into medicine, and the way the vast majority .  If you wish there are alternative pathways, and I am happy to discuss this with you if you want.  However my one advice is that if you wish to get into Medicine, get into it for the right reasons, and go into it with yor eyes open.  Medicine can be stressful, and a lot of hard work both in the University studying, and afterwards trying to carve a career for yourself.  It is however a very rewarding, prestigious and I believe,  honourable  profession.  Regrds  Saif\n\n",

I get ill but I can\u2019t just stop because falling behind really isn\u2019t an option. Yet, its kind of sad when I\u2019m in a clinical and I start feeling faint and have to sit down because I haven\u2019t gotten enough sleep or couldn\u2019t get time off yet to eat. What would you suggest that I do to do well in my classes, go to all my clinics, work and still be healthy?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm glad that your considering dropping the job. With campus jobs its just a matter of timing. If its not compatible with your program then it wont work. Eitherwise if it is compatible then anything would do fine. It doesn't matter what the nature is. Maybe you can try discussing an alternative with them.   Otherwise you may try looking for a job outside campus. If you are really lucky you can get a job assisting a doctor in his private clinic. While you ofcourse will not be elegible to prescribe medication or examine patients, there are lots of other things you can assist with especially in a busy clinic. If given the choice I would choose a specialty I am interested in or if I haven't made my mind up yet then something really general e.g. Internal medicine, a family doctor (general practitioner) to give one a broad perspective about medicine in general. It will be very informative and they usually pay well too     I personally don't like loans, especially ones I am not sure I will be able to pay. But that's just me.  Good luck and always keep a positive attitude during these hard times!\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Hp, First of all you have to answer the question: would you like to deal with patients or do you want to teach medicine or do you want to do medical research? A researcher is more or less like any other scientist he usually doesnt have anything to do with patients. A teacher of medicine could be both a clinical doctor and university professor, or he could be a teacher of academic medical sciences such as anatomy. A clinical doctor, like the ones you see on ER are responsible for patient care (they are also the ones that take night shifts). So lets start from here, ok?\n\n",

You can only be a good student if you are a good teacher.  That means - you can teach other people what you have learned.  You can't really be a good teacher - if you don't Practice what you Preach. So to be a good teacher - you need to have experience. To have experience you have to be on the field. (as in the hospital or in any medical environment.)   See? Its linked all together - after which - you can figure out what - or where you want to concentrate more.   Hope I helped in some way.  I am still a student myself - planning to teach - and practice as well.\n\n",
