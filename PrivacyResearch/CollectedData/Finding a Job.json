    "title": "Medical Student seeks advice re gap year(s)",
    "content": "Hey all,  I'm a UK medical student currently half way through my penultimate year.  Increasingly I'm begining to feel over worked and have less break than ever. Times in hospitals are very demanding and I've got exams roughly every 6 weeks and 'portfolio' cases + an essay deadline intersperced even between them. Hollidays have become so short that I'm exiting them feeling I've barely stopped and am so fearful of messsing up my sleeping (due to the shortness of the hollidays) for the early starts that I can hardly do anything during the tiny amount of time I've got off.  Long and short of it is I'm feeling utterly burned out with the workload and the prospect of qualify and stepping into the killer hours of an FY1 and then FY2 doctor over here and getting on the travellator of continuing CSPPD....Kind of feels like I'll step on the trvellator and my youth will evapourate before my very eyes. Not to mention the fact that my father is in his late 70s and I don't know how much time I'll have left to spend with him.  Anyway I've got to the point that I'm seriously considering a gap year after my medical degree. The thing is I'm not sure if the medical career structure permits such things. It would be easy enough with any other degree but can I simply take a year out get a part time job for a few hours a week or something? Will it be possible to get back on the ladder? What steps are necessary to take a gap year/career break from medicine and come back to it later, and what's necessary to facilitate doing this? Will there be long-term career repercussions?  It's not that I don't enjoy medicine - I do - it's just that I'm not ready to give up so much time in what remains of my youth. I want to head out and be young. It's passing, and it won't last forever. I've only got now to do it.  I've thought about perhaps going to visit some bangladeshi doctors I've met here and working at their clinics and hospitals for a month or two, would that do by way of medical experience should it be necessary to show continuing PPD? Certainly I'd get hands-on experience there?  Perhaps I could take a postgraduate(or just enter as an undergraduate) degree in a medical-related subject in a university nearer home when I qualify? Maybe even a differed entry. Mind you I won't get funding from the SAAS to do so for a second degree I think. And fees can cost \u00a316,000 per year....so that's probably out too. Maybe PG fees or some of the part-time diploma qualifications in diabetes and things take a lot less time?  But would not doing much clinical cause problems? I know bangladeshi doctors who spend legthy periods of time over here, the thing is they are studying for MRCS.  And probably worked for a few years first....still perhaps it suggests this is possible?  Anyway I'd be very glad of any and all advice on these matters.  A Scottish Medic.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi There!  I am a 28 yr. old female. I used to work nights but I have recently switched to a day job. My problem is that I am tired all the time! It's been a little better since I switched to the day job, but I still don't have the energy that I should. I've had this problem ever since I started my period when I was 13. Of course, it's worse when I have my period, but I already know that's becuase I am losing blood. I was tested when I was 14 and again when I had my son at age 20 for anemia and both times they said I was \"Borderline Anemic\", but every time they test my iron, I am just fine, and I haven't taken my iron pills in years. Is there anything else that could possibly be causing me to be so tired all of the time? I get about 7 hours of sleep ea. night, but I don't eat right, and do not exercise....could that be it? Just poor health habits or could it be chronic fatigue? I really hope someone responds to this....this is a constant concern of mine. Thank you for your time.  Sincerely,  Mandy\n\n",

    "content": "2 things top the list when thinking about chronic fatigue in a young female. Anemia and Hypothyroidism. As you say you have been tested for anemia and found to be borderline anemic... i would suggest you get another such test for anemia. this could explain your tiredness. also you did not mention if you were losing more blood with your menstrual cycles or not.  in addition do you feel that you have gained weight even though you are eating less? do you feel cold all the time? and have people or yourself noticed that you have some kind of swelling of your neck? these are things that would happen if you were having low thyroid hormones. this is a condition called hypothyroidism. it is fairly common in females of young ages and can be seen with swelling of the thyroid gland. after both of these are ruled out we can think of other problems including depression that can cause chronic fatigue. for now i would suggest that you proceed on these lines. also talk to your physician about yourconcerns. hope this helps.\n\n",

    "content": "Thank you for responding....I hope I am responding in the right place. YES - First of all, I am ALWAYS cold! If it's 65 - 70 degrees, I am freezing! Also, there is a history of some sort of thyroid disease or problems on my Mom's side....my grandmother had problems with that, and she had to have some sort of surgery, I believe for it. Also, yes....I loose a LOT of blood during my mestrual cycles. I usuall spot for about the 1st 2 days, then I bleed so heavy for the next 2 days, that I have to change my tampon about every half hour (and I use the Super-Plus). Then I spot for about a day (sometimes 2 days) after that.  I used to have normal periods, but I went off of the pill about 2 years ago, they've just gotten heavier since then, so I just figured the heavy bleeding was due to that.  And YES - I keep gaining weight no matter what I do. I blew up with my pregnancy gaining 66 pounds, and I've never lost it. I was 120 lbs. when I got pregnant (8 yrs ago), I was 186 lbs. by the time I delivered. I went back down to about 165 lbs. stayed there for a few years, but within the past 2-3 years, I've been gaining, and now I am at about 185 - 190. I have not noticed any swelling in my neck, and neither has anyone else, but I do swell a lot around my calves, ankles and feet. I retain A LOT of water there for some reason, and this has been more recent - like within the past 3-4 months or so. Does this help any? What do you think it could be? And is chronic fatigue not real common in women my age?  Mandy\n\n",

    "content": "Dear NightOwl, Nights are for sleeping and Days for working. You say that you don't feel energetic after getting up in the afternoon. This is because the Hormore Cortisol , responsible for making the body able to bear most stress and strains of the day, has its highest concentrations in the morning and lowest in the evening. So naturally you don't feel at your best with low levels of Cortisol.  Also you don't feel sleeping because you still are getting enough sleep, although not at an appropriate time. You did not mention the reason for your being a Night Owl. Is it work, TV, internet or what?  Changing habits takes time. The best way in my opinion is that try not to sleep for 24 hours straight. Then try to sleep at night around 10 pm. In this way since you wil be really sleepy ( cause you have not slept for the last 24 hours), there are great chances that you will got to sleep.  Do not sleep at 3-4 am even if you are really sleepy. Try to sleep at night. I hope that helps. Do tell your progress. I'll be glad to know.\n\n",
