    "content": "I am a 59 year-old male in excellent health as per recent physical. I backpack 17 miles/week. In April, I slipped from a sitting position and slightly bumped the back of my head. I have had stiff aching pain on the right back of my neck ever since. Biggest issue is when I turn in my sleep. Chiropractor worked on this for 3 weeks with little help Stated that a muscle in there was 'in spasm'. Doctor took X-rays. Conclusion: \"Multilevel disk space reduction...anterior and lateral osteophytes...Inforamina impingement bilateral and most severe at C-3, C-5 levels on right...caused by osteophytes from uncovertebral joints and facet joints...severe degenerative changes are present...no evidence of injury is noted.\"  Does this ever heal or improve?  Do I seek surgery or just take painkillers from now on?  Why did I never have any trace of pain before I slipped?  Do I stop backpacking?  My doctor simply gave me no instruction.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, The findings on x-ray suggest long term development of spurring, disc space narrowing and in general \"degenerative changes\".  The slip and bump on the back of the head did not cause the bony neck issues.  The bump may have set off a spell of muscle spasm and arthritis in the neck.   Surgery should be an option of last resort unless the nerves exited the cervical vertebrae are being damaged severely by the spurs.  In this case, surgery may be required.  Check with a neurosurgeon or physiatrist regarding proper nerve testing.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "I have suffered from back pain for a number of years. One doctor said I had muscle strain, one PA said the same thing and the military PA couldn't be bothered. I went to a nurse practicianer that listened (finally) to me and ordered an Xray.  This is the results:   AP and lateral views of the thoracic spine were performed demonstrating thoracic curvature convex to the right with the findings consistant with a mild degree of scoliosis but no acute fracture or subluxation. There is mild disc space narrowing and osteophyte formation in the lower thoracic spine between T6-7 and T12-L1  AP and lateral views were perfomed demonstrating multilevel disc space narrowing and osteophyte formation throughtout the lumbar spine most notably at L5-S1 with no acute fracture or subluxation. The S1 joints are notable for mild bilateral S1 joint sclerosis.  My main malfunction is numbness around the area of T6-7.(Had to look that up too.) Sitting too long hurts my back, standing to long hurts my back, and I can't lie on my back. Put it this way, a good day is when my back is numb.  My mother has scoliosis so I know what that is.   The nurse practitioner said I had arthritis. I had to look up a lot of words to figure out what the results said.   I was original put on 800mg of ibuprophen and 750mg of Ruboxin. Since the xrays I was put on 750mg of Methocarbamol and 50mg of Tramadol.   I really hate taking pills.  My question is: Are these drugs very effective for my condition. I just took my first Tramadol and only feel slightly weird. \"I hate weird.\"\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, From an x-ray point of view, the findings in your spine are minimal and I agree with the general diagnosis of arthritis.  Mild scoliosis is also noted. You may consider adding physical therapy to your treatment for pain relief and to improve function including sleep.  The meds prescribed are relatively safe with low side effect profile.  None are classified as narcotics which should be avoided in the treatment of long term/chronic back pain. All in all, it seems your treatment plan is on the right track - just add some rehabilitation for a month or so then continue with home exercise program.  Take care.\n\n",

Otherwise conservative treatment focuses on maintain range of motion, quadricep strength and hamstring length, bracing and NSAIDs (to decrease inflammation).  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Supplements for osteoarthritis?",
    "content": "Hi,  About a year ago I started suffering continuous chronic pain around the left groin area, X-rays indeed eventually confirmed the onset of osteoarthritis of the left hip (I was only 37).  Been trying to combat this thing agressively, heat-pads/creams/pain-killers have been controlling the pain, but unfortunately they're not doing anything about the underlying disease.  The pain seems to wax and wan over a cycle of weeks, my condition seems stable at the moment - after 1 year its still relatively mild- but  there's still a gradual detoriation going on.  I investigated supplements, but the studies on glucosamine chondroitin are disapponing and unconvincing, I don't think the supplement is of any use.    I eventually opted for the same supplements that would be used for osteoporosis - the follwing supplement combo:  Calcium, Vitamin D, Magnesium and Boron.    Boron is particularly intriguing, studies show a strong correlation between soil levels of Boron and incidence of oseto-arthritis.  Unfortunately, there is not yet clear evidence for this supplement combo either - I wondered what the medical opinion on this supplement combo is?  A recent study has found that a known drug for osteoporosis (PTH - Parathyroid hormone) could stop and actually reverse cartilage loss in osteoarthritis.  If confirmed this would be a huge breakthrough, it would be first ever drug shown to definitely stop and reverse cartilage loss.  Any opinions of this?  Link to news report below:  http://www.news-medical.net/news/200909 ... ritis.aspx   Note that the 4 supplements I mentioned (Calcium, Vitamin D, Magnesium and Boron) are known to be intimately connected to PTH levels, which is (weak) evidence that they could be effective against osteo-arthritis.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Osteoarthritis(OA) is not an exclusive disorder of articular cartilage of joints. Almost all components of an involved joint are adversely affected by OA (including the peri-articular bone, synovial lining, adjacent connective tissue elements and muscles).  The pathogenesis of osteoarthritis is not well understood (as is the disease progression and origin of pain).  Hereditary / mechanical factors and the effects of ageing seem to be the central underlying factors.Role of cytokines is still being elucidated.  Apart from these, other factors have been shown to affect the progression of OA, including obesity, associated intra-articular crystal deposition,the presence of polyarticular disease,joint instability / malalignment, peripheral neuropathy and muscle weakness.  At present there is no single, proven effective treatment which takes care of the onset, progression and pain of OA. The supplements you mention are extensively talked about but remain largely of unproven benefit.  The link you have provided is an isolated study and is surely 'interesting'. More studies may be needed to corraborate these observations. Best wishes!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello.  I was in a 4 car (including mine) accident in October.  I was banged around 3 different times, once hard enough to knock a drive shaft completely out of a truck.  I went to the ER and after several tests, was diagnosed with Spondylolsis in a vertebrae in my lower back.  When dealing with the insurance company of one of the vehicles that hit me, the insurance staff member informed me that since it was a degenerative disease that I had it prior to the accident.  I was in the Air Force not even a year prior to the accident and was medically discharged for stress fractures in both knees, ankles, and feet.  They did tests from my lower back down to see if they had to discharge me or if they could keep me.  They found nothing wrong with my lower back and that is where the Spondylolsis is.  The vertebrae was moved forward 3mm.  I am 22 years old.  None of my family members have ever had this and I don't have a history of back pain what-so-ever and have never had leg problems before going into the Air Force.  My question is how big of a chance is it that this is a degenerative thing and not linked at all with my accident?  They are only offering to pay for the medical bills, which is great!  However, I now have back pain every day and have trouble standing and walking for long periods which only happened before my stress fractures healed.  I was told by my ER doctor that it could give me problems during childbirth when I decide to have a child.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi afoster -  Your post brings up several issues that are common in insurance face-offs. First, in most states, even a pre-existing condition, if it is aggravated by trauma caused by the defendant, is an insurance liability for the defendant's carrier. It sounds like you have documented recent (Air Force) studies showing the diagnosis of spondylosis is recent if it is correct at all. While what you decribe is possibly the result of spondylosis, the forward thrust of the vertebra suggests common mechanism of trauma (were you struck from behind?). Usually pre-existing conditions are not held against the plaintif in a fault-determined accident.   Second, I would strongly recommend waving a copy of that Air Force medical exam in their faces. Do you have an attorney working with you on this? There are plenty of them out there in this field, and the contingency fee (often limited by the state and averaging around 20 per cent of the damages awarded) is usually worth it if the case is worth pursuing at all.  Finally, I would also strongly recommend a second opinion re:the spondylosis diagnosis. I suspect it isn't correct. This is a long-term denerative disease, not something that happens overnight. And if you were struck in the rear, then what you describe is, as I have said above, a classic injury. Check it out.  Please keep in touch with us here. I hope everything works out for you.\n\n",

    "content": "I have been diagnosed with spondylosis, post-air force (they never found it, despite countless xrays) by the VA.  If you are out of the military now and had medical problems in the air force, even if you didn't get out with a disability, you should still go to your VA representative and begin your 'disability rating' process.  You list the doctor that diagnosed you with the spondylosis and they will verify it with their own extensive testing.  You will be compensated by the VA if the diagnosis is correct, because it is degenerative.  It may take time, so be patient and diligent with your appointments because it is worth it in the end, and it's completely free, and if you don't live near a VA medical center, they will pay you for your travel.  Get copies of all of your medical (and dental) records from the Air Force and any other dr. and go to http://vabenefits.vba.va.gov/vonapp/main.asp or your local representative to begin your case processing.  Best wishes, and feel better!\n\n",

    "content": "I am now 27 years old.  I have been suffering with joint pain since the age of 15.  It started in one knee, spread to other joints in my legs, and now the thoracic portion of my back.  Several years ago my sediment and the inflamation factor in my blood was high, tests for ANA and Rheumatoid arthritis were negative.  Recent x-rays showed deterioration in my back.  My leg had been numb for four years and my physical therapist found a pinched nerve at L3.  Four weeks of physical therapy helped clear up some of the numbness in my leg and movement in my back, but the pain is still there.  Is it possible to have osteoarthritis at 15 or is there something else possibly going on.  I have made an appointment with a very good rheumatologist in my area, but I couldn't get an appointment until august and I am currently having a very bad period.  For years doctors told me that I had pulled a muscle.\n\n",

    "content": "Well that sounds rather strange cause even if the report doesnt state which vertebrae the spur are it shouldnt be too difficult for your doctor to tell by just looking at the x-rays.  As far as spurs are concerned: Bone spurs are the result of changes over time to the ends of the bones, particularly the vertebrae that make up the spinal column. The fibrous cushions, or disks, between vertebrae tend to toughen and shrink with age. Meanwhile, the tough, elastic cartilage at the ends of the bones progressively hardens.   As the space between the vertebrae becomes narrower, the bone tends to compensate for the loss by growing knobby enlargements, commonly called bone spurs. These growths are often seen in older people who have disk problems, but they also can occur in young adults \u2014 especially athletes, dancers or laborers \u2014 who put unusual stress on muscles, ligaments and tendons.   Unlike the rounded ends of bones in normal joints, spurs do not develop a layer of protective cartilage. In some cases, the new bony surfaces eventually smooth themselves through normal movement. But when they don't, bone spurs can rub against other bony surfaces, nerves or blood vessels, causing pain and inflammation. When such bony growths appear in the upper vertebrae of the neck, the condition is called cervical osteoarthritis. A particularly bothersome condition occurs when a spur develops in the foot, causing pain when standing or walking.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Multiple painful and stiff joints in the hands and feet warrants x-rays and blood tests for rheumatoid arthritis (rheumatoid factor, sed rate, CRP, anti-CCP, CBC).  For pain relief use NSAID's until testing is complete.  Obviously, this will be coordinated through your family physician as he/she will do a thorough history and physical to better define and treat your condition.  Take care.\n\n",

    "title": "Chronic Sore Neck & Headaches",
    "content": "Hi. For two and a half years I have had chronic neck pain. I have been not only to my own doctor but several others...all I have had in this time is 1 xray on my neck which showed nothing.  I have been taking amitriptyline, up to 70 milograms which pretty much knocks me out overnight. I take the medication when my pain is a 10/10 which is basically 3 times a week. Otherwise I sit at about a 7/10. Every day I am getting headaches and everyday I have this pain. I get numbness in my hands and sometimes shooting pains through my left arm. I always get tingling in my fingers. One day two weeks ago I had enough of the pain and went back to see a different doctor. He was appalled that I had been left in so much pain and referred me to a chiropractor urgently. I got in the same day and honestly after the first session I thought I was going to die....I was in that much pain that my husband had to knock me out overnight with the amitriptyline. 2 days later I nervously went back to the chiropractor and have been seeing him now for 4 times and I am still no better. He tells me I have good motion in my neck and that I am getting better. I am NOT feeling any better and in fact on some days I am in such bad pain. I am booked in to see an Orthopeadic Surgeon at the end of October but the chiropractor said the surgeon will do nothing. I am so fearful that I have to live in this pain for more years. Why am I not getting a CT scan on my head and an MRI? Or is this not warranted?? I am in so much pain that I constantly think of just going to my accident and emergency. But afraid they will just send me home. The chiropractor is not making me better, I am still in a lot of pain. What do I do? What do I demand? PLEASE HELP me. I am desperate.\n\n",

It could be a host of many other things so don't just take this word and go with it.  I am just saying, read up on fibromyalgia and speak to your physician.  Debra Van Ness RN\n\n",

I have had 8 sessions now and have been in more pain in the last 2 days. I have also had more numbness in both arms.I see the Orthopeadic Surgeon in 2 weeks so will ask for an MRI.

    "content": "After experiencing severe lower back pain, I was diagnosed with DJD of the lumbar spine. Not long afterwards, I began experiencing right groin and hip pain. Sometimes there would be swelling in the groin area.  Upon visiting the doctor, this pain was autmatically attributed to my back. No x-rays of the hip region were taken.  Over the years the pain in my groin became increasingly worse.  The x-rays showed advanced endstage arthritic change with loss of joint space and I was told I needed a hip replacement.  Could the condition of my hip be related to the degeneration in my spine, or could the groin pain I began experiencing have been from the onset of osteoarthritis.  Also, can osteoarthritis be detected without the use of imaging?\n\n",

Wintergreen essential oil also contains 85% methyl salicylate - just make sure it's therapeutic grade oil.   Lininment or oil can be messaged directly into affected joint.  Adding moist heat may enhance the benefit.  Take care.\n\n",

Infected knees in anyone but in particular the young and the old is a concern as the infection, if not treated, can not only destroy the joint but get into the blood stream and cause the body to become sick (sepsis).   In the young and old in particular, sepsis can cause death.  So, follow what your physician says and get good care for your daughter's knee.  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It is hard to tell what is causing the deformity.  Two possibilities perhaps three.  First, the intrinsic muscles could be weak.  Second, a bony abnormality or tumor could be growing between the toes.  Third, a Morton's neuroma could be developing.  My first step would be to get in to see the physician for physical exam.  The Morton's neuroma would be painful to palpation.  An x-ray would be indicated as well.  Actually, a fourth possibility is the most probable. Check the mobility of the 1st ray (long bone of the 1st toe) to see if it is mobility.  A hypermobile first ray may cause the second digit to move over.  This would show up on x-ray...and over time you may see a bunion develop on the first toe.  Take care.\n\n",

You have been experiencing this for about a week now, if you think that the pain is getting worse or not impoving, i would encourage you to be seen by your doctor to determine whether this is something that warrants an imaging study like a ct scan or not to look for a change in your back problem like a herniated disc.  Losing 25 pounds should make your back problem better not worse as by losing weight you are taking a load off your back. But, you could have pulled a muscle or did a wrong twist.  i would also encourage you to be as active as you can. Meaning that there is no need for bed rest if you have back pain. On the contary try to do your activities of daily living and if you have pain that is preventing you from doing your activities comfortably, you may use pain medications to make it easier.  Once more, thank you very much for using our website http://doctorslounge.com and i hope that this information helped.   Yasser Mokhtar, M.D.\n\n",

Would you still advise a biopsy from the lung lesion or an ANA, RF test maybe?  Of particular concern to me is the possibility that this is a developing case of seronegative spondyloarthritis (e.g. ankylosing spondylitis). This condition as you well know is associated with asymmetrical involvement of the spine and the sacroiliac joints in addition to a high incidence of erythema nodosum. There have been reports of chronic fibrotic changes in the lungs that resemble tuberculosis.  What are your thoughts on this?  Thank you.\n\n",

Pain would involve my thigh, buttock and femoral head, and weight bearing pain.  An x-ray demonstrated AVN. Avascular Necrosis of the Hip.

I think it happens when I move it a certian way but I'm not sure exactly what I'm doing to cause it. Usually if I relax my leg for a while it will go away. If I move my leg or try to walk I feel a sharp pain and cannot walk without limping. I think I've had this problem for a few years (maybe 5) but it wasn't so bad. Recently its been happening more often and the pain is more severe. Can you help me figure out what this is and what I can do about it?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  There are some steps you can take to figure out what is going on with the hip.  First, an x-ray will give a view of the hip joint itself.  Second, sometimes the labrum of the hip tears causing this type of pain thus an MRI would be warranted.   Nevertheless, a visit to your family physician to asses the hip is a good start.  Take care.\n\n",

Sleeping with a pillow between the knees will decrease the pressure on them and ease the pressure on the spine.

If needed, see a physician who can evaluate the spine and knees more thoroughly.   Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, There is a lot going on and I am sorry to hear that you have been immobile for the past 3 years.  I would start addresses these issues with a long visit at your family physician.  He will be the one who will make the necessary referrals to the specialists and keep all the consultations on record in one place in your chart.  The most important concern at this point is the sudden (and I assume unintentional) weight loss with history of pancreatic tumors.  Your family physician should take an extensive history including a review of the different body systems and perhaps a bone scan or CT scan of chest and abdomen to make sure there are no signs of tumors or cancer.    The polyarthritis and vasculitis can be addressed initially with the family physician with some basic rheumatology testing (blood work: CBC, sed rate, CRP, ANA, RF, anti-CCP).  Take care.\n\n",

    "content": "Apparently I have Osteochondrosis in both knees, it occured a 3/4 years ago. I have a hard bone like lump under each knee where it meets the shin.  I am in my early 20s and have began a weight lifting routing. However, integral to weight lifting is the Squat, which requires, by definition a squating motion with weight on the shoulders.   I don't have any particular pain in my knees (which was the case when it first started), but they often feel weak under pressure, and the most concerning thing is the crackling sound they make even when I do an unweighted squating movement. I play sports and when running my knee doesnt cause me any real pain.  Im am getting an X-ray or the appropriate scan to confirm the condition.  I was wondering, is it a bad idea to do squats and deadlifts (require similar motion witthe legs)? Even with knee braces/straps as they are pretty crucial to the programme.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Greeneyes58,  Unfortunately, osteoarthritis and degenerative disk disease tend to be chronic pain producers.  NSAIDS are often helpful but can be hard on the stomach as you have found.  You may want to talk to your doctor about trying one of the COX-2 inhibitor type anti-inflammatories (such as celebrex or vioxx).  Basically these are a subclass of NSAIDS that more specifically target the pain aspects of inflammation and are supposed to cause less GI irritation.  They may work well for you.    Some people will have trouble, even with these meds though.  If this turns out to be the case you may want to consider seeing a pain specialist.  Best wishes.\n\n",

A drawback is the patches need to be placed on the low back and changed regularly so if a person has difficulty reaching or seeing the area it may take a bit to learn how to apply the patches.

    "title": "Who is right about my diagnosis?",
    "content": "Hi!  October 2003 I went to a GP because I was extremely tired ALL the time.//The results of the blood tests were that I had rheumatoid arthritis and he immediately put me on Vioxx and gave me shot of methotrexate and told me I would  have to come in for these weekly shots for the rest of my life.//Well, needless to say, I got really really REALLY sick from the shot, and thought I was going to die!!!But after about five days, I was better and after one hospital visit to the emergency room, I was instructed by two other doctors that methotrexate should never have been prescribed for me initially and was advised to stop the injections.//I was referred to the best rheumatologist in the area, and had to wait four months to get in to see him.  In the meantime Vioxx was working wonderfully, and I was no longer experiencing pain.//Well, when I finally got to see the rheumatologist, he talked to me, talked to me about my weight, and had me perform a few physical floor touching excercises and informed me that I did NOT have RA.//Well, I've mentioned this to my new GP, and he said that I did indeed have some sorth of arthritis in response to my telling him that the Rheumatologist said I did not.  So that made a total of three General Practioner's telling me that I had RA based on my raised test that indicates inflammation  within the body (I forget what it is called.).  Anyway, with the pulling of Vioxx off the market, I was really disappointed, because this had been the first time I had been pain free in a long time.  I tried Celebrex, but I didn't think it had as good as effect.  Recently about three months ago, I went to my regular doctor to ask if there was something else out there, as even though the Rheumatologist said that I didn't have RA, I was experiencing more and more pain every day.....my feet ached horribly and would swell at times, but were not hot to the touch.  After sitting for long perioids of time, I can barely move and walk stifly and painfully for a short while.  Mornings, I walk stiffly.  I've noticed now that my hands and feet ache and swell at the joints, but the main point of pain for me are my left hip and my right shoulder.   They are the worst, but now within the last six months and it appears to be getting worse, I have started having problems lifting the lightest of things, sometimes even forks..without pain in both hands and/or my shoulders.   My regular MD gave me three otherr samples of types of meds to try and told me to let him know which one helped the best, Bextra, Celebrex (we already knew that result), some other drug,  I tried them all for the designated time period, and let them know that Bextra worked the best for me.  They got me a bunch of samples, and the very next day I heard that Bextra was pulled off the market.  He had told me that after we tried all these medications that there were others we could try, and I said...like the ones that cost $15,000 per year...And he said yes.....Well lo and behold when I asked for something else along this line since Bextra was no longer available to me, as neither was Vioxx, and the other drugs naproxen sodium, ibuprofen, and the other trial prescrip meds he gave me didn't work, he turned around and just left a message for me to take naproxen sodium, advil, or celebrex...So I got frustrated and reschedueld another appt with the best Rheumatologist that I saw before and I see him next week.   //What I am afraid of is that I may get the same answer and the pain is excruciating most of the time after sitting or laying for long perioods of time and I cannot even get up from a sitting position and sometimes have to roll off onto the floor and then painfully and slowly help myself up.  I'm getting really frustrated and confused here.   Is it still possible that I have RA? I can still do the ra physical test the RA doctor had me do, which was touch the floor with my hands......but the pain and tiredness I feel  is sooooooooooooooo much worse than it was a year ago.  I don't want to wait around and take one and then the other doctor's word, when I am experiencing this pain that is clearly getting worse and is having a crippling effect on me....It's getting to the point as far as holding things, that my fingers kinda double up and I can't hold things regularly anymore well and I'm always stretching parts of my body as that seems to help the muscles and joints.  Oh...and also...right up in my shoulder area in front of my armpits, are bunches of nodules on each side of my chest.....could this be related to my shoulder pain?  Thank you so much for you listening to my ramblings in not a very logical order.  I'm starting to get rummy from sooooooooooooo many sleepless nights.  Thank you  anjilzheart\n\n",

I'm 44, 120 lbs, female, I do karate 2x/week, swim 1x/week, belly dance and am in excellent health & physical condition.  I drive my car a lot for my sales job but it's the same car I've had for 4 years. Our mattress is a pretty good one. The pain is constant & consistent without much variation in degree of pain (discomfort, maybe the word pain is too strong), I'd rate it at 5 out of 10 every day. My mother has degenerative disk disease, should I consider looking into this?\n\n",

    "title": "Re: consistant back pain",
    "content": "Hello, Thanks for writing in.  You have reported pain/discomfort along the entire spine - from the neck to the low back.  You are physically fit.  Mother has degenerative disc disease.  You spend considerable time driving.  In the spine, a small amount of pain can trigger a general amount of pain.  In other words, the muscles along the spine (the paraspinal muscle run the length of the entire spine) can spasm and cause pain or discomfort.  Pain can also be referred from one place in the back to another (without muscle spasm).    With your history, I would evaluate the back for overall mobility to determine if you tend toward hyper or hypo mobility.  I would suspect the former.  With hypermobility of the spine, there is an increase of shearing force at the facet joints (small joints in the spine)and increased risk of laxity between the vertebrae.  Over time this can caused arthritis, mal aligned of the spine, or inflamation in the tissue supporting the spine including the discs.    Degenerative disc disease is a broad term which radiologist use to describe abnormal MRI findings of the spine.  Before having an MRI, you may consider seeing a massage therapist or physical therapist.  MRI would be indicated if these do not help or if your pain is worsening or if numbness/tingling/limb weakness occur (an indication for possible nerve damage).    Also, use of NSAIDs for a week, heat and/or ice packs may provide some immediately relief.  If in doubt or concern about any above information, consult your primary physician for an accurate diagnosis and treatment options.   Keep us posted and take care.\n\n",

This is a gradual process though and does not occur overnight.    Maintaining good leg strength and flexibility will be important.  Also, maintain a healthy weight.  Obesity will worsen knee degeneration.  If a lot of grinding sensation with squats than avoid that exercise.   And swimming or biking may be better options that running.

    "content": "Hello, As long as you are growing, Osgood schlatters can persist.    The condition involves increased stress on the patellar tendon where it inserts into the front of the tibia.  Calcifcation and chronic inflamation can develop therefore a bump may appear.  Treatment includes treating inflamation with NSAIDS, ice (regularly especially after every bout of exercise), a patella strap or brace to ease the pressure off the tibial tubercle, and quadriceps strengthening.   Physicial therapists and athletic training can help with any rehab program.    Sometimes surgeon remove the bump or ossification site but I would not recommend this until after growth spurts are done and only if the condition remains problematic.  Let us know how things turn out.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  It is not unusual for one knee to be better or worse than the other - assymetry is common with Osgood Schlatter's.  Since this condition is caused by repetitive stress on the tibial tubercle (bony attachment of the patellar tendon) then avoiding repetitive stress is part of the solution.  Therefore use caution with running, jumping, cutting...and skiing. Typically, activity levels are dictated by pain and inflammation levels but remember - pain and inflammation may not occur until after the activity ...so easy does it.    Also use ice after exercise/activity.   Consult a trainer or therapist for specific treatment and exercises.  After the bone's growth plate matures (anywhere from 14y.o - 18y.o.) the problem should cease.  If it persists beyond this, see an orthopedist.  Let me know if you have any more questions and I'll try to answer them.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 49 yr old female and back in 98 after a year 1/2 of doing repetitive work (med office) I developed Carpal Tunnel along with neck & shoulder pain. I was also diagnosed with Degenerative Disc Disease at this time. As the years went on my problems not only worsened but I had also developed new ones.  I have suffered many sleepness nights due to neck pain, tried many different pillows with no relief,  numbness in wrists & hands and arm pain. I am a side sleeper and also experience severe burning in my upper arms so I am constantly switching from one side to the other.   Last year I started to develop symptoms of RLS.  My former dr  prescribed Requip but it seemed to make things worse so I quit taking it after 2 days. I also experience this same ugly feeling in my arms.  I experience mild to moderate RLS during the day but come nighttime it's a lot worse.  I toss and turn to the point where I have to get up and sleep on the couch so I don't keep my husband awake.  I have tried prescription Ibupofen, Soma, combining ibuprofen & Soma, Naproxen and plain ole asprin. When all these fail I resort to sleeping pills.  I am so sick of this every single night and so sick of taking pills. I don't know what to do anymore, all I know is this has got to stop.  I am tired most of the time due to lack of sleep and depressed. I am not seeing a doctor at this time, partly because I don't have a one (looking for a new one) and partly because I just can't afford the $45 copay.    I don't know if this goes hand in hand but within the last year or so I have begun to experience what I think are pre menopausal symptoms, irregular periods, occasional night sweats, dry skin, slight hair loss, facial hair on skin and irritability.  My former doc did take blood tests but they came back normal. Lately I am constantly hot all of time. It's been very hot where I live so that isn't helping things.  And most recently hearing problems where I experience a thumping in my ears. Certain things can trigger this such as noise from the tv or when listening on the phone, cell phones are the worst so I try to avoid them.  Anyway, right now my main concern is the  DD & RLS.... would it be better to seek out a neurologist for treatment or should I see a different type of doctor?\n\n",

It would be worthwhile to screen for hypothyroidism which can cause many of your symptoms including restless legs.   Also, do you suffer from migraines?  Migraine can have extra symptoms like depression, cold sensation and thumping in ears.    Regarding the DDD, it will be important to engage in a regular exercise program including stretching.  A physical therapist can help with the neck and arm exercises. Cervical traction may also help.  An easy carpal tunnel exercise:while resting forearm on a table or the thigh, do wrist extensions holding a light dumbell (< 5lb) until posterior forearm muscle fatigues...daily for 4 weeks.  If pain then stop.  Squeezing exercises eg squeezing a ball are always contraindicated with carpal tunnel.    Keep us posted.\n\n",

It would be also more useful if you can provide us more information about her personal history, medical history, current medications and relevant past history.  This picture could be due to muscle atrophy and weakness. This is usually seen when there is due a neurovascular defect.    If she has diabetes mellitus, a common cause for bilateral symmetrical distal neuropathy (polyneuropathy) and weakness due to defective nerve supply to the peripheral parts of the body including the muscles although late in the course of the disease after sensory neuropathy.  She might have also vascular problems which are common at her age; this might add to the muscle weakness.  This would predispose her to more complications due to immobility like serious infections and DVT.   Other causes like disuse atrophy if she is bedridden for long period, bone or skeletal diseases or malignancies are also possible.  If it is of an acute onset causes like infections (e.g.myositis), drug induced including steroids, and other metabolic abnormalities should be excluded.   I would advise you to follow up with her doctor, direct clinical (especially neurological) examination is essential.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "title": "Re: Severe knee pain",
    "content": "Hello blondefox -  What you describe sounds like \"loose\" joints. Your knees, being the ones that carry a large amount of weight and do a huge amount of work, would likely be the first ones (and maybe the only ones, but time will tell) to show signs of looseness. This is usually due to connective tissue disease, either of the mixed variety, Ehlers-Danlos Type One, or Marfan's syndrome. Are you by any chance tall or at least have long legs (and arms) compared with others? People with Marfan's often have longer-than usual long bones, as well as sometimes longer digits, especially the fingers.   Mixed Connective Tissue Disease (MCTD) can cause a lot of rather random-seeming problems over time, rarely life-threatening ones. E-D can cause more serious joint problems in time, and requires more attention. Marfan's Syndrome can be largely benign, but often also can often cause, over time, such serious problems as detached retina, heart valve problems and even aortic aneurism. For this reason, you probably ought to be tested for autoimmune and connective tissue disease. You may just have \"trick\" knees, but more often than not this partial slipping out of joint can cause problems, including several forms of arthritis due to the constant irritation. Collagen (connective tissue) disease is sometimes compatible with little or no limitation, but it's best to know at least, so that if different annoying future problems surface your doctors will know to look at that as a possible cause. If it's there.   I hope this is helpful. Please do follow up with us.\n\n",

There are times it hurts so bad that I have a really hard time walkin.i have had a doctor say say he thought it was either bursitis or tendonitis. I am currently taking 2 anti-inflammatory pills per day and 3 ibuprofen's x's 2-3 per day. and that doesn't make it stp hurting at all. I have had blood work done. Not sure of the exact tests,but so far everything has been normal. I am 21 and I feel 60. It makes it hard for me to take care of my 9 month old daugter sometimes. Degenerative disc disease runs on my dad's side of the family,and on my mom's it's tumors and degenerative bone and joint disease. If you could please give me some ideas I would appreciate it very much. Thanx for your time  amber\n\n",

    "content": "Dear Amber, Our lower back is a very fragile area and easily prone to injury.  Doing simple things such as carrying your precious child on one hip all the time can \"throw\" your back out, as well as wrong turning to pick up heavy loads.  The Lumbar region and the Sacroiliac joints have both been culpable of causing great pain when injured!  While I respect and appreciate your primary's attention to your complaint, frequently allopathic medicine practitioners prefer medicinal interventions and do not choose to perform manipulation of these areas back into proper alignment. It may be of value to contact your insurance company to see who they will authorize: Chiropractic Physicians or Doctors of Osteopathy (DO) whose practice includes direct hands on manipulation and realignment of spinal subluxations.  It would be well worth your while to explore Chiropractic care to solve your problem.\n\n",

In the second toe of my right foot, I thought at first my new shoes squeezed my toes together causing the soreness. So I never wore the shoes again. Soreness changed to redness & swelling which spread to my big toe & my 3 toe, then up my foot almost to my ankle. I went to the podiatrist did a round of ABX & a steroid Dose Pack, no DX. I went back several times, the Steroid relieved the pain and swelling for about 2 weeks, then it returned. Not spread all over my foot, just on my 3 toes. Since then I have developed A Swollen, red nodule on my great toe right about the middle of it. I have had 2 sets of X-Rays, an MRI, 2 CBC's & Uric Acid's, 1 ANA, CCP IGg, HLA b27, Rheumatodi Arthritis factor, Sed. Rate, & a C-Reactive Protein. EVERYTHING IS NORMAL. I am in serious pain and need help trying to a DX. I have seen 1 podiatrist, 1 bone dr, 2 rheumatologis, & 4 of the Gyno's that I work for. Everyone just says \"WEIRD\". Well I say PAINFUL.

An associated Muscle spasm alone can cause or aggravate the pain due to disc lesions.    These conditions can be treated in the majority of cases with medical and conservative treatment (non surgical).  Non surgical treatment include, physical therapy, certain exercises, weight reduction, epidural steroid injections, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory medications, and decreased daily activities.   Surgery for disc herniation is only considered if symptoms are not controlled after at least one month (6 weeks) of medical and conservative treatment, or in very complicated cases with serious symptoms.  A spinal physician is the one able to determine if surgery is the best treatment for the patient after evaluating the patient personal, social, occupational and disease condition.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello  If anyone can answer this question I would be ever so grateful.  After a fall several months ago I found out through Xrays initially and then an MRI that I have \"...fairly advanced cervical sponylosis with degenerative disc disease and stenosis at C5-6\" according to the orthapedist I was seeing. I was told by the PA who did the Xrays that my neck has no natural curve left and is starting to curve backwards. It was obvious, even to me, that the problem had been there for a long time but I don't understand how I could have been more-or-less unaware of it prior to the fall. If anyone could explain how the fall could have made the problems symptomatic all of the sudden that would help too but my main question is this...Could one (or any combination) of the affore mentioned \"issues\" with my neck be causing dizziness (and sometimes nausea) and is it something I should worry about? I have occassional tingling in my upper arms and sometimes my pinky and ring fingers (mostly on the right) will get pins-and-needles or go numb when I overdo certain movements...the doctor said those symptoms are most likely connected but not a major concern unless they become more persistant...does the dizziness fit into that catagory as well? Any information, comments, ot insights would be greatly appreciated. Thank you so much for offering this opportunity/forum!\n\n",

Cervical Vertigo generally results from damage to the cervical nerves and may be associated with, for example,blunt head injuries, whiplash, cervical spondylosis, etc. A MRI is a useful diagnostic tool in identifying disorders involving nerves etc. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Thersa and Magic! Thank you, Theresa, for the information and response. I've actually been doing somewhat better since that post, Magic, and I'm sorry no one has responded to your questions...I hope everything is going OK for you.  I still have occassional occipital headaches, tingling, and dizziness but I was sent for physical therapy to work on the muscles and given a home exercise program and an occiput cushion to use to keep them loosened up. If I do too much lifting or anything that gives my neck too much of a workout it can greatly aggrivate things but I'm slowly learning what NOT to do and that helps too. They did do an MRI and said I had advanced DDD but I was not told that I had any nerve damage. Is it possible, Theresa, that occassional swelling due to irritation in the cervical spine could cause the symptoms on an occassional basis rather than it being due to damage?  One other question I do have, Theresa, is...my neck sometimes feels like it sticks and then lets loose with a pop (sometimes painful) when I turn my head or look up...it usually happens when my neck symptoms have been aggrivated. Is it likely that this problem is bone spurs or could this also be the result of the loss of disc space (or the spondylosis) and my vertabra grinding on each other? Thanks again, Theresa...sometimes a little info can put a lot of things in much better perspective. I truly appreciate having this forum available to ask questions and you taking the time to answer them. Please take care :o)\n\n",

    "content": "I recently developed a large swollen mass at the base of my neck, I went to a chiropractor, (I've never been to one before) they took x-rays and told me that my spine was reversed, that it was as straight as a rod... and this doctor proceeded to tell me in all her years she has never seen anyone as young as me have this so bad.... she showed me a poster that showed a normal spine, and stage 1,2, & 3 subluxation degeneration... she told me I was at stage two, and I would have to be seen everyday for at least a week. I asked what this leads to, but she just handed me a pamphlet on frontal head posture. I brought this information to my primary doctor, who in turn had me go to the hospital to get what he called \"real\" x-rays. I did this this mornng.... I have heard nothing as of yet.... but I went back to the chiropractor today and he managed to adjust my neck once, as my swelling is still profound, and my muscles are still to tense to manuvere my head freely. I am scheduled to go back in the morning to try some more adjustments.... What exactly is this disease... can it be cured? how did I get it? what should I do?\n\n",

    "content": "Hello splume,  If you have a spinal subluxation degeneration in stage 2, you may have bone spurs, calcium buildup and arthritis in your neck and I don\u2019t think you should be having aggressive movement done in that area until you know if a piece of spur could be broken off and injure something or cause permanent numbness or paralysis. You should probably be seeing a bone specialist; I think your second doctor was probably right to order another x-ray. If you can, try to hold off on the chiropractor treatment until after you get the results from the second x-ray just to make sure there isn\u2019t anything that can become loose through manipulation. A second opinion never hurts when you\u2019re talking about your body and health.\n\n",

Research tells me that this birth defect is hereditary but no one that I can find in my family tree has it.  I am looking at starting a family in the near future and would like any information that I can obtain about passing this on to my children.  I am wondering if any symptoms of this can be noticed in an amnio?  If not, how long into the pregnancy does it take to notice the symptoms?  Any information that you can give me would be greatly appreciated.  Thank You, Paul\n\n",

    "title": "cleidocranial dysostosis",
    "content": "Hello Paul,  The American Journal of Human Genetics has quite a few articles on Cleidocranial dysostosis. This is inherited as an autosomal dominant characteristic, which means that if one parent is affected, each child has a 50% chance of having the disease. Any child who inherits the gene for the condition from the affected parent, regardless of the other parent's normal gene, will develop it. Cleidocranial dysostosis causes an incomplete development or absence of the collar bones and allows the shoulders to be brought together in front of the body. Other bone abnormalities also exist and the persons Intelligence is usually normal. The disorder is present from before birth (congenital) and equally common in males and females.  Genetic counseling is appropriate for prospective parents with a family history of cleidocranial dysostosis, or if one or both parents are affected.  I don\u2019t believe it can be picked up by Amniocentesis but it can be found on Ultrasound or X-ray\n\n",

    "title": "AC Joint",
    "content": "I woke from a nap on Christmas afternoon (Saturday) in a severe amount of pain.  Although I napped on the couch and didnt really move, the pain was coming from my left shoulder.  Since it was a holiday weekend I resigned myself to have to wait until Monday to see a Dr..    Monday morning when I woke, the pain was gone but I had limited movement when it came to certain reaching movements.  Wednesday the pain was back, in addtion to the movement problems.  The pain stopped by Friday but I was referred to have an EMG.  It  showed that the infraspinatus and the supraspinatus were \"dead\" as i call it.  There was nothing coming from those two muscles.  An MRI shows Hypertrophy of the AC Joint which is causing impingement of the rotator cuff.  I do have Degenerative Joint Disease and have had to have a disc removed at L4-L5 but my question is, can there also be a neurological cause to this?  An MRI shows that I have prominence of the ventricular system and mild diffuse volume loss.  I have memory problems and my Neurologist found gait disturbances.  I am waiting for my appointment for him to go over the several brain MRIs that I've had (TIA related).  I can handle a simple ortho issue but my fear is that its more.  Do you have an opinion?  I appreciate any feedback you can provide.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear D,  Sorry about the rather long lag between post and reply, I presume by now you have much of the answers you need.   I will focus on the things you have mentioned that relate to your shoulder The supraspinatus and infraspinatus are part of the rotator cuff of muscles that attach to the top end of your humerus (the humeral head), and move your shoulder.  They can appear dead to EMG is the nerve to them is injured.  The suprascapular nerve supplies these and can be damaged by pressure on a particular area of your shoulder.  The damage can also be caused by a cyst that presses on this nerve at a particular point on the shoulder blade (scapula).  Another reason is a reason is a rotator cuff tear.  Iit would have to be quite a big tear, and although can be caused by impingement, I presume the MRI didn't show such a tear.  Impingement itself is painful, and requires intitially physio and anti-inflammatories, perhaps a shoulder injection of steroids, occassionally needs surgical decompression...  While TIAs and other neurological conditions that you have mentioned can affect these muscles, the EMG trace would not be \"dead\", and pain is not normally a feature.  Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",

    "title": "Can I have DJD at my age?",
    "content": "I have always been very active and healthy. I am a volunteer EMT, which is physically strenuous. Three years ago I jumped out of a squad onto a concrete surface. I was carrying around 100lbs of equipment and landed very hard. I suffered severe, debilitating lumbar pain and was told by the doctor that I had subluxated vertebrae at L5-S1. This has severly limited my physical activity. When I lie on my side I can hear and feel my spine popping from my neck down to the mid-thoracic area. It is usually painless but occaisionally I experience sharp pain. I also have hip and thigh pain on the right side and my hip frequently catches and pops on that side, which is also quite painful. The pain often wakes me up during the night. I have been given Vicodin but it doesn't help at all. I fear that my back injury has altered my gait and in turn caused degeneration in my hip. Do I have a hip replacement in my future? I can't take NSAIDS due to a hx of gastric ulcers.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Firemom,  I guess Degenerative Joint Disease can occur at you age...ceratinly you sound as if you have given your joints enough workout.  Osteo-arthritis can be secondary to both specific injuries to the joints, as well as repeated low grade stresses over the years.    Your back and neck Having a spondylolisthesis, \"subluxated vertebrae at L5-S1\", can cause low back pain and also cause pain radiating into the legs, if nerve roots are compressed. Instability here can be due to some injury, or something you have since childhood.  If a lumbar suport helps, it is said to a sign of some instability here, which perhaps might benefit from surgery.  Vertical impacts can cause stressed to your discs and the facet joints in your spine. DJD in the latter can cause the popping sounds in your back, although some people have them normally.  Your hip and thigh pains could reflect disease in the hip joint.  However hip joint pains are more typically focused around the groin.  It may necessary to check whether the pains in your thigh and side do not represent nerve root problems, caused by your back.  Another cause of such pain may be DJD in the sacro-iliac joints...  Back problems can certainly cause abnormal gait, just as hip problems can...it is probably likely from your story that that both are caused by your previous stresses to your body.  If you can't take NSAIDs ( there are  newer ones that do not irritate the stomach  such as Celecoxib), it does limit the spectrum of drugs that help this condition.  Physiotherapy and swimming will help in most cases.  More radical treatment whether it is hip replacement, or spinal surgery to stabilise your lower back, requires a greater detailed examination and investigation.  If you are having sleepless nights, I guess you need some help, and I would suggest you approach your friendly neighbourhood orthopedic surgeon for help.  He may examine you to evaluate whther the pin in your hip comes from your hip or your back, do some blood tests to ensure your joints are not affected by some systemic inflamatory condition and perhaps do an X-ray of your pelvis, if he feels your hip is the culprit.  At your relative youth, perhaps a hip replacement is bit extreme, and as for predicting whether you will need one in the future...welll it is a common operation, but my crystal ball has sadly lost its shine   Hope this helps  Saif\n\n",
