When I went to the bathroom after a bowel movement not only was there blood on the tissue when I wiped but the toilet was full of blood as well. I'm just not sure what to do. I also get this really sharp pain in the pit of my stomache every time I have to go so can you please tell me what I should do. Is there something seriously wrong with me?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi AnnieMichelle,  Bleeding associated with defecation can be - painful or - painless.  Painful bleeding can be associated with acute anal fissures.Painless bleeding is always regarded with suspicion as malignant tumors of the rectum tend to present this way. However, the common cause of painless bleeding per rectum is hemorrhoidal disease.In this condition, the bleeding is usually painless, occurs at the termination of defecation and is typically bright red in colour(described often as a 'splash in the pan').  The right thing for you to do is to consult a surgeon who, after performing a digital rectal examination & proctoscopy will be able to arrive at a definitive opinion.Your history does suggest the likelihood of hemorrhoidal disease. Good day!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Sassysurvivor, Generally in older individuals any bleeding per rectum mandates exclusion of a colorectal malignancy.In your case, already a colonoscopy had been done and you have known hemorrhoidal disease.If the bleeding is bothering you(so it seems), you should consult a surgeon and discuss the feasibility of certain 'minimalist' procedures such as the 'Barron's banding' which may help in arresting the bleeding.This procedure is well suited for individuals considered to be 'high-risk' cases for 'formal' hemorrhoidectomy.

    "content": "Hello, I have the following problem: It's a fairly small lump, about pea-sized, it's not particularly painful but if I press on it there is a little bit of pain. Nothing severe at all.  It's around the hole of the anus. I first noticed it maybe a week and a half ago.  At first I couldn't locate it again so I just forgot about it, but earlier today I came across it again. It's not particularly hard, but not exactly soft, either, and isn't really prone to moving around too much. I think the first thing that jumps to many people's minds in a situation like this is, \"Could it be cancer?\" Of course, I'm concerned about it, but I realize there are other possible explanations as to what it is. I'll try to see if I feel that it's getting any larger or whatnot, but in the week and a half or so that I remember noticing it, it hasn't gotten any bigger.   I'd just like to sort of see how your situation turned out and if the doctor can offer any further advice. I know this sort of thing really probably should be checked out physically, but man...unless there's a serious chance that it's something bad, I'd really like to spare myself the ordeal?\n\n",

I had a similar problem a few weeks ago,  I noticed something about 3 months ago then just ignored it...  Found it was still there and went to doctors, as i suspected it was an Hemorrhoid.  I get quite a bit of blood from it too!  but when it does bleed the lump goes down and the pain with it !  lol.    Just go to your doctor if your worried.  I was so embarrised to see a doctor but I quickly got over it after realizing that things could be far worse if it did happen to be serious.   There is absaloutly no reason why people should live in silence when it comes to medical problems, however minor they are.. If it concerns you then do speak about it to your gp.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I was reading the above posts and am now more cncerned than ever. About 5 days ago, my husband was acting realy edgy and was walking normal. I finally got it our of him and he told me that there was some sort of sac or sore roght on his anus that hurt very badly. Now my husband has a high tolerance for pain and usually doesn't complain of pain or take pain meds for anything including 3 day long migraines. So you can imagine when he started taking 3 advil and asking me what the signs are of hemmoroids were; I got converned. He would not let me see it nor would he go to the dr and assummed it would go away. But each day it causes him more pain and because of the location, he is too embarrassed to go to the MD. He got out of bed and his boxers had blood on it. He cleaned it and finally allowed me to look at it to see if maybe it was simply a huge boil or something. When I saw it I was like OMG! I have been researching all over this internet tring to find something that remotely looked like what I saw. I am going to explain here in hopes that someone will be able to help me to know what to do for him.  He was right; it was right on the anus. It look like a lump or possible swollen hemmorhoid, and there was blood around it but the most scarry part of it was that it had some sort of black thing on the outside of the skin. I have not seen any pictures on the internet and none of the Anorectal abscess or fissure pictures (only a few pics found) looked like or described a black thing on the outside. I do not think it is a boil because I know what those look like and this was not it unless there is something called an inside out boil. The fact that the black thing was on the surface of the lump or nodule has me concerned. I cannot convince him to go to the dr. because he is so embarrassed and prob fears what he or she wopuld think. I am sure you all know how men can be about having someone look in an area only his mother has seen (due to diaper changes, etc). Please if anyone has had a simlilar thing happen or knows something that should make me rush him to the dr., please share it with me. I am a 29 year old mom, and wife and we share 5 children together and cannot imagine anything happening to him. He is our whole world.   Thanks, Vry cncrnd\n\n",

I feel it constantly, but I *really* know it's there if I clench my muscles together or sit up really straight...or if I spread the cheeks apart.

    "content": "Hi, From your description, it is difficult to arrive at a definitive conclusion. However, i will try to list some of the possibilities.  - Peri-anal hematoma: occurs at the anal verge due to bleeding from one of the tiny veins. Initially painful (if tense) & later pain passes off. - Prolapsed hemorrhoid: grade 2- if it comes out during  straining and reduces sponteneously; grade 3 - if it can only be digitally reduced & grade 4 - if it can't be reduced at all (remains outside). - prolapsed rectal polyp: may or may not be associated with bleeding. - a peri-anal skin tag: usually associated with chronic anal fissures.  Apart from these more common conditions, other lesions (benign & malignant) may also occur in this region.Without a detailed clinical examination, it may be hazardous to afford a guess.You must consult a surgeon & sort this out.

    "content": "Hi, - Bleeding due to hemorrhoids (piles) usually happens at the end of bowel action, is painless and 'Bright Red'.  - Bleeding due to anal fissures may be mixed with stool or may 'streak' the stool.  - Bleeding from higher up in the large bowel may be maroon coloured - what is at times called as 'Hematochezia'.  - bleeding from much higher up in the intestinal tract appears black, tarry, sticky & foul smelling (melena).  I suggest that you see a surgeon, who will perhaps perform a DRE(digital rectal examination) as well as a proctoscopy and sort out your symptom. Best wishes!\n\n",

The first time this happend(month ago)  I put vaseline around the area and the problem went away the next day.... I don't have insurance and honestly i'm too embarassed to just go and talk to somebody about this especially if its not the right person.

Anyway, I have had this soft flesh colored bump for over a year now, and I have no idea what it is. It doesn't cause me any discomfort at all. When I push on it...it's very soft and I feel just mild discomfort, but otherwise I don't even know it's there. Any idea what it could be?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, From your description,it appears that it could be a peri-anal skin tag, usually associated with chronic anal fissures.This is also known as the \"sentinel pile\".  This is usually situated either in front (anterior) or more commonly in the posterior position(at the back of the anal opening).In either case, it will be situated in the midline.The anterior variety is usually associated with pregnancy- associated fissures.   Believed to be as a result of chronic inflammation and associated lymphatic block(localized).   If the swelling is not in the midline, then one has to think of other differential diagnoses (such as a hemangima, a pyogenic granuloma, a wart etc).Best wishes!.\n\n",

    "content": "Two weeks ago,  a very sore lump  appeared very quickly just above my anus, accompanied by extreme  pain making sitting, standing, walking, or sleeping unbearable.  The doctor diagnosed it as an external haemmorhoid because there was no sore or pus but just my normal skin covering the lump, and  prescribed Scheriproct ointment to cure it. The pain persisted, the lump grew and i kept consulting doctors at my local clinic, all repeating that I need to be patient and keep using the cream, even though I voiced my concerns that I didnt think the ointment was resolving the problem, and that I thought it was an abscess of some sort. During this period i felt slighly feverish very briefly on one day.   Ultimately, last night, in agony, I saw an after hours doctor at my local hospital, who examined it and found that the skin was very tender , and that the lump most probably was pussed,  diagnosed it as an abscess and prescribed  a course of the antibiotic Augmentin 625mg tablets. Today my doctor examined it and told me the lump is probably an infection, asked me to continue the antibiotics and stop the piles ointment.   He has asked me to see him tomorow afternoon and says if it persists he will need to send me immediately to the local hospital. Meanwhile, the pain appears to have receded as the antibiotics are kicking in, tho I still feel some lump. I am also taking paracetamols and  diclofenac 50mg a tablet once every 8 hours .   I need your advice as to what this can be and the likely outcome. This problem has happened before and  dissappeared after a course of the same antibiotic . Your replies will be appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "in continuation of the above, i have just seen my doctor again today. I explained that the pain had decreased and he  examined the lingering lump that is still there. His take is that it is a perianal infection, not abscess and will recede solely with the continued use of antibiotics over the next few days without the need to be drained.   In case a medical expert is reading this, my question is, is that so? Everywhere i read it says an abscess needs to be drained and that antibiotics by themselves cannot remove the lump. I  am taking the antibiotics i mentioned above but there is still some pain though not as acute as before and i can sit and move around and sleep more comfortably. I  can still feel the lump .   I  just need your opinion on this matter as this whole episode is both distressing and confusing. Thanks in advance for any forthcoming replies.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, It appears that you probably had a peri-anal abscess which had spontaeneously ruptured and evacuated itself. If it has drained completely and the opening is adequate for continuing drainage, then it is likely to heal with antibiotic therapy. On the other hand, if it had not drained fully or if the opening is inadequate, it may need proper surgical drainage. Good luck!\n\n",

One is pretty much on the surface, but just inside and one is a bit further in, (maybe a cm.) and a bit deeper. Both will move around a bit and aren't really painful, but I got a little twinge of discomfort that alerted me something might be wrong.  I don't think these are hemorhoids (sp?) and I am so afraid of cancer, I had HPV warts on my vagina and cervix when I was younger once- had not idea they could cause cancer of the anus. I can't see either of them because they are a little inside and so small- a mirror will not do. I do not have health insurance and this really scares me.  Please help!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi deb_42,  Going by your description, i would tend to think of two possibilities...  - a chronic fissure (mostly posterior midline, but pregnancy-associated fissures in women could be in anterior midline position).Fissures usually have two associated swellings - one at the top(hypertrophied anal valves) and one at the anal opening (what is known as the sentinal pile).  - a perianal hematoma(at the anal opening) - which may or may not be painful or tender(depending on whether it is tense or lax).The swelling inside could be either a hypertrophied anal valve or a thrombosed hemorrhoid.  Considering your age, i would advise you to consult a surgeon as there is a remote chance that some of these anal lumps could be malignant.It is always better to be cautious. Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, Your description suggests a pilonidal disease (perhaps which has gone in to form a pilonidal abscess). 'Pilonidal' literally means 'a nest of hairs'.Usually these sinuses contain bunches of hairs in them.Why they form - there are no conclusive answers, but lots of hypotheses. It is believed to originate from stretching, block and infection occuring in the hair follicle. Used to be known as the \"Jeep Drivers' disease\" during the world wars - as it happened almost like an epidemic in some soldiers! ( a combination of sweating and jolting probably contributed to this).Usully occurs in hirsute individuals. There may be a genetic basis - curiously, persons whose eye- brows meet in the midline are said to be at a higher risk!!  As your abscess has opened up sponteneously, the treatment presently will be along the following lines--- dressings as necessary, antibiotics and keeping the sorrounding area free of hairs (shaving,epilatory cremes or any other means).  You will need an assessment by a surgeon once this acute episode settles down. Best wishes!\n\n",

It has never caused me any pain and I chose not to see a doctor as I was too embarassed but the other day it was sore at some points throughout the day, however the pain has since dissapeared. The bump blends in with the colour of the rest of my skin but if anything it is a little whiter. I am not yet ready to see a doctor and I would appreciate it if somebody could let me know what it may be. If it is unclear a list of possible diagnoses would be much appreciated.  Thankyou\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  To answer your question: yes! you are at risk of developing anal cancer.   Risk factors with strong evidence include:    1. HPV    2. History of receptive anal intercourse    3. History of sexually transmitted disease    4. Multiple sexual partners (>10)    5. Previous cancers of the cervix, vagina, or vulva    6. Immunosuppression after solid-organ transplantation.   At young age its actually more common in homosexual males but above 35 years of age its more common in females.  Given you are at increased risk you should have your lump examined right away. That however, doesn't mean that your lump is necessarily anal cancer. On the contrary, a thrombosed hemorrhoid would be a much more likely possibility. It would also be associated with bleeding related to stools and constipation. Another possibility is a wart (HPV).  Please keep us updated and good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Anus pain / burning sensation / leakage",
    "content": "From last 2 months there is pain / burning sensation /leakage in my anus region. I have pain around right side and that is internal.  First I was told it may be external hemorrhoids or anal fissure and abscess. (Sometimes I can feel something bulging from anus after bowel movement.) For 2 months I was on medicine for the above symptom.   But now also I have the same pain at the right side and very small amount of leakage still continues when passing air or while walking.  I have done proctoscopy and colonoscopy but they  revealed nothing.  The only thing that was in colonoscopy that some stools were stick around the skin of intestine near rectum.  And doctor guess that because of  this I am having the above symptoms.   So I am advised to drink plenty of water high fiber diet and stay from spicy foods.  Also I have problem that I am not able to have complete bowel movement(BM).  I have 1 BM in morning but after sometime feel to go for next BM. But this BM is very sensitive. It means if I am not able to reach toilet within urge. I don\u2019t hv a BM. And the whole I am passing notorious gases from  my anus.   Can u help me to diagnosis  my problems  ?? I have a sitting job and it usually takes me around midnight to have dinner bcz of work pressure.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Obviously the anus/rectum is not functioning properly. I am glad that you have visited your doctor and have undergone endoscopy. This should be sufficient to exclude any serious diseases.   Tenesmus (inability to complete a bowel motion) is a symptoms of many colonic diseases including inflammatory bowel disease among others. This also should have been excluded by a colonoscopy.   I think your sitting job is the culprit. I would advise you to follow your doctors orders regarding drinking water and dietary recommendations. I would also suggest that you try some form of physical exercise (eg, running, tennis) several times a week. Try this for a few weeks and let me know if there's any improvement.  Best regards,\n\n",

It is worsens, when i am not able to hv a bowel movement.  Also after 2-3 hrs, due to hell lot of sweating, when i clean my anus i find small amount of stool smell in the sweat.    2. Though i don't hv major pain in my right anus but sometimes i can feel pain in my right anus. Also i feel like heaviness around around the area where the large intestine and small intestine meet each other.  3. I hv diagnosed with kidney stone from my sonography.

It will make you leave you feeling healthy and a good way to reduce calories.  I am assuming that the exercising has benefited you in some areas as well.   I suspect that part of your problem is related to bowel function. It may take some time to get better but improving your lifestyle health habits will be better all around.

He told me that i don't hv any abscess, piles  (external or internal) or any type of infections.  Looking at my reports he prescribed me following medicines :     1. Unienzyme  - just after dinner  2. Ciplox-TZ   -   at night  3. Fibril powder -  at night  For the following conditions  1. pain in right anus  2. gases and cosntipation issue.  Things are improving slowly, now i have 1 bowel movement in morning almost regularly.   But i still have a random pain in right anus and gases problems. The pain is of same type that existed 2 yrs ago when i was diagnosed for piles.    There may be other reasons also: 1. Exercise and doing yoga  2. I am taking juice of mix vegetables.  Also, he ruled out  that i hv any kidney stone problem also. Because according to him if i had it, them i must hv severe pain around tht region which i don't hv.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi seriorissue, I just have a few comments about bowel gas which i though of passing on to you. Most of the bowel gas is swallowed air(exogenous) Some of it is formed within (endogenous) duing the process of digestion and bacterial action. Hurriedly eating is one common cause of excessive air swallowing (although, the blame is squarely placed on the food stuff mostly!).One other reason for excessive air swallowing is frequent, voluntary belching.In this instance,a person thinks that he/she is expelling the air out....but what happens in reality is that more air gets in!!  Let me explain...there is a spnincter at the top of the esophagus known as the crico pharyngeous muscle. Normally in is in a contracted state, preventing outside air entering the gut (due to the atmospheric pressure). During unconscious belching, this opens momentarily allowing air to escape out. if a person belches voluntarily, the throat only makes a sound, muscle relaxes and allows air to get in! This results in a vicious cycle of belching ---- air swallowing ---- flatulence ---- more  belching ---- and thus it goes on & on. Therefore, eat in a leisurely fashion, chew(masticate) food well before swallowing, avoid chewing gum with your mouth open, avoid junk foods, avoid unnecessary belching etc. I do not know of sweat smelling of flatus ( although some foods may cause their smell in the sweat). Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Bleeding During Bowel Movements",
    "content": "I am 31 year old white non-Jewish male in decent health. Not terribly overweight (5'10\", 190lbs) but fairly sedentary (office job). I don't have a poor diet, but could probably stand to eat more fiber. Pretty much middle of the road across the board. My mother's father (my grandfather) had colon cancer, but no one in my immediate family.  Anyway, for some time now, I periodically experience bleeding during bowel movements. Bleeding is usually not severe and only is noticeable as spotting on the toilet tissue. Whether there is any bleeding or not depends upon how \"hard\" or \"large\" my bowel movements are. If I have a \"soft\" bowel movement, there is almost never any bleeding. However, it I have a \"hard\" bowel movement, there is usually at least a little pain in the rectum and some degree of bleeding, evidenced by blood on the toilet paper (not mixed in the stool, as far as I can tell). The blood seems to be limited to the same area (or side) of the rectum where there is what feels like a small bulge. This bulge is not hard, but gets tender and irritated after certain bowel movements. Stools are almost always round, but I recently took a stool softener for the first time and my first bowel movement was more flattish than round (but no bleeding).  For some time I was only cleaning with Tucks pads and taking a gentle and cautious approach to bowel movements. This resulted in a fair degree of success and pretty much eliminated the bleeding. The Tucks pads also soothed the aforementioned bulge, eliminating irritation, swelling, or discomfort. Recently I switched back to regular toilet paper and have not been paying so much care during bowel movements and the bleeding is back.The feeling during these bowel movements is almost that of tearing. I would think that this is likely an anal fissure or hemmhroid, except for the slight bulge in the rectum.   WebMD is great, but you can scare yourself silly with the symptoms. I have an appt. with my physician in two weeks to have this checked. In the meantime, I can't help but keep reading every internet article about colon/rectal cancer. Am I worrying unduely (likely anal fissure/hemmrhoid) or are these more ominous symptoms? Thoughts and opinions are appreciated.\n\n",

While you are waiting for your evaluation, increase your fiber intake, drink plenty of water, and avoid foods that make your stools harder in consistency. As always, any rectal bleeding should be evaluated by your physician to identify the causative factor. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "Hi jarntz, One of the conditions that comes to my mind that causes pain, itching, burning and sometimes bleeding and appears as a lump in the anal area is hemorrhoids. This is an enlargement of veins in the rectal area that become inflamed due to causative factors such as constipation, straining, pregnancy, etc. I would encourage you to have an evaluation by your physician to identify the causative factor. Best wishes. Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

    "content": "There is probably not a relationship between your earlier varicose veins on your scrotum and your hemmorhoids.  When you had the earlier varicose veins, could you feel them as lumps in your scrotum?  If you could feel them they were probably a varicocele, which is not unusual, and sometimes does not go away but may not need treatment. Now it sounds like you have hemorrhoids, which has nothing to do with cancer.  However you need to be sure where the bleeding is coming from.  If the enlarged tissue sticks out on the outside of your rectum, you get bright blood on toilet paper, but not coming out with your bowel movements.  If you feel nothing on the outside, feel just inside with a small lubricated finger, and you may feel a lump that bleeds.   It would be best to see a doctor for exam and treatment.  Pharmacies do sell medicines for hemorrhoids that are not harmful to try - unless you are missing something internal.  To be more sure there is not an internal cause, there are kits for testing for blood in the stool (occult blood) to see if the source of the blood is internal. A doctor (which I am NOT) would ask more questions, to make sure you don't have ulcers, abdominal pains, etc.  How old are you?  Taking any medications or drugs? _________________ Dan Dlugose, R.

    "title": "Excruciating Anal pain and alot of bleeding",
    "content": "I am a 26 year old male. I am in ok shape maybe a little chubby and need to be excersizing but overall Im ok.  One year ago I was on an IV antibiotic due to a badly infected leg. While being on this treatment my stools became really massive in size. They were hard to get out. One day while having a bowel movement, out of no where it felt like this god awful knife cut me up inside my anal, For the first time in my life there was blood on my stool and the toilet water was quite red. The toilet paper was also soaked in red blood. I though to myself wow that hurt and thought hope that never happens again.  Low and behold the next time I had a BM I had this unrealstic sharp pain feeling like it was in the same spot. I could barely handle it I didnt know what to do. The stool was coming and I reach under and helded by butt cheeks tight hoping it would relieve this pain. Finally the stool passed and again it was all full of bright red blood. The same looking blood that comes from a bloody nose.  This occurred for several weeks while I tried home remedies to fix whatever happened. I used laxatives and suppositories. It wasnt so hard to pass stool anymore as they must have become lubricated and softer. Still I continued like this for months. I went to the doctors he had a quick look up there with a light im guessing. He said my veins were very swollen and he gave me these tubes of some anal gel to use for hemerroids. I told him I don't think I have hemorroids I cut myself or something. Anyways the creams did the same thing, theh lubricated the stool but that was all. I was still having pain.  I got the the flu one day that lasted for 1 week. In that time I had explosive diarhea it completely gave my issue a break and caused very little pain if any. All of the sudden my issue was somewhat gone. For the next two-three months I could have a BM in peace. With no pain or blood. But I could still feel a little irritation when the stool went past the recent pain area. I was so happy it seemed to be healing.  Well just recently about 2 months ago bang it started out of no where. I had a harder stool than usual and larger also. Now the same thing is back. Everytime I have BM it hurts really really really badly. The blood has returned also. The other day I seriously saw little drops of blood drip into the toilet right from my anal. Again the toilet paper was soaked in blood. The pain feels like pooping razor blades. Once and awhile I will see a streak of blood down the side of the stool. I can almost guess when the stool will have the streak of blood because I can feel the pain of it touching the cut. The pain will last for hours my BM and it is really painful and uncomfortable. My appetite has always been great, no stomach pains just this.  I apologize for such a long letter but i wanted to include all of the information I could. Can you tell me what in the heck has happened to me up there. It feels like the cut is right on the area you have to push your poop through. Not the immediate hole but up like 8 inches. Is that the sphincter?  Do I have something? Cause this is crazy. I dread going to the bathroom all the time! I have been unable to go to the doctors about this issue again because my lifestyle is so busy . Trust me everyday I say ok next week I have to go to a doctor because i cant deal with this anymore. And on and on we go.     Thanks so much for reading this all!   I hope you can help\n\n",

    "content": "HI, I'm not sure how your post got in the oncology page but I really think the problem is not a cancer but an anal fissure.  This is exactly what you describe , a cut.  There are two sphincters at the anus. internal and external.  Having alternating bowel habits, diarrhea...constipation can make this problem worse.  Right now I know of a few things that can help you.  Stool softeners,  high fiber in your diet, water...avoid constipating foods,  beef, cheese, rice...There are also doctors that can help when this becomes unbearable.  A colo-rectal surgeon can do a \"repair\", I believe they cut the internal sphincter and this somehow allows for relaxation and healing.  Also some gastroenterologist will inject Botox into the area...to literally paralyze the muscle...allowing for the area to heal.  Sitz baths can help alot.  but do try to keep the area dry when not in water.  Keeping the area clean and dry is very important to avoid infection as a complication.  Problems with anal fissures are often misdiagnosed as hemorrhoid problems and you may have both.  Unfortunately this problem will usually come and go throughout a lifetime.  So when you're ready go see a specialist. I hope this helps. peace,\n\n",

I couldn't find time through the day to see a doctor so I could not take the pain and bleeding anymore. I went into the ER and a doctor got me to strip and lay sideays on the bed. After examing my anal he said \"wow you have quite the anal fissure up there\".   So your diagnosis was right too, thanks so much. He prescribed me a cream called diltiazem 2% gel compound. Oddly enough the DR forgot to tell me how and when to use it. I was embarassed enough that I didnt even think of asking. When I saw the pharmacist she basically told me to apply twice a day and use lots of fibre and drink lots of water. Afterwards I got thinking when should i use this exactly. Anyways if you know when I am supposed to use it I would appreciate it. Do I use it before a bowel movement? Right after? How far up do I insert the gel?\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  This is something that you will have to address at the clinic/hospital. Direct medical examination is the only way to make a diagnosis.  That said, your symptoms could be due to hemorrhoids. Classically they present with painless bleeding related to the passage of stools.   Anal cancer has of late become common in male patients younger than 35 years of age but this is largely confined to male homosexuals and those with a history of receptive anal intercourse. Have you noticed any unexplained weight loss recently?  Other risk factors include sexually transmitted diseases as well as a history of genital warts.  Because you do not have any sexual risk factors this reduces the chances of anal cancer. However, other cancers of the GI such as rectal cancer may present with a similar presentation. An examination is necessary even if it is a hemorrhoid it needs to be treated so that it doesn't cause complications and unnecessary distress.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, Bleeding after stools that is not associated with pain is usually caused by hemorrhoids. Of course there are two types (external and internal hemorrhoids). I am assuming that has been excluded by your doctor and the negative scope results.  How about your coagulation profile? Family history of colon polyps? Medication history. I checked your medical history but unfortunately, there's not much written there.  How long has this been going? You do not have fever? Is the bright red in color? Other causes include inflammatory bowel disease. Obviously you're concerned about cancer. Assuming that you do not have a family or personal history of colorectal polyps or cancer, and no other symptoms, your risk is small. We are more concerned about those above the age 50. All of this should have been excluded with the colonoscopy.  Please keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Please provide us with the exact results of his pathologic study as written in his report as well as the type of the operation and postsurgical treatment if any was given.  I guess you meant that he had a tumor of the rectum that was invading the superficial muscle layer. This according to Tumor Node Metastases TNM classification is T2 and if he was node negative so N0 (more likely at this stage), and obviously no metastasis so M0.  Thus, by TNM staging he has stage I disease (T2N0M0). Treatment option for those patients include local excision when they have a small (< 3-4 cm), well to moderately differentiated T1 rectal cancer mass with no lymphovascular involvement on histopathology, as long as a full-thickness negative margin can be obtained.  Patients with stage I have excellent long term survival and local control, with five-year local control rates ranging from 82 to 97%, and recurrence-free survival rates of >90 percent.  Close follow up with his doctor is essential, as early diagnosis of local recurrence can keep his chances in achieving another long term disease control.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  Perianal itching is not an uncommon problem; it is usually caused by irritation of the perianal skin.  This could be due to skin problem like dermatitis, anorectal diseases like piles and fissures or local irritation by excess sweat secretions, excess cleaning or irritant creams.   Dermatitis in this area could be due to infections with fungal, bacterial or parasitic organisms.   Being a moist area, infections with fungi and other organisms can occur resulting in inflammation and irritation in this area, Excess rubbing and scratching of the inflamed skin and may explain why you find blood when you clean yourself.   This area is also exposed to organisms that are normal inhabitant in the large bowel or excreted in stools. When the skin is damaged by rubbing or scratching or is moist by excess sweat it becomes a good medium for these organisms to grow, so more intense itching is felt and so on.  It is also possible that this could be due to piles, it is the commonest cause of fresh blood per rectum and if inflammation occurs around you may feel more perianal itching, bleeding and pain.  I would advise you to follow up with your doctor, direct clinical examination is essential to exclude serious causes like malignancy although unlikely based on your description.  Please keep us updated. Best regards.\n\n",

I am extremely bloated all the time and I found this product online and I am wondering if it is safe to use...I am enclosing the link, when you go to it click on home and it will give you the details of the product and what it does...

    "content": "Hello, Supplements such as this are not regulated and therefore we have little data to support or dispute their claims.  I'm sorry I cannot endorse it but can only advise fiber supplements such as Metamucil taken daily with lots of fluids, regular exercise such as walking and a diet rich in fiber (whole grains, fruits, vegetables).  There are safe laxatives such as Miralax that will not cause dependency.  So, there are things you can do to try to keep your bowels emptied on a regular basis.  You don't need to move your bowels every day but it would be good for you to have more than you are currently.    Many people do bowel cleansings periodically but if you worry about worms and parasites, a doctor could diagnose this with a stool specimen processed in a reputable lab.  Then medications can be effective in eliminating them.  Best wishes.\n\n",

For the past year and a half I would say ive had occasional rectum bleedings when going to the washroom its very spotty. But recently when I go a good amount of blood appears on the toliet paper. Like a spot about an inch in diameter. not to thick but noticeable. Also ive had sharp pains in my rectum which has my body to tense up all like a muscle spasm. This happens maybe once a week. The heavier bleeding and frequent spasm have only started to occur recently like within the past 2 months or so. Also when i go to the washroom theres a bit of pain like a scraping pain. Any all day if Im to contract like suck in my rectum theres a bit of pain and that never really goes away. I was wondering what the problem could be?.....hemeroid?? or something more severe like bowel cancer??....also the blood that comes out is usually medium red not really bright but not dark either.  Cheers,\n\n",

At your age you are not at risk for colon cancer but rectal bleeding should be checked out if hemorroids are not there because there are always exceptions.  You could also have an abscess.  Only your doctor can check this out to find the actual cause of the bleeding. The sharp pains are quite normal for some people.  You should report these symptoms to your doctor.  Best wishes\n\n",

Recently however I suspect otherwise. It is part of the rim of the opening of the anus and is purple in color with a what seems like veins and a darker purple color concentrated on a spot on it. When I touch it it feels and I can see inside it many small round objects are inside it. Looks like a weird bundle of very close grapes.....After some research it sounds to me like a have some sort of external hemorrhoid. I have tried pushing it in but seeing as it is part of the rim opening to the anus it does not work fully. Also just pushing it in strikes pain.  I have a diet of whole wheat bread every day with fresh fruits and I just ate some beans after having read that beans help. I plan on doing a sitz or whatever it is called and was just wondering if this is really what I have or something else? And if it is will it go away in time by natural means or will it have to be surgically taken away? I fear the latter part because I would really hope for it to gradually go away in time.\n\n",

I also later that day started experiencing some slight pain in the area between my rectum and scrotum (same sort of feeling you get from a bruise) which comes and goes. The lump does not hurt and I have not been experiencing any pain when going to the toilet and have not suffered from any bleeding.  I went to my local doctor who saw the lump and said it was a perianal haematoma and that it would go on its own. Whilst reading up on this condition online all the articles i have seen indicate that the lump is tender and hurts and that you may experience pain when going to the toilet. As mentioned this has not been the case, the pain is nearby but in a slightly different spot.  My doctor did not do an overly thorough examination, but presume he knows what he is talking about, but just wanted to check if I should get a second opinion as I have had this for a week almost now and it does not seem to have improved? Also was wondering how long the discomfort should last for?  Many thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hello -  Perianal hematoma is almost always caused by some sort of trauma to the area. It can, of course, sometimes be spontaneous, but this is rare. If your doctor didn't do a thorough examination maybe you should go back or else get a second opinion (including a digital rectal exam). You don't mention any trauma to the area (bicyclists often wind  up with this injury after hitting a pothole or bump in the road). The location is too close to the prostate for me to be comfortable with you just waiting for this to resolve on its own. While such hematomas can last a while post trauma (gravity and sitting both cause them to be slow to heal), I think a thorough exam would be far safer and if it actually is a spontaneous hematoma and there's nothing else going on, then that's great. If something else is going on, though, you'd really do well to know about it.   Hope this is helpful. Please follow up with us here.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  I apologize for the late response.  It would be impossible to make a guess without direct clinical examination. I hope you have had the chance to visit your doctor and that you got the clean bill of health!  Anal cancer is a relatively rare disease. It occurs more commonly in Black women than in Whites or Hispanics. More than 80% are 50-60yrs old. However, during the last decade it has become more common in men younger than 35 years, reversing the gender ratio in this age group; it also is related to receptive anal intercourse.  Risk Factors with Strong Evidence: HPV (anogenital warts)  History of receptive anal intercourse  History of STDs >10 sexual partners  History of cervical, vulvar, or vaginal cancer  Immunosuppression after solid-organ transplantation.  About 25% of newly diagnosed patients with anal cancer do not have symptoms.  Bleeding or palpable mass occurs in 50% of patients.  Pain or spasm is a symptom in 40% of cases.  Sensation of a mass (not palpable) occurs in 25% and pruritus in 15%.  Coexistent conditions (ie, anal fistula, anal fissure, or hemorrhoids) are common. A high index of suspicion in the presence of a mass is warranted and a histological specimen should be taken whenever in doubt.  Good luck with your symptoms and please let us know if everything is ok!\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 28 year old female that received laser treatment approximately ten years ago for cervical dysplasia.  The cause of the dysplasia was HPV infection.  My pap tests since then have always come back normal but now I am worried that I could be at risk for anal cancer.  Prior to my HPV diagnosis, I engaged in unproctected anal sex with 2 different partners on numerous occasions.    Part of the reason I am concerned is because I believe I have one of the aggressive strains of the virus.  I had only been sexually active for under a year when my pap test came back with results that stated \"severe cell changes.\"  Could this mean that the same aggressive cell changes could be occurring around my anus?  I've been worrying a lot about this lately because I fear that my anus area could be enduring the same rapid cell changes as my cervix did many years ago.  Please let me know if I would be at high risk for anal cancer and if this is something I should get checked out.  For the record, I have no symptoms that would indicate cancer.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Amecyst,  The answer to this question is unfortunately \"it depends\".  HPV is well linked to increased risk of anal cancer; however, as with cervical cancer, only certain strains increase the risk.  In particular, HPV strain 16 is the most commonly seen strain, followed by strain 18.  Cervical cancer strains vary a little but in general, 16, 18, and 31 tend to be the more aggressive strains.  The answer as to whether or not you may be at increased risk of anal cancer depends on which strain of HPV you were infected with.  Unfortunately, at this point there really is not much to do to decrease your risk if you are infected with an aggressive strain.    The best thing you can do is to continue to have regular check ups with your gynecologist, being sure to make your doctor aware of your concerns about anal cancer.  This way you can continually be monitored for any signs of early changes that may be precancerous.  Early detection is the key.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  It's obviously impossible to make any useful deductions over the internet, but, I can talk to you a bit about anal cancer.  Anal cancer is a rare disease, usually appearing later in life and and is strongly related to sexual practice especially exposure to HPV. HPV whether in men or women increases the risk of developing this rare cancer. Homosexual men that practice receptive anal sex are at an increased risk.   Rectal bleeding is the most common presentation (not a purple-white lump). This appears in 45% of patients. 30% of patients complain of pain. 30% have a concomitant history of anorectal condyloma. Itching and eczema are symptoms of two common pre-cancerous conditions (Paget's disease and Bowen's disease, respectively).  While the chances that you have an anal cancer may be slim, nothing can be excluded without a direct clinical examination. I would suggest you get an exam to determine what exactly this is and have it dealt with as soon as possible.  Good luck!\n\n",

    "title": "Long-Term blood smearing of toilet tissue",
    "content": "Hi,  Having finally gotten the nerve to approach others (sort of) about this problem, I wish to share my symptoms with a professional before addressing my family doctor.  I'm an eighteen-year-old male on no current medications, with no past surgeries, and no past diagnoses of any noteworthy conditions.  Since early middle school, it seems, I've occasionally discovered minute (trace) amounts of blood on toilet tissue after using the restroom.  While I never really found a source of the bleeding, it was obvious the condition stemmed from no internal sources, and most likely the result of rough wiping on the outside area.  However, in early-mid August of this year, bleeding from the area increased a significant magnitude.  At times, toilet tissue would be smeared with a light amount of blood, while at others, the bleeding worsened to leave what seemed to be a drop or two on the paper.  This went on, painlessly, until early September, at which point greatly bleeding subsided, but still continued in relatively light amounts. Then, in mid-October, I began to periodically experience stinging sensations in the area, which typically occurred when I would push or wipe particularly hard during/after a bowel movement.  At first, it seemed to come from the upper-left region of my anus, but then I realized that I was experiencing the same thing from a tiny spot in the upper-right, which had hitherto gone unnoticed.  Now, while this had me worrying severely, it's important to note that I've experienced slight amounts of itching from these two areas extending as far back as the first experience of bleeding occurred, but I'm afraid to say that this is connected to the bleeding I'm currently experiencing.  Furthermore, upon closer examination, I've found what seems to be a small skin tag present in the upper-right location.  In itself, the skin tag does not itch or present any evidence of its presence, but I still find it an important aspect to mention.  Frankly, I'm afraid it's possibly a tumor, but I have no idea how to tell.  Other than the above, I have found no other abnormalities in the area except for a near-surface blood vessel beneath the anus.  Pain and bleeding have now become increasingly periodic in nature, and I have experienced them only two days in the past three weeks, with only a tiny amount of bleeding tonight.  Please put my mind at rest - at least until I can schedule an appointment with the family physician.  I appreciate any help or advice that anyone here has to give.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  Are you saying that the bleeding is only associated with stools? So it doesn't happen on its own that you wake up to find blood has stained your underwear or clothes for example? Is the pain associated with bowel motions. All these conditions make anal conditions/ hemorrhoids more likely. Its indeed very likely since you mention that this all started off with rough wiping which can lead to several conditions in that area.  No one can tell for sure what you have without close assessment and examination. Its good to hear that you will be seeing your doctor soon. Please continue to update this thread after seeing your doctor.  Good luck and best regards,\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all,   When I was 16 or 17 (am 25 now) I suffered extreme trauma to my back passage, it was bleeding for three whole days, out of three different parts.   Here\u2019s how it happened, I was sitting in the back of a van, on the wheel arch, we were going fast and the driver slammed on his breaks making half my body to move forward and the other half to stay where it was, right away I knew something was wrong, I felt it deep in side me.  The bleeding started almost right away (this was on the Friday) by Saturday, the bleeding was worst, and there was an awful smell.   Me thinking that the smell was just the blood, I didn\u2019t go to the A&E or a GP (the smell wasn\u2019t their b4) after Sunday the blood cleared up, but the smell was still their, and its still their.   Now, let me tell you that I have a shower every day, clean down their in the shower and after I go to the loo, making sure their nothing down their which shouldn\u2019t be, I still cant get rid of the smell, so for the past part of 8 years I have wore only jeans, its the only thing which can keep the smell in, and have had next to no exercise.   Theirs also something else it happened down there, it happened when it was bleeding, so I thought it was just he blood.  Every time I need the toilet, down their, it starts to sweat extremely usually, so bad that it makes sweat marks in my boxers, and if I wear light trousers (like combats) the sweat goes right through (that\u2019s another reason why I can only wear jeans) and that\u2019s when the smell starts EVEN although theirs nothing down their which shouldn\u2019t be.   As you can image that I have more or less no life to speak off, cos I can only wear jeans, and I want to get rid of this.   Can one think of a reason why this is happening?   I have been to my GP, a number of times, it only shows up when I need to toilet so making a appointment at the right time is a nightmare.  i have started to shave down their to see if that makes a diffenents, but it doesnt.  I am male, my past diagnoses have been, 3 doctors have said piles and another doctor has said its a sweat glad. (sorry if this is in the wonrg forum) i also havent told any doctors the whole story, only some.\n\n",

You would be surprised how common this really is.  Older people and women tend to be more commonly afflicted with it.    Since you have identified one major trigger - sugar - it would be wise to avoid this.  Some people find that artificial sweeteners have this effect so it would be wise not to just replace sugar with other sweeteners. It would be better to eliminate the sugar as much as possible.  There are treatments to help so please follow up with a doctor who can evaluate the cause and help you find a suitable treatment.  There is an excellent chance your quality of life will be improved.    You haven't mentioned if you have constipation.  Surprisingly enough this condition can be part of the problem.  Stool becomes impacted and loose stool leaks around it.  So, if this is a problem for you, it would also be wise to tackle that issue.    Good luck with this, but know you don't have to live with it untreated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi there,  I'm a 20 year old female. About 5 months ago I discovered two small lumps on my anal entrance. They were the size of two small pimples and were just a little bit itchy. At first I thought I had worms because whenever I've had an itchy bum in the past that's what it has been. But after taking worm tablets, the itch was still there.  Over the past five months, the two pimples have grown in size slightly and now resemble skin tags. They look like extra bits of skin. They are incredibly itchy but only late at night. In the daytime I have very little discomfort (if any). Yet at night, it seems as soon as I go to bed...I get a very strong desire to itch. I try not to itch because the area is sore and imflammed, but it is almost impossible not to.  I noticed that there is now another little lump. Sometimes the area is guey, like there my anal region is leaking slightly and it feels slimy.  My poo is the same consistency as mud, it is squelchy with no shape. Very soft yet not soft enough to be diarreha.  I'm not sexually active and I'm slim. I eat fairly healthy and exercise appropriately. I'm very embarrassed to go and see a doctor. I bought a natural hemmarhoid cream from the pharmacy but that didn't seem to make any difference and it only stung to put it on.  I'm really scared that I have anal cancer or something drastic like that. The fear is nearly enough to get me to the doctor but the idea of opening up my bum for them to have a look is very embarrassing.  PLEASE help!!! Any advice would be hugely appreciated thankyou.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello, I certainly understand your reluctance to expose such areas even to professionals, but I would strongly encourage you to do this - hard as it is.  You will likely find it is not as bad as you expect because the staff will be used to dealing with such matters.  You could see a proctologist or even a family practice doctor, but it is important to find out what it is.  Most likely it will ease your mind because the answer may be that it is nothing to worry about.  But, peace of mind is worth a lot!  The itching and soreness are the symptoms that cause me to suggest this.  If it were just painless bumps I would say it is probably a skin tag or some form of wart, etc.  But, the irritation does cause me to feel there is some type of infection that might need treatment.  I would not go so far as to suggest cancer at this point but since it can start out with mild symptoms, getting this checked out is your best defense.  Hemorrhoids can be painful and itchy so perhaps this is the problem.  In this case, you may find creams along with medicated pads like Tucks to be more helpful than suppositories.  Shallow, warm baths will also offer relief.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 29 year old female in good health and am not on any medications. I am 5'3'' and 133 lbs. I returned exactly a week ago from a six week voluntary teaching programme in Ethiopia. I have noticed blood on the tissue after wiping after a bowel movement. I have noticed this twice, once while I was there and again today. There was about 10 days between each time I noticed. I have no pain, itching or sickness and my bowel movements are normal and healthy now. However while I was in Ethiopia I was constipated a lot of the time and felt very bloated a lot of the time. Since I have returned, that has stopped and my bowel movements have returned to normal. This time there was more blood on the tissue than the first. I thought it was my period but it isn't. I am quite worried as to what it could be. Thanks in advance for your help.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Shell3,  There are several common causes of rectal blood.  It may be due to internal or external hemorrhoids, a colonic polyp that is bleeding some, or an anal fissure (small crack in the mucosa/skin) that is bleeding.  Given that you were recently in Ethiopia it may also be appropriate to check for parasites, although these typically would cause a few more symptoms than just 2 episodes of bleeding.  Your doctor can help evaluate this if it persists.  Best wishes.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi guys! First off I just want to say thank you to all the Dr's and Nurse who provide advise.. i found this site last week, and really.. you're amazing.   Now my problem seems similar to others, but I just wanted to explain the whole story..   I am a 25 year old gay man. In the last month I have had what look like two tags appear near my anus. They appeared within a week of the last time I had sexual intercourse. They are soft, and not normally very painful. Usually they can get itchy, but nothing horrible. Occasionally when I wipe after a BM there may be a little blood. There has only been blood once during a BM, but I think that was from straining.   Now here is some medical history... I have skin tags on my body.. since I seem to have bad luck, they're all in areas that would stink to have them taken off (armpits, near the groin...) And the pictures I've seen online make what I have on my anus look like a skin tag... they're larger than any of the other ones I have.  Last november I had a horrible ordeal with hemorrhoids where. I bled a lot during a couple BMs. I took many sitz baths, and used prep H... I had an allergic reaction to the prep H, AND got an infection. I went to urgent care, was told the hemorrhoid had gone down, and was given a simple antibiotic and painkiller for the infection. From November until July, I've had no other problems.   (Sidenote: family history: My father has many skin tags on his body, and gets hemorrhoids. (Thanks for the genetics dad.))  I have a DR appt in a month.. and from all I've read I think they're tags... I would just like a LITTLE more peace of mind while I wait to see my doc. I'm an over-worrier, so I have obviously worried about anything from stds to cancer. Boo.   Again,. Thanks guys!!\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Starwarsagent1122,  The perfumed wash may be contributing to the itching.  It is also possible that you have an area of eczema or psoriasis that is affecting this skin.  (This would be pretty rare but possible.)  Another common cause of perianal itching is pinworms.  The worms themselves can be very difficult to spot.  They typically are visible more at night and are quite small.    Because of the variety of possible causes, recommending a treatment is simply not possible without an examination.  I would recommend you discuss your symptoms with your doctor.  It is quite likely that there is a treatment to help you.  Best wishes.\n\n",

About two weeks ago when taking a shower i noticed a bump on the opening of my anus, upon further examination I discovered a grape sized lump directly on the opening of my anus its purple in color and quite large. Im realy concerned as to what this is, and i would like to have some kind of idea as to what im dealing with before I go to a doctor. I have read online other people's situation but all describe a small pea sized lump mine is alot larger the size of a grape again stated. It does not hurt when deficating or when sitting, but when touching it it feels soft and quite weird like if it was sore but not to the point that i cant handle it. Its been a little over a week now and it has not shrunk or changed at all still the same size and i feel weird about a doctor inspecting that area. 1st off what kind of doctor would I need to see for this? and this bump wasent there for long i recently noticed it a little over a week ago. When i try to think of it, it appeared after taking a **** mayb i pushed to hard im not sure. Please doctors any ideas as to what this might be?  Regards, Online User\n\n",

    "title": "I thought it was hemorrhoids..",
    "content": "OK well for about 3 years now I have noticed blood sometimes on my tissue after wiping my anus. Not a lot just a little pinkish blood usually when I was near done wiping. There was never any blood in the actual stools. I figured it was because I was heading to the bathroom about 3 times a day.  For the past few months I have been sitting on my ass in my computer chair A LOT! I have had nothing else to do,, I am 21 years old by the way.  So in the past week I started having the worst experience of my life. I'll break it down in to days.  Day 1 - First start noticing pain near my anus. Little bit of itching also  Day 2 - The pain has increased. I can barely stand sitting down right now for 5 minutes.  Day 3 - The pain is unbearable. I figure it is hemorrhoids so my girlfriend (thank God for her), goes and gets me a bunch of stuff to cure it at CVS. I can barely walk and definitely can not bend over.  Day 4 - I am still in the same amount of pain as day 3 but I am now start taking warm baths multiple times. I am still applying prep H and using Tucks to clean my area. When it got to be night time the pain was unbearable so I took 2 ibuprofens. It made the pain go away but the burning was still there. So I am a lot more active before heading to sleep and I go to lay down and I feel this wet stuff in my pants. I touch it and I think it is just the prep H for some reason. I go in the bathroom to check things out and there is a bunch of pus mixed with blood leaking out of a hole very near my anus but below it. After this happened the pain has pretty much disappeared but I still have the burning sensations.  Day 5 - I awake to more pus in my crack. I clean it up, hop into the bath and Thank God the pain isn't their anymore.  Day 6 (Today) - I awake and there is still pus coming out of this hole. I am doing the same things as yesterday taking 4 baths a day. The pus now does not have any blood mixed in but it is more clear with a yellowish tint to it.  Should I be worried right now? Will I get better on my own? Could this be Anal Cancer? I am trying to keep the area clean the best I can with Tucks pads after I take a bath.  Thank you in advance for any replies.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 38 year old female with a history of IBS, unexplained upper quadrant pain. I had my gallbladder removed in 1999 and two ERCPs within three years after the surgery. I've had elevated liver function at times and I currently take Levbid when I suffer a spasm in my upper quadrant area.  I felt a lump about a centimeter away from my anus. I haven't seen it but I definitely feel it when I am going to the bathroom. It does not itch but it does hurt somewhat when I have a bowel movement. Is this something that I need to see a doctor for and if so, would I see a GI, my internist, my OB or a dermatologist? Thank you for any help you can give to me.\n\n",

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease like IBS are more prone to have Hemorrhoids.   Pain is a common association.  The condition can be diagnosed easily with direct clinical examination.  I advise you to seek medical consultation (surgical, general medicine or family doctor).  Keep us updated.\n\n",

    "content": "Hello Doc,  Firstly I would like to know if any kind of lump in the anal area could be a cause of STD. After intercourse with my girlfriend, few days later I figured out that I had a lump in my anal area, which I ignored for like a month, until it started giving pain. I visited my doctor and I was given anti-biotics,which reduced the swelling of the lump,then later on about a month later, it came out a little bit bigger and with pain. I visited the doc again and I was given the same medication in which I was advised to come back to see the surgeon, ever since then I havent gone back to the hospital because I am afraid I would have to be operated upon, besides the lump in spreading to the lower part of my buttocks. Please advise.\n\n",

I would strongly encourage you to have a re-evaluation because untreated infections not only spread to other areas but also have the potential to make one quite ill. Best wishes.

Is the area you are speaking of around the anal opening, sort of like something is protruding or hanging there? Do you experience burning and itching? Does the area become swollen with passage of hard stool or episodes of constipation and then decreases in size over a few days? Any bleeding with bowel movements? If the above is a correct description, have you been diagnosed with a hemorrhoid because that would certainly be a consideration.  Sincerely, Theresa Jones, RN\n\n",

I am not experiencing any bleeding or bowel movement which are more like anal cancer symptoms, though the lump is a little bit above my anus,not exactly on the opening. But the other experience is, when am passing faeces, I feel itches in my anus, and like I said the other time, it makes me feel like putting in a sharp object to scratch it.But theres no burning.

    "content": "Hi dejieyo,  We don't take phone calls unfortunately. Like Theresa said, an anal mass could be due to a lot of things, including many benign diseases. Haemorrhoids, rectal prolapse, perianal haematomas, anal tags, polyps, warts or condylomas, anal abscesses can all present as an anal mass. Non-proctological lumps can also be present from time to time. These include sebaceous cysts and lipomas. Anal cancer is an uncommon disease, however, a palpable mass and/or  bleeding is the presenting symptom in 50% of patients that get this rare disease.  Pruritus ani is excessive and often intractable anal itching from multiple causes. Men are more commonly affected in a ratio of 4:1. Pinworms (Enterobius vermicularis) and chronic Candida infection are the most common infectious agents. Local dermatitis can result from allergic reaction to scented or dyed toilet tissue, or from allergies to certain foods (eg, coffee, tea, cola, beer, chocolate, or tomatoes).  Although poor hygiene may lead to pruritus ani, overzealous cleansing and application of medications also can produce itching. A program of gentle but effective hygiene should be promoted. Drying the anal skin can help, and patients may require frequent changes of cotton underwear during the summer months to prevent skin maceration and further itching. Some patients have been effectively treated with topical antifungals and low-potency steroids.  Please understand that we can only help by providing medical information or explaining medical conditions to you. We are unable to help you reach a diagnosis.   Please call on your doctor again and keep him up to date on your condition.   Good luck dejieyo!\n\n",

There is a little burning feeling assocated with the lump. there is usually no discomfort at all.   I have been reading on anal cancer, What does \"Changes in bowel habits\" mean exactly? does that mean how many times I have to use the bathroom each day? I am afraid that the lump I have is cancer. If it is cancer, since I had the lump for years now, should I have more symptoms?  I do not have blood in the stool. sometimes there is pain accocaited while going to the bathroom, rarely though.  thank you for your time.\n\n",

    "content": "Dear ayanez05,   It would have been of great help if you could give more details about the history and the description of these lesions e.g. whether they are associated with pain or tenderness, if they appeared after a diarrhea attack, other similar lesions in other parts of the body etc. Any recent sexual activity before they were discovered.  According to your description the diagnosis is very difficult and clinical examination is mandatory for diagnosis.   However some possible causes are:  Nodules with white head usually represent infected lesions (commonly of bacterial origin ). If the nodules are mainly in the hairy area, follicles is the diagnosis. The condition is associated with pain, discomfort and tenderness.   Dermatitis in these areas are common and secondary infections with bacterial, or candida is common. In some cases perianal pseudoverrucous papules and nodules represent a special form of primary irritant dermatitis in which elevated smooth red flat topped lesions  are formed. This is commonly occur after severe forms of diarrhea.   Hypertrophied papillae (or anal skin tags, epithelial polyps) is another possibility, clinically they look like external hemorrhoids. They result from, inflammation, edema and fibrosis  Different types of Viral infections give lesions with similar picture. The diagnosis is made by examination and specific tests.   I advise you to be checked by your doctor. Complete detailed history and physical examination are very important to reach the correct diagnosis.  Best regards,\n\n",

Approximatley 6 months ago noticed small lump just inside anal area. It did not really concern me at that time.  Keep feeling lump but recently realized it was larger.  Also now have another smaller lump in close proximity to larger lump.  It only recently has started causing discomfort (burning) when irritated after bowel movement most likely from wiping.

I suddenly woke up today and went to school whne I felt pain inside my Anal, After managing to look there is what looks like a small lump in the way of the hole. I am not sure what to do, or if I goto a docter what to say. I researched  on the internet to no help. I am suppose to be on TV next week and I really do not want this to ruin that for me.   Any ideas to what it could be? Most things I have read about the sort seem to talk about sexual diseases. I also am wondering if I can put off the docter or if it will go away, could it be an infection of some sort?   The  lump is not hard, is blocking the hole... not interfering with bowl movements... Recently however I have had... runny? excrement... Could that be the cause? It is painful and I can feel it.   Thank you.\n\n",

    "content": "I am a 19 year old girl. I am worried about this protrusion (diagnosed as a fissure by a GP and was given xyloproct 2 months back, no improvemet) from near my anal opening which seems to me like a skin tag. It's a LITTLE bit bigger than a pea and is squishy and moves about like a skin flap. I've had this for about two years now, but it has not enlarged in size or changed in any manner over the course of time. It does not generally cause me any pain, but if I ride a bike or walk a long distance, it becomes a little irritated. But this irritation didn't start until a couple of months back. There is no bleeding or pain when i pass faeces. I am worried because a couple of months back i got this continuous lower back pain. It seems be starting at the end of my spine and moves abt 2 inches up along the spine. It's sort of like this burning sensation. I've tried medication prescribed by an orthopaedic surgeon, (Cellox and paracetemol for about 2 weeks now) There is a little improvement. But I can't help but worry. My mother died of breast cancer, don't know if it is of any relevance. I would GREATLY appreciate it if anyone is kind enough to offer me an opinion. I am going to a surgeon in a few weeks. But until then, I just need to ease my mind. so PLEASE!!!\n\n",

The lump is the size of a small pea and extremely hard and is on the ridged skin surrouding the anal opening. There is no bleeding in my stools or any pain while passing them. I applied a haemhorroid cream for a few days but that hasn't helped and I suspect the lump has become more prominent. The lump is under the skin and there is no change in the colour of the skin versus the surrounding area. There are no other symptoms. I am extremely worried and I plan to see my doctor this week but I would just like to know anything that would help me to understand what it is. Thanks\n\n",

    "content": "Hi Dr. Fouad, Thank you for that very informative assessment. My GP pronounced the lump to be a thrombosed hemorrhoid. He asked me to continue using Anusol cream, but in a telephonic conversation today on another matter, I asked him again about this and  he said I could ignore it (the lump). I am not sure if there is anything I can do for now but wait and watch since it is painless. By the way, the cream doesn't seem to be having any effect whatsoever, so I might discontinue it. I'm a bit confused now since I'm not sure if I need to do something else to make it go away or wait for a while before I have it examined once more or just ignore it.  Thanks again for your input  -RP\n\n",

    "content": "Hello,  As I mentioned in another post, anal masses could be due to a benign condition such as sebaceous cyst or a lipoma to a malignant disease.  Anal cancer is an uncommon malignancy. The number of new cases were estimated to be 3,990 in the United States were 630 in 2005.  There is a slightly higher incidence in females than in males. Male to female ratio: 1:2.   As regards age, anal cancer most commonly develops in patients 50 to 60 years old.  About 25% of newly diagnosed patients with anal cancer do not have symptoms. Bleeding or palpable mass occurs in 50% of patients. Pain or spasm is a symptom in 40% of cases. Sensation of a mass (not palpable) occurs in 25% and pruritus in 15%.   Coexistent conditions (ie, anal fistula, anal fissure, or hemorrhoids) are common. A high index of suspicion in the presence of a mass is warranted and a histological specimen should be taken whenever in doubt. Please have it checked out.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "Hi, I'm a 33 yer old male in good health and active in sports(soccer).  Just had a CBC last month and everything was good.  But now I'm a little bit concerned.  Three weeks ago today I had what I hope was a bad case of hemorrhoids.  I went to the bathroom and was trying to rush and I was a little bit constipated.  The next day i was so sore I could hardly walk.  I checked myself and found a large lump on the right side of my anus.  It scared me really bad, plus it was really tender.  I bought some Prep H and put it on.  By the 4th or 5th day the pain started to go away, but the lump didn't.  I looked this up on the internet and all signs point to a thrombosed external hemorrhoid.  I've taken warm baths nearly everyday, but haven't been doing the Prep H thing because it didn't hurt anymore.  Still, to this day the lump is still there.  It's about the size of a peanut or half of a grape and it's a light purple in color.  I got worried because it doesn't seem to be going away.  And today I noticed that I have one swollen gland in my groin on the right side.  It's more like my upper inner thigh, just next to my testicles.  It's a little sore.  Now, I'm a hypochondriac by nature and have been freaking out thinking that it could be some sort of cancer because of the swollen gland and the hemorrhoid lump not going away yet.  I constantly look up symtpoms on the net and keep finding more and more terrible stuff.  My insurance ran out this month because I was just layed off from work, so I can't really afford to go to the Dr. without it coming out of my pocket.  Dr., what should I do?  Does this sound like something that is serious?  Or could it just be a really bad external hemorrhoid that my body is fighting, causing my gland to swell?  Is there anything I can do if it's just an external hemorrhoid?  Will it go away on its own or do I need to see a doctor?  Please advise because I'm a worrier.  Sorry this was so long...\n\n",

Non-proctological lumps can also be present from time to time. These include sebaceous cysts and lipomas. On the other hand, a palpable mass and/or  bleeding is the presenting symptom in 50% of patients that are later found to have anal cancer.  External hemorrhoids are asymptomatic except when secondary thrombosis occurs. Thrombosis may result from defecatory straining or extreme physical activity, or it may be a random event. Patients often report feeling the sensation of sitting on a tender marble. Physical examination identifies the external thrombosis as a purple mass at the anal verge.  If infected this can lead to inguinal lymph node enlargement. The inguinal lymph nodes are situated in the crease between the leg and pelvis (more on the outside of that crease, ie, laterally). They drain the penis, scrotum, vulva, vagina, perineum, gluteal region, lower abdominal wall, lower anal canal. Common causes of enlargement include infections of the leg or foot, STDs (eg, herpes simplex virus, gonococcal infection, syphilis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale, lymphogranuloma venereum), lymphoma, pelvic malignancy, bubonic plague.  Another possibility is anal abscess. I would recommend that you have someone look at this.   Best regards.\n\n",

I ended up going to the doctor and he looked at it for a second and told me what I really already knew.  I had a thrombosed external hemorrhoid that he said would go away on its own, though it may take a little while.  He said I may have a skin tag that he could remove if I wanted him to later, but that it wasn't necessary.  As for the swollen gland in my groin, it turned out to be nothing more than a sebaceous cyst that was infected.  He gave me an antibiotic and sent me on my way.  Now all is well.  I felt so much better after he told me I was fine.  I shouldn't have been embarrassed or scared to see the doctor about this.  Thanks Doc!\n\n",

It is real hard and hurts to sit, sleep, stand...it feels like when I tore having a baby 2 years ago and they stitched me up. ANy way I went to the walk in clinic today and the MD told me thought it was a boil perhaps from an ajoining external hemerrhoid I had just gotten over last week. He gave me an antibiotic to see if we could get the infection to release??? Clindamiacin?? 4  day...and to take 1-2 baths every day.  I mentioned if it would need lancing and the MD said it isn't localized enough. Does this sound logical?  I can't imagine something of this size and density will just 'Go Away'.  When should I see an improvement?? about 4 days??\n\n",

The incidence in men younger than 35 has increased and the sex ratio is reversed in this group.  About 25% of newly diagnosed patients with anal cancer do not have symptoms. Bleeding or palpable mass occurs in 50% of patients. Pain or spasm is a symptom in 40% of cases. Sensation of a mass (not palpable) occurs in 25% and pruritus in 15%. Coexistent conditions (ie, anal fistula, anal fissure, or hemorrhoids) are common. A high index of suspicion in the presence of a mass is warranted.  If you are still having this problem and have not been to the doctor's then I strongly recommend that you do.  Best regards.\n\n",

Pilonidal disease is a chronic subcutaneous infection and foreign-body reaction to hairs embedded in the skin or to abnormalities of hair follicles in the natal cleft. Pilonidal disease is most commonly seen in obese persons and in men between the puberty and 40 years of age.  Pilonidal disease has three common presentations. First, an acute abscess is formed as a result of inflammation. After the abscess resolves a pilonidal sinus tract may develop. Most of these sinus tracts resolve; however, chronic disease or recurrent disease after treatment develops in a small minority of cases.   Physical examination reveals one or more small dermal pits (1 to 2 mm) at the base of the intergluteal cleft.   Have someone look at it. Treatment is usually surgical.  Best regards.\n\n",

    "content": "I grow thick hair around my anus and it has always bothered me and itched so I started shaving it about a year ago. Of course that was not a pleasant thing. After much consideration I decided to wax it. After I applied the wax I think I applied it in my anus a bit and when I pulled it off it was extremely painful. A day later I had a tender, pea-sized lump right on the exterior of my anus. It's very irritating and uncomfortable. It's not discolored or anything but it has a white spot on the center, almost like a whitehead. It doesn't bleed or have pus, it's just really irritating. Could it be an ingrown hair or something else? Should I seek treatment or wait and see if it heals, it's only been 3 days. Thanx for any help!  J\n\n",

It was so bad at times that I would be in tears, I couldn't walk, I couldn't sit, if I coughed or sneezed I could have shot through the roof.  Just very severe pain.  Anyway, I went to a proctologist and found out I had a fissure.  He prescribed anal suppositories that had belladonna and opium in them and they were fantastic.  It took a good 6 months to a year for it to totally clear but I must say it was worse than childbirth.  I now have pain that is related to hemorroids which I can control on my own.  Whatever you do do NOT force a bm.  Another thing that helped me was using a stool softener, changing my diet to more fiber and exercise.  I hope I helped.  Oh, there is some talk about a cream that is used to treat heart problems that works on the fissures, I wish I could remember the name of it. But because it is absorbed into the blood it can cause some undo effects.  Good Luck.\n\n",

My problem is i have some kind of hemorrhoid like bump, but I also have what looks like a string or tube of skin that extends over my problem area about a cenameter. It looks almost like a vein that got pushed out of the skin. This tube is the same color as the rest of my skn in that area. Other than that the rest of the bump looks like a cluster of  two or three upside down tear shaped bumps. When I apply pressure on the those bumps they feel almost solid. I have also noticed that  the area is sore and I can spread the bumps apart and I find the skin to be light coloured or raw. Please can you help me?\n\n",

    "content": "I'm a 24 year old female who was diagnosed with an anal fissure early last year. this I have managed with 'rectogestic' which has been great. I have just recently noticed today in my stool it seem to have red/orange bits (very small around the size of a freckle) and I'm wondering what foods can make your stool change colour or appear red (aside from the obvious documented ones) or should it be cause for concern and should I see a doctor?  It was definately not my fissure as I know what the blood will look like as it appears on the paper not mixed in with the stool. This happened a few weeks ago with capsicum and I ate a big bowl of pasta last night with sauce that was bright red, could this have caused it?  I'm alittle worried as I work for a company that makes colostomy bags so I know way too much about colon cancer but this I can't find an answer for.  Please I really would like some light shed on this?\n\n",

I had a bowel movemet 2 hours ago and walking is even a little painful for me.

    "content": "Early February I experienced sore pains in rectum while going to the toilet a couple nights in a row, I started to bleed on the second night and became very frightened at what it could mean. I have a chronic fear of doctors and people examining me since I was young and I foolishly didn't seek medical help nor tell anyone my problems because I felt uncomfortable telling anyone.   The pains stopped and the bleeding happened only once more during the month, then it didn't happen for a while, I thought it was just a wound like any other and that it healed up. My problems were over I thought.  Unfortunately it wasn't a one off problem, it's months since and I experience this dreadful happening now everytime I retire to the toilet. I'm scared because I've read it's possibly cancer and would need surgery to fix the problem. I dunno how else to describe the problem except to say that it's a fair amount of blood.  I'm 17 years old and am afraid of seeing a doctor or telling anyone in real life my problems. This fear stems from the my father death of cancer in hospital. Please help me.\n\n",

Some instances when bleeding may occur aside from cancerous conditions are minor trauma of the rectum caused by hard bowel movements, straining during bowel movements, hemorrhoids, etc. You may want to increase your fiber intake, drink plently of fluids, and increase your activity. This should help soften the bowel movements.  Sincerely, Rntdj\n\n",

    "content": "Hello all,  I've had what I think is an anal fissure for almost 3 years. I got it very randomly, I was walking about when I felt an uncomfortable wet feeling, when I went to check it out there was quite a lot of blood on my boxer shorts. Anyway after reading about anal fissures I thought it would eventually go away, but it hasn't and I have been embarrased to go to see the doctor about it. It started off as a small cut but over the 3 years has widened out to a larger circular cut about 1.5cm in diameter, it didn't used to bleed as much but now it bleeds almost constantly, there is always blood on my boxer shorts which is sometimes sticky and smells bad (something like canned tuna fish). Just after passing a bowel movement the bleeding that can be seen is bright red blood as I have seen described for piles. It used to be quite itchy especially after using the toilet, however now it just seems painful (not extremely painful just a little). The weird thing is the pain doesn't seem to come from the cut itself (it only hurts when touched), the pain seems to come from the bone just above (the coxics I think it is called). Anyway like I say I have had it for about 3 years and I am only 18 so I doubt it could be cancer, however I would like your advise to what it may be, I'm pretty sure it is an anal fissure or piles. Thank you in advance John.\n\n",

Physical exam didn't come up with anything.\n\n",

This may have  gotten larger, it's hard to tell, but after I deficate it itches, and if I wipe like I normally do, it bleeds some.  Now it itches, at times, for apparently no reason, and if I rub it to relieve the itch, it begins to bleed.  What could this be?\n\n",

Also been getting pain in my scrotum, well near my left and right testicle sort of comes and goes... every few minutes I get a sharp pain there for a second. Taken some Ibuprofen about 15 minutes ago, and not had the pain since then really. .. So not sure if that is a sign of prostrate cancer aswell. Or it is just a slight thing, as I had it onc before a while back but never took much notice as it went away. It went away the other day for about 4 days when it was on the right side. Now it is on the left side. Still Both are really worring me and didn't want to go posting loads of questions everywhere. Also been having concerns over my heart still posted as Josh2004 I think before.. or JoshUK can't remember and couldn't remember my password. Still might post my concerns at the moment in there. I have also been feeling rather light headed and sick, not actually vomiting but felt like it this morning. Also like an acidic burning in my chest. pains in right and left arms a slight irregular heartbeat at times, out of breat this morning doing some things... Although I have had a lot les sleep than I should have recently... Still sorry to go on  Hope this hasn't caused any problems with the rules. Just I have so many concerns over things, tend to worry a lot I guess. But still hope somoene can answer my questions or help me, if you need more information I can always answer questions, I will try to get an apointment to see my doctor and see what he has to say about it all also\n\n",

Only now and then it happens, Also get pains in my arms etc... but have had blood and ECG's done and they all show up normal results guess getting a 24 hour monitoring could be a good thing. I worry that it could be a heart attack or something.. or heart faliour or a blockage in some vein! Guess I worry too much about my health, but the feelings I get do worry me like the pains in my testicles and the bleeding pains in my arms and such like etc.. does worry me although I posted in the heart area a load of info a private doctor told me said I had a lot of trigger points for Fibromealga or something or other... which I hear can cause pains in places.. so could just be muscular pain, I do get like deep what feel like muscular spasms in my chest also... Worried I also had epilepsy as I get like a burning smell sometimes in my nose for a few moments and muscular spasms, I guess I really am a HYPOCONDRIAC lol! but these things have woken me up to what can happen, I know it is more about what IS happening, Just I guess,... some of these things coul dbe very bad!

Hopefully he will do an examination this time around and perhaps arrange for a blood test to be done too, and if that shows nothing an Ultrasound perhaps but the final resort would be have it or them removed  I guess if things have to be done then it has to be done. Still wasn't sure whether to post this in the testicular section or this section. But that is the latest on things at the moment. oh and at times one other thing the pain doesn't seem really the testicle it seems like it is my in my leg or groin lynth or lymth node cancer :S :S or whatever it is if I have that then I will die I guess  Oh well I guess I will get myself some checks done soon and see as to how things go.

There is so much blood the water is red and afterwards.  When wiping there is often blood being wiped after the feces is gone.  At times I have pain in my bowels before moving them.  I know I am not constipated because I go a lot.  What could the cause be?   I tried to make an appointment with my PCP, but the office she works out of does not work very well.  I called to make an appointment was told a nurse would call me back.  No one called for some time, but when I got home there was a message from someone at her office telling me I have to make an appointment with my PCP.  I am confused isn't that why I called origanlly?  That place sucks.  Southborough Medical Group in Massachusetts if you wish to know.\n\n",

    "content": "I know this sounds like a silly question, do you know for sure it's blood? Food can cause your stools to be red or black - licorice, beets, iron, pepto-bismol, berries, tomatoes, etc.   Is it only on the toilet paper or in the water as well? Blood will start dissolving in the water causing the water to turn orange and than red. Is it every time you have a bowel movement? Do you have any other symptoms like stomach pains, vomiting, gas pains, diarrhea, constipation, fever, etc?  First, how dark is it? The darker the blood is, the higher up the bleed is and secondly, is there a foul-smelling odor to it?  Blood can be coming from anywhere along your digestive tract, from your mouth down to the anal opening such as in the form of hemmorhoids. Color will give you an idea - black tarry stool means it's coming from higher up in the gastrointestinal tract, maybe around the esophagus, stomach or small intestines and will look that way because it has been exposed to the digestive juices. Esophageal varices or tears from vomiting, gastritis, stomach ulcers or some type of upper GI bleed can cause this, all which can be bothered by ibuprofen, aspirin, and various other medications.  Maroon or darker red all the way to bright red colored blood stool may be coming from the lower part of the gastrointestinal tract around the large bowel or rectum. Hemorrhoids, fissures, intesinal infections, tumors, polyps, cancer, bowel ischemia, diverticulitis, or lower GI bleeds may cause this.  It sounds like you will need complete bloodwork done to check your blood levels, stool cultures and a complete check-up as soon as possible. You need to make it a priority to see a doctor, this easily could be life threatening!\n\n",

I have just had a look at it and it is black in colour (like trapping your thumb in hammer as suggested ion previous thread) but is getting a little bigger. It also appears that there is another area similar just to the side (approaching the top of anal hole) but this is not a lump, just discoloured a little.   I have read that it can be due to exercise? I have been doing more exercise over the past few weeks - sit ups and also buttock clenching - could this have caused it?  What should I do? Is there a cream I can get and what should I do if there is any blood leakage (none yet). How long will this last or how long before I should see my doctor?   Thanks for your help.\n\n",

Usually if a cancer ispresent causes the problems you experience over a period of time, then it would be detected.  Sometimes biopsies are done in an area of bleeding or problems to see if any cancer is present.  If no visualized lesion or problem is seen, then one does not always do such a biopsy since it can be \"blind\" and may not be too hlepful.  I would have another talk with you physician to review through the tests done to date.  If you are able to travel outside of your area, then you could consider a second opinion.  Scar tissue and hemmorrhoids can cause bleeding, not due to cancer, but due to irritation adn inflammation.  Have you been tried on steroid suppossitories to see if those may help you?\n\n",

I have been passing more stools recently which are narrower than usual, i put this down to the fact that i have increased the amount of fibre in my diet. Recently i have experienced diarreah after my main evening meal, and today i have been constipated and only able to produce pencil thin stools, i suffer from constipation about once a month, but generally only for a few days. I often produce such pencil thin stools when i am strerssed, but not on a consistent basis. I am really worried that i may have cancer, can someone please give some advice?\n\n",

    "content": "Thanks for posting your question here at The Lounge.  If you are experiencing any changes in your routine, baseline bowel habits, including but not limited to your stools becoming thinner than usual and mor difficult to pass due to constipation, then I would recommend that you see your physician for an evaluation.  Some tests that may be done could include a rectal examination,; testing of your stools for any blood; CAT Scan imaging of the abdomen and pelvis; and colonoscopy to take a look inside the bowel.  At you age of 20 years, you would be young to have a cancer of the colon.  Do you have any family history of cancer?  Even at your age, a thorough evaluation should be done.  Causes of your bowel problems other then a cancer should be investigated.  My best to you.\n\n",

It was swollen and painful to the touch, however if I squeezed it I could feel a tiny, pea-like lump right on the edge of my anal hole.

It's a constant pain, especially  when sitting or touching it. There is no blood and it's lasted for two days so far.

    "content": "Last night I was having slight discomfort when I was sitting down. A few hours later, it had reached the point where it was decently painful. I checked and I have a small (little larger than pea-sized) lump on my anus. I don't know what to think, I am not even quite 18 and I've never smoked or anything. Is it a hemmorhoid? I will admit that have had bad bowel habits for a while now. I rarely have them... probably once every 2 days, and I don't get much fiber. Is there are way to tell with decent accuracy if it is a hemmorhoid? I know that you can't accurately diagnose anything over the net, but I don't want to be worried about something that doesn't need to be worried about. I know that I have no reason to be, but I am kind of emberassed and don't want to mention it to anyone. I can't drive, or I would go to the doctor myself and have it checked out. If it doesn't get better soon, I will tell my father and go to the doctor. It's not worth leaving to chance. I think it is getting less painful... but I have never heard of anybody my age having anything like this. How long do hemmerhoids take to dissapear? And will it reoccur? Sorry for the incredibly long post, just trying to make sure I get everything. Any help would be greatly appreciated.\n\n",

    "content": "As you said, diagnosis over the net is impossible (and could be dangerous). As we state on this website, the information we provide is designed to support, not replace, the relationship between a patient and his physician.   The description of your problem is very suggestive of a condition known as thrombosed external haemorrhoid (also known as a perianal haematoma). This presents as a pea-sized (0.5-1.0cm), tense and painful lump just outside the anal verge which may resolve spontaneously within a week and become harmless skin tags. If it does not, you must see a rectal surgeon who has to make sure that it is not a thrombosed internal haemorrhoid which has prolapsed from higher up. You do not mention bleeding, and internal haemorrhoids are the commonest cause of rectal bleeding and are usually painless. If the diagnosis is a perianal haematoma and does not resolve spontaneously, the surgeon (or any experienced doctor) will perform a very simple procedure to squeeze out the contents of the lump \u2013 this gives immediate relief. You said you would go to the doctor if you could drive. Please ask your father to take you because that visit will be reassuring.  You must improve on your bowel habits. Constipation with prolonged straining predisposes to internal and external haemorrhoids (and more serious diseases on a long term).  High-fibre diet, adequate fluid intake and daily exercise are necessary for a healthy bowel habit.  Thank you for contacting our website. Please update us if a doctor examines you and makes a diagnosis.   Dr Anthony Solomon MB BS DTM&H DIP.VEN FRSM Consultant Physician, Tropical & Genitourinary Medicine\n\n",

When I apply pressure the protrusions comes up during passing stools. Occasionaly I have blood while passing stools - This I believe may be due to the cut in the anal opening as I am able to feel the blood from that cut portion with my hands.

    "content": "Hi everyone.  I've been experiencing a lot of discomfort around my anal hole. I seem to have two pieces of skin that can only be described as \"lumps\" or \"flaps\". One is larger than the other which doesn't seem to hurt and is softer to touch, but then the smaller one seems to be a little harder and very, very sore to touch. Trying to pass a stool has become very painful over the last week or two. I actualy noticed the larger piece of skin a long time ago but this other piece of skin seems to have appeared more recently.  I've also experienced bleeding from there for quite some time now. Not like a nose bleed where it would run into the toilet but I've noticed it on the toilet paper.   I haven't been well today in fact which is what got me thinking about this as I don't recall passing a stool today (which is kinda unusual for me) or maybe even yesterday. I've had a fever and have been experiencing lower back ache which is where I believe the bowels are located.  I really don't like the idea of going to the docs and having it examined. I've actually just been to the docs recently as I've had a bit of a scare with a lump I found on one of my testicles, which I'd like to discuss here actually, if there's a forum for it (I'll have a look now).  Anyway, I've gone on long enough. Thanks for your time\n\n",

    "content": "Sir/mam,    I've been having pain at the tip of coccyx bone for almost an year. It used to occur once in a month or whenever did I sit for a long while in an erect position. But past few months it has increased many folds so that now its quite unbearable everytime i get up or change position of sitting.    Last week i visited a lady surgeon. She says its coccydynia, next week she has asked me to come again. She will give me Inj. Kenacort (Triamcinolone acetonide) + Inj. Xylocaine at the site. She says that will get rid me of pain for about two years or so. Does this mean it has the possibility of reccurence?    Can u please tell me what could be the etiology, since i never had any fall or trauma at the site. Is it due to any stress or of any neurotic persoanlity? Please explain me, I am a medical student of final year. Please do help me in this regard. Thanks in advance. God bless you.\n\n",

Your question does not appear to be a cancer related one since the coccyx pain you report does not appear to be associated with a cancer.  Did the doctor who has examined and treated you raise the concern about cancer?  It seems that the steroid and analgesic treatment you received was for a non-cancer related problem.  Such bone/joint problems can be common and can occur elsewhere in the back.  I do not know much more about your problem since it is outside of my areas of expertise.  I would recommend talking with your doctor to learn more about the problem.\n\n",

    "title": "Anal problems",
    "content": "Since about 4 years ago, I've been having lower back pain which seem to be coming from between my testicles and my lower back.  These pains would usually occur from standing up for more than 30 minutes, after sexual intercourse, or during defecation.  This pain has been on going since, and after a motorcycle accident a year ago, in which I bruised my spleen and liver, the experienced has gotten worse.  About a couple months after the accident an incident occurred where I had severe pain for about four days, in the area between my testicles and lower back. Pain so severe I cried, could barely walk, and could not go to sleep without a heat pack on the area.  This pain was accompanied by constipation and oily yellow mucus from the anus.    When I went to the doctor for a follow-up on the accident, I told them about this incident, and they said it could be the vicodin, and that I would just need to increase my fiber and drink lots of water.  Since then, the occurrences have been far less severe.  I've had mild pains shooting up and down my spine, like an electrical current, occurring usually about once a month, lasting less than a second, in which it would cause me to stumble and grimace in pain.  The back and lower pelvic area pain rarely occurs now, but I am still usually constipated and have yellow, oily discharge from my anus three to four times out of the week.  This almost always happens when consuming alcohol, but also occurs regardless of consumption.  I went to a doctor address these problems and symptoms, but he merely treated it as a lower back pain.  I'm eager to get a second opinion, but I feel that the doctors are ignoring my symptoms and me as a concerned patient.  I am only 22, and I'm worried with what it could be.  Can someone give me advice?\n\n",

I don't know what tests your physician did to evaluate your problem.  if you are concerned about what you are experiencing, then I would recommend talking further with your doctor.  if you fell comfortable seeing a specialist (such as a Gastroenterologist), then talk with your doctor about doing so.  It is difficiult to diagnose any specific problem over the Internet and I would not do so without having the benefit of a direct evaluation in person.  Nevertheless, most of the problems that you describe are not related to any cancer.\n\n",

The pain could be from the lower bones of the spine (called the coccyx), the bones of the pelvis, the rectum, the anus or the prostate.  Hemrrhoids can also cause pain.  I would recommend that you see your family doctor for an examination.  A direct look at the area could provide important clues.  A rectal examination is also done to palpate for any problems.  A stool sample can be collected to check for any blood.  Sometimes x-rays are done to look at the bones.  If the pain persists, then it should be checked out.\n\n",

A panel of blood tests can be performed, including checking the level of iron in your blood (if there has been any blood loss in your bowels, then you may have low iron levels since iron is a major component of blood.   Based upon the results, I would consider obtaining CAT scan pictures of the abdomen and pelvis.
